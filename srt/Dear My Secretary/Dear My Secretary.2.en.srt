<i>[Dear My Secretary]</i>

4
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,766
<i>How do you feel about being named one of Asia's top 5 hottest CEOs?
[Previously]</i>

5
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:11,194
<i>I've always been hot, so I wouldn't know how I'm supposed to feel.</i>

6
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:13,660
<i>This is just so… Radiant!</i>

7
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,817
<i>I'd like to inform you, Boss. I'm resigning.</i>

8
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:17,802
<i>I'm resigning.</i>

9
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:20,129
<i>So, why do you want to leave?</i>

10
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:22,161
<i>I want to be Primala, not just "Secretary Prim"</i>

11
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:25,374
<i>whose entire life revolves around work and you every day.</i>

12
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:26,534
<i>So full of yourself!</i>

13
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:27,620
<i>So picky!</i>

14
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,830
<i>You think you're Mr. Perfect or something?</i>

15
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,014
<i>I want to make it up to you.</i>

16
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:33,008
<i>Whatever you want me to do, tell me.</i>

17
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:34,216
<i>You said it yourself.</i>

18
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:36,529
<i>I saw she was upset when I gave flowers to Jinny.</i>

19
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,444
<i>That means she likes me.</i>

20
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:41,575
<i>- Does that mean we got the house back?
- Yes.</i>

21
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:45,420
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

22
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:08,367
- Peekaboo!
- Peekaboo!

23
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,033
I really shouldn't have given you the spare keycard. You two are at it again.

24
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:16,279
And now what? Leaving your child with me again?

25
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:21,066
Please, just for one day.

26
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:25,466
I have an urgent flight to cover. Her dad's not around either. Please?

27
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:27,366
Today, I have to find a new secretary for my boss.

28
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:30,421
How will I have time to look after Ploen?

29
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:33,598
Mom's busy. Grandpa's not here.

30
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,509
Auntie Prim doesn't love me. Am I a bad kid?

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,716
Why would you say that?

32
00:02:43,716 --> 00:02:47,574
No one wants to be with me.

33
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:49,613
That's not true at all.

34
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:53,438
Okay, Auntie Prim will stay with you.

35
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:57,117
Thank you, Prim.

36
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,066
<i>[Boss Wee-Woo]</i>

37
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:11,466
Auntie Prim, Boss Wee-Woo is calling.

38
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:15,596
Yes, Boss.

39
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:22,700
You don't have to worry, Ms. Prim. I'll take care of little Ploen.

40
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,180
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

41
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,366
Ploen, Auntie Prim will come to pick you up at noon, okay? You'll be all right here.

42
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,233
Easy peasy!

43
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,226
My niece can be a bit of a handful.

44
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:42,405
That's normal for children this age. It shouldn't be a problem.

45
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:45,500
That's true, but don't say I didn't warn you.

46
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,243
Got it.

47
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:04,708
Are the contestants for the new secretary position ready?

48
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:12,033
Sorry, I'm late.

49
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,066
But why did you decide to move the interviews here?

50
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:17,766
Well, my new secretary should be able to

51
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:21,333
do everything the way my current one does.

52
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:30,066
Round One, all contestants must run 50 meters in high heels.

53
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:33,400
The first two to reach the finish line will move on to the next round.

54
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,500
Ready?

55
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,233
Wait! Wait!

56
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,800
There's one more applicant for the secretary position!

57
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,366
Here she is, Boss.

58
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:51,566
Manchuporn Thakingsak.

59
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,936
Sounds familiar, Secretary Prim?

60
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,666
Wait. Is that a photo of you, Bhum?!

61
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,033
I might've used a heavy filter,

62
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:10,633
so you and Boss didn't recognize me. Right?

63
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,784
It's me, Bhum.

64
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:16,400
You're applying for the secretary job?

65
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,103
Why not?

66
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:23,300
I give everyone an equal opportunity.

67
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:29,266
Thank you, Boss! I'll do my best to be your secretary!

68
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,968
- Not yet!
- Not yet!

69
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:32,933
Sorry!

70
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,400
Please take your position.

71
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,006
Yes, sir!

72
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:42,179
Ready?

73
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:44,468
Set.

74
00:06:10,414 --> 00:06:13,000
So does that mean Bhum lost?

75
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:18,120
So, if Long-Haired Girl comes in first

76
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,060
and Short-Haired Girl comes in second,

77
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:22,261
then Bhum is eliminated.

78
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:24,778
Hold on!

79
00:06:24,778 --> 00:06:26,532
Look at this first!

80
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:34,819
What should we do, Boss?

81
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,133
Since they crossed the finish line at the same time.

82
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,600
All right then, let all three advance.

83
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,566
Congrats to the sec, I mean, to Ms. Bhum!

84
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:51,300
All three contestants, please proceed to the next challenge!

85
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:56,266
Hold on, Boss.

86
00:06:57,433 --> 00:07:02,166
Are you playing around with the contestants or with me?

87
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,533
Why would I do that?

88
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:08,733
Finding a new secretary is a grave matter for me.

89
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,900
Ploen! Ploen, stop that!

90
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,400
Stop! Ploen, we don't play like that.

91
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,433
Ploen, stop it!

92
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:28,600
You're going to trip!

93
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,700
Ploen, stop it!

94
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,966
Ploen!

95
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:36,066
Round Two, whoever creates a break-time menu that impresses the boss

96
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:37,566
will advance to the next round.

97
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:40,550
You only have one minute.

98
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,033
Taco.

99
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,866
- What?
- Taco.

100
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:04,060
Oh, okay.

101
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,810
Taco.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,700
Mango.

103
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:23,672
No helping!

104
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,666
You decide, Secretary Prim.

105
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:48,648
Yes, Boss.

106
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,033
For the first dish, it's a cake or some kind of baked dessert.

107
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:58,166
This dish is high in flour and sugar, and loaded with trans fats.

108
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,056
Boss doesn't like that. This dish does not pass.

109
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:05,900
Next, we have mango sticky rice.

110
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,566
Although high in calories,

111
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:10,666
it's still better than donuts or hamburgers.

112
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,600
Plus, it includes fruit

113
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
and the boss happens to like it.

114
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,401
This dish passes.

115
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:22,433
For the last dish, we've got oatmeal cookies,

116
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:25,187
tacos with vegetables, and a fruit tea.

117
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:28,887
Perfect for a health-conscious one, like him. This dish passes as well.

118
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:30,820
The two who passed to the next round are

119
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,430
Ms. Manchuporn and Ms. Ratchanok!

120
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,779
Hello, teacher?

121
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:47,846
What? Okay, I'll head over right away.

122
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:50,394
Excuse me, I need to check on my niece.

123
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:01,566
Oh no, why is your face such a mess?

124
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:04,319
What happened?

125
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:11,733
I'm so sorry, Ms. Prim, for asking you to pick her up early.

126
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:14,213
I really couldn't handle it anymore.

127
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,419
Don't tell me this was her doing…

128
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:20,333
Completely.

129
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:22,833
I'm so sorry.

130
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,266
Should we go wash your face?

131
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:27,133
It's okay. I'm planning to go to the hospital anyway.

132
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:29,933
Excuse me, then.

133
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:36,787
Ploen, don't act like this again. Okay?

134
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:40,558
If you behave like this when you grow up, no one will love you. Do you understand?

135
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,658
Look! It's Boss Wee-Woo!

136
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:48,066
That's my boss!

137
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:51,666
Boss, please don't listen to what she just said.

138
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,600
Boss Wee-Woo? Why does your niece call me that?

139
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,533
Because Auntie Prim said—

140
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:01,133
Shouldn't we be focusing on selecting your new secretary?

141
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:06,533
Why did you come here anyway?

142
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,370
Well, I'm looking for someone who can be an exact clone

143
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,200
of my former secretary.

144
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,333
<i>I built this swimming pool so my staff could exercise.</i>

145
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,619
<i>I suggest adding a volleyball and basketball court</i>

146
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:24,966
<i>so my staff can stay healthy and have more energy to work.</i>

147
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,566
<i>What on earth are you doing?</i>

148
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:39,733
<i>I accidentally dropped them.</i>

149
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,973
<i>I couldn't just leave these essential contract documents.</i>

150
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,400
That was so long ago. He still remembers?

151
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,066
When it comes to you, I remember everything.

152
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:04,299
Contestants, get ready!

153
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,033
In the next round,

154
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:15,833
whoever collects all of their colored folders first wins!

155
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,752
Let me warn you.

156
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:22,133
I'm basically a mermaid of the swimming world.

157
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,782
I win the coin toss game at Loy Krathong every year,

158
00:12:24,782 --> 00:12:26,673
so you'd better back down.

159
00:12:26,673 --> 00:12:28,953
You're starting without waiting?!

160
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,533
Where's Ploen?

161
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Auntie Prim!

162
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:58,400
Ploen! Be careful!

163
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,979
Auntie Prim! Take a picture of me!

164
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:03,758
- Ploen!
- Ploen!

165
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:15,280
- Ploen!
- Ploen!

166
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,700
Ploen!

167
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,150
- Ploen!
- Ploen!

168
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,600
Ploen!

169
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:31,354
Are you okay?

170
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:38,803
Ploen, you weren't on your best behavior today.

171
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:43,073
Doing things like that is dangerous. For you and for others, too.

172
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,066
I'm so sorry for all the trouble.

173
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,500
Ploen, what do we say?

174
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,900
I'm sorry for being naughty.

175
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:59,166
In that case, I'd better take her home.

176
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,675
Keeping her here is not a good idea.

177
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,433
Let her stay.

178
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,733
She probably won't be naughty anymore.

179
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,650
Besides, who will help me interview

180
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,630
my new secretary if you leave?

181
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:14,346
Congratulations. The winner is…

182
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,236
Ms. Ratchanok.

183
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:24,066
The one who will be my new secretary must be forward-looking

184
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:27,433
and not leave others behind.

185
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,366
Thank you so much.

186
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,470
<i>[Thiranon Group]</i>

187
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,100
This is the final round, Ms. Ratchanok.

188
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:47,033
Here are the interview questions.

189
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:57,599
How will you live your life with me, as Secretary Mind or Miss Ratchanok?

190
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:05,166
I'll be both. Mind and Ratchanok are both a part of who I am.

191
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,100
Your turn to ask, Secretary Prim.

192
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,544
Yes, Boss.

193
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:13,495
What do you think makes a good secretary?

194
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,100
A good secretary should protect and care for their valuables.

195
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,966
And for a secretary, the most valuable thing is him.

196
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,600
How would you feel about working for a boss who's perfect in every single way?

197
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,500
It'd be quite the challenge!

198
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:33,100
Do you think

199
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,500
you could ever fully satisfy such a perfectly perfect boss?

200
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:43,466
- Does such a person even exist?
- Yes. He does.

201
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:50,400
It might be a bit hard, but I'll do my best.

202
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,866
Would you be responsible enough

203
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:56,000
not to quit your job just because you want to have a boyfriend?

204
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,266
- Wait. People do that?
- Yes! They do!

205
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:06,100
I would never quit for that reason.

206
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:13,000
Are you okay with skipping lunch and staying up all night?

207
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,998
Then I'll nap at lunch and eat at night!

208
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:18,433
You might have to eat late,

209
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:21,700
but no one will pay the compensation that much, like I will.

210
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,500
Great!

211
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,666
But with that money, you'll end up without a life of your own.

212
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:29,033
Isn't the time you dedicate to your work part of your life, too?

213
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:32,733
If you hire me, I'll give it my all.

214
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:36,533
But everyone has a limit to their endurance.

215
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,266
I'll try my best.

216
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:41,066
Those who truly dedicate themselves can make it.

217
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,033
But your friends might start disappearing one by one.

218
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,999
In the end, all you'll have left is a goldfish.

219
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:47,420
That's totally fine. I can be alone.

220
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,360
And I don't even need a goldfish.

221
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,633
But overworking might lead to headaches, fevers, no rest,

222
00:16:55,633 --> 00:17:00,000
weight loss, insomnia, digestive problems, loss of taste, acid reflux,

223
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,710
brittle bones, toothaches, intestinal pain, bad breath, constant nausea,

224
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,100
dizziness, bruising, scalp dandruff, constipation,

225
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,033
scabby knees and elbows,

226
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:14,500
itchy rashes, bleeding gums, and high blood pressure…

227
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,466
Is it really that bad?

228
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:19,732
That's a bit much!

229
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,300
I only said "might".

230
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:27,190
It's okay.

231
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:32,102
I'll take care of myself and make sure I'm worth every cent.

232
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:35,100
I'll even buy a koi fish to keep me company!

233
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,900
Goldfish.

234
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,100
Right. Goldfish.

235
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,000
Okay. You're hired!

236
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,233
Really? Thank you so much! I'm ready to start right away!

237
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,900
Secretary Prim, please inform HR

238
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,166
to prepare the hiring contract for an Assistant Secretary.

239
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,866
Wait. An Assistant Secretary?

240
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:24,733
What's going on with you, Secretary Prim?

241
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:26,833
I'm not joking, Boss.

242
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,040
Now you suddenly change it.

243
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,760
How can you make her the assistant?

244
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,665
Why not?

245
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:36,179
Mind doesn't have any experience.

246
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,000
How could she be a full secretary right away?

247
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,229
And besides, I remember exactly what you said.

248
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:43,610
What did I say?

249
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,500
You wanted to make it up to me, remember?

250
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:50,700
Unless you're taking it back.

251
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,733
Because if not, I'm asking you to repay me now.

252
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,200
You will compensate for that ridiculous video

253
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,900
by training your assistant secretary to pass her probation.

254
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,000
Only then will she become a full secretary,

255
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,866
and only then will I allow you to resign.

256
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:07,100
Until she passes probation?

257
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,366
- Three months.
- Three months?

258
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:12,559
Yes. Three months.

259
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,100
Okay. Deal.

260
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,200
But the moment Mind passes her probation, I'm quitting.

261
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:28,912
So that's how it all turned out, everyone.

262
00:19:28,912 --> 00:19:30,833
So annoying.

263
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,933
Come on, three months will fly by.

264
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:46,900
Yeah! At least you get to hang out and goof off with us for a while.

265
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,466
Exactly! And anyway, that new secretary seems clueless.

266
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:55,133
I've no idea if she'll even pass probation.

267
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:59,466
Wait! So if Mind doesn't pass probation,

268
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,699
I have to stay on as secretary?

269
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:08,333
See? This girl talks without thinking.

270
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,266
Slap that mouth!

271
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:12,466
Slap her! Not me!

272
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:15,086
- Sorry, sorry!
- Slap her!

273
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,373
What?

274
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:29,070
What is it, Prim?

275
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,926
Where did my mischievous niece run off to this time?

276
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,226
Prim!

277
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:54,566
Go, go, go!

278
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:29,300
Stop!

279
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,633
Whoa! Fah, Fah!

280
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:32,900
Have you seen my niece?

281
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,966
Your niece?

282
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:40,733
The tiny, super cute one who looks really mischievous?

283
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:44,675
I saw her a minute ago, right outside Boss's office.

284
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:58,887
Let's go!

285
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:01,000
Boss! What are you doing?!

286
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,533
We're sweeping the sky! Right, Ploen?

287
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:05,234
That's right!

288
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,000
Sweeping the sky?

289
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,800
Ploen said she wants to be a sky sweeper when she grows up.

290
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,205
Why is that, Ploen?

291
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,533
Because there's too much dust!

292
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,933
Too much dust, huh?

293
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,133
In that case, we have to sweep it clean

294
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:20,433
so that everyone can come out and run all over and fill the sky! Does that sound good?

295
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:22,133
Yes…

296
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,266
Then, where should we sweep next?

297
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,133
Let's fly over there and sweep!

298
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:29,600
Let's go. Go! Keep sweeping!

299
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,135
Oh my god…

300
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:38,620
He's handsome, rich, and loves kids.

301
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,530
Oh my god…

302
00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:45,959
He is so warm and gentle,

303
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:49,666
and perfect to be my husband.

304
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,133
My husband, too!

305
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:55,066
Not sharing!

306
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,233
And that's the end of our first song for tonight.

307
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,933
Let's go straight into the final performance!

308
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:51,966
Let's hear some applause and support from all our friends here!

309
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,733
Ploen! Dad! That's enough playing around. Come eat!

310
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:13,825
We were having fun. We had such a big crowd, too!

311
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:17,366
"Phot the Hellfire Guitarist" will call it a night.

312
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:22,013
See you again next lifetime, folks! Bye-bye!

313
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,326
Just getting into it.

314
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,833
We're going to be stuffed tonight!

315
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,100
This made-to-order food stall has a crazy long line.

316
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,926
- Because it's tasty?
- Nope. Just slow.

317
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:48,333
Prim, how many times have I told you? You have worked so hard already,

318
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,438
and you still insist on getting food for us, too.

319
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:52,000
I told you it was not necessary.

320
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,766
I was worried Dad wouldn't have anything to eat.

321
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:57,572
- You're so sweet.
- Please! Dad can survive on just alcohol.

322
00:24:57,572 --> 00:25:01,049
In fact, I would bring some rubbing alcohol from the hospital for him to try!

323
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:03,191
That's a good idea! My intestines will be squeaky clean.

324
00:25:03,191 --> 00:25:04,791
Wait, are you nuts?

325
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:09,127
Stop joking like that. I'm being serious!

326
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:12,244
Come on, don't be so serious.

327
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,666
And don't worry about me either. I'm quitting.

328
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:15,766
- You're quitting?
- You're quitting?

329
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:16,866
Yes.

330
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:20,433
What does "quitting" mean, Auntie Prim?

331
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:23,533
It means I won't be working anymore, sweetie.

332
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:25,666
But Boss wants me to train the new secretary right now.

333
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,466
Once she's good enough, he'll let me quit.

334
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:30,900
It shouldn't take more than three months. Then I'll finally be free.

335
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:36,600
We don't have anything sour, let me go whip up a spicy salad!

336
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:56,200
Her job's going well,

337
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,833
her boss trusts her completely.

338
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:01,266
So why is she suddenly quitting?

339
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:03,800
How would I know, Dad?

340
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,549
Maybe he relies on her too much. She can't take it anymore.

341
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:08,060
Maybe she's stressed about things at home.

342
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,124
Don't forget, she has us to worry about, too.

343
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Is she crying?

344
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:23,310
She must be seriously conflicted about quitting.

345
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,733
Well then, what do we do?

346
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,033
Dad! You should go comfort her.

347
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:30,000
Comfort her? Rockers don't comfort people.

348
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,266
You are Rocker, but you're still her dad.

349
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:34,466
Go!

350
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:37,466
- But I…
- Go!

351
00:26:37,466 --> 00:26:38,946
Go!

352
00:26:44,857 --> 00:26:46,257
Prim.

353
00:26:47,593 --> 00:26:50,959
Is something bothering you, sweetheart?

354
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:59,525
If life ever gets too hard, too heavy,

355
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:01,933
if it ever brings you to tears,

356
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:05,266
just remember this. You've got your dad,

357
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:07,133
your sisters, and your little niece.

358
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:09,545
We'll always be here for you, no matter what.

359
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:13,100
Dad, why the drama?

360
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,433
I'm not crying.

361
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:20,379
It's the onions. I'm chopping them for the spicy salad. They sting my eyes.

362
00:27:26,965 --> 00:27:28,200
<i>[Loving my work. Can't wait to finish up and go travel!]</i>

363
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,540
<i>[Don't forget to wear your lucky color!]</i>

364
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,600
<i>[Deadline is tonight. Pink is the color!]</i>

365
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,006
<i>My kind prince…</i>

366
00:27:55,006 --> 00:28:00,243
<i>I love the "buhnga" snack you gave me the most.</i>

367
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:03,366
<i>But my parents don't like buying it for me.</i>

368
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:06,238
<i>They say if I overeat, I'll get cavities.</i>

369
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:09,066
<i>So I brush my teeth longer than usual.</i>

370
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:12,366
<i>If I don't get cavities, I'll get to eat it again!</i>

371
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:17,966
<i>I miss you so much, my prince. When will I get to see you again?</i>

372
00:28:19,225 --> 00:28:21,025
Yeah…

373
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,900
When will I get to see you again, my prince?

374
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,733
You really are something, right?

375
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:32,900
So sneaky.

376
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,833
Instead of just letting her resign peacefully,

377
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:40,800
you're forcing her to stay another three months.

378
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,320
Yeah, that gives me three months to treat her so well

379
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,830
that she won't want to resign.

380
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,700
Hey, let me ask you something.

381
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,133
If someone calls you "Wee-Woo," what does that mean?

382
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,031
"Wee-Woo"?

383
00:28:57,031 --> 00:28:59,968
How would I know? Why?

384
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:01,547
Never mind.

385
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:05,368
Time to move on to the next phase of my plan.

386
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,770
What now?

387
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,940
What are you scheming again?

388
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:21,132
<i>From now on, you don't need to deliver flowers to anyone anymore.</i>

389
00:29:21,132 --> 00:29:24,900
What does that mean? What's he even talking about?

390
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,566
<i>Prim, I have something urgent that I need to talk to you about.</i>

391
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:30,033
<i>I'll send someone to pick you up.</i>

392
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:46,200
Prim, Thi just broke up with me…

393
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:50,166
Wait, wait a second.

394
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:54,933
So you brought me here because of the breakup with Boss?

395
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:58,833
Thi said we were never in a relationship

396
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,900
and we never will be.

397
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,333
He said he didn't want to be part of any gossip.

398
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:06,398
So there won't be any private meetings,

399
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:09,433
dinners, or one-on-one time anymore.

400
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:15,066
He said he just wants us to be strictly coworkers.

401
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:18,000
What should I do now?

402
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,520
Just find someone new. It's easier.

403
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,180
Really?

404
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,489
Yes.

405
00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:30,100
Love someone who loves you. That's better.

406
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:34,233
That's true.

407
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,820
I feel so much better now after talking to you, Prim!

408
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,566
- Joom?
- Yes?

409
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:45,485
- The director's done shooting for the day.
- Yes.

410
00:30:45,485 --> 00:30:47,865
- Let's go home then.
- Yes.

411
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,726
Great. Drag me out here and don't even offer to take me back.

412
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:06,400
- Hello!
- Hey there.

413
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,332
Please take care of me. I'm really looking forward to learning from all of you.

414
00:31:10,332 --> 00:31:11,990
Honestly, I feel really relieved that

415
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,100
Prim is still here to help guide and train me.

416
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,700
Since I'm so new, I still need to learn a lot.

417
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:23,720
Mind's joining us, and Prim's still here, too.

418
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,800
Sounds like we need to celebrate!

419
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,700
Celebrate! Yes, celebrate!

420
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,820
Then let me treat you all, please!

421
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,466
Love it! Mind, let's celebrate!

422
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:35,633
No, no! Stop right there. They aren't children to be minded.

423
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:37,466
Let the great-grandma here pay, right?

424
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:40,600
Excuse me? Cut it out! Calling me a great-grandma now?

425
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,666
And asking me to treat, too?

426
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:46,400
Nope. I've got doctor's fees and health supplements to take care of.

427
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,433
Bhum, do you have to see a doctor already?

428
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:51,300
A face-lift doctor, sweetie.

429
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,533
See how tight her face is?

430
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:54,766
They pulled it up from her butt to her face,

431
00:31:54,766 --> 00:31:57,600
then back down to her butt again!

432
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,966
Watch it! Don't get too close, honey. It stinks!

433
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:12,133
But if it's him,

434
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:17,866
I swear, I'd be willing to care for him for life.

435
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,633
- Hi, Kawee-wee-wee! Hello there!
- Hello, everyone.

436
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:38,746
Perfect timing, Goody.

437
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:43,133
Here's the logo file you asked me to design.

438
00:32:44,093 --> 00:32:49,533
- Thank you so much, Kawee!
- Easy there.

439
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:53,066
You're always helping me out. So sweet of you. Thanks again!

440
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:56,711
You're welcome.

441
00:33:00,335 --> 00:33:01,966
- Bhum?
- Yes?

442
00:33:01,966 --> 00:33:03,633
You've got something on your lips, just a little bit.

443
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:05,878
Oh, I didn't even notice.

444
00:33:09,723 --> 00:33:11,423
Excuse me for a moment.

445
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:18,366
Does anyone else smell something weird?

446
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:22,933
Like a sour smell? Like damp laundry that didn't dry properly?

447
00:33:26,312 --> 00:33:28,146
I should get going now.

448
00:33:33,566 --> 00:33:38,200
- Wait! Sour smell, damp clothes… seriously?

449
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,550
Yeah!

450
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,400
All I could smell was that fine, young man!

451
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:48,631
You have to remember the names of all the clients from each brand.

452
00:33:48,631 --> 00:33:49,900
Please don't mix them up.

453
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,966
Also, remember what items or food they like or dislike,

454
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:54,733
so you don't send or order the wrong things.

455
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,766
Same goes for Boss.

456
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:59,933
When he's upset or stressed, make him pandan tea.

457
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:02,245
It helps him relax.

458
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,366
During the day, he'll usually say he's not hungry,

459
00:34:05,366 --> 00:34:07,633
but we need to prepare Greek salad for him in advance.

460
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:11,236
- Because the truth is, he is hungry.
- Got it.

461
00:34:11,236 --> 00:34:13,833
Most importantly,

462
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:18,033
cable ties should never be left in Boss's office. Absolutely never.

463
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:19,766
Why not?

464
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:23,900
If Boss doesn't like something, we don't question it. Just follow it.

465
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,464
Understood.

466
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:32,779
Prim, have you already packed everything?

467
00:34:36,253 --> 00:34:38,373
This photo, how long ago was it taken?

468
00:34:38,373 --> 00:34:41,233
You look so young in it!

469
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:44,933
So you're saying I look old now?

470
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:46,572
No!

471
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:49,792
When you're a secretary, you must always think before speaking.

472
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:53,733
Make sure your words can't be misinterpreted beyond your intentions.

473
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:55,739
Yes.

474
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,039
Okay, your first task.

475
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,532
Take this contract and get it copied on the big copier.

476
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:03,046
Photocopy these contracts, double-sided, to save paper. Then bind them.

477
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:04,946
Got it.

478
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,233
<i>Why are you so incompetent, Secretary Prim?</i>

479
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:21,933
<i>This was an important meeting with a client,</i>

480
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:24,900
<i>and I missed it because of you!</i>

481
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,833
<i>I've already told you to learn those business terms properly.</i>

482
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:31,200
<i>And today, you used them wrong, wrote them wrong,</i>

483
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,333
<i>and it caused issues!</i>

484
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:37,500
<i>If you can't even handle this, how are you going to be my secretary?!</i>

485
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:40,266
<i>I'm sorry, sir…</i>

486
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:43,820
<i>- I…
- Don't give me excuses.</i>

487
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,553
<i>Miss Primala,</i>

488
00:35:45,553 --> 00:35:49,599
<i>do you remember what you said when you first became my secretary?</i>

489
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,033
<i>You told me you would do your very best.</i>

490
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:54,633
<i>Is this your best?</i>

491
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:57,933
<i>I really tried! I haven't even had time to sleep</i>

492
00:35:57,933 --> 00:35:59,666
<i>since I started this job.</i>

493
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:02,133
<i>I've been working nonstop, memorizing business terms,</i>

494
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:05,500
<i>practicing as much as I can to learn fast…</i>

495
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,488
<i>But people make mistakes sometimes, don't they?!</i>

496
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:11,000
<i>No! I am flawless! I never make mistakes.</i>

497
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,266
<i>And if you're my secretary, then you shouldn't make any either!</i>

498
00:36:16,152 --> 00:36:17,852
<i>So full of yourself…</i>

499
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:20,493
<i>What did you just say?!</i>

500
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,066
<i>I asked you, what did you say? Repeat it!</i>

501
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:28,295
<i>Say it! I told you to speak!</i>

502
00:36:28,295 --> 00:36:29,804
<i>You're full of yourself!</i>

503
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:31,766
<i>It bothers me that you don't care about anyone else's feelings.</i>

504
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:34,418
<i>You never listen. You have no empathy.</i>

505
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:36,600
<i>You're cold and heartless!</i>

506
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,132
<i>I quit!</i>

507
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,010
<i>Hey!</i>

508
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,950
<i>How dare you speak to your boss like that, calling him heartless?</i>

509
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,318
<i>And then have the nerve to quit like it's no big deal?</i>

510
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:57,466
<i>I didn't really think. I wasn't in my right mind…</i>

511
00:36:58,697 --> 00:37:00,700
<i>So what now, Prim?</i>

512
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,260
<i>Are you really quitting?</i>

513
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,793
<i>I don't want to. But if I do,</i>

514
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:07,794
<i>how can I pay for the house loans?</i>

515
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:11,381
<i>I still need to cover Proud's tuition fees.</i>

516
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:12,566
<i>Prim!</i>

517
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:16,758
<i>Stop worrying about everyone else and start worrying about yourself!</i>

518
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:32,100
<i>What's wrong? Who's calling? Why don't you answer?</i>

519
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,533
<i>It's my boss!</i>

520
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:37,133
<i>Then why did you set the ringtone to a siren sound?</i>

521
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:41,500
<i>Because what could be more urgent or important than his work?</i>

522
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,000
<i>He's probably calling to scold me again.</i>

523
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,666
<i>Then why aren't you answering?</i>

524
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,200
<i>That sound is annoying!</i>

525
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,566
<i>Dad, no!</i>

526
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:52,733
<i>Hello? Who's this?</i>

527
00:37:55,026 --> 00:37:57,159
<i>It's your boss calling!</i>

528
00:37:59,637 --> 00:38:02,233
<i>No, I'm her father.</i>

529
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:03,433
<i>Yes, sir. Yes.</i>

530
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:05,566
<i>Prim. Where's Prim?</i>

531
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:07,033
<i>She's not here.</i>

532
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:10,200
<i>She went to the bathroom.</i>

533
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:14,600
<i>Is there something urgent?</i>

534
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:23,366
<i>Yes, I understand. Got it.</i>

535
00:38:23,366 --> 00:38:26,860
<i>Yes, sir. Okay.</i>

536
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:33,500
<i>Am I fired, Dad?</i>

537
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,426
<i>He said you still need to come to work tomorrow.</i>

538
00:38:37,426 --> 00:38:39,186
<i>Don't be late.</i>

539
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:40,800
<i>That's all.</i>

540
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:50,393
<i>Boss.</i>

541
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,300
<i>I'm sorry about yesterday.</i>

542
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,166
<i>Bring me the schedule to check,</i>

543
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:01,533
<i>and come with me to the meeting.</i>

544
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,576
<i>Yes, Boss.</i>

545
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:07,539
<i>Just a moment, Boss.</i>

546
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:09,406
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

547
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:23,499
<i>A boss isn't just someone who gives orders.</i>

548
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:28,238
<i>They want their team to grow and get better, too.</i>

549
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:32,921
<i>I'm that kind of boss,</i>

550
00:39:33,687 --> 00:39:36,680
<i>not some heartless villain.</i>

551
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:43,066
<i>Yes, Boss. I understand.</i>

552
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:54,823
Why are you smiling?

553
00:39:54,823 --> 00:39:57,066
Nothing.

554
00:39:57,066 --> 00:40:01,566
Well, Goody has picked an excellent place for our dinner celebration tonight.

555
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,000
I'll send you the location. Okay…

556
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,461
Wait, should we invite Boss, too?

557
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:09,600
No way.

558
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,033
He wouldn't stoop to eating at a place like that with us.

559
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:18,505
And besides, if he comes, it won't be fun.

560
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:21,684
Okay, see you there!

561
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,866
Going out for dinner and it won't be fun?

562
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:31,133
It'll be fun for sure.

563
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,500
I doubt you'll last three months

564
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,900
if you're already this confused, just making copies.

565
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,000
It's just that I…

566
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,100
Let's see…

567
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:25,500
Prim told you to make double-sided copies and bind them, right?

568
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,671
Yes!

569
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:30,066
You figured it out just by glancing at it?

570
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:32,300
That's amazing!

571
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,700
Of course! Let me tell you something.

572
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,266
When I was born, I didn't cry "wah-wah,"

573
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:46,066
I came out screaming, "Genius! Genius, Daddy!" Just like that!

574
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:52,633
All right, watch and learn. Pay attention and do it just like this!

575
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:54,239
Okay.

576
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,200
Wow! That's amazing!

577
00:42:02,885 --> 00:42:05,133
I need two sets.

578
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:08,066
Could you do one more copy for me?

579
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:11,033
I need to pop into the restroom quickly. I'll be right back to pick them up.

580
00:42:11,033 --> 00:42:14,800
Sure! Go take your time and chill.

581
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,233
Oh, thank you so much!

582
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,200
Of course!

583
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:23,000
When you're this talented, everyone naturally looks up to you.

584
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,766
One more set, right?

585
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:30,075
Wait a second…

586
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:32,733
Is the newbie tricking me into doing her work?

587
00:42:35,403 --> 00:42:38,500
No way, come on.

588
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,566
Who would dare take advantage of a genius like me?

589
00:42:41,566 --> 00:42:46,253
I'm just overthinking again…

590
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,230
<i>[Poh Tha Tian]</i>

591
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,300
Congrats, Mind, for joining us as a new member!

592
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,989
And congrats to you, too, Prim, for still being here with us.

593
00:42:59,863 --> 00:43:02,233
Hey, look at this!

594
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:03,600
<i>[Spicy Pork Bone Soup]</i>

595
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,600
Just seeing it makes my mouth pucker all the way down to my intestines!

596
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,645
What are we waiting for?

597
00:43:08,645 --> 00:43:10,839
- Dig in!
- Let's go!

598
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:20,476
Girl, the meat falls right off the bone.

599
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:23,166
It's so tender!

600
00:43:40,503 --> 00:43:42,103
What?

601
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:45,411
Why are you tapping me nonstop?! I'm enjoying my food.

602
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:47,131
What?

603
00:43:51,966 --> 00:43:55,166
Boss! You came, too?

604
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:58,500
Well, you're all here celebrating. How could you leave me out?

605
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,800
We're a team, aren't we?

606
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:07,544
Having some spicy pork bone soup, are you, Secretary Prim?

607
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:09,449
Looks delicious.

608
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:17,280
Spicy beef salad, spicy minced meat,

609
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,360
pork bone soup, papaya salad, spicy liver,

610
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:20,700
everything looks amazing.

611
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:26,033
If you overeat, you might get bloated or develop kidney issues.

612
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:30,066
Exactly! That's why these aren't suitable for you, Boss.

613
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:33,984
Would you like to have it delivered to your house instead?

614
00:44:36,205 --> 00:44:39,033
No need. I'll just have a little bit.

615
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,200
Sis…

616
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,094
I've never seen Boss this chill before.

617
00:45:08,094 --> 00:45:09,834
But look at him…

618
00:45:09,834 --> 00:45:14,133
Who eats spicy pork bone soup and still looks hot?

619
00:45:19,537 --> 00:45:21,266
So sexy…

620
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:26,100
Handsome. Steamy. Love it.

621
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,000
This is so good.

622
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,566
This place deserves a Michelin star!

623
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,962
Michelin!

624
00:45:33,962 --> 00:45:37,233
Are you full now, Boss? It may be time to go home.

625
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:41,600
I'm just worried it's past your bedtime…

626
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,133
It's fine. Once in a while.

627
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:45,933
Let's have fun, everyone.

628
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:54,206
- Yes!
- Yes!

629
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:58,233
Perfect. Let's head to the next spot.

630
00:45:59,393 --> 00:46:02,926
Oh girl… another place?

631
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:06,640
I don't know if it's going to be fun or just shady.

632
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,633
<i>♪ Acting wild, but I'm real inside ♪</i>

633
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:25,666
<i>♪ Better than being fake with a sweet smile to hide ♪</i>

634
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:29,433

635
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:36,077
<i>♪ Straw-buh-lies, not strawberries ♪</i>

636
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:16,366
Is there something on my face?

637
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:17,870
No…

638
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:22,266
I just haven't seen you laugh and smile like that in a long time.

639
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,466
Don't drink too much. Okay?

640
00:47:31,466 --> 00:47:34,933
Or you'll end up tying someone else's necktie again.

641
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:53,763
Big thanks to our lovely boss for joining us today!

642
00:47:55,007 --> 00:47:57,333
Our boss makes us happy,

643
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:02,966
so we, the loyal employees, will give our all! Let's go full throttle!

644
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:05,400
And now for our final song,

645
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,233
lead vocals by me, Bbum Bbum!

646
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:14,100
No, no! It's Goody! Number one lead singer!

647
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,500
Move aside, Goody! It's Bbum Bbum all the way!

648
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,333
Oh, please. Please give me the mic! You go sit over there!

649
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,533
My chest is all tight!

650
00:48:30,162 --> 00:48:32,535
That was intense! Very good!

651
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,305
Apologies, Boss!

652
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:50,066
Ms. Bbum is pretty funny, right?

653
00:48:50,066 --> 00:48:52,266
How did she even get that drunk?

654
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,900
What are you looking at?

655
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,333
I almost forgot what your laugh sounded like, Boss.

656
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,400
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

657
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,166
But I don't want to trouble you, sir.

658
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:17,400
No need to be so formal.

659
00:49:18,127 --> 00:49:22,262
By the way, I broke up with Jinny.

660
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:25,708
I know. She came crying to me.

661
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:29,355
Really? What did she say?

662
00:49:29,355 --> 00:49:33,233
She said, "Who else could be as perfect as Thi?"

663
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:35,600
That you've set the bar so high

664
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,033
that no other man will ever compare.

665
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:42,300
Wait, what? She really said that?

666
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:47,000
I thought she'd say I was cold-hearted and ruthless.

667
00:49:47,933 --> 00:49:49,833
So you do know yourself.

668
00:49:50,594 --> 00:49:53,700
Anyway, let's head back.

669
00:50:11,766 --> 00:50:14,547
Thank you for the ride, Boss.

670
00:50:15,287 --> 00:50:18,833
So, how was today? I want to know. As your boss,

671
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:21,325
do you think I'm a good one?

672
00:50:22,824 --> 00:50:24,625
Yeah, you're okay.

673
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,800
And am I charming?

674
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:32,266
Are you conducting some kind of employee satisfaction survey?

675
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:34,988
I can send you the proper evaluation form if you want.

676
00:50:34,988 --> 00:50:38,916
I don't care about anyone else's opinion. I only care about yours.

677
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:41,900
Is it enough to make you stay?

678
00:50:43,392 --> 00:50:47,266
So you went out to eat with us, took everyone to karaoke,

679
00:50:47,266 --> 00:50:50,366
all that was to stop me from quitting?

680
00:50:50,366 --> 00:50:53,050
Is that so bad?

681
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:58,130
You got extra care, support, and kindness from me, especially for you.

682
00:50:59,193 --> 00:51:01,966
It didn't feel special at all. It did feel awful.

683
00:51:01,966 --> 00:51:04,066
When a boss pretends to be kind just to manipulate the staff,

684
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:05,733
no one wants to work for someone like that.

685
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:07,457
Pretending? Manipulating?

686
00:51:07,457 --> 00:51:10,300
You just crushed my good intentions completely, Secretary Prim.

687
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,900
Was it really good intentions? Or just selfishness?

688
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,066
Excuse me, sir.

689
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:17,112
You're talking back to me again.

690
00:51:17,112 --> 00:51:19,898
You've probably been holding it for nine years.

691
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:24,166
Yes. Maybe try lowering your ego a little, sir.

692
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:26,446
Just seeing your face gives me a headache.

693
00:51:26,957 --> 00:51:29,394
- My face?
- Yes, that face.

694
00:51:29,394 --> 00:51:30,700
Instead of admiring yourself in the mirror every day,

695
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,033
try yelling at your reflection for once.

696
00:51:32,033 --> 00:51:33,433
On the days you only think of yourself, say,

697
00:51:33,433 --> 00:51:36,838
"You heartless jerk! You selfish bastard!" Try that sometime.

698
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,700
I never thought you'd hate me this much

699
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,533
or want to stop working with me so badly.

700
00:51:49,766 --> 00:51:51,733
Goodbye, sir.

701
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:09,620
<i>[What is this? Take me there...]</i>

702
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:18,366
I ended up snapping at him again today.

703
00:52:18,366 --> 00:52:20,300
I feel awful!

704
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,500
But seriously, I just want to resign. Why does it have to become such a big deal?

705
00:52:34,072 --> 00:52:36,359
<i>The only people who've ever said I have no heart</i>

706
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:40,231
<i>are you and my older brother.</i>

707
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,933
His older brother?

708
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,733
Does Boss have a brother?

709
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:13,600
I'll go get his necktie first.

710
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,306
Okay.

711
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,393
I'll also have to start learning how to tie a tie for him.

712
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,005
Boss,

713
00:53:34,173 --> 00:53:36,906
I wanted to apologize about yesterday.

714
00:53:36,906 --> 00:53:39,400
It's fine. I'm not holding it against you.

715
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,900
That's all you came for, right?

716
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,400
Then, let me help you with your tie.

717
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,266
No need.

718
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:50,766
I don't want to be that selfish guy who overworks you beyond your duties.

719
00:53:53,033 --> 00:53:54,666
From now on, if I don't call for you,

720
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:56,833
don't come into my office.

721
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,745
Secretary.

722
00:53:59,745 --> 00:54:01,166
- Yes?
- Yes?

723
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:04,100
I was calling Secretary Mind, not Secretary Prim.

724
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,700
I want to send an email to a client in Hong Kong.

725
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,133
Come with me.

726
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:09,833
Yes, sir.

727
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:33,026
What is it, Prae?

728
00:54:34,263 --> 00:54:35,873
What?

729
00:54:39,706 --> 00:54:41,427
What the hell are you doing?

730
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,000
I wanted to find out

731
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,733
if you're really as heartless as they say.

732
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:54,006
I'm sorry for interrupting. I'll come back later.

733
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:03,088
So, what's the verdict? Am I a normal person with a heart or not?

734
00:55:03,088 --> 00:55:08,932
You have one. But you're missing something.

735
00:55:08,932 --> 00:55:10,066
What?

736
00:55:10,066 --> 00:55:15,066
You lack understanding of simple things.

737
00:55:15,066 --> 00:55:18,933
They're bound to clash now and then.

738
00:55:18,933 --> 00:55:24,166
But man, the stuff you told me, that's not just "clashing".

739
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:26,766
If it were me, and my secretary said all that crap to my face,

740
00:55:26,766 --> 00:55:28,187
I'd have fired her on the spot.

741
00:55:28,187 --> 00:55:33,966
And usually, you're the kindof guy who never backs down,

742
00:55:33,966 --> 00:55:36,466
which is weird.

743
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:41,433
She probably thinks she holds the upper hand.

744
00:55:41,433 --> 00:55:45,566
If she resigns, she gets to throw every punch she's been holding back.

745
00:55:45,566 --> 00:55:47,500
Man, your dynamic with her. It's spicy!

746
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,112
I don't even know who to root for. You or your secretary.

747
00:55:51,112 --> 00:55:54,755
You can cheer for whoever the hell you want. I just came to vent, that's all.

748
00:55:59,066 --> 00:56:01,239
Seriously, man. Do you ever take the easy way?

749
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:03,897
You just love making things complicated, don't you?

750
00:56:15,345 --> 00:56:17,045
Secretary Prim?

751
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:19,759
What's wrong?

752
00:56:19,759 --> 00:56:21,659
Where are you going?

753
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,066
Where did Ploen go?

754
00:56:36,066 --> 00:56:37,366
Just now, I went to the restroom.

755
00:56:37,366 --> 00:56:39,533
I told her to wait outside, but I didn't see her when I came out.

756
00:56:39,533 --> 00:56:42,266
What should I do, Prim?

757
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:44,666
I left her in front of the bathroom, and when I came out, she was gone!

758
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:46,633
I forgot to check the time. I came out and she wasn't there!

759
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:49,826
Stop! Breathe.

760
00:56:50,499 --> 00:56:52,925
- Okay.
- What should I do, Prim? I've searched all over for her!

761
00:56:52,925 --> 00:56:54,433
Calm down, please.

762
00:56:54,433 --> 00:56:55,900
Let's split up and search. We'll find her.

763
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,966
- What should I do?
- Prim, you go that way.

764
00:56:57,966 --> 00:56:58,966
I'll go this way.

765
00:56:58,966 --> 00:57:00,500
- Let's go.
- Okay.

766
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:05,833
Ploen! Ploen, sweetie!

767
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:08,200
Excuse me, I'm looking for a missing child.

768
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:13,266
Excuse me. Have you seen a cute little girl with a round face who looks just like me?

769
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,781
Ploen…

770
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:27,560
<i>[Happy Children's Day]</i>

771
00:57:27,562 --> 00:57:29,262
Ploen…

772
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,166
Ploen…

773
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:34,066
Ploen… Ploen…

774
00:57:47,919 --> 00:57:49,753
<i>Come with me, dear.</i>

775
00:57:54,746 --> 00:57:56,246
Prim?

776
00:58:13,925 --> 00:58:18,366
It's okay. We will find her.

777
00:58:20,533 --> 00:58:24,000
But I'm afraid Ploen will end up like…

778
00:58:36,806 --> 00:58:39,666
Ploen! Ploen!

779
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:40,915
Prim!

780
00:58:40,915 --> 00:58:44,153
Ploen… Ploen, wait!

781
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:46,159
Ploen!

782
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:48,933
I'm so sorry.

783
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:03,906
Prim!

784
00:59:08,126 --> 00:59:09,726
Ploen!

785
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,066
Ploen, why did you wander off?

786
00:59:33,066 --> 00:59:35,618
Why didn't you wait in front of the bathroom like your mom told you?

787
00:59:35,618 --> 00:59:39,590
I'm sorry. I wanted to go and play in the ball pit,

788
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,910
but I got lost.

789
01:00:02,343 --> 01:00:05,166
Thank you so, so much.

790
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:12,466
Prim, I'll see you later at Dad's.

791
01:00:16,352 --> 01:00:17,955
Come on, sweetie.

792
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:31,300
Do you have something to say to me?

793
01:00:33,573 --> 01:00:35,973
Thank you for helping find Ploen.

794
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:38,546
And…

795
01:00:38,546 --> 01:00:43,466
I'm sorry for what I said yesterday.

796
01:00:44,026 --> 01:00:45,830
Noted.

797
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:49,033
You're still mad, aren't you?

798
01:00:49,686 --> 01:00:51,079
I'm not a child.

799
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:53,660
I won't hold a grudge over something like that.

800
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:59,820
Thank you, "Boss Wee-Woo"!

801
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,533
Can you finally tell me why your niece calls me "Wee-Woo"?

802
01:01:11,746 --> 01:01:14,362
Can I not answer that just yet?

803
01:01:14,362 --> 01:01:16,942
Prae, wait! I'll walk you out.

804
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:25,352
<i>You're probably sleeping peacefully right now…</i>

805
01:02:25,352 --> 01:02:28,033
<i>But I keep having nightmares almost every night.</i>

806
01:02:48,219 --> 01:02:50,411
<i>Your soulmate is right in front of you.
[Next Episode]</i>

807
01:02:50,411 --> 01:02:53,770
<i>Because the red thing is holding you together.</i>

808
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,480
<i>I know you brought me here to be a shield against the pairing.</i>

809
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,481
<i>You're not being nice.</i>

810
01:02:59,481 --> 01:03:01,874
<i>I didn't come back to only launch a new book.</i>

811
01:03:01,874 --> 01:03:02,849
<i>But it's because of you, too.</i>

812
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:05,650
<i>This is Dr. Tawan. Good looking. Excellent profile.</i>

813
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:08,694
<i>- Secretary Prim.
- This is the deputy, Prim's boss.</i>

814
01:03:08,694 --> 01:03:09,866
<i>"Prim's."</i>

815
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:11,821
<i>"Boss," I heard it clearly.</i>

816
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:16,328
<i>If you're going to get married, you only have to marry me.</i>
