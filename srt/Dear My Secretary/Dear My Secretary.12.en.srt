1
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:07,567
When will you stop causing trouble
for everyone around you, huh?

2
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,367
Because you kept hiding the truth, isn't it?

3
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:10,953
The one who was locked up that day…

4
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:12,879
It wasn't me, it was you.

5
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,959
I remember everything now.

6
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,411
My prince.

7
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,369
Happy Birthday, my dear friend.

8
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,254
You actually remember?

9
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:23,305
Your birthday happens to be the same day
as my wedding anniversary.

10
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:27,367
You know, both you and me,
we can never go back to how we were.

11
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:28,889
Let's stop dragging this out.

12
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,913
My favorite jacket is gone! What should I do?

13
00:01:30,913 --> 00:01:32,201
Can you help me look for it?

14
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:33,342
Fine.

15
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:35,009
- Yay!
- Hey!

16
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:38,816
Happy Birthday, my prince.

17
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,736
I wished for you to be my princess forever.

18
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:43,871
Go home now. Drive safe.

19
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:51,009
Prim!

20
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,174
Someone, please help!

21
00:01:53,174 --> 00:01:54,985
Is anyone here? Help!

22
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,447
Someone call an ambulance!

23
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:00,619
Help! Help!

24
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,086
- Prim!
- Are you okay?

25
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,606
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:08,859
We were about to play paintball,
but my gun went off by accident.

27
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:10,760
Huh?

28
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,075
Paintball?

29
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:13,075
Yes.

30
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,810
- Oh?
- Oh?

31
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:19,900
I'm really okay, though.

32
00:02:20,486 --> 00:02:21,486
Huh?

33
00:02:34,118 --> 00:02:36,838
Well, next time, be more careful, okay?

34
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:38,464
Yeah, we're sorry.

35
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:44,710
You really acted well.

36
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,641
I thought it was real.

37
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:53,655
I was so worried.

38
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:18,199
<i>♪ The spotted spider over there ♪</i>

39
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,427
<i>♪ I saw it struggling… ♪</i>

40
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:49,382
What are you doing, sir?

41
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:52,006
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm just going to sleep with you.

42
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:53,892
- Huh?
- Surprise!

43
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:57,138
Sleep in my room?

44
00:03:57,138 --> 00:04:00,839
Yeah, I'm worried someone might
shoot paintball at you again,

45
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,618
so I want to take care of you.

46
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,184
But, my bedroom is small.

47
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:08,638
It's fine. I want a change of scenery.

48
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:10,151
I've slept in big rooms enough already.

49
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,688
Sleeping in a small room would be nice.

50
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:15,394
Don't worry, if you can sleep, I can sleep too.

51
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,886
What are you doing, sir?

52
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:39,157
Getting ready to sleep.

53
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,826
You don't need to be so excited
about sleeping with me.

54
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,836
Just relax, like it's your own home.

55
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:51,174
Shouldn't I be the one saying that?

56
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,988
You don't have to repeat it. Don't worry.

57
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,731
I'll make myself comfortable,
like it's my own home.

58
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,128
I'm being sarcastic!

59
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:03,166
Oh, really?

60
00:05:04,824 --> 00:05:07,611
I came to see you tonight
because I really care about you.

61
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,979
I want to be with you
so you can sleep peacefully.

62
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,014
Well, let's sleep.

63
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:22,775
I'm here, you don't need to
be afraid of anything.

64
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,839
You're praying?

65
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:56,834
Yes, my mom says if I pray, I'll sleep well.

66
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:00,683
With someone as brilliant as me,
you'll have good dreams anyway.

67
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:05,642
And my mom also said that if I pray,
ghosts won't bother me.

68
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:18,329
I didn't know that
brilliant people are also afraid of ghosts.

69
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:20,627
I'm not afraid.

70
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:22,684
I just respect them.

71
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:43,198
Boss!

72
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:46,535
Are you okay, sir?

73
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:48,569
Oh, I'm so sorry!

74
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:50,116
You're so mean!

75
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:55,206
Who told you to climb onto the bed?
I was so startled!

76
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,425
I can't sleep.

77
00:06:58,076 --> 00:07:01,287
If we're squeezing into the bed like this,
how could we possibly sleep?

78
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,887
Well, there's only one bed here.

79
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:06,451
Just sleep, I won't do anything to you.

80
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,149
Or do you want me to?

81
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:12,404
Boss!

82
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:31,074
Am I sleeping too close to you?

83
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:33,398
No, actually.

84
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,480
I can't sleep either.

85
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:40,967
I think… you should go back home.

86
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,550
I told you, I don't want you to sleep alone.
You'll get shot again.

87
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,409
How about this?
Do you want to stay at my place?

88
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:53,862
My bed is way bigger…

89
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:54,862
and bouncy.

90
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:59,152
Are you crazy?
Are you thinking something inappropriate?

91
00:07:59,152 --> 00:08:00,529
You're the one having those thoughts.

92
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:03,538
If you hadn't thought about it,
how would you know what I was thinking? Huh?

93
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:05,849
I didn't think about that.

94
00:08:06,644 --> 00:08:09,749
Then let's go sleep at my house.
I'll give you the master bedroom.

95
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:11,856
I'll sleep in the guest room.

96
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:14,318
- But…
- Then let's just squeeze together like this.

97
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:18,719
Who knows, maybe we'll be closer even more.

98
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:24,198
Okay, fine. Let's go then.

99
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:37,610
Sweet dreams.
Don't walk into my room in your sleep.

100
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:41,124
Yeah, you too, sir.

101
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:42,824
Don't walk over in your sleep.

102
00:08:43,713 --> 00:08:44,713
Sweet dreams.

103
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:54,452
Prim, Prim!

104
00:08:55,555 --> 00:08:56,748
What is it?

105
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:57,748
Nothing.

106
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:00,898
I miss you.

107
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,330
Good night!

108
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,330
Good night!

109
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:31,726
The room is big, the bed is big,
but I can't sleep.

110
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:40,923
How did you get in here?

111
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:44,482
I was worried about you.
When I was in your room, it was so small.

112
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:46,862
I saw what you were doing,

113
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:50,930
but now, I don't know what you're doing
because my house is big.

114
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,950
I just realized that
a big house isn't always better.

115
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,410
Maybe I'll demolish the house
and rebuild it to make it smaller.

116
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,633
Oh, calm down, Boss.

117
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:02,438
And you just barged into my room?

118
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:06,972
You're mistaken, this is my room,
which I gave you to sleep in.

119
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:08,599
I just want to sleep next to you,

120
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:11,147
in case you have a nightmare,
so I can comfort you.

121
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:13,775
Thank you.

122
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:16,886
So I'll sleep on the bed.

123
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:19,691
If I sleep on the floor, you'll feel uneasy
and won't be able to sleep.

124
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:31,138
I know what you're thinking about.

125
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:32,642
But I'm so worried about you

126
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:35,993
that I don't have the energy
to think about what you're imagining.

127
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,370
Don't worry, just sleep.

128
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,780
I haven't thought about anything.

129
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:47,016
I'm just going to sleep.

130
00:10:59,228 --> 00:11:01,640
So why did we move houses

131
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,802
if we're still going to end up
sleeping close together?

132
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:07,217
Close together? The bed is much bigger now.

133
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:19,513
<i>Or should we think of something
more than just sleeping?</i>

134
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:21,128
<i>This is crazy.</i>

135
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:23,735
<i>I just realized that sleeping in a small bed,</i>

136
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:25,259
<i>squeezing together at her house,</i>

137
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,542
<i>feels better than sleeping
in the big bed at ours.</i>

138
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,493
<i>A big bed feels empty.</i>

139
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:31,483
<i>I want to roll over and be close to her.</i>

140
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:36,149
<i>No, no, no, I have to act like gentlemen.</i>

141
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:46,390
<i>He's just lying down,
not thinking about anything?</i>

142
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,566
What are you doing, sir?

143
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:55,845
Are you okay?

144
00:11:58,403 --> 00:12:00,505
I'm trying to act like a gentleman.

145
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,656
You can't sleep?

146
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:10,589
Yes.

147
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:16,099
Alright, would you like to
hear a story or a song before sleep?

148
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,237
Then let's go with a story.

149
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:23,648
Once upon a time,

150
00:12:23,648 --> 00:12:28,822
there was a man who was born handsome,
rich, perfect, and radiant…

151
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:29,822
Wait a second.

152
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:34,010
Is this a story or your biography, sir?

153
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,010
How did you know?

154
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:38,640
Then let's switch to a song instead.

155
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:45,800
Alright, here goes.

156
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:07,224
<i>♪ Sleep tight, my darling ♪</i>

157
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:12,815

00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:41,178

163
00:13:41,178 --> 00:13:46,404
<i>♪ I'll always hold you tight ♪</i>

164
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,256
Looks delicious, I must say.

165
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:15,043
I have some talent too.

166
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,912
Why am I praising myself?

167
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,490
Seems like I've gotten a lot from Boss.

168
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,072
<i>[Dry Rice Porridge]</i>

169
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:31,593
Boss?

170
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:38,922
Boss, are you okay?

171
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:40,465
Why do you look like this?

172
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:48,581
<i>Oh no.</i>

173
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,648
<i>Why can't I sleep?</i>

174
00:14:55,338 --> 00:14:57,587
<i>Oh, I'm so flustered now.
I need to take my hand off.</i>

175
00:14:57,587 --> 00:15:00,655
<i>I need to take my hand off.
I need to take my hand off!</i>

176
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:19,080
<i>Oh my god.</i>

177
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,683
<i>She's hugging me tighter than before.</i>

178
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:23,446
<i>I need to think about something else.</i>

179
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:27,368
<i>Find a focus that won't make
my hormones go wilder than they should.</i>

180
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:31,024
<i>I've got it.</i>

181
00:15:31,024 --> 00:15:32,068
<i>This method will work…</i>

182
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:38,849
<i>May all beings
that are companions in suffering…</i>

183
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:44,329
<i>Crazy, chanting this
makes me feel like I've done a good deed.</i>

184
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:45,415
<i>Maybe I should chant again.</i>

185
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:51,927
May all beings
that are companions in suffering…

186
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,925
Last night I slept in a bad position.

187
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:58,374
My neck feels like I got hit by a truck.

188
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:04,190
Come here, I'll give you a massage.

189
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:10,387
This feels so good.

190
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:12,708
You're good at this, huh?

191
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:18,399
Of course,
I'm good at everything now, just like you.

192
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:20,936
Oh!

193
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,010
Oh, can I take back what I just said?

194
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,156
No, you can't.

195
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:25,156
Oh!

196
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:28,296
Are you trying to kill me?

197
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,132
Are you teasing me?

198
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:42,477
Calm down, I usually massage my dad like this.

199
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:43,960
How is it? Is it better?

200
00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:48,966
Yeah… it's gone.

201
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:51,634
It really works.

202
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:52,700
Super perfect.

203
00:16:54,154 --> 00:16:57,474
So, can I ask you to massage me
for the rest of my life?

204
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:00,673
Just massaging, huh?

205
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:42,787
<i>[Pat]</i>

206
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:57,315
You again?

207
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
Pat!

208
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,530
You're going to interrupt my happiness
for the rest of my life, huh?

209
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:06,259
<i>What happiness?</i>

210
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,485
<i>Don't tell me you're with Prim.</i>

211
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,517
<i>Oh, man. So early in the morning?</i>

212
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:14,532
It's not like that.

213
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,237
Why are you calling?

214
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:20,222
<i>The Netherlands furniture company
we talked to the other day…</i>

215
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:22,874
<i>They've agreed to
send their products to our mall.</i>

216
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,610
Really?

217
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,199
Awesome, you're great!

218
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:31,314
I'll give you a bonus for twelve months.

219
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:32,961
Thanks a lot.

220
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:37,790
Congratulations,

221
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,470
Such great news to start the morning with!

222
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,950
Starting the day with good things like this,
today is definitely a lucky day.

223
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:46,012
Perfect day.

224
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:50,941
Can I continue?

225
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,611
No, the time's up.

226
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:55,611
Let's go eat.

227
00:18:56,473 --> 00:18:57,473
Come on!

228
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:21,239
Hello, Chairman. Hello, Mrs. Chollada.

229
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,096
Thee…

230
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,808
Your father and I have something to discuss.

231
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:53,085
Thee…

232
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:56,764
I want to hear the whole story now.

233
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:01,736
Are you ready to tell us everything?

234
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,750
I'm ready now.

235
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:20,387
<i>We've been riding for so long.
When will we reach the aquarium?</i>

236
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,841
<i>Just a little further.</i>

237
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:30,053
<i>Let's go back. This doesn't seem to be the way.</i>

238
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:32,013
<i>Why, are you scared?</i>

239
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,486
<i>I want to go back.
I don't want to see the fish anymore.</i>

240
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:39,170
<i>If you don't want to go, then just wait here.</i>

241
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,250
<i>I'll go alone and come back to you soon.</i>

242
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,357
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

243
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,600
<i>You're too scared to be alone, aren't you?</i>

244
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:49,234
<i>No.</i>

245
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,167
<i>Then wait here so you don't get lost.</i>

246
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:54,291
<i>You scaredy-cat.</i>

247
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,112
<i>Come back quickly.</i>

248
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:19,557
<i>Are you okay?</i>

249
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:25,027
<i>I got dizzy, kid.</i>

250
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,916
<i>Thank you for caring.</i>

251
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:40,022
<i>But I'm too weak to carry the stuff back home.</i>

252
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:49,100
<i>Could you please help me carry stuff home?</i>

253
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:57,379
<i>I'll wait for my brother first.</i>

254
00:21:58,995 --> 00:22:01,176
<i>No, because…</i>

255
00:22:02,012 --> 00:22:04,896
<i>I have a daughter,
and my daughter has been very sick.</i>

256
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:07,337
<i>She has been sick since this morning.</i>

257
00:22:08,802 --> 00:22:11,362
<i>If I don't hurry back,
it could be dangerous for her.</i>

258
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:15,669
<i>If you don't help me,</i>

259
00:22:16,707 --> 00:22:19,324
<i>I won't be able to carry
the stuff back alone.</i>

260
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:24,740
<i>Alright, I'll help.</i>

261
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:28,051
<i>Thank you.</i>

262
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:52,250
<i>Where did you leave your brother?
Tell me right now, Thee!</i>

263
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,312
<i>I'm asking where you left your brother.</i>

264
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:55,312
<i>Just tell me!</i>

265
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:57,222
<i>Tell me now!</i>

266
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:02,702
<i>Tell me, please.</i>

267
00:23:02,702 --> 00:23:05,353
<i>I promise I won't scold you, my dear.</i>

268
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:11,008
<i>Damn you! How could you do this?</i>

269
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:12,070
<i>Where did you leave him?</i>

270
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,308
<i>Tell me right now.</i>

271
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,161
<i>Tell me, I said tell me!</i>

272
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,461
<i>Will he have a scar for the rest of his life?</i>

273
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:35,175
<i>I feel so sorry for him.</i>

274
00:23:44,554 --> 00:23:47,307
<i>It's my fault. I'm sorry.</i>

275
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,867
After I recovered,

276
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:11,551
I was back home,

277
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:18,202
I thought all the terrible things
had come to an end.

278
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,560
But in reality, it was just the beginning…

279
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:39,638
<i>What are you doing in my room,</i>

280
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:42,066
<i>and why are you wearing my shirt?</i>

281
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,433
<i>What are you doing in my room?</i>

282
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
<i>Get out!</i>

283
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:51,822
<i>I was trapped in an abandoned house
almost to the point of death,</i>

284
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:52,915
<i>Because of you!</i>

285
00:24:52,915 --> 00:24:54,903
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

286
00:24:54,903 --> 00:24:56,966
<i>It was me who got kidnapped!</i>

287
00:24:56,966 --> 00:24:57,966
<i>It was me!</i>

288
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:01,056
<i>Get out! I told you to leave!</i>

289
00:25:01,056 --> 00:25:02,056
<i>Get out!</i>

290
00:25:03,342 --> 00:25:05,546
At that time, my body hadn't fully healed yet,

291
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,087
and my mental state wasn't okay either.

292
00:25:08,726 --> 00:25:12,322
But he acted as if I was the one at fault.

293
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,997
I tried to let it go.

294
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:31,351
But one day, I couldn't take it anymore.

295
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:33,762
I was angry, Mom.

296
00:25:36,698 --> 00:25:40,345
Because I knew I was the one
who had gone through all the bad things.

297
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:45,998
At one point, I started fighting back.

298
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:48,240
We fought so fiercely.

299
00:25:51,518 --> 00:25:54,685
<i>Are you really going to take your son
to see a psychiatrist?</i>

300
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:58,951
<i>Yes, I'm going to take him
for treatment at the hospital</i>

301
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:01,123
<i>before his condition gets worse.</i>

302
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,596
<i>He's just confused and feels guilty.</i>

303
00:26:05,596 --> 00:26:07,355
<i>He is not crazy.</i>

304
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:11,859
<i>Darling, you should admit it already
that right now,</i>

305
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:14,124
<i>Thee is in a very bad state.</i>

306
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,106
<i>Don't you see that
Thee picks fights with Tham every day?</i>

307
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:21,721
<i>Yesterday, he was even going to
hit Tham with a baseball bat.</i>

308
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:26,425
<i>How could Thee do that to his younger brother,</i>

309
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:29,170
<i>especially after what he just went through?</i>

310
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,094
<i>I know you sympathize with Thee,</i>

311
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:35,842
<i>but you also have to
think about Tham's feelings.</i>

312
00:26:35,842 --> 00:26:38,566
<i>How will he be okay
if this keeps happening every day?</i>

313
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:41,331
<i>How could you just send your child
to a mental hospital like that?</i>

314
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:44,974
<i>I can't accept that.
I'd rather die than let that happen.</i>

315
00:26:46,832 --> 00:26:47,907
<i>Darling…</i>

316
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:52,017
<i>Why does it have to be like this?
I want to die.</i>

317
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:54,693
For me, after seeing someone
die right before my eyes…

318
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:57,640
'Death' feels incredibly vivid.

319
00:26:59,262 --> 00:27:01,157
And it's very terrifying for me.

320
00:27:02,903 --> 00:27:06,100
I'm afraid of seeing another person
die in front of me.

321
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:09,717
<i>It's hard to believe that
Thee has become such a jealous person</i>

322
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:12,073
<i>to the point of abandoning
his brother like that.</i>

323
00:27:12,073 --> 00:27:13,965
<i>I overheard that he's gone crazy.</i>

324
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,770
<i>With such a serious condition,
it's right to send him to a mental hospital.</i>

325
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,514
<i>They're lucky this hasn't come to light.</i>

326
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:24,396
<i>Where would they go if anyone found out?</i>

327
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:27,443
<i>It must be the misfortune of our family line.</i>

328
00:27:27,443 --> 00:27:30,225
<i>Uncle hoped that
he would be the hope of the family,</i>

329
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:33,096
<i>but now the eldest grandson is going crazy.</i>

330
00:27:33,096 --> 00:27:34,763
<i>Oh, that's just great.</i>

331
00:27:34,763 --> 00:27:37,528
<i>I'm not crazy! I'm Tham!</i>

332
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:41,303
<i>I'm the one who was captured, not him!</i>

333
00:27:41,303 --> 00:27:43,283
<i>I'm not crazy!</i>

334
00:27:43,283 --> 00:27:45,073
<i>Did you hear me? I'm not crazy!</i>

335
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:53,036
<i>Thee! Thee! Don't do this!</i>

336
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:54,504
<i>Thee!</i>

337
00:27:54,504 --> 00:27:56,380
<i>I said stop! Stop now, Thee!</i>

338
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,527
<i>Thee!</i>

339
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:58,969
<i>Thee, don't do this!</i>

340
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,068
<i>- I'm Tham, not Thee.
- Thee!</i>

341
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:02,930
<i>- I'm Tham, not Thee.
- Thee!</i>

342
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,050
<i>I'm Tham.</i>

343
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:10,050
<i>Thee! Thee! Thee! Thee, my child! Thee.</i>

344
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:14,840
<i>Thee, son! Thee.</i>

345
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,928
<i>Thee, what's wrong?</i>

346
00:28:17,543 --> 00:28:18,976
<i>- Thee!
- Thee!</i>

347
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:20,529
<i>- Thee…
- Honey.</i>

348
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,713
<i>Someone, please call an ambulance!</i>

349
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:23,747
<i>- Honey.
- Thee!</i>

350
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:24,849
<i>- What happened?
- Thee!</i>

351
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:26,637
<i>- Thee, my son!
- You'll be okay.</i>

352
00:28:27,316 --> 00:28:30,307
At that point,
I just thought I had to do something.

353
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,314
<i>- Thee, Thee!
- Thee!</i>

354
00:28:34,216 --> 00:28:36,529
<i>Someone, please call an ambulance!</i>

355
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:38,649
<i>Thee!</i>

356
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:43,489
<i>- Tham!
- Tham!</i>

357
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:45,960
<i>Tham, my dear! Tham!</i>

358
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,281
<i>Tham! What's happening?</i>

359
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:51,133
<i>Tham! What's wrong?</i>

360
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:54,389
<i>What happened, Tham?</i>

361
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:05,603
<i>How's Tham?
Has he come back from the hospital yet?</i>

362
00:29:06,574 --> 00:29:08,458
<i>What did you say, son?</i>

363
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:13,020
<i>How is Tham?
Has he come back from the hospital yet?</i>

364
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:17,104
<i>What did you just say? Your name is Tham.</i>

365
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:19,675
<i>No, I'm Thee.</i>

366
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:25,080
<i>I left Tham behind, so he was kidnapped.</i>

367
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,909
At that moment,
I just thought pretending to be Thee

368
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:37,569
and letting him believe he's Tham,

369
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,330
the way he wanted to believe,

370
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:43,405
would be the best solution
to end all these bad things.

371
00:29:47,272 --> 00:29:50,405
To bury the suffering and pain completely,

372
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,271
and start over again,

373
00:29:56,112 --> 00:29:58,208
even though it's not the truth.

374
00:29:59,346 --> 00:30:02,413
But it allowed our family
to move forward that day.

375
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:08,501
I'm sorry, my child.

376
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:10,855
It's my fault.

377
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:17,892
It was my fault that day.
I decided to let things go

378
00:30:17,892 --> 00:30:21,134
because I thought
if the two of you switched names,

379
00:30:21,134 --> 00:30:22,462
everything would be over.

380
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:28,338
It seemed like the only way
to protect both of you.

381
00:30:32,318 --> 00:30:33,856
I forgot to think that…

382
00:30:34,608 --> 00:30:37,859
even though Tham felt pain,

383
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,590
But he wouldn't suffer as much as you did,

384
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:44,867
who was going through that incident yourself.

385
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:48,610
I'm sorry, my son.

386
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,775
For making you carry this terrible thing alone.

387
00:30:57,084 --> 00:30:59,109
Please forgive Dad and Mom.

388
00:31:18,027 --> 00:31:19,979
I've never blamed you, Dad and Mom.

389
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:23,018
I understand everything.

390
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:26,558
I was willing to do that on my own.

391
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:29,188
Thee…

392
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:33,370
From now on, if you have any problems,

393
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,602
please tell your father and me directly.

394
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:38,315
Don't keep things to yourself.

395
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:41,534
Alright.

396
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:46,073
I believe everything will get better
from now on.

397
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:55,644
And how is Tham doing?

398
00:31:59,748 --> 00:32:02,357
Tham will probably return
to England soon, my son,

399
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,752
and he probably won't be
coming back for a long time.

400
00:32:14,331 --> 00:32:15,331
Oh, no!

401
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:27,181
What… why are you poking me?
I'm watching the lottery.

402
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:30,331
- Sis!
- Oh! What now?

403
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:31,331
There!

404
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:33,242
It's Kawee.

405
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:36,104
Well… it's Kawee. So what about it?

406
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:37,633
Isn't it strange?

407
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:39,417
Today Kawee isn't wearing a leather jacket,

408
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,130
but still looks good in a different way.

409
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:47,557
Kawee-wee-wee, eat your meal and enjoy!

410
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,057
- Sis!
- What?

411
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,101
Aren't you feeling unwell?

412
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:58,014
Why aren't you screaming for Kawee like before?

413
00:32:58,694 --> 00:33:02,859
Oh… my eyes are already set.

414
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:04,836
I'll look at only one person.

415
00:33:04,836 --> 00:33:05,836
Who?

416
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,840
- Tell me.
- Nothing.

417
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,157
Oh my god!

418
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:13,151
I… I… I won the lottery!

419
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:14,256
I'm going to be rich!

420
00:33:15,923 --> 00:33:17,402
Wait… wait a minute. Calm down.

421
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:18,547
Wait a second. What prize did you win?

422
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:22,211
- How much money?
- The fifth prize, 20,000 baht.

423
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:23,825
Oh my god! Oh my god, oh my god.

424
00:33:23,825 --> 00:33:26,525
Where did you go to pray,
and why did you win so much?

425
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:28,204
I went to the Golden Gourami Goddess Shrine.

426
00:33:28,204 --> 00:33:30,611
I have to make a big offering now.

427
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,323
Wait, wait, the Golden Gourami Goddess?

428
00:33:32,323 --> 00:33:34,260
Oh my god,
I've never won the lottery in my life.

429
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,872
Can I touch it? For good luck,
good fortune, and good health, please?

430
00:33:36,872 --> 00:33:39,017
- Let me touch it!
- Be careful, be careful!

431
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,801
Oh my god, I have to go make my offering now.

432
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:43,691
I want to win the lottery too!

433
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:47,965
That was a real sudden windfall!

434
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:49,718
Hey, go get it quickly! It's my money!

435
00:33:49,718 --> 00:33:50,807
Go now! Hurry!

436
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:03,743
Prim, please take care of Thee, okay?

437
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:10,564
Take care of him as his secretary, understand?

438
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:15,765
Yes, don't worry.

439
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:39,596
My favorite jacket is missing,
and I feel like I'm not myself!!

440
00:34:39,596 --> 00:34:42,732
So, have you already
taken care of my documents?

441
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:43,938
Yes, you left them behind,

442
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:46,943
and I separated the recyclables
and sold them to the scrap vendor.

443
00:34:46,943 --> 00:34:47,943
What?

444
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,367
Oh no, those were important documents!

445
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:52,798
What should I do?

446
00:34:53,736 --> 00:34:54,736
What happened?

447
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,789
It's the sales contract
from the buyer that they sent to me.

448
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:02,734
I accidentally threw it into the trash can.

449
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:06,267
And then she sold it to the junk dealer.

450
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:08,132
How long ago was that?

451
00:35:08,132 --> 00:35:10,178
Just a little while ago,
at the building over there.

452
00:35:11,828 --> 00:35:13,636
Let me go check. Take this.

453
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:34,929
It landed here, of all places?

454
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:37,885
Oh my god… this is so frustrating!

455
00:35:39,408 --> 00:35:40,408
Uncle!

456
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:42,729
Uncle, wait! Stop!

457
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,392
Hold on! Just a sec!

458
00:35:45,392 --> 00:35:47,888
Stop, stop!

459
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:50,814
What is it, kid?

460
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,460
It's some old paper that
you bought from my company.

461
00:35:54,104 --> 00:35:56,637
There's an important document inside.
Can I get it back?

462
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,521
Oh, come on. I already paid you.

463
00:36:00,521 --> 00:36:02,302
You think I'll just give it back?

464
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,298
There are only a few sheets,
please let me have them back.

465
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:07,496
Wait! What is this?!

466
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,127
Hey, no! What the heck are you doing?!

467
00:36:14,043 --> 00:36:15,911
I asked for it, and you didn't give it.

468
00:36:16,564 --> 00:36:17,979
I don't want to give it back.

469
00:36:18,537 --> 00:36:19,537
What's the problem?

470
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:22,797
Okay then, let's do this, uncle.

471
00:36:22,797 --> 00:36:24,110
I'll buy it back from you.

472
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:26,057
- Buy it back?
- Yeah.

473
00:36:26,057 --> 00:36:27,765
Alright, 500.

474
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:31,740
Are you crazy? 500 for a few sheets of paper?

475
00:36:32,304 --> 00:36:34,028
That's my price.

476
00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:35,529
What's the problem?

477
00:36:36,623 --> 00:36:37,811
This is so annoying!

478
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:41,223
I've been annoying since birth, kid.

479
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:45,497
I usually like peace,

480
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:47,389
but when it comes to a fight,
I won't back down.

481
00:36:49,412 --> 00:36:50,967
If you want to fight…

482
00:36:53,222 --> 00:36:54,646
You want to fight?

483
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:55,646
Fine.

484
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:57,595
Hey, you guys!

485
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,380
Who are you calling for?

486
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,520
You'll know soon.

487
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:15,535
Okay.

488
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,640
Alright, Pen, don't forget to eat

489
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,108
and take care of yourself.

490
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:27,733
Alright.

491
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:29,556
That Pen again?

492
00:37:30,808 --> 00:37:31,808
Oh, Bhum!

493
00:37:32,388 --> 00:37:33,801
Hello.

494
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:35,216
What are you looking for, Bhum?

495
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:36,216
None of your business!

496
00:37:39,276 --> 00:37:41,067
Well, let me help you find it.

497
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:42,067
I said, stay out of it!

498
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:48,901
I found it! Yay!

499
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:56,303
Hey, why are you hugging me?

500
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,829
You're the one hugging me, Bhum.

501
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:00,142
Stop it! That's not true!

502
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:06,609
Hey… This guy's asking for it!

503
00:38:11,168 --> 00:38:13,270
Actually, I'm a peaceful guy, uncle.

504
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:16,535
I'm pretty well-mannered.

505
00:38:16,535 --> 00:38:18,102
Just like you, right?

506
00:38:18,102 --> 00:38:20,715
- Want me to button it for you?
- No need!

507
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,769
- Feels uncomfortable.
- Alright then, how much was it again?

508
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,809
- It's 500. Right.
- Just 500?

509
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:27,146
Fine, 500 it is!

510
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:28,689
- Hey! Catch him!
- Zombies!

511
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:31,471
Hey! Stop right there!

512
00:38:31,471 --> 00:38:33,551
Sis! Did you find it?

513
00:38:33,551 --> 00:38:34,645
Did you? Did you?

514
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,075
Did you find it, huh?

515
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:42,278
I can't believe it! Thank you so much, sis!

516
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,105
Next time, just buy it online, okay?

517
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:46,476
Cash it in and share some with me!

518
00:38:46,476 --> 00:38:48,364
Thank you so much! You're the best!

519
00:38:50,016 --> 00:38:51,107
Let's go cash it in!

520
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,354
Hey! Oh God!

521
00:39:06,354 --> 00:39:08,480
I'm not with god yet, just almost.

522
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:11,833
What happened to you?

523
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,972
Don't even ask. My mouth hurts.

524
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,780
Is this it?

525
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,705
Hey, thanks!

526
00:39:28,537 --> 00:39:30,113
- Oh…
- What's that?

527
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:33,048
It's not this one.

528
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:45,538
Oh, hey!

529
00:39:45,538 --> 00:39:46,904
Here it is!

530
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:49,193
That's a relief.

531
00:39:49,193 --> 00:39:51,154
At least it didn't end up
with the junk collector.

532
00:39:58,544 --> 00:40:00,724
Sorry about that.

533
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,571
Does it hurt?

534
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:05,570
- Oh!
- Hey!

535
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,162
Sorry, sorry!

536
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,730
Let me take you to get that treated.

537
00:40:16,009 --> 00:40:17,856
I got another bag already,

538
00:40:17,856 --> 00:40:18,929
thank you so much.

539
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,357
Running away from your problems again?

540
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,973
Where are you planning to go this time?

541
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:37,746
How do you expect me to feel

542
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,985
when you've been trying to help me,

543
00:40:40,573 --> 00:40:43,694
but I've spent more than half my life
hating you?

544
00:40:47,216 --> 00:40:49,345
Back then, I thought that if I acted that way…

545
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:54,101
Dad, Mom, and you
wouldn't have to suffer the pain.

546
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,570
Did I seem so weak
and pathetic that you didn't think

547
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,714
I could face the truth?

548
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,653
You should have told me the truth,

549
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:14,875
encouraged me, and stood by my side,

550
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:18,514
not kept it from me like this.

551
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:24,852
Now I realize I was wrong.

552
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,179
You're right.

553
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:34,254
I should have supported you
and faced the pain together.

554
00:41:35,315 --> 00:41:37,571
Like a family should.

555
00:41:53,908 --> 00:41:54,959
I'm sorry.

556
00:41:57,624 --> 00:41:59,075
And if, from now on,

557
00:41:59,075 --> 00:42:01,444
you want to blame me or keep hating me,

558
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,117
I understand.

559
00:42:06,013 --> 00:42:07,671
But please don't hate yourself.

560
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:11,416
I want you to let go of everything.

561
00:42:13,112 --> 00:42:15,661
And live happily for yourself.

562
00:42:19,182 --> 00:42:20,277
I'm sorry too.

563
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:25,423
What did you say?

564
00:42:28,975 --> 00:42:31,017
I'm sorry for stealing your memories.

565
00:42:35,044 --> 00:42:37,206
I've hated myself so much
for everything that happened.

566
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,338
And the only way I could feel better…

567
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:45,241
was to become someone else.

568
00:42:53,548 --> 00:42:55,223
I'm giving you back the name Tham.

569
00:42:59,232 --> 00:43:00,237
No way.

570
00:43:01,043 --> 00:43:03,125
I've been living as Thee for half my life now.

571
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:05,087
Changing back would feel weird.

572
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,794
Are you sure?

573
00:43:09,794 --> 00:43:10,794
Yeah.

574
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,839
The name Thee doesn't suit you.

575
00:43:14,476 --> 00:43:16,433
It fits someone cool like me better.

576
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,446
I'm sorry for everything.

577
00:43:31,338 --> 00:43:34,758
And I wish you the best in everything,
little Thee.

578
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:42,178
You're welcome, Tham.

579
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:01,790
Director, Director!

580
00:44:02,747 --> 00:44:03,747
Director!

581
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,590
Please sign these documents, Director!

582
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:11,294
You've been sitting there in shock
for an hour now.

583
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:19,004
This is an important document,
not divorce papers, Director.

584
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:21,024
Get a grip, please.

585
00:44:24,643 --> 00:44:27,403
There are still plenty of things
you need to sign.

586
00:44:28,947 --> 00:44:31,557
My boss asked me
to bring these to Director for signature.

587
00:44:33,886 --> 00:44:37,486
Well, Director saw Mrs. Ann
taking a photo with another guy.

588
00:44:37,486 --> 00:44:41,665
He couldn't handle it and went into shock like…

589
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:43,553
He's completely out of it.

590
00:44:44,334 --> 00:44:46,419
I have no idea what to do anymore.

591
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:57,742
Fine, don't sign then.

592
00:44:59,999 --> 00:45:03,745
How about we step outside for some fresh air?

593
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,888
Have some coconut water to feel refreshed.

594
00:45:13,888 --> 00:45:14,929
Coconut water?

595
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:16,163
What's wrong with coconut water?

596
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:18,489
Ann used to buy it for me all the time.

597
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:19,861
- Oh!
- Ann…

598
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:21,500
I'll go get you something else then!

599
00:45:25,747 --> 00:45:27,101
Here's some watermelon juice.

600
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:29,682
That's Ann's favorite drink.

601
00:45:29,682 --> 00:45:30,970
Just drink plain water then?

602
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,858
Water is what Ann always told me to drink.

603
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:37,430
She said it's the best.
It's healthy, and I miss Ann so much.

604
00:45:38,217 --> 00:45:39,410
Just drink it already!

605
00:45:40,145 --> 00:45:41,185
- Here!
- Okay.

606
00:45:58,902 --> 00:46:00,714
Director, what's wrong now?

607
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:06,409
<i>- Darling.
- What?</i>

608
00:46:06,409 --> 00:46:11,916
<i>Did you know
our country is becoming an aging society?</i>

609
00:46:12,752 --> 00:46:13,752
<i>And?</i>

610
00:46:14,603 --> 00:46:20,603
<i>Shouldn't we help produce
the next generation for our country?</i>

611
00:46:22,902 --> 00:46:24,246
<i>That actually sounds good.</i>

612
00:46:24,981 --> 00:46:26,781
<i>Really? It's good?</i>

613
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:29,170
<i>No, I mean, it is great.</i>

614
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,019
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah, it really is.</i>

615
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:34,636
<i>Alright, lift your head a bit.</i>

616
00:46:34,636 --> 00:46:36,208
<i>My arm's getting numb.</i>

617
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:38,609
<i>And then, one, two, and press!</i>

618
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:42,270
Ann and I,
we really planned to have kids together.

619
00:46:43,824 --> 00:46:44,824
But now…

620
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:48,185
That dream won't come true anymore.

621
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:54,772
I understand that it's painful
and hard to forget.

622
00:46:55,463 --> 00:46:57,371
But the past is the past.

623
00:46:57,371 --> 00:46:58,825
Whether you feel ready or not…

624
00:46:58,825 --> 00:47:00,741
People have to move on, Director.

625
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:09,229
I'll try my best.

626
00:47:10,415 --> 00:47:12,084
And I'll be cheering for you.

627
00:47:15,094 --> 00:47:16,760
That's my coconut water.

628
00:47:19,235 --> 00:47:20,422
I haven't swallowed it yet.

629
00:47:21,656 --> 00:47:23,386
Take it back. Sorry!

630
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:29,153
Is Pat really that sad?

631
00:47:29,872 --> 00:47:31,987
He must be really heartbroken.

632
00:47:31,987 --> 00:47:34,423
I hope the director can move on soon.

633
00:47:36,276 --> 00:47:38,738
He moves on in circles.

634
00:47:42,915 --> 00:47:45,795
But thank you so much
for taking care of my friend.

635
00:47:54,342 --> 00:47:55,342
Oh…

636
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,374
So cute!

637
00:48:03,015 --> 00:48:05,020
The small one is cute,
and the big one is cute too!

638
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,683
If they're all cute, then buy them all.

639
00:48:08,654 --> 00:48:10,746
Or do you want something else
from this section?

640
00:48:10,746 --> 00:48:12,272
I can get the whole section for you.

641
00:48:12,272 --> 00:48:14,638
- I'll just call the staff.
- Whoa! Calm down.

642
00:48:15,342 --> 00:48:17,615
You can't spoil me like this, Boss.

643
00:48:18,386 --> 00:48:19,586
Why not?

644
00:48:19,586 --> 00:48:21,490
I'm rich, and I want to spoil you.

645
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,450
But I don't want it to be like that.

646
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,383
I don't want people thinking I'm with you

647
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:28,925
just because you're rich and spoil me.

648
00:48:31,893 --> 00:48:34,729
Fine, then. I'll just buy one item.

649
00:48:34,729 --> 00:48:39,189
And I promise. I won't act like
a rich guy who spoils you anymore.

650
00:48:39,189 --> 00:48:41,431
I'll just be the focusing type.

651
00:48:41,431 --> 00:48:42,668
Focused on what?

652
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:46,329
Focused on loving you.

653
00:48:49,877 --> 00:48:51,935
So, which one do you like?

654
00:48:51,935 --> 00:48:53,649
- Which one's good?
- This one is cute too.

655
00:48:53,649 --> 00:48:54,878
Hey, Thee!

656
00:48:58,763 --> 00:48:59,769
Hello.

657
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:00,770
Hello.

658
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:03,887
Walking around so openly together, huh?

659
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:05,173
Are you two dating now?

660
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:07,477
Yes.

661
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:09,587
It can't be true.

662
00:49:13,628 --> 00:49:15,361
What kind of joke is this, Thee?

663
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:19,473
You're just a secretary and her boss.

664
00:49:22,948 --> 00:49:24,195
Oh, really?

665
00:49:24,957 --> 00:49:29,416
Well, what a cozy boss
and secretary relationship you two have.

666
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:31,030
If people didn't know better,

667
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:34,423
they'd misunderstand for sure,
probably across several neighborhoods!

668
00:49:34,423 --> 00:49:37,849
Look, Thee,
I just want to give you a bit of advice.

669
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,719
Honestly, I don't want to say much.

670
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:41,689
But I care about you, so I have to warn you.

671
00:49:41,689 --> 00:49:44,637
You should be mindful of your image, you know.

672
00:49:44,637 --> 00:49:46,648
In today's society,

673
00:49:46,648 --> 00:49:49,905
there are so many gossipers and troublemakers.

674
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,045
That's true, I can kind of see it now.

675
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,377
Are you talking about me?

676
00:50:03,762 --> 00:50:04,903
Well, I guess so.

677
00:50:06,634 --> 00:50:08,218
Bro! Hmph!

678
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:23,613
Are you really dating Prim?

679
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:31,307
Yes, we are together,
and we won't break up easily.

680
00:50:35,196 --> 00:50:37,029
It's not that I dislike Prim,

681
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:39,711
she's good and capable, I can see that.

682
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:44,190
But to be together and get married,

683
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:45,791
you know that it's impossible.

684
00:50:46,405 --> 00:50:47,982
Why would it be impossible, Dad?

685
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:52,831
You're asking like
you don't know the rules of our family!

686
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:58,434
You know that…

687
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:03,197
your wedding isn't just about you.

688
00:51:03,197 --> 00:51:05,905
It will affect the company

689
00:51:07,186 --> 00:51:09,070
and our family as well.

690
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:12,830
I don't think grandpa will be okay with Prim.

691
00:51:15,263 --> 00:51:16,302
Why, Dad?

692
00:51:17,252 --> 00:51:20,883
Do you know that everything I've achieved today

693
00:51:20,883 --> 00:51:24,120
because of Prim has been helping
and taking care of everything?

694
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,319
And I think the most important thing is
she's the one I love.

695
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:32,153
I think that should be enough, right?

696
00:51:32,153 --> 00:51:33,471
But it's not enough.

697
00:51:35,112 --> 00:51:39,045
Thee, don't be stubborn about this.

698
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,375
If I say no, then it's a no.

699
00:51:44,636 --> 00:51:47,289
You can do whatever you want,

700
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:50,513
Except for marriage and starting a family.

701
00:51:50,513 --> 00:51:51,905
That's a matter for the family,

702
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,438
and you have no right to break the rules.

703
00:51:55,168 --> 00:51:58,763
Don't let me see you walking around
with Prim out in public like this again.

704
00:52:00,582 --> 00:52:01,678
Understand?

705
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:38,991
The president wanted to talk to you.
Is there something serious?

706
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:44,403
It's not serious, but…

707
00:52:45,298 --> 00:52:46,396
It's complicated.

708
00:52:48,734 --> 00:52:50,718
It's about my family structure,

709
00:52:50,718 --> 00:52:53,440
which I haven't agreed with.
I've wanted to revolutionize it,

710
00:52:55,977 --> 00:52:57,937
but it just came sooner than I thought.

711
00:52:59,047 --> 00:53:00,271
Revolutionize?

712
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:02,091
That sounds scary.

713
00:53:02,743 --> 00:53:04,953
Don't tell me, do you have tanks?

714
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,520
Someone like me doesn't have tanks.

715
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:12,772
I only have submarines.

716
00:53:16,286 --> 00:53:17,441
I'm fine, though.

717
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,243
It's something that
a great leader like me can handle.

718
00:53:22,651 --> 00:53:25,598
Yes, my boss is the best.

719
00:53:34,569 --> 00:53:37,491
If you don't have anything after work today,

720
00:53:37,491 --> 00:53:40,000
let's go home together. I'll give you a ride.

721
00:53:41,447 --> 00:53:44,449
Okay, let's go by submarine, okay?

722
00:53:50,878 --> 00:53:54,469
Sorry, is there a messenger
from the dry cleaner delivering clothes?

723
00:53:54,469 --> 00:53:55,846
Yes, there is.

724
00:53:57,841 --> 00:53:59,054
Thank you so much.

725
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:11,426
Finally got it cleaned.

726
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:14,989
It has never smelled this good before.

727
00:54:23,054 --> 00:54:24,602
He must be happy.

728
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:38,609
Here.

729
00:54:40,749 --> 00:54:41,781
You found it?

730
00:54:42,483 --> 00:54:43,483
Yeah.

731
00:54:44,196 --> 00:54:46,049
I took it and got it cleaned.

732
00:54:46,588 --> 00:54:49,568
It smells fresh,
like it just came out of the shop.

733
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:55,971
Oh, you really are my baby. My love.

734
00:54:55,971 --> 00:54:58,414
Finally, we get to meet again.

735
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:03,124
Thanks so much.

736
00:55:03,124 --> 00:55:04,130
Thank you!

737
00:55:30,847 --> 00:55:32,041
Thanks.

738
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:33,326
Well… I have to go now.

739
00:55:34,145 --> 00:55:36,380
Yeah, I have to go too.

740
00:55:42,202 --> 00:55:43,314
I need to go this way.

741
00:55:51,794 --> 00:55:54,635
You don't have to do all of this for me.

742
00:55:56,268 --> 00:55:58,142
I've noticed you've been stressed lately.

743
00:55:58,895 --> 00:56:00,978
So I'd like to give you
a foot massage with salt.

744
00:56:05,014 --> 00:56:06,860
Are you feeling a little better now?

745
00:56:08,686 --> 00:56:10,506
Don't worry about my father.

746
00:56:13,397 --> 00:56:14,675
I'm okay now.

747
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:17,035
What about you, Boss?

748
00:56:17,759 --> 00:56:19,670
Is everything okay with Tham?

749
00:56:21,723 --> 00:56:25,748
I've told everyone the truth
about what happened.

750
00:56:27,031 --> 00:56:29,225
At first, I thought I wouldn't be okay with it,

751
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,995
but after talking about it,

752
00:56:33,462 --> 00:56:35,059
I actually feel much better now.

753
00:56:37,677 --> 00:56:39,328
You made the right decision, Boss.

754
00:56:40,076 --> 00:56:42,182
The truth is the truth.

755
00:56:42,182 --> 00:56:43,764
If we feel something,

756
00:56:43,764 --> 00:56:46,366
we should speak up and let others know.

757
00:56:46,366 --> 00:56:47,713
We shouldn't keep it inside.

758
00:56:49,165 --> 00:56:51,523
People should be honest
with their own feelings.

759
00:57:05,937 --> 00:57:06,937
Then…

760
00:57:10,196 --> 00:57:13,014
Can I be honest with my feelings now?

761
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:15,370
What?

762
00:57:18,025 --> 00:57:19,555
Tonight, I want to be with you.

763
00:58:12,962 --> 00:58:15,971
Well, lately, there have been dating rumors.

764
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:18,355
And those people are having
some private moments in the office.

765
00:58:18,355 --> 00:58:20,524
At most, they'd just hug, kiss,
or something like that, right?

766
00:58:20,524 --> 00:58:21,739
- Oh!
- Wow!

767
00:58:21,739 --> 00:58:25,142
- Hugging and kissing. That's pretty bold!
- Yeah.

768
00:58:25,142 --> 00:58:27,166
Prim, our boss has a girlfriend!

769
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:28,911
Boss went out for dinner with a woman,

770
00:58:28,911 --> 00:58:30,477
and they were acting all sweet together.

771
00:58:30,477 --> 00:58:32,909
I'll give you some time to end things with her.

772
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,632
Anyway, that woman is not right for you.

773
00:58:35,632 --> 00:58:37,197
If you don't believe me,

774
00:58:37,197 --> 00:58:39,922
I'll let the second line
take over the business.
