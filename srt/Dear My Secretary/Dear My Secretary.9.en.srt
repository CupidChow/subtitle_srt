1
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:09,395
Isn't this the first event where the boss
and Jinny are showing up after their breakup?

2
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:11,623
Well, I just want to
get back together with Thee.

3
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:14,736
You know I'm hitting on you.
Why are you trying to pair me with Jinny?

4
00:01:14,736 --> 00:01:16,348
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

5
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:18,014
You two are a good match.

6
00:01:18,014 --> 00:01:20,354
I'm the one who's not worthy of you.

7
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:22,546
But I like you. I don't like Jinny.

8
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:26,410
Is this the one making you work nonstop all day
and won't let you resign?

9
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,522
And who are you?

10
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:29,744
Don't tell me this office has two bosses.

11
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:32,608
I'm Thee's older brother, not the boss.

12
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:35,180
I'm just here, trying to win her over.

13
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,653
Win her over?

14
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:40,017
Even if it never happened,
you'd still never get as far as I have, loser.

15
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,277
Now, you can answer my question, right?
Whether we can be together or not.

16
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:48,601
I'm sorry for the late response,
but here is my answer.

17
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:58,872
Good morning, Secretary Prim.

18
00:02:00,376 --> 00:02:02,616
I told you already,
you didn't have to pick me up.

19
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:05,452
Why are you at work so early today?

20
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:08,800
I couldn't sleep, so I came in early.

21
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,891
What happened to your lip?

22
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,029
A woman kissed me last night.

23
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:41,157
Boss!

24
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,270
Am I so handsome that you can't stand up?

25
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:13,159
Yes, you're so handsome I could almost faint.

26
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:19,866
But… could we not be so sweet right now?
I'm afraid someone might see us.

27
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:25,957
If you're concerned about saving face,
should we just get married?

28
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:29,900
I mean, I'm handsome, rich,
smart, and perfect in every way.

29
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:32,055
You need to marry me right away.

30
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,587
<i>♫ The moment of falling in love
Feels just like this ♫</i>

31
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:42,572
<i>♫ That split second when I saw you ♫</i>

32
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:46,403
<i>♫ The way you smiled, the way you blushed ♫</i>

33
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:49,938
<i>♫ It felt like the world slowed down ♫</i>

34
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,938
Let's get married.

35
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:02,002
Boss, please, get up!
You don't have to be so dramatic.

36
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:05,929
We've only been a couple
for less than 24 hours.

37
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,299
I'm just in a hurry!

38
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:08,904
If you're okay with it,

39
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:11,689
I'll ask my secretary
to book the hotel right away.

40
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:15,429
Oh, you want me to book the hotel?

41
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,959
Oh, right. My secretary and
my girlfriend are the same person now.

42
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:46,831
Have you apologized to your brother yet?

43
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:50,350
Hurry up and clear things up.

44
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:52,887
I don't want him overthinking it.

45
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:56,905
I already went there, Dad,

46
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:02,013
and I saw with my own eyes that
Thee wasn't overthinking at all.

47
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:05,130
He seems happy enough.

48
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,978
I don't think he even wants an apology from me.

49
00:05:09,783 --> 00:05:10,884
What kind of happiness?

50
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,348
To summarize,
our event will be held in the main hall.

51
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:48,278
As for the admission fee, it's 300 baht
for Thais, 1,000 baht for foreigners,

52
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:51,688
and a 50% discount for students.

53
00:05:51,688 --> 00:05:52,688
Wait a moment.

54
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:55,757
Kids can enter for free.

55
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,396
Isn't that a good idea?

56
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:03,237
It allows kids to absorb
great art from Thai artists.

57
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:30,597
Boss, I have a concern.

58
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:34,133
The artists we've invited all charge high fees.

59
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:38,476
No problem. Supporting Thai artists?
I'll pay whatever it takes.

60
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,246
That's amazing, Boss!

61
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,267
Fabulous… Absolutely fabulous!

62
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:51,986
That's it? If there's nothing else,
we'll close the meeting.

63
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:53,098
Thank you, everyone.

64
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:55,712
Perfect!

65
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:01,498
Perfect!

66
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:31,793
Prim!

67
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,561
Do you want to see something funny?

68
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:37,325
What is it?

69
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:38,698
Let me show you.

70
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,160
When is the meeting
with Singapore Airlines, Boss?

71
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,209
Friday, from 2 to 4 PM.

72
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,776
Here's another one! Watch this!

73
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:56,453
What's the exchange rate
for one US dollar today?

74
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:57,712
35.85 baht.

75
00:07:57,712 --> 00:07:58,758
What's the name of your dog?

76
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:00,727
Big Bang, Andromeda, Supernova, Sonic.

77
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:01,727
You see?

78
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,235
It's like this,

79
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:08,235
Thee is someone
whose brain never stops working,

80
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:12,083
not even when he's asleep or in sleep mode.
He can still respond like that.

81
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:18,340
But honestly, I haven't seen Thee

82
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,602
dozing off at work like this in a long time.

83
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,468
Based on this, I'd hypothesize that
there's something

84
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:38,230
making Thee feel really relaxed,
at ease, and happy.

85
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,619
But I don't know what caused it

86
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:44,041
or who might be involved.

87
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:48,222
Do you know, Secretary Prim?

88
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:51,824
I don't.

89
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:53,218
Don't know?

90
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,602
Laughing and laughing, huh?

91
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,917
- Director Pat?
- Yes?

92
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:19,284
Have you seen the scar
on the boss's ankle before?

93
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:20,619
You didn't seem surprised by it.

94
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:23,911
Oh, I've known about it
since we studied together in Boston.

95
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:30,700
And do you happen to know
how the boss got that scar?

96
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:37,100
Don't tell anyone. We're playing football.

97
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,380
He was tackled hard
and ended up splitting both of his legs.

98
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,340
Luckily, the doctor was able
to stitch them up in time.

99
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,420
- Really?
- Why did you believe me? Just kidding!

100
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,443
I really don't know.
I've asked him before, but he wouldn't tell me.

101
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,095
Yes, that's the truth.

102
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:55,817
Alright, I'll get going now.

103
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:13,223
<i>I got that scar
while playing football with my friends.</i>

104
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:15,920
<i>I was never kidnapped,</i>

105
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:19,775
<i>and I'm not the prince you're looking for.</i>

106
00:10:29,686 --> 00:10:30,686
What are you doing?

107
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:32,273
I'm photocopying.

108
00:10:32,857 --> 00:10:35,817
But what you're copying
isn't a document, is it?

109
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,832
Mind thinks that this morning,
you probably need coffee urgently.

110
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,820
Still asleep?

111
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:33,396
What are you doing?

112
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:39,262
Boss.

113
00:11:39,854 --> 00:11:42,796
Let go. Someone might walk in.

114
00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:46,279
Who's going to walk in?
You're the only one who can get close to me.

115
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:50,508
I was just coming in to check.

116
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:52,595
I don't care. You're going to be punished

117
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:55,493
for igniting the desires within me.

118
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:57,760
Desires? What desires?

119
00:11:58,508 --> 00:11:59,508
I just want to sleep.

120
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:01,314
Or do you want something else?

121
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:05,287
Boss, you're not speaking very clearly.

122
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:13,014
Even though my words aren't clear,
my heart is very clear.

123
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:18,089
Well…

124
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:20,739
Are you feeling unwell?

125
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,099
I've never seen you sleep so deeply before.

126
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,447
I feel relaxed.

127
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:28,700
Since last night, after you kissed me,

128
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,959
I haven't had any bad dreams.

129
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:34,439
People kiss to wake someone,
but I kiss you and you fell asleep?

130
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:38,299
Yes, because I feel happy, blissful,

131
00:12:39,246 --> 00:12:41,296
and I don't feel the pain of the past anymore.

132
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:54,866
What's on your mind?

133
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:00,533
Boss,

134
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:04,655
the prince that I've been looking for,

135
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:06,069
is it really Tham?

136
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:13,928
You already know the answer.
Why are you asking?

137
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:17,892
I just feel that…

138
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:22,282
you are the prince for me, not Tham.

139
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:41,850
Even if I'm not the prince for you, or if I am,

140
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:44,704
what does that matter?

141
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:49,656
If I'm not that prince,

142
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:52,493
will you change your mind and stop liking me?

143
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,043
No, I won't.

144
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:58,358
I will always like you

145
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:01,308
because you are the prince in my real life.

146
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:09,524
Then, I'll get back to work, prince.

147
00:14:14,464 --> 00:14:18,515
Don't be gone too long, okay?
I'll miss you, my princess.

148
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,526
- Boss!
- What?

149
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:25,742
Let me go!

150
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:59,793
<i>Today, I miss the prince again.</i>

151
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:06,051
<i>The prince loves to eat Bunga Puda sweets,</i>

152
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:08,721
<i>so he packed them in his bag.</i>

153
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:12,964
Did I like eating Bunga Puda sweets?

154
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,180
Yes, Pong.

155
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:25,559
Did someone ask to buy the novel
to turn it into a movie?

156
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:30,982
Where should we go for a date this afternoon?

157
00:15:30,982 --> 00:15:33,085
Let's have a meal together as lovers,

158
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:35,835
to celebrate the first day we've been together.

159
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:39,233
We're already celebrating just one day?

160
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:41,569
Of course! It's not just days.

161
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:44,656
Every moment spent with the one you love,
and who loves you back,

162
00:15:44,656 --> 00:15:47,992
should be appreciated and celebrated,
don't you think?

163
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,411
So, what do you want to eat?

164
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:54,996
Anything is fine,
but let's go to a special place.

165
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,498
Something with a nice atmosphere, and romantic.

166
00:15:58,498 --> 00:15:59,602
Got it!

167
00:15:59,602 --> 00:16:02,899
A restaurant we've never been to,
with a private room too.

168
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:05,245
I want to have a sweet time with my partner.

169
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:07,558
Got it!

170
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:09,391
Let's order wine to celebrate as well.

171
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:12,154
Sure, let's go with red wine.

172
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:14,076
Perfect!

173
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:17,895
Also, order flowers
to surprise my partner, something like…

174
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:23,324
<i>Did I just order my girlfriend
to order things to surprise herself?</i>

175
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:24,324
<i>What am I doing?</i>

176
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:25,962
<i>Is this right?</i>

177
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:28,407
<i>Are we partners or am I your secretary?</i>

178
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:34,588
Alright, I'm sorry.

179
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:35,709
I forgot.

180
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,040
You can choose the restaurant,
anywhere you want to eat.

181
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:41,839
Okay, if that's the case,

182
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:46,424
Rice with shrimp paste and mackerel?
I'd love that.

183
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:49,656
Alright, deal! Let's go to that place.

184
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:52,339
Wait,

185
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,185
there's something I'd like you to do.

186
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,971
So, how will you save my name in your phone?

187
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,795
Let me think about it for a moment.

188
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:24,363
Fah, when we get back to the office,

189
00:17:24,363 --> 00:17:25,864
can you update me on the meeting results?

190
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:26,981
Got it, Director!

191
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:33,406
Fuck!

192
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:36,751
- Fah.
- Yes?

193
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:37,882
Be a bunker for me first.

194
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:41,592
Oh, hello! Wait!

195
00:17:41,592 --> 00:17:43,726
Madam Ann, how did you get here?
It's been so long.

196
00:17:43,726 --> 00:17:46,185
How have you been?
Wow, that green shirt looks great today!

197
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:47,210
Move aside, You purple!

198
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:55,152
Why is he calling?

199
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:03,496
Boss Wee-Woo?

200
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:09,452
Your niece used to call me like this.

201
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:11,569
So what does it actually mean?

202
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:13,525
Well, it's…

203
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,902
Are you implying that
I'm dangerous and annoying?

204
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:17,746
No, it's not like that.

205
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:21,845
It means that if you need help,

206
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:24,190
I'll be alert and answer your call right away.

207
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,103
Because you're important,
and I need to take care of you.

208
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:30,779
Can't get out of this one, huh?

209
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:31,912
You're just making excuses.

210
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,809
But that's okay, I'll let it slide.

211
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:41,185
Try calling me and see
what tone I set for your contact.

212
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:50,771
<i>"My girlfriend is calling. I really have to
pick up because I love her so much."</i>

213
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:53,991
Boss!

214
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:56,509
If I call you during a meeting
with the executives?

215
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:57,509
What will happen then?

216
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:00,535
Oh, right, I didn't think of that.

217
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:06,311
No worries, everyone will know right away
that I have a girlfriend.

218
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,599
I'm running away from my wife, now.

219
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:41,992
I'm not a wife, I'm your ex-wife!

220
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:44,947
When are you going to
sign the divorce papers already!?

221
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:45,947
I won't sign!

222
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:48,728
Hey, you! Don't run away!

223
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:50,583
Oh, Fah!

224
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,405
- Hop on, Director!
- Okay.

225
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:55,320
Hey! Stop, I haven't gotten up yet!

226
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:59,172
Let's go!

227
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,060
Come back here, hey!

228
00:20:03,944 --> 00:20:05,062
Dang!

229
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:16,779
Water, sir.

230
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,020
Wait a moment.

231
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:22,995
Here you go.

232
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:28,612
Alright… wait…

233
00:20:32,218 --> 00:20:33,218
Fork and spoon, please.

234
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:39,085
Honestly,
you don't have to do everything for me.

235
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,129
We're having dinner as a couple,
not as a boss and secretary.

236
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:47,197
So I should be the one taking care of you more.

237
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,730
I lost myself for a bit.

238
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:53,908
Just try it.

239
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:57,459
Shrimp paste chili dip with fried mackerel
at this place is really good.

240
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:04,225
Thank you.

241
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:13,619
How is it?

242
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:16,112
I've never had food this delicious before.

243
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,266
I guess I'll have to order it
into the mall next time.

244
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:24,563
Do you know, to enjoy it properly,
you should eat with your hands?

245
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:28,226
Look, it has to be like this.

246
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,085
Try it!

247
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,298
Like this?

248
00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:51,961
Does the bone get stuck in your throat?

249
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,751
Love gets stuck in my throat.

250
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:58,044
Boss!

251
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,606
But why does the director
avoid Madam Ann like that?

252
00:22:08,765 --> 00:22:10,653
I haven't signed
the divorce papers for Ann yet.

253
00:22:11,326 --> 00:22:14,242
So, she keeps bothering me
to get everything sorted out.

254
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,264
Then why don't you just
sign it and get it over with?

255
00:22:19,264 --> 00:22:20,754
You've been living separately
for so long already.

256
00:22:20,754 --> 00:22:23,157
Yes, I've been living apart
from her for a long time, I know.

257
00:22:25,307 --> 00:22:29,079
But signing the divorce
papers feels like the final signal

258
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:32,749
that it's really over between me and her.

259
00:22:34,832 --> 00:22:36,436
I just can't bring myself to do it, Fah.

260
00:22:48,206 --> 00:22:49,206
It's so bitter…

261
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,020
Roti?

262
00:22:51,858 --> 00:22:52,858
My life.

263
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,705
I don't want to work.

264
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:00,727
Let's skip work
and go on a date instead, shall we?

265
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:04,427
Normally, you never act so carelessly.

266
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:06,510
Don't let having a girlfriend
make you lose your way.

267
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,759
Roger that!

268
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:15,699
Oh! Dad!

269
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,762
Are you coming to the office today?

270
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:20,504
Just came to check some documents.

271
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:23,081
Did you go for lunch?

272
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:27,574
Yes, Prim took me to eat
shrimp paste chili dip with fried mackerel.

273
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,574
It was really good, Dad.

274
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:30,790
Next time, I'll take you too.

275
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:33,999
It's okay.

276
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:38,918
Thee, if you have time,

277
00:23:39,712 --> 00:23:43,135
it might be better
to have dinner at home with your mom.

278
00:23:59,932 --> 00:24:00,932
Boss…

279
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:07,946
The president and your mom
still don't know about us…

280
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,009
I haven't told them yet,

281
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:12,284
but I think I'll tell them soon.

282
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:20,534
Don't worry.

283
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:22,858
My parents know you well.

284
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:24,972
I don't think they'll have any issues.

285
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:30,841
But even if they do,
no one can stop the love I have for you.

286
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,150
Do you understand?

287
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:35,693
Yes.

288
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:38,299
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

289
00:24:46,424 --> 00:24:47,593
Go investigate about Thee,

290
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,807
keep track of where he
goes and what he does,

291
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:51,807
and report back to me.

292
00:24:52,837 --> 00:24:55,387
I want to know
if Thee and Prim are really dating.

293
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:05,325
Take this batch, it's not needed for sure.

294
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:06,350
- This one?
- Yeah.

295
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,718
- Clear it all out. Go, go.
- All of these?

296
00:25:07,718 --> 00:25:08,561
That's right.

297
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:10,292
- It shouldn't be heavy.
- Oh, no.

298
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,685
- Slowly, slowly.
- Alright, carry it out and come back.

299
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:14,180
- No slacking off, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

300
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,432
Okay, go now.

301
00:25:17,952 --> 00:25:19,405
What are you guys doing?

302
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:22,100
Oh, we're just checking brochures

303
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,416
and old advertising materials
that we're not using anymore.

304
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:26,000
We're planning to throw them away.

305
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,004
Oh…

306
00:25:27,004 --> 00:25:29,060
Then we'll help you.

307
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,645
Oh, great! Thank you!

308
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,371
- This box too, right?
- Yes, definitely.

309
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:34,946
- Go ahead.
- Can you handle it, Prim?

310
00:25:34,946 --> 00:25:36,298
Yeah, yeah, it's not too heavy.

311
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:37,848
- I can lift it, Mind.
- Oh, okay.

312
00:25:38,518 --> 00:25:39,518
Let me help.

313
00:25:42,355 --> 00:25:43,859
It's okay, sir.

314
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:45,626
It's fine. I want to help. Let me help.

315
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:47,293
- Bring it over.
- Oh… I think it's okay, Boss.

316
00:25:47,293 --> 00:25:48,921
- I'll do it myself.
- Let me help.

317
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:51,634
- Bring it here.
- I think it's okay, sir, don't bother.

318
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,634
I want to do it. Let me help. Come on.

319
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,601
Okay, if you insist.

320
00:26:00,301 --> 00:26:01,749
Great!

321
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:02,911
Where should I move this box?

322
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:06,448
Just take it outside to throw away.

323
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,079
Okay.

324
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:18,771
This box too, right?
Let me carry this one myself.

325
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,627
Seriously?

326
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,650
- Let me tell you something!
- Yeah?

327
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,421
I've never seen anything like this before.

328
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:32,280
I think something's definitely up with boss.

329
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,389
I mean, he can actually carry stuff by himself?

330
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:35,448
- Right?
- Usually, it's just…

331
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:38,367
"Secretary Prim! Secretary Prim!" all the time.

332
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:42,140
Honestly, I think
the boss's been acting weird lately.

333
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,421
Like, he's unusually kind and overly happy.

334
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:49,164
Hey, what's wrong with your eyes?
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

335
00:26:50,473 --> 00:26:51,473
What?

336
00:26:57,968 --> 00:27:01,413
Oh no, I deserve to die, master!

337
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,224
Boss, please don't fire me!

338
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:05,071
I was just talking nonsense!

339
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:07,705
It's okay.

340
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:10,169
I'll take it as a compliment, alright?

341
00:27:11,014 --> 00:27:13,014
Tea, anyone? I'll make some for everyone.

342
00:27:13,014 --> 00:27:14,699
- Oh, no need!
- No need at all!

343
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,557
We're good, thanks! So full.

344
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:17,763
I'm so full, Boss.

345
00:27:28,275 --> 00:27:29,737
Why didn't you tell me?

346
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:32,576
My eyes are about to pop out of their sockets,

347
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:33,758
and you're still clueless.

348
00:27:33,758 --> 00:27:36,726
Gosh, I almost got fired
because of you! Seriously!

349
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:38,117
It's all your fault! How can you be like this?

350
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:39,438
What if I get fired, huh?

351
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:57,162
What's going on?

352
00:28:01,658 --> 00:28:02,662
Where are you going?

353
00:28:03,658 --> 00:28:05,199
I'm going to make some copies for you.

354
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,317
I'll handle it myself.

355
00:28:08,227 --> 00:28:11,041
Meanwhile, take this tea I made

356
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,817
and let me know if it tastes good.

357
00:28:54,552 --> 00:28:55,678
What are you all looking at?

358
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:02,376
He's making copies himself!

359
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,085
And binding them too!

360
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:07,995
I swear, the world must be ending!

361
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:12,235
Are you all just going to stand here and watch?
Aren't you going to help him?

362
00:29:13,132 --> 00:29:14,630
- Yeah, you're right.
- Let's go.

363
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,479
- Boss.
- Sir?

364
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:20,106
Would you like us to help you with that?

365
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,078
No need, I've already finished everything.

366
00:29:27,078 --> 00:29:29,433
Double-sided copies, bound, and all set.

367
00:29:30,948 --> 00:29:31,948
Perfect!

368
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:38,310
Actually, I can do everything myself, huh?

369
00:29:39,104 --> 00:29:40,401
No need to hire anyone at all.

370
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:43,263
Ridiculous!

371
00:29:46,427 --> 00:29:48,780
Are we going to lose our jobs? Are we? Huh?

372
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,537
Are we?

373
00:29:51,805 --> 00:29:54,479
Boss, do you realize your actions

374
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:57,867
are making everyone in the office
think you're planning to lay us off?

375
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:00,139
Everyone's losing their minds right now!

376
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:02,482
Really?

377
00:30:05,822 --> 00:30:07,276
What's going on?

378
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:10,162
What's gotten into our boss?
Why is he acting so strange all of a sudden?

379
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:12,249
If you know anything, tell me right now!

380
00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:14,241
He's carrying things himself now.

381
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:15,327
Making his tea himself.

382
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:16,847
He is even doing his own photocopying!

383
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:19,931
Could it be that the boss
is under some kind of black magic?

384
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:21,677
Some strong black magic?

385
00:30:21,677 --> 00:30:23,091
Oh, come on!

386
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:25,851
What kind of black magic would
make someone this hardworking!

387
00:30:25,851 --> 00:30:26,851
True!

388
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:31,050
Hey, hey! You're acting all fidgety now.

389
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,005
Those shifty eyes of yours… You know something?

390
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:34,030
Spit it out now!

391
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,051
I don't know anything!

392
00:30:36,697 --> 00:30:38,732
Hey, your voice is trembling!

393
00:30:38,732 --> 00:30:41,014
- Exactly!
- Speak up! Don't keep secrets!

394
00:30:41,014 --> 00:30:43,730
What secret? There is none, really.

395
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:45,573
What?

396
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:49,200
Or is it that
the boss has plans to reduce the staff?

397
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:53,919
Well, I don't think that's it.

398
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,914
Boss, please let me do it myself.

399
00:30:55,914 --> 00:30:57,475
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

400
00:30:59,808 --> 00:31:00,808
What's that?

401
00:31:01,768 --> 00:31:03,330
Well, how is it, how?

402
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,440
- Yong!
- Huh?

403
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,104
What does the boss need the ladder for?

404
00:31:06,104 --> 00:31:09,387
Well, the lightbulb is broken,
so the boss is going to replace it himself.

405
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,886
Changing the lightbulb himself?

406
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:15,659
He is even changing the lightbulb himself?

407
00:31:16,696 --> 00:31:18,136
Oh crap!

408
00:31:18,136 --> 00:31:22,482
I think the boss
really has plans to reduce staff.

409
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:26,357
He's definitely
putting pressure on us indirectly.

410
00:31:27,305 --> 00:31:30,579
But I just don't want you
to work too hard, Prim.

411
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:33,497
Anything I can do myself, I want to do.

412
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:35,390
But that's my job, though.

413
00:31:36,113 --> 00:31:38,373
I think we need to understand

414
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:40,553
and separate work from personal matters first.

415
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:44,053
But I really want to do this for you.

416
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:47,630
Even though I'm a bad boss,

417
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,666
I can be a good boyfriend.

418
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:55,231
Please let me be a good boyfriend. Please.

419
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:56,553
Please.

420
00:31:56,553 --> 00:31:58,033
Please, please, please.

421
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,279
No need to act like that.

422
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:03,289
You can't just blink your eyes like that.

423
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:05,688
Puffing your cheeks, too.

424
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:09,450
Please don't act cute.

425
00:32:11,488 --> 00:32:12,488
Alright,

426
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:17,200
but you must only pamper Prim outside of work.

427
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,140
At work, you have to act normal.

428
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,255
And what about this elevator hallway?

429
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:29,226
Does this count as inside
or outside the office?

430
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,380
Inside.

431
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,512
How about the parking lot?

432
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:36,304
That's inside too.

433
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:39,741
How about we say within a one-kilometer radius
from the company, is that okay?

434
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,813
Can we make it 500 meters?
I'm worried I won't be able to control myself.

435
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:46,897
Alright, that's fine.

436
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:49,038
But if you make the first move,
I won't count it.

437
00:32:52,255 --> 00:32:56,193
Okay, I'll try to do what you said.

438
00:32:56,193 --> 00:33:00,168
But for now, can I have a goodbye kiss?

439
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:02,634
No, you can't.

440
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:05,728
Well…

441
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,621
I have something to tell you.

442
00:33:08,699 --> 00:33:09,699
What is it?

443
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:11,366
It's about Jinny.

444
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,647
Thee.

445
00:33:18,446 --> 00:33:20,233
Jinny, how did you get in here?

446
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,715
Jinny can go anywhere,

447
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:26,496
but I won't bother you anymore, Thee.

448
00:33:27,975 --> 00:33:30,717
I already know that my love is one-sided.

449
00:33:31,397 --> 00:33:33,245
I think it's best if I step back with dignity.

450
00:33:35,591 --> 00:33:37,417
Don't come out yet, continue pooping please.

451
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:47,999
I'm sorry for only being able
to be like a brother to you.

452
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:51,542
It's okay,
but Jinny will give news to the press.

453
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:55,586
Can I tell them that
you're the one who left me?

454
00:33:57,289 --> 00:34:01,779
Sure, do whatever makes you feel better.
I'll take on the bad guy role.

455
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:04,296
Thank you, Thee.

456
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:09,196
But if you change your mind,
you can always message me online.

457
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:11,085
For now, I'll be on Tinder and waiting for you.

458
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,002
Once you're done, you can come out.

459
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,038
Do you want to wash your hands first?

460
00:34:31,258 --> 00:34:33,355
Is this going to be okay?

461
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,917
Anything that keeps me
from being involved with other people,

462
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:39,302
but only focusing on my one true love,

463
00:34:39,936 --> 00:34:41,142
that's perfectly fine.

464
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:52,757
<i>Right now,
Thee and I are good friends to each other.</i>

465
00:34:53,974 --> 00:34:55,699
<i>They're good friends now?</i>

466
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,539
Is there a third party involved?

467
00:34:57,539 --> 00:34:59,995
<i>That's right, is there a third party involved?</i>

468
00:35:00,575 --> 00:35:03,347
No, not right now.

469
00:35:03,347 --> 00:35:05,077
<i>- There isn't one?
- Oh.</i>

470
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:07,247
But even if there were,

471
00:35:07,868 --> 00:35:12,118
I would still bless them on their
new relationship.

472
00:35:13,114 --> 00:35:14,831
<i>So kind-hearted, such a beautiful spirit.</i>

473
00:35:16,545 --> 00:35:19,791
<i>Jinny, please! No! Don't! Stop!</i>

474
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:28,521
I feel so sorry for Jinny.

475
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:32,034
Why is our boss doing this?

476
00:35:36,606 --> 00:35:40,209
Jinny, Fah love you.

477
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:44,433
Boss is unavailable
for interviews right now. I'm so sorry.

478
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,234
We haven't been able to reach you,
so please accept my apologies.

479
00:35:47,234 --> 00:35:48,700
Boss is currently abroad.

480
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,396
- Sorry about that.
- That's all for now.

481
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,188
The situation with Boss
and Jinny is really serious, right, Prim?

482
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,092
Documents from the director
are here for Boss to look at.

483
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:08,275
Fah, are you okay?

484
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:11,916
Secretary Prim,

485
00:36:13,343 --> 00:36:14,343
about that day…

486
00:36:15,899 --> 00:36:17,489
Boss, you're so mean.

487
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:18,580
What a cold-hearted man!

488
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,744
What's wrong with Fah?

489
00:36:29,097 --> 00:36:30,097
Oh.

490
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:34,037
Fa is a fan of Jinny. She's probably hurt.

491
00:36:34,798 --> 00:36:38,100
You should have explained things to others
so they would understand.

492
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,899
I don't want to.
If I had to explain everything to the world,

493
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,060
I'd be exhausted.

494
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:56,491
Do you know about Boss and Jinny yet?

495
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,983
I think they broke up because
he's been hanging out with his secretary.

496
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:06,964
Lately, they've been together all the time,

497
00:37:06,964 --> 00:37:10,931
calling her "Secretary dear, secretary babe."

498
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,154
Boss hired the secretary,

499
00:37:18,992 --> 00:37:21,580
so of course he calls for her.
What else would you expect?

500
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,200
Should he call for your fathers instead, huh?

501
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,865
And anyway, who's breaking up with whom,
being nice to whom,

502
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:28,380
or getting back together with whom?

503
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,554
How is that any of your business?

504
00:37:30,554 --> 00:37:33,360
Why does it concern you so much?
I really want to know.

505
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,001
You work at the same company,
taking his salary,

506
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:39,349
but then you gossip about him behind his back.

507
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:40,881
Should I slap you to teach a lesson instead?

508
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:41,889
- Do you want that, huh?
- No, we don't want it.

509
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:44,469
- Do you want that? Try me!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

510
00:37:52,435 --> 00:37:53,435
Here.

511
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:57,909
What's this?

512
00:37:58,599 --> 00:37:59,599
A basil plant.

513
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:02,015
- A basil plant?
- Yep.

514
00:38:03,182 --> 00:38:04,482
Why are you giving me this?

515
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:07,763
Do you know how much it is per handful?

516
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:09,063
It's five baht.

517
00:38:10,006 --> 00:38:12,579
If you buy it every day for a year,

518
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:15,532
it adds up to 1,825 baht.

519
00:38:15,532 --> 00:38:19,435
In a hundred years, that's 182,500 baht.

520
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:20,921
You save so much.

521
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:26,230
But people probably won't eat only basil
for a hundred years, right?

522
00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:28,427
But I want to give it to you

523
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:32,026
as a housewarming gift from your senior.

524
00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:36,853
And sorry again for taking your air purifier.

525
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,716
Thank you, but…

526
00:38:42,716 --> 00:38:46,502
if I take care of it myself,
it will definitely die.

527
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:48,710
And also, I can't cook.

528
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,710
What?

529
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:53,209
Take it.

530
00:38:53,823 --> 00:38:54,823
Fine.

531
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:57,947
Wait here, I'll be back.

532
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:00,289
Huh?

533
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:22,716
If you cook this basil dish yourself,
it only costs 20 baht.

534
00:39:23,555 --> 00:39:25,763
What? This is for me?

535
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:27,279
Yes.

536
00:39:28,072 --> 00:39:29,691
Oh, alright.

537
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:34,337
Take care of your body,
eat good and healthy food.

538
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:39,503
It looks delicious, doesn't it?

539
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:46,224
Oh, I'm checking if there's no fried egg?

540
00:39:47,086 --> 00:39:50,406
What fried egg? Eggs are expensive right now,

541
00:39:50,406 --> 00:39:51,806
so let's skip the egg for now.

542
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:56,111
But you said to eat something healthy,
and eggs are healthy--

543
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:57,311
But they're expensive.

544
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:02,983
Let's forget about the fried egg for now.
Listen to this first.

545
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:06,995
This is a basil stir-fry recipe.

546
00:40:06,995 --> 00:40:09,359
If you follow it,
it will definitely be delicious.

547
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:13,285
And this is an instruction for growing basil.

548
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,471
If you follow it, your plant might not die.

549
00:40:16,452 --> 00:40:21,756
Do you know what is the best fertilizer
to make your basil grow fast?

550
00:40:22,636 --> 00:40:23,636
What?

551
00:40:27,534 --> 00:40:30,731
The best fertilizer for basil is music.

552
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:32,753
Huh?

553
00:40:32,753 --> 00:40:34,553
You have to sing to the plant.

554
00:40:36,237 --> 00:40:37,237
Like this.

555
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:42,431
<i>♪ Oh little basil, grow up ♪</i>

556
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:45,906
<i>♪ Oh little basil, grow up ♪</i>

557
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:51,872
<i>♪ Beautiful basil blooms, oh, oh… ♪</i>

558
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:57,366
<i>♪ Oh little basil, grow up ♪</i>

559
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,380
Like this.

560
00:41:01,482 --> 00:41:02,915
Listen and memorize it.

561
00:41:03,646 --> 00:41:04,937
Then sing it to your plant.

562
00:41:05,824 --> 00:41:06,824
Can you sing?

563
00:41:08,854 --> 00:41:12,859
<i>Should I hate a guy like this
or feel good about him?</i>

564
00:41:14,587 --> 00:41:16,246
The plan of being a good guy worked,

565
00:41:16,246 --> 00:41:17,859
I got something tasty to keep her mouth shut.

566
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:19,871
She probably won't tell anyone
about my secret now.

567
00:41:20,885 --> 00:41:22,550
Come on, try singing for me.

568
00:41:23,693 --> 00:41:25,191
<i>♪ Oh little basil… ♪</i>

569
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,376
- Ah, no. Oh.
- Oh.

570
00:41:27,376 --> 00:41:29,259
<i>♪ Oh little basil, grow up ♪</i>

571
00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:30,049
One more time.

572
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:33,362
<i>♪ Oh little basil, grow up ♪</i>

573
00:41:33,362 --> 00:41:34,640
Your "grow" is wrong. Start over.

574
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,770
<i>♪ Oh little basil, grow up ♪</i>

575
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,703
Sing "grow" again. Come on!

576
00:41:39,703 --> 00:41:42,556
<i>♪ Oh little basil, grow up ♪</i>

577
00:41:42,556 --> 00:41:45,006
You're singing in the wrong key!
Look, the leaves are wilting!

578
00:41:53,098 --> 00:41:54,098
Let me try.

579
00:42:12,871 --> 00:42:13,871
Here.

580
00:42:35,412 --> 00:42:39,499
Prim, are you there?
Open the door, quickly. It's me.

581
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,888
Is your sister here?

582
00:42:43,217 --> 00:42:46,201
Great, I'll officially introduce myself
to your sister then.

583
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:48,912
Wait, wait a second, Boss.

584
00:42:49,707 --> 00:42:51,254
Well, I'm not ready yet.

585
00:42:51,931 --> 00:42:52,935
Why?

586
00:42:52,935 --> 00:42:55,306
I think maybe
you should find a place to hide for now.

587
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:56,958
No need.

588
00:42:58,311 --> 00:42:59,313
Prim!

589
00:42:59,313 --> 00:43:01,078
- Open the door!
- Boss, come here!

590
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,325
- Where to?
- Boss, come on. Hide quickly.

591
00:43:04,325 --> 00:43:06,475
Go fast, come on.

592
00:43:06,475 --> 00:43:08,376
You should hide in the bathroom for now.

593
00:43:08,376 --> 00:43:09,576
In the bathroom?

594
00:43:10,398 --> 00:43:14,550
Secretary Prim,
I am the Boss of the Theeranont Group.

595
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,101
But now, you are just Prim's boyfriend.

596
00:43:17,101 --> 00:43:18,339
- You should stay here for now.
- Prim!

597
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:20,370
- Don't make a sound. Stay quiet.
- Prim, are you there?

598
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,396
- Hey--
- Don't do anything, okay?

599
00:43:27,383 --> 00:43:29,893
So slow, have you been pooping?

600
00:43:29,893 --> 00:43:30,893
Yes.

601
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,921
Here, I bought crab fried rice for you.

602
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:36,399
Go get some plates and bowls.
Come on, let's eat together.

603
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:46,531
Oh, one bowl, two pairs of chopsticks,
two glasses of water…

604
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,742
Who's eating with you?

605
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:52,003
Is it your future brother-in-law?

606
00:43:52,935 --> 00:43:56,681
Well, the boss came to discuss work,
then he left after finishing.

607
00:43:56,681 --> 00:44:00,054
Oh, this late at night,
and he's making you work overtime again?

608
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,874
I could report this
to the labor department, you know.

609
00:44:01,874 --> 00:44:02,889
He's your boss after all.

610
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:05,458
Why is he eating at the employee's house,
instead of buying good food

611
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:06,912
like sushi or steak,

612
00:44:06,912 --> 00:44:10,522
But he's eating just this?
Such a cheap rich person.

613
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,685
Well, Prim wanted to eat like this.

614
00:44:14,939 --> 00:44:17,301
What about the news
about him breaking up with that actress?

615
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:20,359
Oh, he broke up with her to be with Prim

616
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:22,177
so that she'd feel better.

617
00:44:22,177 --> 00:44:23,562
Yikes, does that mean

618
00:44:23,562 --> 00:44:25,016
he was dating both of you at the same time?

619
00:44:25,016 --> 00:44:27,814
How would I know
if he's hiding someone else at home?

620
00:44:27,814 --> 00:44:29,713
Or maybe he's keeping you as his mistress?

621
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:32,061
Are you breathing
through your fat layer or something?

622
00:44:32,061 --> 00:44:34,020
Yes, no, it's not like that, Pear.

623
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,161
Don't argue, put your hands together!

624
00:44:37,797 --> 00:44:39,477
Which lecture is it going to be this time?

625
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:42,536
Listen! I told you before, right?

626
00:44:42,536 --> 00:44:44,785
That you and him are not a good match.

627
00:44:44,785 --> 00:44:48,767
No matter how much your boss loves you,
his parents won't accept you.

628
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,902
One day, if he points
his finger at you and says

629
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:53,613
"Get out of here, Secretary Prim.

630
00:44:53,613 --> 00:44:54,901
Don't get involved with my son!"

631
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,787
And then throws water on your head,
what will you do, huh?

632
00:44:58,477 --> 00:45:00,334
Have you been watching too many dramas?

633
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:01,444
Hey!

634
00:45:06,202 --> 00:45:07,595
Hey, where are you going?

635
00:45:08,253 --> 00:45:09,253
To the bathroom.

636
00:45:10,886 --> 00:45:12,242
You can't go in the bathroom now.

637
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,409
Well… the bathroom has a house gecko.

638
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:17,509
That's not so bad.

639
00:45:18,796 --> 00:45:20,436
And there's a cockroach.

640
00:45:20,436 --> 00:45:21,449
I'm not scared.

641
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:22,662
And there's a tokay gecko.

642
00:45:22,662 --> 00:45:23,696
What?

643
00:45:23,696 --> 00:45:25,270
A tokay gecko in this room?

644
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,461
Let me know when you get home.

645
00:45:41,461 --> 00:45:42,829
Yeah, you too.

646
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:44,692
Don't forget to bring someone
to help catch the gecko.

647
00:45:44,692 --> 00:45:46,133
What a crazy night!

648
00:45:48,263 --> 00:45:51,818
A gecko in the room has to be handsome,
rich, and wear a suit, right?

649
00:45:54,397 --> 00:45:56,383
Are we going to
talk about geckos for much longer?

650
00:45:57,258 --> 00:45:59,957
Let's go home, Ploen is waiting.

651
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:16,175
Pear and Pround have already gone back.

652
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:21,900
What are you laughing at?

653
00:46:22,782 --> 00:46:27,696
I just realized that
you can mimic a tokay gecko really well.

654
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:32,577
Don't laugh, my heart is shattered.

655
00:46:32,577 --> 00:46:35,113
Does your older sister think of me like that?

656
00:46:36,123 --> 00:46:37,655
Don't take it personally,

657
00:46:38,249 --> 00:46:42,062
Pear hasn't seen
the cute side of you like I have.

658
00:46:42,062 --> 00:46:44,817
If she did, she'd definitely like you.

659
00:46:45,948 --> 00:46:47,266
Really?

660
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:48,266
Sure.

661
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:50,520
You're not joking with me, right?

662
00:46:55,224 --> 00:46:58,956
Did… did you just make that sound yourself?

663
00:47:01,091 --> 00:47:02,091
No.

664
00:47:03,996 --> 00:47:05,482
Then let's get out of here.

665
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:33,152
Hello, Tham.

666
00:47:33,152 --> 00:47:34,152
<i>Hello, Prim.</i>

667
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:37,277
I was going to invite you
to the press conference

668
00:47:37,277 --> 00:47:39,330
for the movie based on my novel.

669
00:47:40,136 --> 00:47:45,546
Oh, you're inviting me to the press conference
for the movie based on your novel, right?

670
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:47,567
Are you free?

671
00:47:52,385 --> 00:47:53,385
Sure.

672
00:47:53,998 --> 00:47:54,998
Then see you there.

673
00:48:00,486 --> 00:48:02,001
Is it okay with you?

674
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:05,138
Of course, because…

675
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,220
I'm generous enough.

676
00:48:14,852 --> 00:48:19,807
When I meet Tham, I will tell him how I feel,

677
00:48:19,807 --> 00:48:21,571
so he can finally move on from me.

678
00:48:23,386 --> 00:48:25,630
What feelings?

679
00:48:26,675 --> 00:48:28,769
That I don't like him because…

680
00:48:29,383 --> 00:48:31,060
I already have someone I like.

681
00:48:35,294 --> 00:48:36,294
Who is it?

682
00:48:38,753 --> 00:48:39,753
I'm not telling you.

683
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:47,666
Then you have to tell him
how much the person you like

684
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:50,909
is handsome, kind, and perfect.

685
00:48:52,812 --> 00:48:53,944
Or should I tell him myself?

686
00:48:53,944 --> 00:48:56,340
Because my mom called and
forced me to go to this event too.

687
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,806
Oh, no need. I'll tell him myself.

688
00:49:06,966 --> 00:49:08,217
What are you looking at, Boss?

689
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,801
I'm checking if anyone is around.

690
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,424
If no one is here, I can…

691
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,053
I learned this from Pat, you know.
Pat taught me this.

692
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:37,002
You want more?

693
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:39,202
That's enough.

694
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:53,990
Oh, Prim.

695
00:49:56,277 --> 00:49:57,337
Hot chocolate.

696
00:50:05,717 --> 00:50:08,424
Congratulations.
I'll be looking forward to the movie.

697
00:50:09,212 --> 00:50:11,698
You remembered that I like dark hot chocolate?

698
00:50:12,232 --> 00:50:15,217
I always remember
the details of the people I contact.

699
00:50:15,217 --> 00:50:16,970
It's the nature of being a secretary.

700
00:50:19,692 --> 00:50:21,244
Is there anything I can help you with?

701
00:50:23,373 --> 00:50:25,732
Is this also part of being a secretary?

702
00:50:28,911 --> 00:50:32,471
If that's the case,
could you give me some encouragement?

703
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:37,000
Don't worry, Tham. You can do it.

704
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,799
There are a lot of people here today
to support you,

705
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:41,812
Mrs. Chonlada and Thee are here too.

706
00:50:51,622 --> 00:50:56,152
As the author of the book,
Tham, or as we know him well as Morpheus,

707
00:50:56,152 --> 00:50:58,396
how do you feel about next year

708
00:50:58,396 --> 00:51:03,283
when the words on paper are going to
become characters in a movie?

709
00:51:04,153 --> 00:51:06,876
It feels like a dream, a very good dream.

710
00:51:08,377 --> 00:51:12,738
I'm so happy to see Tham looking bright

711
00:51:12,738 --> 00:51:16,911
and opening up more and more
in front of others.

712
00:51:19,115 --> 00:51:24,637
What about the Thai version of your book,
"Two of Us", which is called "Rawangraosong"?

713
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:29,758
Does your love story appear in it, Tham?

714
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,915
Oh, this is embarrassing,

715
00:51:39,706 --> 00:51:40,908
but yes, there is.

716
00:51:40,908 --> 00:51:43,705
Really? Do we want to know?

717
00:51:43,705 --> 00:51:46,391
- We want to know!
- We do!

718
00:51:47,298 --> 00:51:50,452
So many people want to know!
Can you share it with us?

719
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:06,929
Well, it's something
I don't want to talk about,

720
00:52:10,063 --> 00:52:11,849
Actually, when I was a kid…

721
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:13,841
No way.

722
00:52:14,436 --> 00:52:16,057
I was kidnapped.

723
00:52:16,057 --> 00:52:18,472
- What?
- Is that true?

724
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:26,265
In the abandoned house,
where I was kept captive,

725
00:52:26,265 --> 00:52:29,818
I found another girl in that house,
who was also kidnapped.

726
00:52:32,293 --> 00:52:36,986
I was tied up, and everything was really scary.

727
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,121
But I felt good that she was there with me.

728
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:47,067
And I don't even remember
how I managed to escape.

729
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:51,240
Then what happened to the girl?
What happened next?

730
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:56,314
I didn't see her again for a long time,
but eventually, I did meet her again.

731
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:05,382
I realized that our story is,
in fact, about my first love.

732
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:13,647
I wanted to confess my love to her
and make her love me back.

733
00:53:59,134 --> 00:54:00,134
Prim.

734
00:54:02,844 --> 00:54:04,787
Are you free to talk with me for a bit?

735
00:54:27,505 --> 00:54:28,793
What I said…

736
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:32,668
I didn't mean for it to be news
or for anyone to pay attention to it.

737
00:54:33,746 --> 00:54:37,760
I just wanted you to know how I feel.

738
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,811
I'm sorry if it made you uncomfortable.

739
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:53,681
I understand how you feel, Tham.

740
00:54:55,262 --> 00:54:56,872
But for me…

741
00:54:58,225 --> 00:55:00,051
Even though you might
be the prince I've been looking for

742
00:55:00,051 --> 00:55:01,437
and wanted to meet all this time.

743
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,509
The reason I wanted to meet you

744
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:07,900
isn't that I like you
or because you're my first love.

745
00:55:10,038 --> 00:55:11,725
I just want to thank you

746
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:16,702
for protecting and looking after me that day.

747
00:55:23,966 --> 00:55:25,106
I'm sorry.

748
00:55:26,926 --> 00:55:29,682
I don't think I can return your feelings.

749
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:33,209
Is it because of Thee?

750
00:55:35,385 --> 00:55:36,385
Huh?

751
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,047
Do you know what Thee is like?

752
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,437
He made me suffer my whole life
because of what happened that day,

753
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:49,178
It's made me run away from everyone.

754
00:55:51,899 --> 00:55:53,443
Can we stop talking about this now?

755
00:56:02,322 --> 00:56:04,605
You keep repeating the same thing,
aren't you tired of it?

756
00:56:05,912 --> 00:56:08,473
Tired? Of course you'd say that.

757
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:10,858
You can't remember anything.

758
00:56:11,405 --> 00:56:13,693
But I have to live with this pain
for the rest of my life.

759
00:56:15,767 --> 00:56:17,908
You think you're the only one who's in pain?

760
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,649
Never mind.

761
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:28,491
From now on, you're not allowed to
talk about this with Prim anymore.

762
00:56:29,751 --> 00:56:31,190
No, actually,

763
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:32,863
just don't see Prim ever again.

764
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,600
Let's go.

765
00:56:53,432 --> 00:56:55,885
Please don't be angry at Tham, Boss.

766
00:56:56,525 --> 00:56:58,258
I think he's pitiful.

767
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,680
Besides, he didn't steal my heart like you did.

768
00:57:04,684 --> 00:57:06,944
If you say that, I guess I can forgive him,

769
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:09,706
but I have to apologize to you as well.

770
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:12,631
For putting you
in such an uncomfortable situation.

771
00:57:14,647 --> 00:57:15,955
It was very uncomfortable…

772
00:57:17,514 --> 00:57:20,314
Then how about I take you somewhere
where you won't feel uncomfortable?

773
00:57:20,816 --> 00:57:21,816
Where is that?

774
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:30,819
The view is superb, sir.

775
00:58:31,846 --> 00:58:35,649
Right, do you know that
this is my secret oasis?

776
00:58:56,692 --> 00:58:57,692
Thank you.

777
00:58:59,705 --> 00:59:03,114
Actually,
this Phthalo Green color really suits you.

778
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:06,685
You're mistaken. I suit every color.

779
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:10,331
Yeah, whatever you say.

780
00:59:13,322 --> 00:59:15,483
But I didn't say that myself.

781
00:59:15,483 --> 00:59:17,636
When I was a kid, my designer told me that.

782
00:59:20,254 --> 00:59:25,665
<i>When he was taken,
was my little piggy very scared?</i>

783
00:59:25,665 --> 00:59:27,494
<i>How… was he?</i>

784
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:29,654
<i>Little piggy?</i>
