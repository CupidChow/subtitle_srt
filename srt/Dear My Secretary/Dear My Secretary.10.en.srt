1
00:01:05,276 --> 00:01:08,042
I already know that my love is one-sided.

2
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:10,066
I think it's best if I step back with dignity.

3
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:14,147
If I'm not your prince,
will you change your mind and hate me instead?

4
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:15,806
I will always like you

5
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:18,046
because you are the prince in my real life.

6
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:20,024
When are you going to sign
the divorce papers already?

7
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:21,186
I won't sign!

8
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:23,138
In the abandoned house
where I was kept captive,

9
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:24,956
I found another girl in that house.

10
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:26,482
She's my first love.

11
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:29,054
I just wanted you to know my feelings.

12
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:30,446
Can we stop talking about this now?

13
00:01:30,446 --> 00:01:33,225
From now on, just don't see Prim ever again.

14
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:37,658
When he was taken,
was my little piggy very scared?

15
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:38,970
Little piggy?

16
00:01:44,182 --> 00:01:45,197
Little piggy.

17
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:49,339
Yes?

18
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:05,076
Why did you respond
to the name "Little Piggy", sir?

19
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:15,150
Little Piggy? What's that about?

20
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:20,144
Your mom used to call you Little Piggy
when you were a kid, didn't she?

21
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
Not at all.

22
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:28,375
It's just a habit. I automatically respond
whenever I hear your voice.

23
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,758
You could call me Little Piggy,
Little Puppy, or Little Bear,

24
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:31,959
and I'd still respond.

25
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:37,889
I'm well-rested now.

26
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:39,052
Let's head back.

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,817
Prim, is there something else
you want to talk to me about?

28
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:57,902
When you once…

29
00:02:57,902 --> 00:02:59,822
mentioned about "Little Piggy" to me.

30
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:02,870
"What happened to Little Piggy
when he was kidnapped?"

31
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:05,891
That Little Piggy is my boss, right?

32
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,151
Please tell me the truth.

33
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:14,235
There's something I'm not aware of, correct?

34
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:20,149
You've misunderstood, Prim.

35
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:23,912
Little Piggy is Tham, not Thee.

36
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:34,898
Oh, Prim, visiting my mom again?

37
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,830
Yes.

38
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,462
I was just about to call you, actually,
to return your diary.

39
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:42,416
Oh… Okay.

40
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:47,770
Have you remembered anything after
reading the diary?

41
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,972
Do you remember
the appearance of the woman who kidnapped us?

42
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:56,234
Not at all.

43
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:00,472
How about the time at the abandoned house?

44
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:02,050
Do you recall anything from back then?

45
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:07,566
No worries.

46
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:12,966
I was just secretly hoping
the diary might help jog your memory.

47
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:18,506
The doctor said it might be because my brain
wants to protect me from bad memories,

48
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:20,627
so it chose to forget things
I don't want to remember.

49
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,577
Well, let me go take the diary first.

50
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:27,577
Sure.

51
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:55,796
<i>From now on,
you don't follow strangers again, okay?</i>

52
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,936
<i>You have to come back and love me, okay?</i>

53
00:04:57,936 --> 00:05:01,720
<i>If you come back, I'll marry you, prince.</i>

54
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,542
<i>Marry me?</i>

55
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:04,823
<i>That's not possible.</i>

56
00:05:04,823 --> 00:05:06,388
<i>Why not?</i>

57
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:11,639
<i>Because when you grow up,
you should marry someone you love.</i>

58
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,923
<i>Then if you grow up,
you must come back to love me.</i>

59
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:17,644
<i>We'll get married. Promise me, okay?</i>

60
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:21,044
<i>Okay, let's make a promise.</i>

61
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:33,686
Here's your diary.

62
00:05:34,346 --> 00:05:35,886
Thank you for letting me borrow it.

63
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:42,088
Is this a picture of you when you were a kid?

64
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:43,644
Yes, it is.

65
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:47,587
And which one is you?

66
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:49,868
The one in the blue cape.

67
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:03,266
Prim.

68
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:16,423
The reason I like you isn't just because
we share a past together.

69
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,508
I liked you from the first day
we met at the hospital.

70
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,308
I understand that
you've already turned me down,

71
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:34,077
And I'm not one of those
stubborn and stupid guys.

72
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:41,109
But I want you to know
that the feelings I have for you

73
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:45,583
won't change or fade easily.

74
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:51,692
If it's possible,

75
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,409
please give me another chance.

76
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:18,362
It seems like the prince is actually the boss.

77
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:23,667
But then why did Mrs. Chollada
and the boss lie about it being Tham?

78
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:26,384
What really happened?

79
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,660
Should I ask,
or should I just pretend not to know?

80
00:07:40,264 --> 00:07:41,297
Yes, Boss.

81
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:45,040
At 1 pm, you have a review meeting
for the new pipeline system.

82
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,079
At 2 pm, there's a conference call with Japan.

83
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,129
After that, there's a meeting
with the CEO of the joint venture company.

84
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:51,732
Mind will accompany you today.

85
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:55,791
So does that mean I won't see you all day?

86
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
That's correct.

87
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:01,253
I'll probably wither away
like a plant without water.

88
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:04,093
Stop being so dramatic, please.

89
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:07,514
Then can you come to my house this evening?

90
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:11,197
Is that appropriate?

91
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:15,103
Why are you blushing?
I'm just inviting you over for dinner.

92
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,047
Oh, is that so?

93
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,065
But if you want something else,

94
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,721
I'm always ready to serve.

95
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:30,408
Boss!

96
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:34,120
When will you stop calling me "Boss"?

97
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,250
Try calling me something else,

98
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,250
like…

99
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:40,669
Thee, Mr. Thee,

100
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,779
or even "Thee, darling."

101
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,290
Anything is fine.

102
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,460
Fine, Mr. Thee.

103
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,734
What did you just call me?

104
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,862
Mr. Thee.

105
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:58,435
I couldn't hear that clearly. Say it again.

106
00:08:58,435 --> 00:08:59,460
Mr. Thee.

107
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,683
- One more time.
- That's enough!

108
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:03,618
Would you like me to record it for you?

109
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,772
- Sure, go ahead.
- I'm being sarcastic!

110
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,637
I'll get back to work now.

111
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
Prim.

112
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:15,680
Yes?

113
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
You don't want to eat, sure?

114
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:32,539
Boss, I'm sorry
for sending the meeting report late.

115
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,873
I just finished correcting the typos
and printing it out.

116
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:37,036
Please don't dock my points.

117
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:42,392
It's fine. I've already decided
not to extend your probation period.

118
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,099
Huh?

119
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,951
I'll hire you as a permanent employee
in the position of Assistant Secretary,

120
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:50,843
but with the same salary
as a regular secretary.

121
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:52,718
Okay.

122
00:09:57,643 --> 00:09:58,643
Yes?

123
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:00,529
Is that true, Boss?

124
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,706
Thank you, sir!

125
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:17,470
Are you possessed, new girl?

126
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,423
I pay homage to the Blessed One,
the Worthy One…

127
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:24,128
Bhum, I'm not possessed!
The boss just made me a permanent employee!

128
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:29,779
Really?

129
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,366
He said I'll be the Assistant Secretary.

130
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,845
Hey, wait a minute.

131
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,987
You are the Assistant Secretary?

132
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:43,059
So Prim's still the Secretary?

133
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,367
Does that mean
the boss isn't letting you resign?

134
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,152
Boss, sir.

135
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:05,759
Mind should be the Secretary,
not the Assistant.

136
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,676
And what about my resignation?

137
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:10,321
I've extended your resignation
for one more month.

138
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:11,911
One month?

139
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:14,541
That's not fair. The deadline is already up!

140
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,546
I want to live my own life already!

141
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:22,571
Hold on, Boss! Let's discuss this properly!

142
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,630
My mom cooked and packed food
in this lunchbox for me.

143
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,220
I took it here for my mom's sake.

144
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,112
I usually do IF in the evenings, though.

145
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:39,112
Who asked?

146
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:41,028
I just wanted to share.

147
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
As for you,

148
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:52,507
I'm not changing my mind, Secretary.

149
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,600
That's final.

150
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,101
Congratulations, Mind.

151
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:07,930
You got both a new job
and a new place to live, right?

152
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,894
Thank you.

153
00:12:09,894 --> 00:12:12,922
Oh, in that case,
why don't we celebrate at Mind's place?

154
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:15,248
- Sounds great.
- Yeah!

155
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:18,559
<i>Oh no, if we go to my apartment,
we'll run into that guy.</i>

156
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:20,940
Well…

157
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,601
Hey, Kawee!
Bringing your own lunch again today?

158
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,095
Oh, yeah.

159
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:30,853
My mom cooked for me.
If I didn't bring it, she'd probably feel bad.

160
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:35,153
Wow, doing it out of love for your mom.

161
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:38,094
Such a sweet and dutiful son, Kawee.

162
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:39,627
- Totally my type.
- Mine too.

163
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:41,626
Don't tell me this is the basil
that you grew yourself,

164
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:42,766
and you even sang a song for it too?

165
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:45,654
<i>♪ Oh little basil, grow up ♪</i>

166
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:50,915
What are you even talking about?
That makes no sense!

167
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,245
Well, I'll excuse myself then.

168
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:56,929
- Alright.
- What a cutie.

169
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:03,979
So, this Saturday, let's eat at Mind's place.

170
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,919
Alright, deal.

171
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,222
I think we should go eat
at a nice restaurant instead.

172
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,790
Why's that?

173
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,264
Well… Mind's place is tiny.

174
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:16,548
It might be a bit inconvenient.

175
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:17,572
Don't overthink it.

176
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:20,823
It's not about the place, it's about the food.

177
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:23,458
We can each bring one or two dishes.

178
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,458
- Right?
- Yep!

179
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:26,266
That's right!

180
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:28,155
- But…
- Hey!

181
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:30,930
Just stop! You are stuttering!

182
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,380
What does it mean?
Are you hiding someone at your place?

183
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,991
- Look at this one! So cheeky and bold now!
- Is that true?

184
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,080
Pretty sassy, huh?

185
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,831
Oh, stop it, sis!
You're imagining things way too much!

186
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:43,812
- Am I right?
- Is he good-looking, though?

187
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:45,290
- No…
- Tell us!

188
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,127
I don't have a boyfriend, okay?
I'm still single.

189
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:52,648
In that case, we're all eating
at Mind's place this Saturday. Deal!

190
00:13:53,238 --> 00:13:54,559
- Here.
- Yay!

191
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,559
Let's go!

192
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,035
Go!

193
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,152
- See you this Saturday!
- Follow us, now!

194
00:13:58,152 --> 00:13:59,475
- Come, now!
- Saturday, alright?

195
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:01,045
- She's weird and sassy.
- There'll be a performance, too.

196
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:02,498
Weird, huh?

197
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:04,567
What deal? I never agreed to anything!

198
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,233
Sorry, I just felt like swimming right now.

199
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,918
So, you had to witness
my perfectly sculpted body.

200
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:06,306
Bet you can't resist?

201
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,790
Not at all.

202
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:14,241
Alright, I'll go get dressed.

203
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,572
I'm worried about you.

204
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:17,985
Wouldn't want you losing your
composure any more than this.

205
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:42,220
Hello, Pear?

206
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,226
<i>Where are you?</i>

207
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:47,356
At the boss's house.

208
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:52,586
<i>What are you doing there?
Are you dating that guy now?</i>

209
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:55,156
<i>How many times do I have to tell you
it's not going to work out?</i>

210
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:58,913
Whether it works or not,
I'll decide that myself.

211
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,087
He's always taken care of me,
worried about me, and protected me.

212
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:08,656
Please don't see him in a bad light,

213
00:16:09,232 --> 00:16:12,199
and I don't want you worrying about us either.

214
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,685
<i>Well, fine.</i>

215
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:22,226
<i>Consider this a warning.
It's your life, anyway.</i>

216
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:24,689
<i>Just don't forget about our meeting tomorrow.</i>

217
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:27,298
Okay, bye.

218
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:41,851
<i>So, older sister really doesn't like me, huh?</i>

219
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:46,375
<i>Maybe I'm just too perfect, too flawless.</i>

220
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,456
<i>She must be wary of the gap
between social classes,</i>

221
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,699
<i>even though I don't care about it at all.</i>

222
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:54,383
<i>Mr.Thee, Cholathorn Theeranonsakun,</i>

223
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:57,413
<i>next time, tone down the perfection a bit.</i>

224
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:01,732
<i>Guess I should act more like an ordinary,
down-to-earth guy for once.</i>

225
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,508
What are you doing, Boss?

226
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:26,360
I'm trying to act down-to-earth.

227
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,950
Huh?

228
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:36,555
Well…

229
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:39,142
What?

230
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:54,536
I could eat this dish for the rest of my life.

231
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:58,068
Are you okay now?

232
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,910
Yep.

233
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:04,696
If so, can we talk about something serious?

234
00:18:06,027 --> 00:18:07,464
Something serious? Like what?

235
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,464
If you're going to keep me from resigning,

236
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,612
you'll have to compensate me for my time.

237
00:18:13,612 --> 00:18:17,513
Because I'm losing time to live my life,
time to go out and explore,

238
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,370
and I can't do all the things
I've been wanting to do for a whole month.

239
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:23,924
Sure, no problem.

240
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,321
But, are you okay with it?

241
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:31,801
With what?

242
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,764
I overheard you
talking on the phone with your sister.

243
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:38,492
She's still not okay with me, is she?

244
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,742
Well--

245
00:18:40,742 --> 00:18:45,645
But don't worry, I'll find a way
to make your sister okay with me.

246
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:49,222
Thank you.

247
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,480
Oh, tomorrow I'm taking a day off,

248
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,700
I'm going with my family.

249
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,529
Oh, your usual yearly holiday?

250
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,443
Are you going to the beach again this year?

251
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:01,452
Yes.

252
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:04,482
Okay, then I won't call to bother you tomorrow.

253
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:09,427
But tonight, I'll bother you as much as I want.

254
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:12,486
So intense.

255
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,619
The words?

256
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,782
The smell of instant noodles.

257
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,107
Did you bring charcoal, huh?

258
00:19:32,107 --> 00:19:33,779
Have you been here for long?

259
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:36,541
- Well.
- We've been here since last night, Prim.

260
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,343
This one's scared the sea will disappear.

261
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,460
Where's Dad and Ploen?

262
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,895
Oh, Dad took Ploen
to a band competition together.

263
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:47,960
Wait, Dad is taking our niece to cheer him too?

264
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,507
What? What do you mean, cheer?

265
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:54,346
Let's say he took her to be the main star.

266
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:58,146
My daughter's the vocalist in the band!

267
00:19:58,146 --> 00:19:59,190
Vocalist?

268
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,254
Dad said Ploen's the star,

269
00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:04,542
the one who's gonna score high
with the judges, Prim.

270
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:08,372
This time, it's pretty chill,
but they look serious too.

271
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:11,498
I think he wants to bring home
the championship as a gift for mom.

272
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:15,111
Wow, that's romantic.

273
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:23,843
Hey, whose car is that?

274
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:45,421
How did you get here, sir?

275
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:48,719
I took a day off to come here with my family.

276
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:54,101
Yeah, I wanted to come
and get to know your family better,

277
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:55,810
so they can stop worrying
about us being together

278
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,962
and finally accept me as their son-in-law.

279
00:21:02,571 --> 00:21:04,060
Hello, older sister.

280
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,060
Don't bother.

281
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,024
- Hello, younger sister.
- Hello.

282
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:10,269
I'm Thee, Cholathorn Theeranonsakun.

283
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,950
You didn't come here
to drag Prim away for work, right?

284
00:21:16,437 --> 00:21:19,880
No, I came because I miss Prim.

285
00:21:23,564 --> 00:21:26,164
So, are you two officially together?

286
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,919
- No, we're--
- Yes, we're dating, younger sister.

287
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:36,886
Older sister,

288
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:40,460
I know you're worried about us being together,

289
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,940
but don't worry.

290
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,859
The truth is,
we have something deeper between us.

291
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:47,093
Huh?

292
00:21:47,093 --> 00:21:49,474
What do you mean by "Deep"?

293
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,948
It's intimacy, sis,
don't take it the wrong way.

294
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:53,836
Yeah, sorry.

295
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:56,482
That "Deep" means I'm serious about this.

296
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:58,387
Serious?

297
00:21:58,387 --> 00:22:01,847
Like dating a celebrity and breaking up, huh?

298
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:04,431
- You're going to date Prim like that?
- Hey, Pear!

299
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:05,751
No way.

300
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:07,687
I'm serious.
I love her and I want to marry her.

301
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:10,109
I'm even ready to get married today if I must.

302
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:13,966
Wow, he's madly in love.

303
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,614
Hey! Easy there, girl.

304
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:17,994
Where are you going, by the way?

305
00:22:22,745 --> 00:22:25,763
One, two, three! Whee!

306
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:31,007
Didn't people buy seafood at the market?

307
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:33,007
Buying it from the market
doesn't have the same vibe.

308
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:34,773
This is a family activity, you know?

309
00:22:34,773 --> 00:22:37,016
We've been doing this since
our parents were around.

310
00:22:38,985 --> 00:22:41,949
If you can't even fish for yourself,
just go back to Bangkok.

311
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:43,708
Why waste time here?

312
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:57,246
Oh, that's heavy!

313
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,221
Oh, oh. You got it!

314
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,384
One, two, three, go!

315
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,919
Oh? Why is it getting stuck?

316
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,090
- Oh, no!
- No!

317
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,412
Pear!

318
00:23:12,412 --> 00:23:13,510
- Oh!
- Oh!

319
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:24,125
- Yay!
- That's big!

320
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:43,137
Do you need help
setting the table, younger sister?

321
00:23:43,137 --> 00:23:44,999
No, it's fine. I will do it.

322
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,507
I'll help grill it, older sister.

323
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:59,347
Hey, go away, go!
You go play in the sand over there, please.

324
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:02,943
Boss.

325
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,291
How about making dipping sauce with me?

326
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,241
Make dipping sauce?

327
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,446
How?

328
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:10,456
Just try it.

329
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:14,495
Crush the chilies and garlic until it's fine.

330
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,963
- It's all here, right?
- Yes.

331
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:17,853
Like this?

332
00:24:17,853 --> 00:24:20,186
That's right. Okay.

333
00:24:20,186 --> 00:24:22,699
Make it a bit stronger, or it won't be fine.

334
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:25,243
Here.

335
00:24:25,822 --> 00:24:26,836
That's okay now.

336
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,523
Just grind it.

337
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,982
Sir, are you okay?

338
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,440
I think the chili got in my eye.

339
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,465
- Oh no, my hands are all messy.
- Did you see that?

340
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:43,123
Prim, pass me the knife.

341
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:45,605
- The food is burned now!
- Hold on a second.

342
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:47,060
It's burned now.

343
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,100
Here, here!

344
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,140
Where? Where? Where?

345
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,808
Ah, older sister, older sister.

346
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:54,968
I didn't mean it!

347
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:57,005
Older sister! I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!

348
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:00,666
Oh, are you hurt? Am I hitting you again?

349
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,831
Am I hitting you again?

350
00:25:02,831 --> 00:25:04,959
- Don't follow me!
- Older sister!

351
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,186
Older sister, I'm sorry!

352
00:25:11,132 --> 00:25:12,598
It's delicious.

353
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:17,391
For a beginner making dipping sauce like this,
future brother-in-law,

354
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,954
you did pretty well. It's really good.

355
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:31,777
- Older sister?
- Huh?

356
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,063
How's the seafood sauce?

357
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,568
It's okay, though. Just normal seafood sauce.

358
00:25:39,568 --> 00:25:41,616
I'm eating it to be polite.

359
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,060
I guess there's a lot of politeness, right?

360
00:25:51,493 --> 00:25:52,506
Here you go, sir.

361
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,431
Have you fertilized the basil plant I gave you?

362
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,206
Is it dead?

363
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:15,210
No, it's still alive.

364
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,317
It's okay.

365
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,056
Well then, take this chili plant. Take it.

366
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:24,694
Can I not take it?

367
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:26,393
I'm too lazy to take care of it.

368
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:28,634
Do you know how much chili costs
per kilogram nowadays?

369
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:31,357
It's 180 baht!

370
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,839
I've saved you so much already.
Do you know that?

371
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:37,801
Are you flirting with me?

372
00:26:40,677 --> 00:26:44,060
Are you crazy? I just want to be nice to you.

373
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,030
Oh?

374
00:26:46,764 --> 00:26:47,983
You're being nice…

375
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:50,522
because you don't want me
to tell anyone your secrets, right?

376
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:54,375
Not at all.

377
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:58,040
Hey, I'm asking seriously,
why do you have to create such an image

378
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,831
and lie to people at the office like that?

379
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,915
I'm going to put the chili plant down for you.

380
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,727
Hey! Hey, you!

381
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,783
I haven't given you permission
to enter my room yet.

382
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:27,082
My baby basil turned into crispy basil, no.

383
00:27:28,678 --> 00:27:31,033
Delicious!

384
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:35,560
Your family's cooking is amazing.

385
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,104
Especially the seafood dipping sauce.

386
00:27:37,104 --> 00:27:38,371
Anything you dip into it tastes great.

387
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:39,371
Thumps up!

388
00:27:40,147 --> 00:27:41,147
Next time,

389
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,778
I'll bring it and dip you in it instead.

390
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:46,444
No way, Boss!

391
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:52,053
But really, I'm full now.

392
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,573
Well, honestly,
You weren't competing in an eating contest,

393
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,131
you didn't have to force
yourself to eat that much.

394
00:27:58,858 --> 00:27:59,860
I had to!

395
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,725
I need to show your sister
that I'm just an ordinary guy.

396
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:04,485
I can eat normal food too.

397
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:06,920
Okay, then.

398
00:28:13,018 --> 00:28:14,494
So, how about we have a competition?

399
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,417
A competition? Can I join too?

400
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:24,071
The competition
we're going to have is hot and exhausting.

401
00:28:24,684 --> 00:28:26,010
I don't think you can handle it.

402
00:28:26,556 --> 00:28:28,143
You can leave if you want, no pressure.

403
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:29,979
I can handle it!

404
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:31,787
Even if I have to walk on a thorny path,

405
00:28:31,787 --> 00:28:34,336
I'll walk it as long as I have Prim by my side.

406
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,273
So corny.

407
00:28:39,273 --> 00:28:40,420
Too much.

408
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,676
Their words?

409
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:43,802
Your breath. You should brush your teeth.

410
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:45,729
Hey, Pround!

411
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:47,505
You traitor!

412
00:28:47,505 --> 00:28:49,416
So, what's the competition?

413
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:52,297
Tada!

414
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,545
We're going to race to collect seashells!

415
00:28:54,545 --> 00:28:56,621
Whoever collects the most wins,

416
00:28:56,621 --> 00:28:58,264
and they can ask for one thing they want.

417
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,330
Collecting seashells?

418
00:29:01,854 --> 00:29:04,667
Doesn't really match
my outfit for this activity.

419
00:29:05,637 --> 00:29:08,340
Well, it didn't match
when you wore it to the beach either.

420
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,056
If you don't want to play, just say it.
Don't make excuses.

421
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:14,223
It's not that. Just wait a second.

422
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:23,616
Hey, Pear.

423
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:27,040
Why do you keep picking on him like that?

424
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,672
I know you don't like that he showed up
and declared that he's dating me,

425
00:29:30,672 --> 00:29:32,924
but you don't have to
be so harsh on him, right?

426
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:35,271
What? This is just a little tease,
not a big deal.

427
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:36,271
Can't handle it?

428
00:29:36,911 --> 00:29:38,936
- But… he's--
- But what?

429
00:29:38,936 --> 00:29:40,735
If you like him, that's your business.

430
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:44,175
And if I don't like him,
that's my right too, right?

431
00:29:44,175 --> 00:29:45,247
Isn't that true, Pround?

432
00:29:45,247 --> 00:29:46,655
True.

433
00:29:46,655 --> 00:29:48,556
But I like him, the future brother-in-law.

434
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:49,644
He's kinda quirky.

435
00:29:49,644 --> 00:29:51,052
Seriously.

436
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:53,276
I'll smack you with a spade, you traitor!

437
00:29:53,276 --> 00:29:56,239
- Bring it on!
- You want to fight? Huh?

438
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,201
Why aren't you taking care of it properly?

439
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:08,074
Well, I've never had to
take care of anyone before.

440
00:30:09,436 --> 00:30:12,984
And besides, you're the one
who pushed this onto me.

441
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,894
We're here! Mind!

442
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:18,896
I totally forgot!

443
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:20,753
This is bad!

444
00:30:21,332 --> 00:30:22,412
Is that the sound of Goody?

445
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:23,468
Yeah, it is!

446
00:30:23,468 --> 00:30:24,468
Huh?

447
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:29,986
Go hide! Hide, hide!

448
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:32,626
Go in the bathroom, quick, come here!

449
00:30:34,657 --> 00:30:37,405
No! Someone's definitely
going to come into the bathroom!

450
00:30:38,241 --> 00:30:39,297
Go, now!

451
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:41,022
- No, I can't!
- Hurry up!

452
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:43,092
It's too hot, oh my gosh!

453
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:48,502
Stay here, don't come up. Stay low, understand?

454
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:53,602
Wait! No, no!

455
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:59,811
Hello!

456
00:30:59,811 --> 00:31:01,407
Hi everyone!

457
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,384
I'm so hungry right now!

458
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:09,964
Wow, by now, he probably won't come, right?

459
00:31:09,964 --> 00:31:11,782
He has probably gone back to Bangkok already.

460
00:31:16,252 --> 00:31:17,252
Oh!

461
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,399
- Hey!
- Oh!

462
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,491
You're all dressed up like this.

463
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,699
If you're scared of the heat,
you can leave early.

464
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:55,703
I'm not afraid of the heat.
I brought the umbrella for the ladies.

465
00:31:57,852 --> 00:31:59,508
So, are we ready?

466
00:32:01,174 --> 00:32:02,296
Let's go!

467
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:04,060
- Go now!
- Hey, wait up!

468
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,618
Let's go!

469
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:56,272
Alright, the winner is…

470
00:32:56,272 --> 00:32:57,579
your future brother-in-law!

471
00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:58,786
Huh, really?

472
00:32:58,786 --> 00:33:00,309
- Really?
- Yay!

473
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:04,726
Yay! I won!

474
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:07,919
This is crazy.
It's my first time playing the game, and I won!

475
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,919
Perfect!

476
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,815
- Yay!
- Hey! Take it easy now!

477
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:13,355
You're taking advantage of the moment.

478
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,631
So what do you want to ask for?

479
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:26,810
I'll give this prize to Prim.

480
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,399
That's sweet.

481
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,987
Hey, Prim, what do you want to ask for?

482
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,700
Then I'll ask for you…

483
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,105
to love Boss, just like I love him.

484
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:44,471
- Wow!
- Hey.

485
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:45,845
What world am I in right now?

486
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:49,122
It's okay.

487
00:33:49,122 --> 00:33:51,229
You can dislike me all you want.

488
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,779
I understand that you love
and care about Prim so much.

489
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:57,380
I'll prove to you that I'm sincere, serious,

490
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,220
and love Prim just as much.

491
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,450
Alright, alright.

492
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:05,606
Take the shells back to the sea,
don't bring them home.

493
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:13,844
Don't worry too much,
your future brother-in-law.

494
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,060
Actually, our sister's starting to
soften up a bit.

495
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,106
But she still needs to keep up
the tough sister act for a little longer.

496
00:34:20,246 --> 00:34:21,755
You can do it, future brother-in-law.

497
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Fight for it!

498
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:28,581
Is something wrong, Pear?

499
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,733
What happened, Pear?

500
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:36,486
I watch it on YouTube.

501
00:34:36,486 --> 00:34:39,827
They said you have to crush
the sea urchin spines as finely as possible,

502
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:43,220
then mix water and vinegar
in a one to one ratio.

503
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,420
Rub it on the wound, and it should heal.

504
00:34:47,037 --> 00:34:49,744
But for cleanliness,
I'll wrap the wound for you first.

505
00:34:51,153 --> 00:34:53,275
Exactly! Great job.

506
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:56,199
Wait, aren't you a doctor?

507
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,940
How could you let someone else treat the wound?

508
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,734
Well, letting him do it is better.
He could score some points.

509
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,203
Alright, all done.

510
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:13,779
Well…

511
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,312
Did I get pricked by a sea urchin
or did I break my leg?

512
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:18,553
Don't be surprised.

513
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:20,788
I've been through this before.

514
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:23,754
Seeing this makes me crave
shrimp wrapped in sugarcane.

515
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,740
Hey! What's wrapped in sugarcane?

516
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,111
Oh, is that enough? I'm hungry.

517
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:40,062
Why are you dancing so much?

518
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:43,322
Look, our food is Khantoke,
which is Lanna style.

519
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:45,177
I just wanted to perform it as a soft power,

520
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:47,997
to show love for Thai culture, understand?

521
00:35:47,997 --> 00:35:51,358
But come to think of it,
I think we should stop focusing on soft power.

522
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:52,401
I'm starving.

523
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:55,691
- Can we eat? Look, it's all messed up now.
- Alright.

524
00:35:55,691 --> 00:35:56,864
<i>[Khantoke]</i>

525
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,579
Wow, Nam Prik Ong, so good! Oh, it's amazing.

526
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:02,141
Did you hear that crunch? Crunch, crunch.

527
00:36:02,141 --> 00:36:04,169
Crispy, crunchy, so great.

528
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:06,170
It's delicious!

529
00:36:07,393 --> 00:36:08,579
Delicious!

530
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:15,763
It's so good.

531
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:28,699
No, you're just overthinking it.

532
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:31,050
- You're overthinking.
- You're overthinking.

533
00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:42,665
Here.

534
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
Thank you!

535
00:36:52,572 --> 00:36:55,120
This mango smoothie
is a recipe passed down from my mom.

536
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,260
It's so delicious!

537
00:36:58,498 --> 00:37:02,327
Pear doesn't make it for anyone easily
unless they're family.

538
00:37:05,102 --> 00:37:09,595
So you're softening up, huh?

539
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:14,588
It really is delicious.

540
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:16,425
Thank you very much.

541
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:19,308
Pear likes to act like a mom,

542
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,000
taking the role of mom,

543
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,965
so she tends to scrutinize
your character heavily.

544
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,787
I just want Prim to have a good, warm family

545
00:37:31,787 --> 00:37:33,637
with good people to take care of her.

546
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,790
I can't help but worry

547
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:39,935
since she's with someone as
extraordinary as you.

548
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:47,578
Alright, I'll try to be as ordinary as I can.

549
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,732
Well, I'll give you a chance then.

550
00:38:03,189 --> 00:38:04,220
Should you get married today?

551
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,533
- Hey!
- Is that possible?

552
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,533
Let's go.

553
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:11,819
Thank you, big sister.

554
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:12,819
Yep.

555
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:19,535
By the way, there's something
I've been wondering.

556
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:24,154
Why does everyone come to this beach
every year like this?

557
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:34,711
We come to keep the promise
we made to our late mother.

558
00:38:47,913 --> 00:38:48,913
<i>Watch and see, honey.</i>

559
00:38:49,855 --> 00:38:52,141
<i>Today, I'm going to win the first place trophy</i>

560
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:54,736
<i>as a birthday gift for you.</i>

561
00:38:54,736 --> 00:38:59,081
<i>And when I go up to accept the award,
I'll wish you a happy birthday</i>

562
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:02,811
<i>and tell you he loves you,
making everyone at the event jealous.</i>

563
00:39:02,811 --> 00:39:07,156
<i>Oh, honey, you're being so dramatic.</i>

564
00:39:07,156 --> 00:39:09,701
<i>But I'm going to do my makeup and hair.</i>

565
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:11,867
<i>I'll make them beautiful just in case</i>

566
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:14,084
<i>someone wants to take my photos.</i>

567
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:16,220
<i>- Look at you!
- The sea!</i>

568
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,145
<i>I want to go to the sea!</i>

569
00:39:18,145 --> 00:39:20,810
<i>Wow, it really is the sea.</i>

570
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,766
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

571
00:39:22,766 --> 00:39:24,955
<i>Actually, we still have some time, honey.</i>

572
00:39:24,955 --> 00:39:28,288
<i>Or should we sit by the sea for a bit?</i>

573
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:32,329
<i>Sure, is that okay, kids?</i>

574
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:33,708
<i>Yay!</i>

575
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,786
<i>- Yay!
- Yay!</i>

576
00:39:58,364 --> 00:40:00,390
<i>Look, look at mine. Look at mine!</i>

577
00:40:03,665 --> 00:40:06,269
<i>Everyone, let's go now.</i>

578
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:08,410
<i>Or we'll be late. Let's go! Come now.</i>

579
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:11,946
<i>What's wrong, honey?</i>

580
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:13,517
<i>- I lost the car key.
- Huh?</i>

581
00:40:14,832 --> 00:40:16,552
<i>We just came from here.</i>

582
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:27,311
<i>- You found it?
- No, nothing!</i>

583
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:37,661
<i>I'm sorry, honey.</i>

584
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:40,476
<i>It's your birthday,</i>

585
00:40:41,926 --> 00:40:43,888
<i>and instead of making you happy,</i>

586
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:47,040
<i>I've created a problem.</i>

587
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,863
<i>Now we won't make it to the competition,</i>

588
00:40:51,487 --> 00:40:53,815
<i>and I still haven't been able
to bring you the award.</i>

589
00:40:53,815 --> 00:40:55,889
<i>Honey, come on!</i>

590
00:40:56,562 --> 00:40:57,883
<i>It's okay.</i>

591
00:40:57,883 --> 00:41:00,847
<i>Just having everyone here together</i>

592
00:41:01,414 --> 00:41:02,938
<i>makes me so happy.</i>

593
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,409
<i>Well, since you can't go to the competition,</i>

594
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:11,175
<i>how about you puts on
a mini concert right here?</i>

595
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:13,006
<i>Seriously?</i>

596
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:18,177
<i>And then, we'll all come here</i>

597
00:41:18,177 --> 00:41:20,665
<i>every year on my birthday.</i>

598
00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:21,691
<i>How about that?</i>

599
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:23,943
<i>- Sounds great! Yay!
- Sounds great! Yay!</i>

600
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:25,331
<i>That's right!</i>

601
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:26,331
<i>What a great idea!</i>

602
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:01,703
The following year,
we brought mom here to celebrate again.

603
00:42:01,703 --> 00:42:03,556
But after we left the beach,

604
00:42:03,556 --> 00:42:06,030
Mom started going
in and out of the hospital frequently

605
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,861
and then mom… left us.

606
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,100
So today is the day…

607
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,820
Yes, today is our mother's birthday.

608
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:28,160
Our family promised that we would
celebrate her birthday here every year.

609
00:42:30,734 --> 00:42:32,419
It feels like I'm…

610
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:35,095
an extra on your family's special day.

611
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,534
It's okay, you can come next year.

612
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,655
Yeah.

613
00:43:03,253 --> 00:43:04,802
Dad sent a video from the competition!

614
00:43:06,723 --> 00:43:07,805
Oh! Look!

615
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:17,211
- That's Ploen.
- Oh.

616
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:19,368
- How cute!
- My daughter!

617
00:43:19,368 --> 00:43:20,726
That's my daughter.

618
00:43:25,448 --> 00:43:29,486
<i>[Heart of Rock Grand Prize Winner 10,000 Baht]</i>

619
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:35,404
Thank you, Prang,

620
00:43:36,425 --> 00:43:39,339
my wife, who's in heaven, the only one for me.

621
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:50,435
Honey, I did it!

622
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:10,765
Actually, our mall organizes
a music festival every year.

623
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:14,672
I think next year we should invite
your dad's band to perform too.

624
00:44:16,352 --> 00:44:17,539
You called him 'dad' already?

625
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:19,805
Well, that was smooth, wasn't it.

626
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:36,946
So who's overthinking here?

627
00:44:37,893 --> 00:44:40,014
Well… there's something suspicious.

628
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:46,502
Hey! Why are you all turning like that?

629
00:44:46,502 --> 00:44:47,609
What are we, roast pigs?

630
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:48,691
Eat your food.

631
00:44:53,781 --> 00:44:55,752
Raise your hand, raise your hand.

632
00:44:56,842 --> 00:45:00,330
Officer! What are you doing here?

633
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:03,067
Someone downstairs reported that

634
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,486
they saw someone outside your room
for a long time.

635
00:45:05,486 --> 00:45:06,793
They were worried that
he might be trying to commit suicide.

636
00:45:06,793 --> 00:45:07,824
- What?
- What?

637
00:45:07,824 --> 00:45:09,108
Commit suicide, sir?

638
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:10,662
Commit suicide?

639
00:45:10,662 --> 00:45:13,698
Hey, what should we do? Who is it?

640
00:45:13,698 --> 00:45:15,194
Who is it? Who?

641
00:45:17,516 --> 00:45:18,760
Who?

642
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,767
Where?

643
00:45:21,025 --> 00:45:22,328
Kawee!

644
00:45:23,878 --> 00:45:25,847
Surprise!

645
00:45:29,892 --> 00:45:31,463
Surprise!

646
00:45:32,185 --> 00:45:33,604
Kawee, what are you doing here?

647
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:36,445
Well, I came for the surprise, of course.

648
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:38,135
- Huh?
- Surprise!

649
00:45:39,578 --> 00:45:40,946
Oh no, oh no!

650
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,300
Watch out, Kawee, watch out!

651
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,108
Oh no, oh no!

652
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:46,292
Well…

653
00:45:46,292 --> 00:45:48,272
Well, Mind invited me too,

654
00:45:48,272 --> 00:45:49,637
but if I came in a normal way,

655
00:45:49,637 --> 00:45:51,246
I was afraid nobody would remember me.

656
00:45:52,814 --> 00:45:55,672
So I planned with Mind,
for me to wait on the balcony

657
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:59,272
and wait for everyone
to open the grand opening for me.

658
00:46:01,749 --> 00:46:05,167
- Grand opening.
- Oh!

659
00:46:05,167 --> 00:46:06,947
Going all out like the Ratchada Theater.

660
00:46:06,947 --> 00:46:11,011
Big time, fabulous.

661
00:46:11,011 --> 00:46:13,586
Kawee's really putting on a show.

662
00:46:17,931 --> 00:46:18,931
Hey.

663
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:24,225
This is the Pleiades constellation,

664
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:27,484
and this is the Bat constellation.

665
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,328
This one is the Ursa Minor constellation.

666
00:46:32,533 --> 00:46:34,682
You're so good at stargazing, Boss.

667
00:46:34,682 --> 00:46:36,366
NASA should be calling you by now.

668
00:46:39,232 --> 00:46:41,071
Did I act smart again?

669
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,126
I was planning to be normal.

670
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:47,785
I'm so cool,

671
00:46:48,367 --> 00:46:50,424
I bet you're completely smitten by me now.

672
00:46:53,827 --> 00:46:57,549
Yes, I'm ten times more smitten by you, Boss.

673
00:47:02,446 --> 00:47:03,798
Only ten times?

674
00:47:09,512 --> 00:47:11,793
Well, I could say it's a million times.

675
00:47:26,572 --> 00:47:28,697
I love you a million times too.

676
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:48,029
What's going on here?

677
00:47:51,096 --> 00:47:53,579
Want to come inside, Prim?

678
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,739
Sitting in the wind like this,
you're going to get sick.

679
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,368
There are so many mosquitoes. Let's go, go, go!

680
00:47:57,368 --> 00:47:58,784
And you…

681
00:47:58,784 --> 00:48:00,110
go back to the hotel and sleep.

682
00:48:02,026 --> 00:48:03,704
Hurry up, or you'll get sick.

683
00:48:22,253 --> 00:48:23,477
How could you do this?

684
00:48:24,472 --> 00:48:25,472
Oh?

685
00:48:26,911 --> 00:48:28,353
You need to kiss the other side too.

686
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,500
Good night.

687
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:41,874
Good night.

688
00:48:58,474 --> 00:48:59,474
What?

689
00:49:03,061 --> 00:49:05,633
Guys, did you hear that?

690
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:22,508
Oh, hey.

691
00:49:24,365 --> 00:49:25,544
I'm going to have a heart attack.

692
00:49:25,544 --> 00:49:27,998
Hey… What are you doing here?

693
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,748
Don't tell me the hotel is full.

694
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:36,190
The hotel isn't full,
but I wanted to be close to you,

695
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,395
so I bought a tent and set it up here.

696
00:49:37,395 --> 00:49:38,395
Huh?

697
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:41,110
And this isn't just any tent.

698
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,110
Look at it.

699
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,636
How's it? Pretty, huh?

700
00:49:50,979 --> 00:49:51,979
Yeah.

701
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,963
I want to stay
and protect you, take care of you.

702
00:49:56,963 --> 00:49:59,049
I'll be your personal bodyguard.

703
00:50:01,551 --> 00:50:02,551
Is he sane?

704
00:50:03,405 --> 00:50:04,612
Let's go to bed, Pear.

705
00:50:04,612 --> 00:50:06,013
Yeah, fine.

706
00:50:06,792 --> 00:50:07,792
Love stinks.

707
00:50:16,438 --> 00:50:18,114
There's no need to go through all this trouble.

708
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:20,109
You'll get bitten by mosquitoes and die.

709
00:50:20,858 --> 00:50:22,435
I won't die from mosquitoes,

710
00:50:23,352 --> 00:50:25,417
but if I'm 500 meters away from you,

711
00:50:26,386 --> 00:50:27,470
I'll definitely die.

712
00:50:29,075 --> 00:50:30,220
Super dramatic.

713
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:54,706
Why do you keep hugging me?

714
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:57,721
I can hug you all day long.
Never get tired of it.

715
00:51:03,887 --> 00:51:04,887
What?

716
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:08,682
I just kissed your cheek earlier.
Isn't that enough?

717
00:51:09,448 --> 00:51:10,857
It was just a cheek kiss.

718
00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:14,269
I want to kiss you more.

719
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,519
Oh no!

720
00:51:27,069 --> 00:51:30,364
Well, I'm about to slice
some cucumbers for a face mask.

721
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,584
Can you help me slice them?

722
00:51:33,874 --> 00:51:35,170
Sure.

723
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,173
What about you?

724
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:38,393
Do you want to do a face mask together?

725
00:51:39,702 --> 00:51:43,340
No thanks. I'll set up the tent instead.

726
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,216
That's fine. I'm worried the knife might slip.

727
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:49,781
Make sure to focus on
setting up the tent, alright?

728
00:51:49,781 --> 00:51:50,785
Yeah, sure.

729
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,915
Follow me, Prim. My face is all dry now.

730
00:52:01,763 --> 00:52:03,132
Good night for real now.

731
00:52:06,302 --> 00:52:07,302
Good night.

732
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:24,267
I'm happy.

733
00:52:25,605 --> 00:52:26,805
What are you happy about?

734
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:29,908
I'm happy that your sister
has opened her heart and accepted me

735
00:52:29,908 --> 00:52:31,548
as her future brother-in-law.

736
00:52:32,314 --> 00:52:35,917
Only a future brother-in-law, though.
You're not a real one yet.

737
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:41,405
But thank you for everything
you've done for me, Boss.

738
00:52:42,924 --> 00:52:45,248
Isn't the goal meant to be pursued?

739
00:52:45,888 --> 00:52:48,789
And I still have one more goal left to pursue.

740
00:52:49,939 --> 00:52:50,951
What goal?

741
00:52:52,877 --> 00:52:53,988
Your future father-in-law.

742
00:52:56,254 --> 00:52:58,364
That's a very dangerous level to pass.

743
00:52:58,364 --> 00:52:59,449
It's so scary.

744
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:04,963
Someone like me isn't scared, Secretary Prim.

745
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:08,437
There's nothing that
the most brilliant executive in Asia,

746
00:53:08,437 --> 00:53:09,783
like me, can't handle.

747
00:53:18,912 --> 00:53:19,912
Hello, Pat.

748
00:53:23,278 --> 00:53:24,278
I didn't forget.

749
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
Yeah, thanks a lot.

750
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,154
- Is something urgent?
- Yeah.

751
00:53:30,154 --> 00:53:31,610
Pat called to remind me that

752
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,700
I need to attend a thank-you event
from the Spanish Chamber of Commerce today.

753
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:38,194
In that case, I will go with you.

754
00:53:38,194 --> 00:53:39,903
So I can help you get ready.

755
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,924
No need.

756
00:53:42,924 --> 00:53:45,070
I'll be going with my whole family today.

757
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,328
You should just
spend your time with your family.

758
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,965
It's fine,

759
00:53:50,545 --> 00:53:53,132
I've already spent plenty of time
with my family too.

760
00:53:54,306 --> 00:53:56,119
Secretary Prim is ready to get back to work.

761
00:54:18,273 --> 00:54:19,273
Hey, dear.

762
00:54:21,663 --> 00:54:23,802
The Ambassador
from the Philippines is asking for you.

763
00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:29,439
You know,

764
00:54:30,085 --> 00:54:34,969
I think it's time to tell Tham the truth.

765
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:38,242
I don't want to lie to him anymore.

766
00:54:42,425 --> 00:54:43,947
Let's stop this conversation now.

767
00:54:45,252 --> 00:54:47,192
I want to handle Thee's matter first.

768
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:48,967
Why?

769
00:54:49,712 --> 00:54:50,909
What happened to Thee?

770
00:54:52,037 --> 00:54:55,674
Thee neglected work
and followed Prim to go on a trip.

771
00:54:55,674 --> 00:54:59,336
The person I sent to investigate
told me they're dating.

772
00:54:59,973 --> 00:55:00,973
What?

773
00:55:01,575 --> 00:55:04,386
You had someone investigate our child?

774
00:55:05,388 --> 00:55:07,441
Yes, I wanted to know.

775
00:55:08,077 --> 00:55:10,609
I want to separate these
two as quickly as possible.

776
00:55:12,278 --> 00:55:16,724
You know that Prim can never be Thee's bride.

777
00:55:16,724 --> 00:55:18,730
They're just not right for each other.

778
00:55:21,108 --> 00:55:22,411
But right now,

779
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:26,669
the one we should
be most worried about is Tham, not Thee!

780
00:55:26,669 --> 00:55:31,145
Do you realize that
this situation is getting worse?

781
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:33,854
Before things get worse,

782
00:55:34,809 --> 00:55:38,408
I think we should tell him the truth.

783
00:55:38,408 --> 00:55:39,420
Listen to me…

784
00:55:40,353 --> 00:55:41,728
Stop it.

785
00:55:41,728 --> 00:55:43,816
I can't keep this bottled up any longer.

786
00:55:44,736 --> 00:55:47,482
If you keep being stubborn
and don't handle this,

787
00:55:48,229 --> 00:55:50,524
I'll talk to him myself!

788
00:56:14,634 --> 00:56:15,933
Are you okay, Mom?

789
00:56:15,933 --> 00:56:16,933
Huh?

790
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:23,830
I saw you sitting alone for a long time.

791
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:24,830
What happened, Mom?

792
00:56:26,506 --> 00:56:27,506
No, dear.

793
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:31,487
Well, yeah…

794
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:34,059
Actually…

795
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,250
There is something.

796
00:56:40,603 --> 00:56:41,603
Tham.

797
00:56:43,045 --> 00:56:44,575
Don't be panic.

798
00:56:46,763 --> 00:56:49,337
Listen to what I'm going to tell you carefully.

799
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:56,566
Don't get confused,

800
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:58,765
don't overthink,

801
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:02,977
and don't feel guilty
about what I'm going to say.

802
00:57:02,977 --> 00:57:04,115
Do you understand?

803
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:07,203
Sure.

804
00:57:09,353 --> 00:57:10,353
What is it?

805
00:57:14,593 --> 00:57:17,440
25 years ago…

806
00:57:19,882 --> 00:57:24,047
it was Thee who was kidnapped.

807
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:26,217
It's not you.

808
00:57:47,138 --> 00:57:48,138
What did you say?

809
00:57:51,994 --> 00:57:54,222
You weren't kidnapped,

810
00:57:55,988 --> 00:57:56,988
it was Thee.

811
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,211
That can't be true!

812
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:03,688
It had to be me!

813
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:07,554
I remember being the one who was kidnapped.

814
00:58:07,554 --> 00:58:10,100
And… my hands were tied too!

815
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,226
The one who had his hands and feet tied,

816
00:58:21,259 --> 00:58:23,720
the one who was taken to that house,

817
00:58:24,479 --> 00:58:25,569
it was Thee.

818
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,527
And when you were little,

819
00:58:38,856 --> 00:58:42,049
your name was Thee, not Tham.

820
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:54,634
Tham!

821
00:58:58,269 --> 00:58:59,471
Tham!

822
00:58:59,471 --> 00:59:00,471
Tham, dear!

823
00:59:16,645 --> 00:59:18,060
- Hello.
- Hello.

824
00:59:20,739 --> 00:59:21,859
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

825
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:22,859
Bye.

826
00:59:27,322 --> 00:59:29,310
Then, I'll go talk to customers first.

827
00:59:48,609 --> 00:59:49,609
Tham, sir?

828
00:59:52,377 --> 00:59:53,551
Is something wrong?

829
00:59:57,391 --> 00:59:58,391
I…

830
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,749
I just found out that
all the memories I thought I had…

831
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,184
they're not my memories at all.

832
01:00:09,512 --> 01:00:10,518
My mom said that…

833
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,695
the child who was taken wasn't me.

834
01:00:20,812 --> 01:00:22,133
You know about this, don't you?

835
01:00:23,633 --> 01:00:24,848
It's true, right?

836
01:00:29,261 --> 01:00:30,266
Why are you silent?

837
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,656
Is it hard to answer?

838
01:01:26,171 --> 01:01:28,468
I remember now. That woman.

839
01:01:38,835 --> 01:01:40,021
Come with mommy, my dear.

840
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,519
You have to die.

841
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:48,230
I'm going to kill both of you.

842
01:02:05,371 --> 01:02:06,468
Prim!

843
01:02:06,468 --> 01:02:07,689
Prim, Prim!

844
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:09,275
Prim, Prim!

845
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:11,370
Prim!

846
01:02:12,206 --> 01:02:13,797
Prim! Prim!

847
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:14,823
Prim!

848
01:02:14,823 --> 01:02:16,396
Prim, can you hear me, Prim?

849
01:02:16,396 --> 01:02:17,396
Prim!

850
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:21,229
What did you do?

851
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:25,392
Prim!

852
01:02:25,392 --> 01:02:26,392
Prim!

853
01:02:27,112 --> 01:02:28,489
Prim, what happened to you?

854
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:56,471
When will you stop causing trouble
for everyone around you, huh?

855
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:59,664
Everything's chaotic because
you kept hiding the truth, isn't it?

856
01:02:59,664 --> 01:03:01,635
My favorite shirt is gone! What should I do?

857
01:03:01,635 --> 01:03:02,707
Well, go look for it then.

858
01:03:02,707 --> 01:03:03,762
Can you help me look for it?

859
01:03:03,762 --> 01:03:05,813
When will you finally sign the divorce papers?

860
01:03:05,813 --> 01:03:06,828
Can you give me a chance?

861
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:08,825
Happy Birthday!

862
01:03:08,825 --> 01:03:11,391
- You actually remembered?
- It's fine if I didn't remember.

863
01:03:11,391 --> 01:03:15,033
As long as your dear secretary remembered,
that's enough.

864
01:03:15,831 --> 01:03:17,807
But today, I'll tell you everything.

865
01:03:17,807 --> 01:03:20,983
If it could just make you wake up
and talk to me again.
