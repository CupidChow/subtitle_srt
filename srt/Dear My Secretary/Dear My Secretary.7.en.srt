1
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:07,990
Don't tell me that girl is moving here?

2
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:12,198
The kidnapped child back then
is the heir to the Theeranon Group.

3
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,031
That child's name is Thee or Tham?

4
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:17,143
I tried investigating,
but I couldn't find anything.

5
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,183
No records, no information at all.

6
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:23,765
I can sense that,
the person who was kidnapped with me,

7
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:26,572
the prince I've been searching for, is you.

8
00:01:27,178 --> 00:01:31,603
I was never kidnapped,
and I'm not the prince you want.

9
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:34,344
Did you see the post
in the secret group of Morpheus?

10
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,071
He says that he was kidnapped as a child.

11
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:38,345
Who was kidnapped?

12
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,736
It was Tham, Prim.

13
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:42,375
You've been kind to me…

14
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:45,486
because you think I'm the prince
you've been searching for,

15
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:47,465
not because you like me.

16
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,215
Who exactly is my prince?

17
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:38,075
Here, this might help you remember something.

18
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,035
I hope so too.

19
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:48,221
Thank you for making me feel better.

20
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:53,939
All this time…
I've felt so much pain about that.

21
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:59,631
I blamed Thee, hated Thee,
for making me through such terrible things.

22
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:03,983
Until I met you.

23
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:06,780
Then I realized
that you were there with me that day.

24
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,610
It made the pain hurt less.

25
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:17,787
I feel like I have a companion in misery,
someone who shares those bad memories with me.

26
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:21,138
It's like I'm no longer alone
in that dark place.

27
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:26,487
Now, I'm thankful to Thee

28
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:29,719
for leading me to you.

29
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:41,944
Look at this.

30
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:46,712
When other people organize workshops,
dozens or even hundreds show up.

31
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:50,745
But when I host one,
look at this, just us here.

32
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:53,219
There's not even one handsome guy in sight!

33
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:54,692
This is all we've got.

34
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:57,873
So frustrating.

35
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:03,415
Oh, but at least there's this one person

36
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:06,485
who lifts my spirits so much.

37
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:08,263
Hi, Kawee-wee-wee!

38
00:04:08,263 --> 00:04:09,263
Hello.

39
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,833
Kawee, did you misunderstand something?

40
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:17,316
They went to a workshop in another province.
but why…

41
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:20,521
Oh, this is my uniform.

42
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,798
What kind of normal person
wears a leather jacket to go into the forest?

43
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,809
A true intellectual shouldn't criticize
other people's tastes, you know.

44
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:39,900
Alright, let's get on the bus.
You're so handsome Kawee!

45
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,906
Come on, hurry up, get in!

46
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,825
Alright, he is handsome. Let's go.

47
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,268
So handsome.

48
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:47,318
What're you doing?

49
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,039
Do you know
why I decided to go to the workshop?

50
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:55,359
Probably to get a free trip and free food.

51
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:57,252
Well, you're not wrong.

52
00:04:57,252 --> 00:05:01,790
What? No! It's to keep an eye on you!

53
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,983
What?

54
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,604
Keep an eye on me? Why is that?

55
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:08,380
Just in case you say something to someone else,

56
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,061
like how I'm not actually rich
and still live in some old apartment.

57
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,131
Then I can immediately explain
that I'm just frugal and good with money.

58
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,597
Good with money?
Is that why you only have one outfit?

59
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:23,012
How did you know that?

60
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:29,464
Here, we have coin-operated
washing machines and dryers.

61
00:05:29,464 --> 00:05:33,139
But if you'd like to air-dry your clothes,
you can use that area over there.

62
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,597
People still air-dry their clothes these days?

63
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:38,360
I thought everyone just spin-dries them now.

64
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,589
Some people just don't want to spend money.

65
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:43,826
Especially that person.

66
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:54,219
It seems like he really loves that shirt.
I saw him wearing only that one.

67
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:56,095
He keeps washing and hanging them to dry.

68
00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:59,330
And when it rains, it doesn't dry properly.

69
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:03,556
I thought so.

70
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,900
What's wrong, Mind?

71
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,217
Oh, I'm feeling a bit sour
and bitter in my throat.

72
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:15,217
Sorry about that.

73
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:19,689
You have only one shirt,
and refuse to spend money on the machines.

74
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:22,378
You wash and hang it to dry on the rooftop,
it doesn't dry properly.

75
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:25,127
And on some days,
it ends up smelling sour, right?

76
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:30,696
Stop talking right now!
What if someone overhears you?

77
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:33,738
This is exactly why
I have to go to the workshop!

78
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:39,003
I won't let you ruin my reputation,
my good looks, or the popularity

79
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:40,211
I've worked so hard to build!

80
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:46,539
Mind, Kawee, what are you two doing?
Get in the car already.

81
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,471
- Yes.
- Yes, coming!

82
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,636
Good looks, my ass.

83
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:59,577
<i>Tomorrow morning, you have a tennis match
scheduled with the German consul.</i>

84
00:06:59,577 --> 00:07:01,539
<i>In the afternoon, you'll have tea
with the British ambassador.</i>

85
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:04,902
<i>And in the evening, you're giving a speech
at the Chonburi Chamber of Commerce event.</i>

86
00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:07,092
<i>Alright, noted, Secretary Prim.</i>

87
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:10,068
<i>In that case, I'll excuse myself
to attend the board meeting.</i>

88
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:11,068
<i>Wait a moment.</i>

89
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:16,358
<i>What is it?</i>

90
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:20,486
<i>Nothing. I just wanted to say…</i>

91
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:24,023
<i>I love you, my prince.</i>

92
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:27,019
<i>Wait, Prim!</i>

93
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:29,026
<i>Right there, right there!</i>

94
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:37,381
<i>What a crazy dream.</i>

95
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:39,625
<i>It's not a dream. It's real.</i>

96
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,240
Was this a dream within a dream?

97
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:55,298
I can't stay here anymore!

98
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,340
Alright, everyone, come on down!

99
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,752
The most exciting outing in the world
is about to begin!

100
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:19,979
Come! Come on, come on down!

101
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,352
What's up with her
having all the fun by herself?

102
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:25,939
And look around,
this place is so desolate and eerie.

103
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,264
It's like we're here to offer robes to monks.

104
00:08:29,264 --> 00:08:30,323
Where's the fun in this?

105
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,140
Come on, energy up!
We're going to have so much fun today!

106
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,573
- Let's go! Hurry up! Follow me!
- What's with all that energy?

107
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,656
Come on! Smile! Laugh!

108
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:19,116
We have to thank our big sister, Bhum,
for organizing this workshop.

109
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:24,500
We get to travel and learn something.
It's so great and worthwhile!

110
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,899
Of course, it is!

111
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,339
Let's give Bhum a round of applause!

112
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,972
But excuse me, everyone.
Can I swap the applause reward for…

113
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:37,300
a sweet, sugary kiss instead?

114
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,979
Hey, Kawee just took a course
on waste segregation.

115
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:46,263
He probably doesn't want to touch garbage.

116
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:47,363
It's true.

117
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:49,892
It's smelly and dirty.

118
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:51,663
- Are you insulting me?
- What?

119
00:09:51,663 --> 00:09:53,080
- Is that it?
- One hundred percent.

120
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:06,799
Oh, what's that smoke?
Is someone burning something around here?

121
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:30,749
They say "A handsome face can't be hidden."

122
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:33,682
But this is "a face that is smoking hot."

123
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:39,599
Hello, Boss. What brings you here?

124
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,124
Is there something urgent?

125
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:45,534
Why am I here? Well, I'm here
to grill barbecue for everyone to enjoy.

126
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:54,020
Though, to be honest, it wasn't my idea.

127
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,044
It was Yong's idea, wasn't it, Yong?

128
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,060
Yong!

129
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:02,686
Yes, sir.

130
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:04,872
Today they're going to
the Zero Waste Workshop, right?

131
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:05,941
Yes, that's correct.

132
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:08,759
Great! Let's go buy supplies
to make some barbecue!

133
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:13,433
Sure.

134
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:17,672
Where should we buy them?

135
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:21,394
Oh… that's right!

136
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:29,319
But we don't want to trouble you.

137
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,960
You've driven all the way here,
and you'll have to drive back, too.

138
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:33,562
Who said I'm driving back?

139
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,519
What?

140
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:38,258
Don't tell me…

141
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:41,602
That's right. I'm staying overnight
to join the workshop with all of you.

142
00:11:45,823 --> 00:11:49,539
You can't find another boss like this.
A boss who is handsome, kind,

143
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:51,140
and caring about his staff.

144
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,164
The entire world probably
only has one person like me.

145
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:05,346
Boss of the Year!
Everyone, give him a round of applause!

146
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:08,052
Bravo!

147
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,333
Bhum.

148
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,138
Shall we swap seats?

149
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:39,080
Oh, sure, sure.

150
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:43,694
Excuse me, excuse me.

151
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,497
It seems cold over there.

152
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:49,008
This spot feels safer.

153
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:54,222
Why are you sitting next to me?

154
00:12:55,023 --> 00:12:56,877
Are you here to threaten me about that secret?

155
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,142
And what if I am, huh?

156
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:05,941
By the way,
what activities are planned for tomorrow?

157
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:09,100
Tomorrow, we'll be submitting
the workshop homework to the staff

158
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,020
and then competing in some games.

159
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,065
What kind of games?

160
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:14,067
- Oh…
- A trash-collecting rally in pairs.

161
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:18,300
That sounds fun. Count me in.

162
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
What?

163
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,941
The game is fun, but it's exhausting, sir.

164
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,343
You'd be better off as a committee.

165
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:34,346
No, I'm playing.

166
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,229
Yong will play too, so we'll have enough pairs.

167
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,579
Have you thought about
who will pair up with whom?

168
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,145
I think…

169
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:45,363
- Say it, Bhum!
- Who?

170
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:47,619
You were just talking nonstop earlier!
Did a ghost possess you?

171
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,952
And now you're completely silent?

172
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,568
Boss, sorry. We're just talking casually.

173
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:57,819
- Say it.
- It's too harsh to apologize, bro.

174
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:59,100
I haven't thought of it yet.

175
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:03,826
Then Goody, Prim, Mind, and Bhum
will act as representatives and draw lots

176
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:05,459
to decide the pairs, okay?

177
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,655
What are you doing, Goody?

178
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:22,682
I'm praying to the divine!
I don't want to pair with the boss.

179
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:25,500
If I pair with him, I'll be so nervous. No way!

180
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:32,473
Then I'm going to pray for a pair
with the boss or Kawee!

181
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:36,140
The gods won't grant your wish.
Don't be so confident.

182
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,500
Just wait and see!

183
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Let's see.

184
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,638
Boss, Kawee, Boss, Kawee.

185
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:44,739
Boss, Kawee…

186
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:45,905
Yong!

187
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:59,249
I told you, there's no way you'd get it.

188
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,224
Oh, that's my name.

189
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,481
Now I can follow you around
and keep you quiet everywhere!

190
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:16,300
Heaven is clearly on my side.

191
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,500
More like hell is.

192
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,848
- It's Heaven.
- Huh!

193
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:24,606
<i>[Boss]</i>

194
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,964
Where did Bhum go?

195
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:49,699
Oh, where did she go?

196
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,082
I'm here!

197
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:02,452
How many layers did you stuff in there, Bhum?

198
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:06,844
Do you want to get hit?
It's all-natural, gifted by my mom!

199
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,416
Yong.

200
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:14,659
Yong!

201
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:17,266
Close your mouth before a fly gets in
and lays eggs!

202
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,919
Stop staring.

203
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,861
Everyone, listen up!
our boss has something to say.

204
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:29,972
Today, I've brought special rewards
for everyone participating in this activity.

205
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:32,840
The winning team will receive two iPads!

206
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,059
No way!

207
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,171
I've been wanting one, sir.

208
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:42,899
If everyone's ready,
please take your positions.

209
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,819
Wait for the signal.

210
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,591
Hey! Kawee!

211
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:56,794
Let's go, sir!

212
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:11,659
<i>Today, dad went to the market
and bought lots of Bunga Puda for me.</i>

213
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:16,742
<i>But I didn't eat them all.
I saved some for my prince too.</i>

214
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:22,920
<i>I've been trying to recall the prince's name,
but I really can't recall it.</i>

215
00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:29,699
<i>It's okay. I'll wait for the prince to be back
and tell me his name again.</i>

216
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:32,188
<i>I'm waiting, my prince.</i>

217
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,859
<i>Why hasn't the prince come back to see me yet?</i>

218
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:44,109
<i>Has the prince forgotten the promise
he made to me?</i>

219
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:47,355
<i>Have you forgotten me, my prince?</i>

220
00:17:48,144 --> 00:17:52,347
<i>No matter what, I'll keep waiting for you.</i>

221
00:17:53,758 --> 00:17:55,815
<i>Were we locked up together as kids?</i>

222
00:17:56,388 --> 00:17:57,388
<i>Yes.</i>

223
00:17:58,114 --> 00:18:02,826
<i>Don't you remember me?
That we used to be together?</i>

224
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,109
<i>I was so shocked by what happened that day,</i>

225
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:07,963
<i>I barely remember anything.</i>

226
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:25,039
Hey, hurry up! We're going to lose.

227
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:31,180
I can't. If you want the prize so badly,
go play by yourself.

228
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,685
What? Do you think
all my effort is just because I want the prize?

229
00:18:36,411 --> 00:18:37,980
Well, isn't it?

230
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,420
No way! I'm a serious guy.
I commit to what I do.

231
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,392
I'll see it through. The prize is just a prize.
Understand me better, will you?

232
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:50,852
Save your fake talk for someone else.
Don't try to fool me.

233
00:18:57,145 --> 00:18:58,767
Hey, there it is!

234
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,537
Oh, you're right! Go get it quickly!

235
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:06,745
But I think we'll have to climb.

236
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:15,336
What? I can't climb!

237
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,993
So, why exactly are you here?

238
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,330
I'm here to cheer on my staff.

239
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:24,237
Be honest.

240
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,592
Okay, honestly…

241
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:29,622
I missed you.

242
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:34,319
I wanted to see you, to be near you.

243
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:42,034
Right now, I'm trying to win your heart.
That's why I'm pulling out all the stops.

244
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,051
I get it. You don't have to keep repeating it.

245
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:51,098
Actually, I've been feeling uneasy,

246
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,397
and I can't focus on anything.

247
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:57,225
I wanted to talk to you about a few things.

248
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
What things?

249
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:01,582
First of all…

250
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:05,100
I'm not flirting with you
just to prove you anything.

251
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,580
or stop you from resigning.

252
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,926
I'm hitting on you
because I genuinely like you.

253
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,773
I don't want you to misunderstand.

254
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:20,986
I got it.

255
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:24,675
Second…

256
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:29,622
about the other day
when you asked me about your "prince".

257
00:20:34,181 --> 00:20:36,836
If I weren't that prince,
would you still like me?

258
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:45,050
Even if you say no, I'm still hitting on you.

259
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,196
So, I want you to stop thinking
whether I am that prince.

260
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:50,609
I want you to focus more on who I am instead.

261
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,506
You just answered yourself.

262
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,020
Why are you asking me?

263
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:00,383
I just wanted to know your opinion.

264
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:03,490
But I've also gotten used to
my own authoritarian ways.

265
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:15,798
Yong!

266
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:17,846
Walk faster, or we'll lose to the other teams!

267
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,040
Sorry, Bhum.

268
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,117
I just wanted to watch your back

269
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,977
in case you might fall.

270
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:32,335
Is this man showing concern for me?

271
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:37,100
It's been decades since I last heard
a man say something so caring, Bhum!

272
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:43,566
I can't have feelings for Yong.
Keep your head high.

273
00:21:58,372 --> 00:21:59,678
Hold my jacket for me.

274
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:03,196
Be careful.

275
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,916
I've never trusted anyone with this jacket.

276
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:06,976
Yeah, I got it.

277
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:20,718
Hey, climb carefully, okay?

278
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:23,804
Don't fall.
I don't feel like taking you to see a doctor.

279
00:22:23,804 --> 00:22:25,986
This is nothing, don't worry about me.

280
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:33,752
Almost there! You've got this!

281
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,420
Hello, Mom.

282
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,721
What? My jacket!
Why did you just toss it like that?!

283
00:22:50,332 --> 00:22:54,043
I'm up on the mountain, Mom.
The signal's pretty bad here.

284
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:56,185
Hello? Hello?

285
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,650
Hello? Mom? Hello?

286
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,528
Hey! I'll go talk to my mom first, okay?

287
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:05,820
The jacket! Where are you going? What about me?

288
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,882
Just a minute, I'll be right back. Okay?

289
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:11,992
The jacket!

290
00:23:37,773 --> 00:23:38,773
Why are you calling?

291
00:23:40,972 --> 00:23:42,470
Why are you answering Prim's phone?

292
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,901
I'm with Prim right now.
If it's not important, I'll hang up.

293
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:50,100
I have something more important
to talk to Prim.

294
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,613
I will call to talk
about my memories with Prim,

295
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:54,113
the good times we shared together.

296
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,827
Before you start acting
like you own her memories,

297
00:23:57,827 --> 00:24:00,080
shouldn't you remember
what really happened that day?

298
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,399
You can't do this, sir. This is my phone.

299
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:11,819
Do you like my brother?
Why do you want to talk to him so much?

300
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:16,060
I just want to recall the memories
of when I was kidnapped. That's all.

301
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,232
So that means you'll have to meet him regularly
to revive those memories, right?

302
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:21,991
Yes.

303
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,986
If I told you I'm not okay with this,
would you still go meet him?

304
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:27,778
Sure.

305
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:33,573
She's definitely sulking.

306
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:51,858
<i>Help!</i>

307
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:09,070
<i>Anyone! Someone, help! Help me, please!</i>

308
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:12,363
I can't remember anything.

309
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:13,610
I have to remember something.

310
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:15,435
I have to remember Prim.

311
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:18,717
Why can't I remember anything?

312
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,474
I must remember.

313
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,083
I have to remember Prim.

314
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,340
<i>Before you start acting
like you own her memories,</i>

315
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,807
<i>shouldn't you remember
what really happened that day?</i>

316
00:25:29,807 --> 00:25:31,233
<i>I must remember.</i>

317
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,808
<i>I must remember.</i>

318
00:25:37,156 --> 00:25:38,544
<i>I need to remember.</i>

319
00:25:38,544 --> 00:25:39,990
<i>I have to remember Prim.</i>

320
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,177
Bhum, are you okay?

321
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,812
Why do you seem so quiet?

322
00:25:50,725 --> 00:25:53,958
Or are you having a heat stroke?
You need to drink water, Bhum.

323
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:55,893
This isn't good. You have to drink water.

324
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:59,064
- It's dangerous, Bhum.
- I'm fine! Stop it, Yong!

325
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,460
Why are you staring?
You think you've found an angel in the forest?

326
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,539
Bhum.

327
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:11,763
What?

328
00:26:11,763 --> 00:26:12,763
Stay still, please.

329
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:15,979
Stay still? Why?

330
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:16,979
There's a bug.

331
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:20,792
Oh, come on, Yong, it's just a bug!

332
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:22,140
It's a spider.

333
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,393
A spider? Spider?

334
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:34,172
Bhum, Bhum! It's okay now.

335
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:36,600
I think it's okay now. It's gone, Bhum.

336
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:39,465
It's not gone.

337
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,465
It's inside my shirt!

338
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:49,260
Don't come to the front! Don't! Don't come!

339
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,382
Oh no, don't climb up here!

340
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:54,515
Oh, I found you.

341
00:27:08,804 --> 00:27:10,997
I'm sorry. I promise I won't do that again.

342
00:27:14,604 --> 00:27:18,232
I won't be mad.
I don't want to ruin the atmosphere.

343
00:27:18,232 --> 00:27:20,483
This might be my last outing, after all.

344
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:23,579
I think I'll really miss moments like this.

345
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:24,991
Then don't resign.

346
00:27:28,016 --> 00:27:29,722
You can join outings like this more often!

347
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:42,046
Prim!

348
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:53,640
It's just a gas canister exploding, Prim.

349
00:28:03,854 --> 00:28:05,654
Have you two seen the new girl, Mind?

350
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,300
What's up with you, Yong?

351
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,732
I'm a gentleman.

352
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:26,203
So, have you two seen Mind or not?

353
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:31,651
Don't let me see you.
I'll hit you even shorter!

354
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:42,500
Bhum, may I return the breast to you then…

355
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,260
I mean, let me return this to you, Bhum.

356
00:28:46,013 --> 00:28:47,106
Thank you.

357
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:17,805
Bhum, are you okay?

358
00:29:18,418 --> 00:29:19,418
I'm not okay.

359
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,132
I think you might have hurt your leg.

360
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,208
In that case,
how about letting me carry you on my back?

361
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:27,488
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

362
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:30,031
Let's go.

363
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:53,971
What's wrong, my son?

364
00:29:53,971 --> 00:29:57,598
Tham! What's happening to you? Tham, Tham!

365
00:29:57,598 --> 00:30:02,375
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Tham, How are you, my son? Huh?

366
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,343
How are you, son?

367
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,730
Are you okay?

368
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:10,471
I'm okay.

369
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,500
- Tham…
- Tham!

370
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,500
Tham!

371
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,272
When I was kidnapped,

372
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:23,526
I remember hearing a bang like that.

373
00:30:24,786 --> 00:30:28,674
Ever since then,
I've been scared of loud noises.

374
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,416
<i>Don't cry.</i>

375
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:54,914
<i>I'll give you some delicious snacks, okay?</i>

376
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:11,988
<i>Is it good?</i>

377
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:28,290
The prince gave me this snack,
and it made my fear go away back then.

378
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:34,172
As I grew up,
whenever I felt scared or stressed,

379
00:31:34,972 --> 00:31:36,694
I would take this snack and eat it.

380
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,208
He saved my life, so I want to meet him again

381
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:46,693
and remember everything that happened that day.

382
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:21,112
You know… I used to have a dog.
It was a Golden Retriever.

383
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:24,464
Its name was Big Bang
Andromeda Supernova Sonic.

384
00:32:26,063 --> 00:32:27,716
Are you sure that's a name?

385
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,790
Yeah.

386
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:35,037
Big Bang Andromeda
Supernova Sonic was a dog I loved so much.

387
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:37,474
It rarely barked and was very smart.

388
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:41,118
But Big Bang Andromeda Supernova Sonic, it had…

389
00:32:41,118 --> 00:32:43,590
Just call it Big Bang.

390
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:46,849
Okay.

391
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:52,151
Big Bang had one peculiar habit.

392
00:32:52,921 --> 00:32:56,659
It loved to bury
the bones it chewed on in my yard.

393
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:59,903
And it never dug them up again to chew.

394
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:02,313
It just left them buried there.

395
00:33:03,797 --> 00:33:05,285
Is it forgetful?

396
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:07,265
I'm not sure.

397
00:33:09,136 --> 00:33:10,891
Big Bang has been gone for a long time now.

398
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,082
But I've never felt the need
to dig up those bones and look at them again.

399
00:33:19,061 --> 00:33:21,026
Even if I were to dig them up now,

400
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:23,849
they might have decayed already.

401
00:33:28,123 --> 00:33:29,971
Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?

402
00:33:32,306 --> 00:33:34,918
If you have something to say,
just say it directly.

403
00:33:34,918 --> 00:33:36,518
There's no need to beat around the bush.

404
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,766
I want to tell you that bad old memories…

405
00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:43,457
you shouldn't dig them up again.

406
00:33:46,297 --> 00:33:47,684
The kidnapping,

407
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:50,632
my brother,

408
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:53,738
my family, and me.

409
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:57,463
Everyone went through pain because of it.

410
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,225
It was barely bearable to get through.

411
00:34:02,689 --> 00:34:03,800
I care about you

412
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:07,721
and don't want you to suffer like we did.

413
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,021
I understand,

414
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:17,004
but that day, even though it was
a terrible memory,

415
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:23,516
Tham took care of me
and made sure I survived to this day.

416
00:34:24,424 --> 00:34:26,141
That's why I want to thank him.

417
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,776
I hope you understand.

418
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:35,005
Okay, I respect your decision.

419
00:34:36,502 --> 00:34:38,646
You do as you wish,

420
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,515
I'll handle my feelings on my own.

421
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,582
But I'll stay by your side like this,
no matter what.

422
00:35:15,151 --> 00:35:16,544
So handsome…

423
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:21,114
Why is he suddenly this handsome?

424
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:52,624
Why is she acting so weird?

425
00:35:52,624 --> 00:35:53,625
Big sis!

426
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,340
What are you doing?

427
00:35:56,976 --> 00:35:58,270
Just standing there, breathing.

428
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,066
Breathing?

429
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:05,773
Yeah, just standing around breathing,
wasting the day like always, right?

430
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:09,529
Let me go breathe somewhere else.

431
00:36:10,164 --> 00:36:12,331
- Bye, bye!
- Wait, hold up.

432
00:36:13,152 --> 00:36:14,825
What? What's up with her?

433
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:17,114
- She makes a weird high-pitched sound.
- She's weird!

434
00:36:17,114 --> 00:36:18,380
- Everything is weird.
- Go.

435
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:28,375
And the winning team for this game is…

436
00:36:28,957 --> 00:36:30,502
Kawee and Mind!

437
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:33,189
Yes! Yes!

438
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,998
Thank you for the iPad!

439
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:45,939
I'll make sure to use this iPad
to benefit the company as much as I can,

440
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:47,604
so you won't regret it, sir.

441
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:49,891
So dramatic.

442
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,544
Thank you!

443
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,864
Yay, congratulations!

444
00:37:25,465 --> 00:37:26,465
Have you thanked me yet?

445
00:37:28,308 --> 00:37:29,334
For what?

446
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,041
Fine,

447
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:33,900
don't thank me then.

448
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:37,583
But you should really feel grateful to me.

449
00:37:40,036 --> 00:37:41,036
Grateful? For what?

450
00:37:42,453 --> 00:37:44,455
For the iPad I won for you.

451
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:49,878
Honestly, I should have gotten both iPads.

452
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:50,878
What?

453
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:54,138
We won this game because we found eight items.

454
00:37:54,798 --> 00:37:56,442
I found six, and you found two.

455
00:37:57,022 --> 00:38:00,014
Looking at your performance,
leaving me stuck on the tree,

456
00:38:00,827 --> 00:38:04,530
tossing my favorite jacket without a care,

457
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,651
you should've been content
with just getting the charger.

458
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:11,979
But I'm not a petty person.

459
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:13,612
I'm quite a gentleman.

460
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,524
You just need to be grateful and remember this.

461
00:38:23,297 --> 00:38:24,297
And…

462
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:28,393
You must keep my secret until the day you die.

463
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:30,683
Got it?

464
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,896
Understood, Kawee.

465
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:41,951
Good.

466
00:38:50,237 --> 00:38:52,285
Are there really people like this in the world?

467
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,322
Actually,
you didn't have to walk me to the room.

468
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:05,826
Why not? Are you afraid someone will see us?

469
00:39:07,551 --> 00:39:09,340
Let them see. It's actually a good thing.

470
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,501
They'll know you're already taken.

471
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:18,279
But honestly, it's kind of a shame.

472
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:20,856
Why's that?

473
00:39:22,392 --> 00:39:23,418
We could have…

474
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:27,832
stayed in the same room.

475
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:30,642
Oh my gosh, sir!

476
00:39:32,606 --> 00:39:35,744
Boss! I'm sorry! Are you okay?

477
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,932
It's nothing, just a little thing.

478
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:43,494
Just falling on top of a cactus.

479
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:46,629
But why does my face
feel weirdly itchy and stinging?

480
00:39:58,138 --> 00:39:59,570
This is the last one, Boss.

481
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:04,629
What are you laughing at, Secretary Prim?
I'm in pain here.

482
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:07,486
I'm sorry,

483
00:40:07,486 --> 00:40:08,486
but…

484
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:12,071
your face looks so funny right now.

485
00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:22,834
Are you allergic to anything?

486
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:26,533
When I'm in hot weather
or exposed to dust or smoke,

487
00:40:27,497 --> 00:40:29,051
my skin tends to itch like this.

488
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,527
Well, wait a moment.
I'll go get some medicine for you.

489
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:41,838
Here you go.

490
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,529
Thanks so much, Secretary Prim.

491
00:40:47,629 --> 00:40:50,505
You're always prepared for me
in any situations.

492
00:40:50,505 --> 00:40:51,719
You take such good care of me.

493
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:54,783
It's a part of my job, sir.

494
00:40:57,366 --> 00:41:00,068
But from now, I don't want you
to do it just because it's your duty.

495
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:04,131
I want you to do it
because it's from your heart.

496
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:11,948
I think I'll go rest now.

497
00:41:11,948 --> 00:41:13,355
I'm suddenly feeling a bit sleepy.

498
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:20,066
What?

499
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:22,499
The medicine hasn't even been applied yet.

500
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:27,377
Well,

501
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:31,385
every time you're in the meeting,
everything goes so smoothly.

502
00:41:31,385 --> 00:41:32,745
You're awesome, my boss.

503
00:41:33,531 --> 00:41:37,220
Of course, I am.
Because I'm Cholathorn Theeranonsakun.

504
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,129
There's nothing I can't do.

505
00:41:41,922 --> 00:41:44,619
I shouldn't have opened the opportunity
for you to praise yourself.

506
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:45,619
What did you say?

507
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:50,257
Right, Boss. You're amazing.
Long live Theeranonsakun.

508
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,068
Anyway, I have an urgent project
that needs your help, really urgent.

509
00:41:56,068 --> 00:41:57,842
Why? Are you launching a new business line?

510
00:41:57,842 --> 00:41:59,568
Or opening a mall overseas?

511
00:42:02,777 --> 00:42:05,077
Is this the big urgent project
you're talking about?

512
00:42:05,077 --> 00:42:06,341
Yep.

513
00:42:06,341 --> 00:42:08,339
You want me to help you pick meat for steaks?

514
00:42:10,034 --> 00:42:14,190
Yeah, last time I made barbecue,
I felt like I didn't choose the right cuts.

515
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,629
This time it's an important occasion.
I need to be meticulous.

516
00:42:17,629 --> 00:42:21,549
Important occasion?
Who are you making steak for?

517
00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:23,345
Just focus on picking the meat.

518
00:42:25,682 --> 00:42:26,842
Oh, well…

519
00:42:28,148 --> 00:42:29,239
what about this coconut?

520
00:42:30,899 --> 00:42:32,707
You're unaware of my secret skill.

521
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:42,977
Don't ask me, Director. I don't know as well.

522
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,282
Hello!

523
00:43:04,411 --> 00:43:07,209
Pear, why didn't you tell me you were coming?

524
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,736
Why, do I need to tell you first?

525
00:43:09,736 --> 00:43:12,364
Or… are you hiding someone in your room, huh?

526
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:19,002
No one.

527
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:22,899
Well, I just got back from Korea.

528
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:26,460
I brought lots of cosmetics and snacks for you!

529
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,286
Thank you so much!

530
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:29,539
Got it!

531
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:32,287
Don't you think
you should at least invite me inside?

532
00:43:33,227 --> 00:43:35,806
No. I have to go out soon.

533
00:43:35,806 --> 00:43:36,806
Where are you going?

534
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:40,566
I need to take
some contract documents to my boss.

535
00:43:40,566 --> 00:43:41,780
Right now?

536
00:43:42,332 --> 00:43:44,095
Well, yeah.

537
00:43:44,095 --> 00:43:46,663
If my boss wants to work, I have to go, right?

538
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:51,578
Really? And for just showing him documents,
do you need to dress up this nicely?

539
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:55,014
Dress up? This is just normal!

540
00:43:55,845 --> 00:43:59,184
Turn around. Just turn around.

541
00:43:59,184 --> 00:44:00,184
Turn around!

542
00:44:02,487 --> 00:44:03,607
Can you turn around slowly?

543
00:44:06,129 --> 00:44:07,129
Turn around.

544
00:44:10,768 --> 00:44:14,404
It's clear now. Prim, put your hands together.

545
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:16,437
Enough! No need to lecture me.

546
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:18,010
Hey, Pear, I really need to go now.

547
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,310
Please lock the door for me. I'm going. Bye!

548
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,656
Wait, Prim, Prim! Prim!

549
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,200
Boss.

550
00:44:34,996 --> 00:44:36,184
You look beautiful today.

551
00:44:37,459 --> 00:44:38,459
Thank you.

552
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:40,831
What are you up to, sir?

553
00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:44,000
Oh, I'm cooking for you.

554
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,806
I wanted to make up for the barbecue last time.

555
00:44:45,806 --> 00:44:48,060
I felt the flavor wasn't perfect enough.

556
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,866
So today, I'm going to show you
the art of grilling meat.

557
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:55,127
You know, Secretary Prim,
grilling meat is a high-level art

558
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:56,585
that not just anyone can master.

559
00:44:56,585 --> 00:44:59,140
But I can because I studied it.

560
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:02,618
When I lived abroad, my friends at university
loved my cooking skills.

561
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,454
- Boss, sir!
- Wait!

562
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:05,460
I'm not finished yet.

563
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,739
Do you know Joe Biden?

564
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:07,979
Did he ever try your cooking?

565
00:45:07,979 --> 00:45:09,819
No, but I really want him to.

566
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:11,779
I'm confident he'd love my cooking skills.

567
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:13,739
- Boss!
- Wait, I'm not finished yet.

568
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,060
Do you know Steve Jobs?

569
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,945
- He's never tried your cooking, has he?
- Of course not, he's passed away.

570
00:45:16,945 --> 00:45:18,539
- How could he possibly try it?
- Boss!

571
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:19,739
Wait, I'm not finished yet.

572
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:22,551
- Do you know…
- Enough bragging! It's burning!

573
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:23,551
What?

574
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:25,864
Oh no! Fire!

575
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:31,960
Fire! Fire! Watch out!

576
00:45:33,146 --> 00:45:34,146
Boss!

577
00:45:35,741 --> 00:45:36,741
Boss!

578
00:45:38,941 --> 00:45:41,630
- Move, move! Move!
- Why did you get in the pool?

579
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:54,293
Oh, it's all ruined.

580
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,262
Are you laughing at me for burning the meat?

581
00:46:02,032 --> 00:46:04,466
No, I'm laughing because…

582
00:46:04,466 --> 00:46:06,865
you jumped into the pool to get water?

583
00:46:08,294 --> 00:46:09,294
Oh, well…

584
00:46:10,121 --> 00:46:13,314
my brain tends to get confused
when I have to face the unexpected situations.

585
00:46:13,314 --> 00:46:14,689
It sort of malfunctions.

586
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:18,721
But more importantly, I was worried.

587
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:21,623
Worried about the meat burning, huh?

588
00:46:23,092 --> 00:46:24,220
No, worried about you.

589
00:46:28,526 --> 00:46:30,556
The fire was pretty intense, you know.

590
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,737
Thank you for worrying about me.

591
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,512
The more I look, the sadder it gets.

592
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,417
It's okay.

593
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:51,485
We can just clean the grill
and cook the meat again.

594
00:46:51,485 --> 00:46:52,878
It's no problem. I can wait.

595
00:46:53,848 --> 00:46:55,169
All the meat's gone.

596
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,240
Did you burn all the meat?

597
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,979
Yeah, I just wanted to make the perfect steak,

598
00:47:00,979 --> 00:47:03,326
but none of the pieces
came out the way I wanted.

599
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,917
A genius like me,
skilled at everything in the world,

600
00:47:10,946 --> 00:47:11,963
except grilling meat.

601
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:17,460
Well, wait for a moment.

602
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,579
I'll go buy more meat
and grill it for you again.

603
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:21,339
Oh, no need, really.

604
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,236
I'd rather not
have to call the fire department.

605
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:25,993
But… it's…

606
00:47:25,993 --> 00:47:28,012
We can find something else to eat.

607
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:34,220
Alright, then what do you feel like eating?

608
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,105
Want me to order Michelin-starred food for you?

609
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,017
I don't feel like
having Michelin-starred food today.

610
00:47:40,017 --> 00:47:42,157
Just something simple from your fridge will do.

611
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:45,982
Something simple?

612
00:47:46,853 --> 00:47:48,650
So simple you wouldn't even think of it.

613
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,172
From premium-grade steak…

614
00:47:58,819 --> 00:48:00,862
to plain instant noodles, just like that.

615
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:04,501
Take a closer look, sir.

616
00:48:13,386 --> 00:48:15,025
Looks delicious, doesn't it?

617
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,902
I whipped this up using
leftovers from your fridge.

618
00:48:19,979 --> 00:48:22,260
Food doesn't have to be perfect, you know.

619
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,211
The person next to me
is making the food perfect.

620
00:48:28,745 --> 00:48:29,745
Let's try it.

621
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:41,278
You're eating it wrong!

622
00:48:41,278 --> 00:48:44,205
To make it taste better,
you have to eat it like this.

623
00:48:48,686 --> 00:48:50,105
Does it really have to be that way?

624
00:49:03,413 --> 00:49:04,477
It does taste better!

625
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,263
- Right?
- Yes.

626
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:27,060
Boss!

627
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,443
- What?
- How are you eating?

628
00:49:28,443 --> 00:49:30,803
The noodles are coming out of your nose!

629
00:49:30,803 --> 00:49:31,805
Really?

630
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:56,892
<i>Who's going to die first?</i>

631
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:05,634
<i>The spotted spider over there,
I saw it struggling…</i>

632
00:50:21,198 --> 00:50:23,157
Where are you going to push me this time?

633
00:50:23,157 --> 00:50:24,684
I'd like to prepare myself.

634
00:50:24,684 --> 00:50:26,123
This way or that way?

635
00:50:27,773 --> 00:50:28,779
Well… it's just--

636
00:50:28,779 --> 00:50:31,745
Is it because my breath smells bad?
Or are you scared of something?

637
00:50:31,745 --> 00:50:35,307
- No, it's not--
- I've wondered why you act like this.

638
00:50:35,307 --> 00:50:36,804
But I can't figure it out.

639
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:39,930
If there's something bothering you,
you can tell me.

640
00:50:44,065 --> 00:50:45,633
Well, every time I close my eyes,

641
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:48,393
I keep seeing ghosts.

642
00:50:48,393 --> 00:50:49,393
Ghosts?

643
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:53,692
There! Ghosts, ghosts!

644
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,307
Boss!

645
00:51:03,173 --> 00:51:04,173
I'm kidding.

646
00:51:08,373 --> 00:51:09,956
I'm scared of something.

647
00:51:12,606 --> 00:51:15,151
But I'll try my best
to overcome this fear for you.

648
00:51:29,939 --> 00:51:32,132
Thee! Thee!

649
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:33,132
Oh!

650
00:51:38,631 --> 00:51:39,852
Well…

651
00:51:39,852 --> 00:51:42,354
I was just bringing wine
to eat with the steaks.

652
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:43,354
But…

653
00:51:44,046 --> 00:51:47,936
wine doesn't really go
with something this spicy, does it?

654
00:51:48,759 --> 00:51:50,265
It's fine. Let's do this.

655
00:51:50,265 --> 00:51:54,790
Don't overthink it.
Just pretend I was never here, okay?

656
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:58,009
Prim was about to leave anyway.
It's getting late.

657
00:51:58,009 --> 00:51:59,854
- I'm going now.
- Hey, Prim.

658
00:51:59,854 --> 00:52:01,968
Oh, Prim, your bag!

659
00:52:19,712 --> 00:52:21,722
Thee, sorry, my friend.

660
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,072
- Pat!
- Huh?

661
00:52:23,072 --> 00:52:24,072
Come here!

662
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,380
Huh?

663
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,060
You're dead meat!

664
00:52:32,437 --> 00:52:33,485
Hey, hey!

665
00:52:33,485 --> 00:52:35,552
UFO! UFO! Oh!

666
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,629
Hey! Pat, Pat!

667
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,340
Get back here, Pat!

668
00:52:53,255 --> 00:52:55,160
Prim, can you help me with something?

669
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,393
Oh, of course!

670
00:52:56,393 --> 00:52:59,383
I want Thee. Can you arrange that for me?

671
00:53:00,152 --> 00:53:01,152
Excuse me?

672
00:53:01,886 --> 00:53:03,281
Are they really back together now?

673
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:04,293
How about that?

674
00:53:04,293 --> 00:53:06,158
Your boss got taken away by someone else!

675
00:53:07,232 --> 00:53:09,451
Thanks for making me meet Prim again.

676
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:14,149
You can keep thanking me all you want because
Prim will always be by my side for life.
