1
00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:09,476
It was my fault that day.
I decided to let things go

2
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:12,579
because I thought
if the two of you switched names,

3
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:13,800
everything would be over.

4
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,719
Please forgive Dad and Mom.

5
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,449
I believe everything will get better
from now on.

6
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:19,817
I'm sorry for everything.

7
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:22,528
And I wish you the best in everything,
little Thee.

8
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:24,447
You're welcome, Tham.

9
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:25,614
You found it?

10
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:26,714
Thank you!

11
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:30,612
Are you really dating Prim?

12
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:32,080
We are together,

13
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,800
and we won't break up easily.

14
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,888
Don't let me see you walking around with Prim

15
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,201
out in public like this again, understand?

16
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:41,844
If we feel something,
we should speak up and let others know.

17
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:44,386
People should be honest
with their own feelings.

18
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:47,206
Can I be honest with my feelings now?

19
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,591
These huge strawberries…

20
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:01,700
can only be properly enjoyed in Japan.

21
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:04,477
They're really big!

22
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:07,588
Wait, wait.

23
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:09,898
Why do I suddenly feel…

24
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:12,180
Some wicked energy.

25
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,535
Oh!

26
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:16,535
It's you.

27
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,960
What's wrong?

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,513
Why are you staring at me like that?

29
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:49,168
You should pick it up. It could be important.

30
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,365
Seems like it's not so important.

31
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,965
[Pat]

32
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:24,033
I'm telling you, if it's not important,
you might as well arrange his funeral.

33
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:35,628
Why are you calling me so late at night?

34
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:38,649
This is late?

35
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,353
You usually come home late anyway.

36
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:43,453
Where were you?

37
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:48,330
Or were you busy fooling around with someone?

38
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,338
I swear I wanna reach through this phone
and smack you.

39
00:03:52,338 --> 00:03:53,719
What is it?

40
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,765
If it's not urgent, you're dead meat.

41
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:58,738
Oh, acting tough now, Daddy?

42
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,157
Look, man.

43
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,949
That Michelin-starred hot pot restaurant…

44
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,582
we were expecting to open at our new mall…

45
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:06,018
They're not opening anymore.

46
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:07,397
Is that urgent enough for you?

47
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,585
What happened?

48
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:11,427
I thought the contract was already signed?

49
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,749
I don't know either.

50
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:15,899
They postponed, then canceled out of nowhere.

51
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:18,134
But if I guess

52
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:21,105
I think he was making a deal
with our rival mall.

53
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:23,768
I've already checked our rival mall…

54
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:26,645
They wanted this restaurant to open there.

55
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:30,304
Then I'll go to negotiate with them again.

56
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,853
What? You're flying there to talk to them?

57
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:34,800
Will they even have time to meet with you?

58
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:37,740
They have to make time for me
because I need to talk to them.

59
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,023
You're coming with me.

60
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:40,023
Tomorrow?

61
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,221
Alright, I'm going.

62
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:48,179
Wait.

63
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,240
If I go tomorrow morning,

64
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:52,695
I won't see Prim for several days.

65
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:57,717
I can't just stay still tonight.

66
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:06,092
Fell asleep already?

67
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:10,307
We were just getting into it,
how can you fall asleep now?

68
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,452
Sleeping like a log.

69
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:27,749
You won't see me for days.

70
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:31,467
You're really not going to wake up
and continue?

71
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:39,952
You're really not going to wake up?

72
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:46,101
Don't regret this later.

73
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:06,335
She must've been tired.

74
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:30,120
Hey,

75
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,325
you're probably
worried about the client, right?

76
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,380
Don't worry.

77
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,099
Because I prepared the documents
for you very well

78
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:38,140
covering every angle.

79
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,699
I guarantee the client will change their mind.

80
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,219
- Eat some strawberries to ease the stress?
- I don't want that.

81
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:45,410
I'm not worried about the client.

82
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,477
People who are good at everything, like me,
don't worry about anything.

83
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:50,357
Right.

84
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:52,674
People as confident as you
don't have to fear anything?

85
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:54,847
Even if you are talking to Putin,
you probably are not afraid of anything.

86
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,527
I'm not scared. I've talked to him before.

87
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:01,650
You've talked to Putin?

88
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:03,585
Is it true?

89
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:06,512
When was that? How come I never knew?

90
00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:07,612
You're kidding!

91
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,146
Hey!

92
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:29,618
What are you thinking?

93
00:07:29,618 --> 00:07:30,679
So silly.

94
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,060
Yes, Boss?

95
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:46,019
Hello.

96
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:47,711
I'm in a meeting
with the Japanese side right now.

97
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,160
But I really miss my dear secretary.

98
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:53,153
Love you!

99
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,118
Miss you too.

100
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,650
Why are you speaking so softly?

101
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,378
And why didn't you say you love me too?

102
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:03,136
If you don't say it, I'm not hanging up.

103
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:05,597
Boss!

104
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:07,607
Say it.

105
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:09,059
Quickly, come on.

106
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:16,196
I love you, too.

107
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,260
That's it.

108
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:27,673
What a tease!

109
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,773
Who's teasing you, Prim?

110
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,619
When did you get here?

111
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:34,269
And how much did you hear?

112
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,935
I only heard something about teasing.

113
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,159
Thank goodness!

114
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,240
Who's good?

115
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,350
No, nothing.

116
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,752
I'll go buy some coffee.

117
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:47,072
Oh, wait.

118
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:48,319
Isn't this coffee?

119
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,074
Well, I like to eat two glasses
at the same time.

120
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,162
Yeah, I'm going.

121
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,979
Seems suspicious…

122
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:01,822
- Prim seems suspicious?
- Prim seems suspicious?

123
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:05,201
Yeah, she was acting strange,
secretly talking on the phone.

124
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:07,762
And when I asked, she got all flustered
and tried to cover it up.

125
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:09,357
Like she's hiding something.

126
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:10,423
Oh my gosh, damn it.

127
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:14,829
Hearing this is making
my gossip radar go off like crazy!

128
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:17,574
- Right?
- Wait, or maybe…

129
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:18,763
Maybe?

130
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:20,361
Do you know something, Goody?

131
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:23,871
Nope, I was just startled.

132
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,306
Speaking of secrets, the other day,

133
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:35,267
I saw Yong following a woman into a van.

134
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:36,294
- Huh?
- Huh?

135
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:38,660
Oh, is Yong seeing someone?

136
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,450
Or could it be someone from our office?

137
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,792
I couldn't see her face clearly.

138
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,273
I don't think so.

139
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:46,987
Oh, or she is?

140
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,075
It must be "Pen, dear" for sure!

141
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:51,620
Pen… Pen, who?

142
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,347
Yong always talks to that "Pen, dear"
on the phone.

143
00:09:55,347 --> 00:09:57,478
He keeps calling her "Pen, dear"
and "Pen, love".

144
00:09:57,478 --> 00:09:58,632
It's so annoying!

145
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,478
Just thinking about it makes me irritated!

146
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:04,053
Come on, why are you so angry, huh?

147
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:05,893
That "Pen" burned your house or something?

148
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,439
Huh?

149
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,550
I just have a stomachache,
so I got a bit irritated.

150
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:14,412
I'll go to the bathroom first.

151
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:17,497
What's wrong with her?

152
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:20,086
Isn't Sis Bhum acting a bit suspicious, too?

153
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,991
- Crap!
- It's not a crap, it's steamed sticky rice.

154
00:10:27,984 --> 00:10:30,134
I brought it for you, Bhum.

155
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:31,934
I've been looking for you all over the place.

156
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:34,332
You… brought it for me?

157
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:35,332
That's right.

158
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:39,430
Why's that?
And the boss isn't even at work today.

159
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,353
You still showed up for work?

160
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:44,259
Shouldn't you be taking
your girlfriend out somewhere?

161
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,549
Girlfriend? Please!

162
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:48,218
Look at me, who would want me, Bhum?

163
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:53,225
Oh, the one you were talking to
on the phone the other day.

164
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:55,411
That "Pen, dear" or "Pen, love".

165
00:10:57,996 --> 00:10:59,470
Stop! What's so funny?

166
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,111
It's not funny at all! You think this is funny?

167
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,326
Yes, yeah.

168
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:06,961
But do you want to meet "Pen, dear"?

169
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:09,986
No, why would I?

170
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:14,390
Great! I've been wanting to see
who Pen is for a long time.

171
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,251
But I'd really love for you to meet her, Bhum.

172
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:18,251
Would you mind?

173
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:21,674
You're so persistent!

174
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:22,914
Since you're insisting so much,

175
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,844
I'll go.

176
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:28,306
But let me tell you, I really don't want to go.

177
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:30,072
That way, right?

178
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,389
- Yes.
- Okay.

179
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:33,565
Bhum.

180
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:36,244
Wow, didn't want to go, huh?
But you're moving pretty fast.

181
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,852
So, where's Pen?

182
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:44,359
Well, right here, Bhum.

183
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,404
So it's her, huh?

184
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:54,469
Her face is so plain,

185
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:57,895
average-looking, not charming at all.

186
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:00,272
What's with the 'tch'?

187
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:02,886
You suddenly giving me that look?
Want me to slap you?

188
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:03,909
Oh my!

189
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:05,388
What are you angry about?

190
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:06,608
Don't let me see you again!

191
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:11,486
Bhum, who are you talking to?

192
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:13,742
That "Pen, dear" right there!

193
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:15,179
"Pen, dear" is here.

194
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,436
- Huh?
- Right here.

195
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:20,107
This grandmother is Pen?

196
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,107
Yes, ma'am.

197
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,327
Oh, so, you mean

198
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:27,341
this grandma is the mother of your mother

199
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:29,979
who gave birth to you?

200
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:31,470
Yes, my grandma.

201
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,089
My grandma is old and doesn't have much to do,

202
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:34,822
so she sells steamed sticky rice here.

203
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:37,919
Grandma, this is Bhum,
the one I often talk about.

204
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,031
Stop teasing! Is this a prank?

205
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:41,851
Did you just dress someone up
to be your grandma?

206
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:44,554
Let me see. Is this real hair?

207
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:47,132
Did you put powder on it?
Is this hair powdered or what?

208
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:51,599
I'm really old, dear.
Who would joke around like a kid?

209
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:53,952
My real grandma.

210
00:12:58,154 --> 00:12:59,675
I'm sorry, Grandma.

211
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:01,106
It's just… when I was little,

212
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:04,214
I used to hire motorcycle taxi drivers
to pretend to be my parent.

213
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:07,759
So, I thought Yong was playing a prank, too.

214
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:11,800
Oh, so she's Bhum?

215
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
Pretty.

216
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:16,565
Cute.

217
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:19,988
And funny, just like he told me.

218
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:25,144
Oh, Grandma!

219
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,380
Excuse me?

220
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,777
You still can't return yet?

221
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,939
Didn't you say it went smoothly?

222
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,585
It's been three days.
Why haven't you come back yet?

223
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:39,436
The Japanese side still hasn't agreed.

224
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:42,119
I'm trying to convince their CEO.

225
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:46,060
Pat and I used every strategy we have.

226
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,289
I didn't expect it to drag this long, either.

227
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:51,973
If I had known this,
I would've gone with you to help.

228
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:55,436
I miss you so much already.

229
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:57,929
Hello?

230
00:13:58,762 --> 00:13:59,762
Hello?

231
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:01,641
Did he hang up?

232
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:03,745
Hello?

233
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:05,492
I'm still here.

234
00:14:05,492 --> 00:14:07,044
I'm just really happy

235
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:10,060
my girlfriend said she misses me so much.

236
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,290
In that case, I should stay even longer,

237
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,637
so you'll miss me even more.

238
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:16,626
No way! Stop dawdling.

239
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:19,240
Hurry up with your work and come back soon.

240
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,426
That's all for now.

241
00:14:24,923 --> 00:14:26,925
Why did it feel like
my girlfriend just scolded me?

242
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:29,783
But it feels kind of nice.

243
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,057
Don't you guys think…

244
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:43,919
Ever since the boss has been away,

245
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,316
Our work runs smoothly and peacefully.

246
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:53,434
Totally! The atmosphere feels
strangely refreshing!

247
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:57,675
Look, I heard there's a storm
over there right now.

248
00:14:57,675 --> 00:15:00,387
The airport might close,
and flights could be delayed.

249
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:03,997
So does that mean
the boss will be staying longer?

250
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:08,452
If that's the case,
I shall make a wish to the sacred powers.

251
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:13,539
Please let the boss be stuck in a storm
five, six, seven, eight, or nine storms!

252
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,210
Amen!

253
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:18,195
As good employees,

254
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:19,882
we should hope our boss returns soon.

255
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:21,817
So the company can continue running smoothly.

256
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:25,056
Everyone, put your hands together!

257
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,659
- P-P-Put our hands…
- Put our hands together.

258
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,979
- Say together, please.
- "Together."

259
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:30,979
Not funny.

260
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:33,899
May the Triple Gem

261
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,220
"May the Triple Gem"

262
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,579
and all the powers that exist

263
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:39,779
"and all the powers that exist"

264
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,018
in the world

265
00:15:41,018 --> 00:15:42,739
"in the world"

266
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:45,108
grant our boss a swift return.

267
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:49,640
"grant our boss a swift return."

268
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,699
Come back quickly.

269
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,566
"Come back quickly."

270
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:54,052
Because I'm dying to see him.

271
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:57,281
"Because I'm dying to see him."

272
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:00,766
Amen.

273
00:16:00,766 --> 00:16:02,986
"Amen."

274
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:04,291
Very good, everyone.

275
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:10,180
"I'm dying to see him."

276
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,458
Is it strange?

277
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,373
That's weird, really weird.

278
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,220
When you use it for too long,
the machine gets a little funny like this.

279
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:31,421
Press the pink button once,

280
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,879
then press the yellow button twice,

281
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:39,623
and you can now press the green button.

282
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,272
Thank you.

283
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,754
Kawee, you're so kind, charming
and great at your job.

284
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:55,920
That's why you're everyone's favorite
in the office.

285
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,224
You flattered me.

286
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:00,479
If Kawee had a girlfriend,

287
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,951
all the girls in the office would be
heartbroken and lose focus on their work.

288
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:06,391
I don't plan on having a girlfriend.

289
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,804
I'm afraid the girls might get too distracted

290
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:10,146
and the company could go bankrupt
because of me.

291
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:15,384
And should I fire you
before the company goes bankrupt?

292
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,569
- Hello, Boss.
- Hello, Boss.

293
00:17:22,856 --> 00:17:24,144
Why do you come to this department so often?

294
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,740
Does your department
not have a photocopy machine?

295
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,593
Oh, our photocopy machine is often broken.

296
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:29,711
I'll buy seven new machines for you,
each one for a different day.

297
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:30,934
Oh, thank you.

298
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:33,867
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:37,886
Or…

300
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:41,562
Are you coming to this department on purpose
to make the girls…

301
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:44,444
heartbroken and distracted,

302
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,254
causing my company to go bankrupt?

303
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:50,979
No, sir.

304
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:54,601
Follow me to my room.

305
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:00,841
- Not you.
- Yes, sir.

306
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:04,239
Secretary Prim,

307
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,567
follow me to the room.

308
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:06,567
Yes.

309
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,257
What is the boss angry about?

310
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:18,075
He came in and started yelling at us.

311
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:19,917
Exactly, my heart skipped a beat.

312
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:21,473
I was almost getting fired right then.

313
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:23,987
- That was close, wasn't it--
- Yeah.

314
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:35,899
Anyway, thanks for
helping with the photocopying.

315
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:49,115
Why is your face red?

316
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:50,754
- Huh?
- Are you not feeling well?

317
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:53,156
No.

318
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:55,159
No, nothing.

319
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:57,007
I'm okay.

320
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,133
Okay, fine then.

321
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:03,415
Are you done with the copying?

322
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:06,008
Yes.

323
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,799
Bye.

324
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:19,346
That idiot… doesn't know anything.

325
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:28,355
Did you say you couldn't return yet?

326
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,212
I'm upset!

327
00:19:32,324 --> 00:19:34,877
Upset? It's me who should be upset!

328
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:37,145
You finished your work
and didn't say a word to me.

329
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:39,405
You left me waiting, all frustrated, by myself.

330
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:44,470
Don't try to steal the spotlight.
I'm the one who should be upset with you.

331
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,819
I worked hard and rushed back to see you.

332
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,341
I crossed rivers, seas,
and oceans to be with you.

333
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:51,659
I hoped to see your bright smile,

334
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,173
but what I saw was…

335
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:56,422
you smiling at that plain face guy
in a leather jacket.

336
00:19:57,515 --> 00:20:00,950
What smile? I was just talking normally.

337
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,380
Why are you jealous? That's not cute.

338
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,259
Yes, I'm jealous, and I'm possessive of you.

339
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:07,872
From now on, I forbid you.

340
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:10,653
Don't smile at any guys
like that again, got it?

341
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:13,461
Then you also can't tease me

342
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:15,266
and make me miss you like this again.

343
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:17,076
Do you understand?

344
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:18,079
Upset!

345
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,657
Hey, are you pouting back at me?

346
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:25,564
Okay, I'll let you win this time.
Let's call it a tie.

347
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:29,943
But I'm punishing you for making me jealous.

348
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:35,526
Boss, we're at work, you know.

349
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,539
We can do this at home, then? Let's go home.

350
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,329
It's not like that.

351
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:42,650
I'm just worried that others might see us.

352
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,896
It would be good.

353
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:46,180
I could announce that I'm your boyfriend,

354
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,012
and then all the guys in the company
will stop bothering you.

355
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:50,072
Please don't.

356
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:53,121
Why? You don't like me?

357
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,286
No, I don't.

358
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:57,419
I just worry about how others might think.

359
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:01,173
Okay.

360
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:03,200
Then we can continue at home.

361
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,440
So we can pick up
where we left off the other day.

362
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:10,951
Boss, what are you saying?

363
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:13,113
I need to go back to work now.

364
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,779
Before you go, can I have a hug?

365
00:21:19,055 --> 00:21:20,948
Please, I miss you.

366
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,376
We haven't seen each other in days.

367
00:21:27,811 --> 00:21:28,811
All right.

368
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:35,217
You said you were only going to hug me!

369
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:36,784
An extra bonus, ma'am.

370
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:38,925
There's a special promotion too. Want to try?

371
00:21:41,763 --> 00:21:44,511
Boss, what are you doing?

372
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,636
It's the promotion!

373
00:21:46,363 --> 00:21:48,282
A special deal just for you, Prim.

374
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:51,578
- Interested?
- No, thanks.

375
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:53,210
Enough, sir!

376
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,351
So, Thee is dating his secretary?

377
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,385
How did you find out?

378
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,620
Well, the world is so small, Father.

379
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,020
Thawat hired the same investigator as Thada.

380
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,579
And when Thada found out,

381
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:08,778
Thada was, well…

382
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:11,366
His heart dropped to his feet, Father.

383
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:12,779
What's up with Thee?

384
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:15,250
He wouldn't accept
any of our pretty young girls.

385
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,173
But he chose the secretary
sitting right outside his office.

386
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:20,088
If this news gets out,

387
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,595
it's going to ruin our reputation.

388
00:22:21,595 --> 00:22:23,273
Such a disgrace.

389
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,692
Bring Thee and his father
to my house right now.

390
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:30,976
I have something to discuss with him.

391
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:34,206
Sure.

392
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:49,201
When I found out that
you were going to the school event.

393
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,165
I had Mon make you a special outfit.

394
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:56,570
Look, when your friends see it,
they'll be amazed.

395
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,315
Do you like it, Tham?

396
00:22:58,315 --> 00:22:59,315
I like it.

397
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:14,498
Your brother, Thee,
also wanted a prince costume too.

398
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:17,158
So I had her make both outfits at once.

399
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,417
Here, I'm very happy to see little princes…

400
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:27,010
as my own two sons.

401
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,771
You're brothers, so you must love each other.
And don't fight, okay, my children?

402
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,578
You seem to be lost in thought.
What's on your mind, dear?

403
00:23:54,353 --> 00:23:55,884
I was thinking about when I was young,

404
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:59,079
back when I left Thee behind.

405
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:05,319
That happened a long time ago,

406
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,996
don't dwell on it, okay?

407
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:16,756
I can't forget.

408
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:19,930
I left him on purpose.

409
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:22,932
Put him through a bad situation like that.

410
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:29,463
Even though he forgave me now,

411
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,126
I still hate myself.

412
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:42,088
Thee is talented and loved by everyone.

413
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,062
I was jealous of him and wanted to be like him.

414
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:52,078
So I did bad things like that.

415
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:58,525
Mom and Dad are very disappointed in me, right?

416
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:04,683
Not at all.

417
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:07,287
Mom and Dad are the ones at fault

418
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:09,577
for comparing you to Thee.

419
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:13,367
Without thinking of your heart.

420
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,047
That's what caused you pain,

421
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,020
I'm sorry.

422
00:25:18,712 --> 00:25:20,362
I'm also at fault

423
00:25:20,362 --> 00:25:24,302
for not being attentive to your feelings

424
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:28,150
and having you endure the hurt.

425
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:30,973
I'm sorry, dear.

426
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:32,880
Please forgive me and your dad.

427
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,607
It's not too late, is it?

428
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:41,140
To start over again?

429
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:47,137
It's not too late.

430
00:25:47,974 --> 00:25:50,877
Thank you for giving us a chance.

431
00:25:54,157 --> 00:25:55,417
Come here, let's hug.

432
00:25:58,594 --> 00:26:00,500
No need to think too much about it.

433
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:04,364
It's okay, son.

434
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:08,562
Sorry, a call's coming in.

435
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:14,145
Hello?

436
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,573
What?

437
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:18,677
Father found out?

438
00:26:19,757 --> 00:26:21,605
Okay, okay, I'll follow you there.

439
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,466
I really love the passion fruit juice here.

440
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,455
Just the right sweet and sour taste.

441
00:26:42,455 --> 00:26:44,935
As refreshing as our love.

442
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:49,156
If you really like it,
finish it up and come back soon.

443
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:50,500
You've been away for quite--

444
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,775
Do you miss me?

445
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:54,057
That's why you've got so much work piling up.

446
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:57,214
You should hurry back to clear it up.

447
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,531
You're so mean.

448
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:03,442
Don't you miss me?
You're only thinking about work.

449
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:06,166
You know, when I went to Japan,

450
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,477
I saw a couple walking together,
hugging and kissing.

451
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:09,539
It was very sweet.

452
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,529
It made me miss you so much.

453
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:15,557
So I worked hard day and night
to get back to you.

454
00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:19,640
I'm really tired right now.

455
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,854
Can I recharge my energy with you…

456
00:27:21,854 --> 00:27:23,071
For just two hours?

457
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:26,210
I'll give you just one hour.

458
00:27:27,473 --> 00:27:28,825
Just one hour?

459
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,025
In that case, I need a fast charge.

460
00:27:37,545 --> 00:27:39,188
How does that work?

461
00:27:55,432 --> 00:27:57,468
Prim, are you okay?

462
00:28:02,737 --> 00:28:03,737
Prim?

463
00:28:04,939 --> 00:28:06,139
- Yes?
- What's on your mind?

464
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,654
How are you…
planning to charge your energy, Boss?

465
00:28:13,665 --> 00:28:14,665
Just like this.

466
00:28:35,675 --> 00:28:37,795
Boss! Boss…

467
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:42,609
That's enough.

468
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:47,972
Thank you.

469
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,233
Yes, Dad.

470
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:58,798
Grandpa wants to see you
at the main family house.

471
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:00,905
What's the matter?

472
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,217
It's about you and Prim.

473
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:09,747
Okay, I'll go right away.

474
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:17,860
I guess I won't be able to finish my work
and recharge with you after all.

475
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,500
I have to take care of my family matters.

476
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,020
Is everything okay?

477
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,709
Just some trivial things at home.

478
00:29:27,236 --> 00:29:29,284
I'll drop you off at the office first, okay?

479
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:32,164
Let's go.

480
00:29:42,766 --> 00:29:44,566
Did you hear something, Mind?

481
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:46,966
Yes, I did.

482
00:29:49,618 --> 00:29:51,140
It's Goody's voice!

483
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,652
Was that Bhum's voice?

484
00:29:58,135 --> 00:29:59,695
That's Namwan's voice too!

485
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:03,352
Or are they having…

486
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:08,045
Are you crazy? Those three?

487
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:09,501
Probably not.

488
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:38,864
Oh, Prim, Mind!

489
00:30:38,864 --> 00:30:41,995
Would you like to join us?
This is spicy lime salad, delicious!

490
00:30:41,995 --> 00:30:43,167
Spicy lime salad?

491
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:44,174
Yeah.

492
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:47,054
Is that why they're making those sounds?
For the spicy lime salad?

493
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,447
Exactly, Bhum bought it for us all.

494
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,703
Come on, hurry up and eat with us!

495
00:30:51,703 --> 00:30:53,938
It's so tasty!

496
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:58,298
Oh, I thought
someone was doing something like that.

497
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,858
Well, lately, there have been dating rumors.

498
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:07,171
And that people are having
some private moments in the office.

499
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:11,090
Oh, who would do
something dirty like that, right?

500
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,589
Hey, it's possible.

501
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:14,046
There have been so many rumors.

502
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:16,446
They say that
people are making out in the office a lot.

503
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:21,871
It's just a rumor. Who would dare to do that?

504
00:31:21,871 --> 00:31:24,519
At most, they'd just hug, kiss,
or something like that, right?

505
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:29,901
- Hugging and kissing. That's pretty bold!
- Yeah.

506
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:32,301
Hey, should we report this to the director?

507
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:34,326
Oh, should we tell the boss?

508
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,340
- Let's go.
- Go ahead.

509
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,533
- Yeah.
- Right.

510
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:38,239
Oh, no need.

511
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:40,981
Boss doesn't need to know about this.

512
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:42,904
Oh, I just remembered
I have some work to revise.

513
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:44,160
I need to go now.

514
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,311
This is for Director Pat.

515
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:47,311
Hey, wait.

516
00:31:56,906 --> 00:31:59,277
Hey, who are you packing that for?

517
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:01,844
Oh, I'm giving it to my dog at home.

518
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:06,116
What's that?

519
00:32:06,116 --> 00:32:07,190
- What?
- Huh?

520
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,208
Your dog eats spicy lime salad, too?

521
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:11,662
Yeah! She got pregnant,
so she started craving something sour.

522
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,284
Wait, wait a minute.

523
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:17,970
- When did you raise a dog?
- Yesterday.

524
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:18,970
- What breed?
- Chihuahua.

525
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,084
- Male or female?
- Male.

526
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:21,220
- Long fur or short?
- Short.

527
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,329
- How many legs?
- Eight.

528
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:25,785
You, liar! What kind of dog has eight legs?

529
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:29,161
Hey, why are you so curious about my dog?

530
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:31,295
Just know that I have a dog, that's enough!

531
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:33,920
I'm off. The dog's probably hungry.

532
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:38,806
Doesn't it poop itself
after eating spicy lime salad?

533
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:39,821
Here you go.

534
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:42,536
Oh, thank you, Bhum.

535
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,352
Enjoy your meal! It's really spicy and tangy.

536
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,205
Looks so delicious.

537
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,673
Why do we have to hide like this, Bhum?

538
00:32:59,155 --> 00:33:03,607
Well, I'm just worried that someone might see

539
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,659
and gossip about us negatively.

540
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,879
I brought the salad here

541
00:33:08,879 --> 00:33:11,490
to represent the good friendship

542
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,867
among coworkers.

543
00:33:14,965 --> 00:33:16,442
Just a friendship?

544
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:20,671
Well, what else could it be?

545
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:22,672
You won't even ask me to be your girlfriend.

546
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:24,690
Huh, what did you just say?

547
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,022
Oh… just complaining about little things.

548
00:33:29,022 --> 00:33:32,077
Complaining about work that doesn't make sense.

549
00:33:32,658 --> 00:33:34,890
- Oh.
- Well, I'll go now.

550
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:45,657
Someone said you are dating a secretary?

551
00:33:54,056 --> 00:33:55,110
Who told you, Grandpa?

552
00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:57,689
It doesn't matter who told me.

553
00:33:59,221 --> 00:34:01,698
The question is, is it true?

554
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,231
It's true. I'm dating Prim.

555
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:15,218
I'll give you some time to end things with her.

556
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,590
Anyway, that woman is not right for you.

557
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:22,229
Why is that?

558
00:34:23,387 --> 00:34:25,914
Prim is a good person with a great personality.

559
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:27,347
She's also smart and cute.

560
00:34:28,353 --> 00:34:29,995
I don't see anything wrong with her.

561
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:32,263
Everything you've said…

562
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:37,147
doesn't justify having her as your wife.

563
00:34:39,263 --> 00:34:41,503
Then what would be enough, Grandpa?

564
00:34:41,503 --> 00:34:45,252
Do I have to marry a rich woman
just to make us wealthier?

565
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:46,252
Thee!

566
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:50,149
Don't act like you don't understand
the family's rules.

567
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:56,529
Prim doesn't have the ability
to help our business grow, you know.

568
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:58,116
But I've shown you, Dad.

569
00:34:58,622 --> 00:35:01,277
Don't you see how well
our family's main business is doing now?

570
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,214
I don't need a woman to expand a business.

571
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,083
I truly love Prim.

572
00:35:11,929 --> 00:35:14,644
And I don't want my love life
to be about business

573
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:16,959
or bound by crazy rules of my family like this.

574
00:35:17,652 --> 00:35:20,354
The crazy rules you mentioned…

575
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:25,001
have kept our family going to this day.

576
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:28,529
And this business is a family business.

577
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:31,515
You can't make decisions on your own.

578
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:37,197
If you don't believe me,

579
00:35:38,777 --> 00:35:41,390
I'll let the second line
take over the business.

580
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,106
Father!

581
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,669
If that's how Grandpa wants it, I won't argue.

582
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:17,752
It's nice, so you and I
won't have to be tired anymore.

583
00:36:17,752 --> 00:36:23,064
No way. You know how messed up
the rest of the family's lives are.

584
00:36:23,664 --> 00:36:26,832
They can barely take care of their own family.

585
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:32,755
And everything our family has built

586
00:36:32,755 --> 00:36:35,091
will probably all be destroyed.

587
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:39,967
If the business fails, it won't only be
our family in trouble, you know?

588
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:43,236
Have you ever thought of our employees?

589
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,830
Let me ask you, Thee.

590
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,489
Do you really want one woman

591
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:52,748
to cause trouble for hundreds
or even thousands of people?

592
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:13,325
One woman…

593
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:17,748
with hundreds and thousands of lives?

594
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:25,932
Oh my god!

595
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:27,327
Impossible.

596
00:37:28,256 --> 00:37:29,429
What's wrong, Mind?

597
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,375
Prim, our boss has a girlfriend!

598
00:37:34,149 --> 00:37:35,549
Who has a girlfriend?

599
00:37:36,395 --> 00:37:39,407
Boss, of course. Did you know about this?

600
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:41,691
No way!

601
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:44,284
The boss has a girlfriend? I don't think so!

602
00:37:44,284 --> 00:37:45,424
It's true!

603
00:37:45,424 --> 00:37:47,729
A friend of mine from high school
messaged me and said

604
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:49,925
the boss went out for dinner with a woman,

605
00:37:49,925 --> 00:37:51,570
and they were acting all sweet together.

606
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,173
My friend said if they're not a couple,
they're definitely in the talking stage.

607
00:37:57,173 --> 00:38:00,466
Here, she secretly took a picture
and sent it to me.

608
00:38:00,466 --> 00:38:03,203
Did your friend really take a photo?
Have you seen it?

609
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:07,163
Not yet. She hasn't sent it to me.

610
00:38:07,163 --> 00:38:08,654
Her internet connection must be slow.

611
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:22,973
Oh… this is crazy.

612
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:25,347
Why hasn't she sent it yet? So slow!

613
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,044
Is your friend just teasing you?

614
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:31,459
She probably doesn't have a picture,
or maybe she's never seen them.

615
00:38:31,966 --> 00:38:33,953
Well, it might be true.

616
00:38:34,466 --> 00:38:36,928
This friend loves to tease me.

617
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:55,611
Is this you, Prim?

618
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:05,432
I got caught, huh?

619
00:39:08,426 --> 00:39:12,429
By the way… when did this happen, Prim?

620
00:39:13,654 --> 00:39:15,409
Well…

621
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:18,636
- It's…
- I see now.

622
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:19,766
I haven't told you yet.

623
00:39:21,313 --> 00:39:22,403
I was just joking.

624
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:24,400
You don't have to tell me. It's okay.

625
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,189
You can tell me whenever you're ready, Prim.

626
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:27,189
I understand.

627
00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:29,683
And don't worry, Prim.

628
00:39:29,683 --> 00:39:32,819
My lips are sealed.

629
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:34,210
I won't tell a soul.

630
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,550
Especially Goody or Bhum.

631
00:39:37,805 --> 00:39:42,022
But if they find out on their own,
there's nothing I can do.

632
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,839
Thank you.

633
00:39:47,362 --> 00:39:50,233
I have an important question to ask you.

634
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,233
Yeah?

635
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:53,941
So, where exactly…

636
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:58,859
did you and the boss
have some private moments in the office?

637
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,849
Are you crazy, Mind!

638
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:03,822
Oh, I just want to know.

639
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,961
I need to sign some documents, don't I?

640
00:40:15,961 --> 00:40:16,966
Yes.

641
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:18,472
You can take them to my room.

642
00:40:18,472 --> 00:40:19,472
Okay, sir.

643
00:40:25,212 --> 00:40:26,765
Oh, I know now.

644
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:29,545
You must be sneaking off
in the boss's room, right?

645
00:40:29,545 --> 00:40:30,545
Mind!

646
00:40:35,689 --> 00:40:36,789
What a cute couple.

647
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,276
How did the meeting go yesterday?
Everything went smoothly?

648
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:53,481
Yeah, it was fine.

649
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:59,754
Here are all the documents
that you need to sign while you were away.

650
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,688
I haven't signed them all yet?

651
00:41:05,326 --> 00:41:07,594
You're really acting like a secretary.

652
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:11,291
When you're with your boyfriend,
you don't need to be so serious.

653
00:41:11,858 --> 00:41:16,066
I can't do that. I need to separate work
from personal matters.

654
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:17,166
One more thing…

655
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:19,383
One more thing?

656
00:41:20,346 --> 00:41:21,346
Nothing.

657
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,625
Liar!

658
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:27,269
You always flare your nose when you lie.

659
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:28,269
Really?

660
00:41:29,006 --> 00:41:30,006
Just kidding.

661
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:32,246
But it means you lied.

662
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:39,433
Mind knows about us now.

663
00:41:41,326 --> 00:41:42,326
Really?

664
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:02,587
Yes!

665
00:42:04,228 --> 00:42:06,216
Someone finally knows.

666
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:09,117
When I hear that someone knows about our love,

667
00:42:09,117 --> 00:42:10,117
I feel…

668
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,625
brighter than ever.

669
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:14,625
Oh?

670
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,860
Why is that?

671
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,619
You know that…

672
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:22,670
How much do I want people to know about us?

673
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,171
We can get around without hiding.

674
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:29,570
Or should I announce it to everyone?

675
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,547
Let's call the press and have an interview.

676
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:35,257
Then all the other guys
will stop bothering my beloved.

677
00:42:35,257 --> 00:42:39,720
I want to announce to the whole world
how much I love you.

678
00:42:41,368 --> 00:42:43,553
No… No, please don't do that.

679
00:42:43,553 --> 00:42:46,151
I don't want anyone to know yet.

680
00:42:46,151 --> 00:42:48,139
I don't know what to do.

681
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:49,333
Please.

682
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,266
All right.

683
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:55,971
I'll try to do what you want.

684
00:42:56,637 --> 00:42:59,314
But I'm not very confident in my patience.

685
00:43:00,925 --> 00:43:02,025
Very good.

686
00:43:03,265 --> 00:43:06,290
By the way, would you like tea or coffee?

687
00:43:08,882 --> 00:43:10,089
Coffee.

688
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:11,468
But no sugar.

689
00:43:11,468 --> 00:43:14,650
Because my life with you
is already sweet enough.

690
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:17,907
Okay.

691
00:43:17,907 --> 00:43:21,156
I'll add a lot of coffee,
so your life is about to get bitter.

692
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,630
I'll do it for everyone.

693
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,778
I'll do my best,

694
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,999
and will definitely
never let your hand go again.

695
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:45,607
And if you don't let go,
how am I supposed to make coffee?

696
00:43:56,966 --> 00:43:59,363
You can't bail on me like this.

697
00:43:59,363 --> 00:44:01,740
I booked a restaurant.

698
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,309
No, I don't want to eat alone.

699
00:44:07,232 --> 00:44:09,574
Okay, alright, I'm hanging up now.

700
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:14,459
Did your friend bail on you?

701
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,319
Yeah.

702
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,585
Who's as hot as you?
Every time you invite a girl, she says yes.

703
00:44:24,402 --> 00:44:27,269
Look at this, where did this flower come from?

704
00:44:29,123 --> 00:44:30,492
Oh please,

705
00:44:30,492 --> 00:44:31,827
I've never invited anyone.

706
00:44:32,342 --> 00:44:33,647
As for the flower…

707
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:35,710
Someone was organizing an event.

708
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,471
And threw it in the trash.
I felt sorry for it, so I asked to take it.

709
00:44:39,465 --> 00:44:40,682
Yeah?

710
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,323
Yeah?

711
00:44:46,678 --> 00:44:48,671
Hey so…

712
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:50,861
How about you have dinner with me today?

713
00:44:51,414 --> 00:44:52,414
Huh?

714
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:57,629
Let's just celebrate that
I became the new assistant secretary.

715
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:00,551
Oh…

716
00:45:02,024 --> 00:45:03,124
Congratulations.

717
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:07,757
But I'm not going. Eating out is expensive.

718
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:09,579
Stingy!

719
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:12,661
Oh, fine, I'll pay for you.

720
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:14,868
No, if you pay, it's a favor,

721
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:16,427
then I'll have to pay you back.

722
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:18,246
Once I pay you back,
you'll have to pay me back.

723
00:45:18,246 --> 00:45:19,779
So I have to pay you back,
then you'll pay me back again.

724
00:45:19,779 --> 00:45:22,244
We'll go back and forth like this.

725
00:45:22,244 --> 00:45:24,152
I don't like a loop like this.

726
00:45:24,152 --> 00:45:25,969
I don't want to be in a whirlpool like this.

727
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:26,994
I'll pass.

728
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:31,966
Come on, just think of it
as me returning the favor

729
00:45:31,966 --> 00:45:33,951
for helping me with
those documents the other day.

730
00:45:35,057 --> 00:45:36,057
No.

731
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:41,391
Why do you overthink everything?

732
00:45:41,391 --> 00:45:42,805
Just come with me! Hurry!

733
00:45:42,805 --> 00:45:44,834
- No way! It's expensive.
- Come on!

734
00:45:45,674 --> 00:45:47,043
I'll send you home today,

735
00:45:47,783 --> 00:45:50,624
or should I stop by my house first?

736
00:45:52,373 --> 00:45:53,574
Why is that?

737
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:59,711
Just to hang out,
or you can sleep at my place if you want.

738
00:46:01,783 --> 00:46:04,851
I'm not having nightmares anymore.
I can sleep alone now.

739
00:46:09,371 --> 00:46:12,611
But we still haven't finished what we left off.

740
00:46:14,712 --> 00:46:16,922
What are you saying, Boss?
That's inappropriate.

741
00:46:16,922 --> 00:46:21,126
Inappropriate?
It's a normal thing that lovers do.

742
00:46:22,188 --> 00:46:23,963
Please stop joking, sir.

743
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:28,536
I'm not joking.
I'm completely serious, and I mean it.

744
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:36,632
What's up, Pear?

745
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:40,135
What?

746
00:46:40,135 --> 00:46:41,980
Which hospital are you at?

747
00:46:43,246 --> 00:46:44,954
I'll rush over right now.

748
00:46:47,273 --> 00:46:48,373
What happened, Prim?

749
00:46:54,537 --> 00:46:56,362
Dad, Dad!

750
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,060
Dad!

751
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,472
Dad, Dad!

752
00:47:02,472 --> 00:47:05,464
Dad, I'm here!

753
00:47:05,464 --> 00:47:07,006
Dad!

754
00:47:07,006 --> 00:47:08,352
- Peekaboo!
- Hey!

755
00:47:09,183 --> 00:47:10,638
Dad!

756
00:47:10,638 --> 00:47:13,439
You scared me! What's this prank?

757
00:47:13,439 --> 00:47:14,739
It's a fake-death prank.

758
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:16,654
It's not funny, Dad.

759
00:47:16,654 --> 00:47:19,247
Okay, it failed.
Next time, I'll come up with a new one.

760
00:47:25,066 --> 00:47:28,453
Why didn't you tell me Dad was this sick?

761
00:47:31,399 --> 00:47:32,911
What happened?

762
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:54,269
It's nothing serious.

763
00:47:54,889 --> 00:47:56,933
I just played the guitar too hard,

764
00:47:56,933 --> 00:47:59,652
so it got me h-h-heart attack.

765
00:48:00,874 --> 00:48:02,944
I saw you had a lot of work to do,

766
00:48:02,944 --> 00:48:05,539
and it was quite sudden.

767
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:08,499
Pround and her doctor team
handled everything already.

768
00:48:10,173 --> 00:48:12,401
It's just his old heart condition
acting up again.

769
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:15,473
He needs to take meds and rest for a few days,
and he'll be fine.

770
00:48:15,473 --> 00:48:16,814
Don't count days.

771
00:48:16,814 --> 00:48:18,060
Better to count by the hour.

772
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,502
Right now, I'm ready to get up and solo again!

773
00:48:20,502 --> 00:48:21,702
- Dad!
- Dad!

774
00:48:22,492 --> 00:48:23,632
Put your hands together!

775
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:26,964
From now on…

776
00:48:27,631 --> 00:48:30,486
You must not play music
until the doctor allows it.

777
00:48:30,486 --> 00:48:31,626
Do you understand?

778
00:48:31,626 --> 00:48:33,821
Is this my child or a nun from a temple?

779
00:48:33,821 --> 00:48:35,613
She's such a great preacher!

780
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:37,514
You sure know how to argue.

781
00:48:44,718 --> 00:48:46,791
Does that mean your dad is okay?

782
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:48,966
He's okay.

783
00:48:52,511 --> 00:48:54,411
But he really scared me.

784
00:48:56,195 --> 00:48:59,121
But tonight, I'll stay here to look after Dad.

785
00:48:59,121 --> 00:49:01,536
I want Pear and Pround to go home and rest.

786
00:49:02,127 --> 00:49:03,127
Okay.

787
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,544
What's on your mind, Boss?

788
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:21,738
Oh.

789
00:49:23,611 --> 00:49:25,878
If I die, how would you feel?

790
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:28,963
Why are you saying this?

791
00:49:29,752 --> 00:49:31,393
I don't like it.

792
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:34,019
I just…

793
00:49:34,653 --> 00:49:38,286
I was just thinking.
Your dad's situation scared me.

794
00:49:38,286 --> 00:49:41,839
One day I could die from a shock and disappear.

795
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,259
I'd never see you again.

796
00:49:44,466 --> 00:49:46,679
Saying things like this scares me.

797
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,471
I didn't mean to scare you.

798
00:49:50,471 --> 00:49:53,909
I just wanted to express that
anything can happen.

799
00:49:56,073 --> 00:49:57,131
Because of that…

800
00:50:04,393 --> 00:50:08,141
Every minute of ours is very valuable.

801
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:14,254
I'm already using every minute to be with you,
making it worthwhile.

802
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:19,373
Today, you should go back and rest first.

803
00:50:19,373 --> 00:50:22,774
Tonight, I'll stay here with Dad.

804
00:50:22,774 --> 00:50:26,300
And can I take a day off tomorrow?

805
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,975
As you wish,

806
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:31,209
you can take a week off if you want.
I don't mind.

807
00:50:31,743 --> 00:50:34,054
But if you need my help with anything,

808
00:50:34,054 --> 00:50:36,126
just let me know, okay?

809
00:50:37,111 --> 00:50:38,111
Sure.

810
00:50:41,052 --> 00:50:42,052
I'm going now.

811
00:50:50,805 --> 00:50:52,047
Did you forget something, Boss?

812
00:50:54,866 --> 00:50:55,993
I forgot to kiss your cheek.

813
00:51:05,126 --> 00:51:06,126
Ready?

814
00:51:08,689 --> 00:51:09,946
One,

815
00:51:09,946 --> 00:51:11,020
two…

816
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,196
- Go!
- Oh!

817
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:14,798
Got you!

818
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:19,646
Ready?

819
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:23,165
You ready?

820
00:51:23,724 --> 00:51:24,724
Go!

821
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:30,819
What are you doing?

822
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:34,922
Oh,

823
00:51:34,922 --> 00:51:36,288
how did you get here?

824
00:51:37,664 --> 00:51:39,783
They don't throw it like that anymore,

825
00:51:39,783 --> 00:51:40,833
it's old-fashioned.

826
00:51:46,037 --> 00:51:47,801
Then who told me to catch the dish earlier?

827
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,519
Are you really okay now?

828
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:55,840
Oh, no worries.

829
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,440
I could live another ten thousand years!

830
00:51:58,919 --> 00:51:59,919
Dad.

831
00:52:00,781 --> 00:52:01,781
Just kidding.

832
00:52:10,462 --> 00:52:11,763
The saline drip just ran out.

833
00:52:11,763 --> 00:52:14,828
A special room is ready.
We'll move to that room.

834
00:52:14,828 --> 00:52:15,932
Huh?

835
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,012
Special room?

836
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:18,234
Moving room?

837
00:52:18,234 --> 00:52:20,369
Are you taking advantage
by adding extra room charges?

838
00:52:21,155 --> 00:52:23,648
This place is fine as it is. I can stay here.

839
00:52:23,648 --> 00:52:25,554
Look, I have a universal healthcare card.

840
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:27,817
This.

841
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:30,879
"Massage with Tum"

842
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,136
I gave the wrong.

843
00:52:35,226 --> 00:52:38,828
Actually, Mr. Thee asked us to ensure that
Mr. Poj gets the best care possible.

844
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:41,100
Did the boss order this?

845
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,100
That's right.

846
00:53:10,518 --> 00:53:13,151
You really seem to love
sweet and sour pork, don't you?

847
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:14,151
Yeah!

848
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,660
It's my favorite dish.

849
00:53:17,299 --> 00:53:20,869
Eating it reminds me of my mom.
She used to make it for me a lot.

850
00:53:21,515 --> 00:53:22,515
Really?

851
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:26,010
That's great, having a mom to cook for you.

852
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,457
Normally, at my house, I have to go out to eat

853
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:31,875
or buy food from outside to eat at home.

854
00:53:34,143 --> 00:53:35,483
You're so lucky, you know,

855
00:53:36,077 --> 00:53:37,855
to be able to go out and eat often.

856
00:53:37,855 --> 00:53:39,202
For me…

857
00:53:39,202 --> 00:53:41,170
I get to eat out…

858
00:53:41,836 --> 00:53:42,936
only on my birthday.

859
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:44,559
Once a year.

860
00:53:46,085 --> 00:53:47,085
Why?

861
00:53:47,816 --> 00:53:49,633
You don't have to wait for your birthday.

862
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:51,531
It's just a regular rice porridge shop.

863
00:53:52,097 --> 00:53:53,406
You can come here anytime.

864
00:53:53,919 --> 00:53:55,754
Well, my family's not rich like yours.

865
00:53:59,766 --> 00:54:01,206
My dad passed away when I was young.

866
00:54:01,946 --> 00:54:03,432
My mom has been working alone.

867
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,680
So, when it comes to spending money,

868
00:54:07,265 --> 00:54:08,365
we have to think twice.

869
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:14,135
But now your salary isn't small.

870
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:16,728
Maybe cut back a little on being so stingy.

871
00:54:18,145 --> 00:54:19,566
It's not stingy.

872
00:54:19,566 --> 00:54:21,515
It's about appreciating the value of money.

873
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:26,479
And why pretend to be rich,
lying to others like that?

874
00:54:28,038 --> 00:54:29,471
I've been looked down on before.

875
00:54:32,525 --> 00:54:33,725
Looked down?

876
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,598
My family owns a laundry shop.

877
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:42,202
The only time I got to touch nice clothes was…

878
00:54:42,924 --> 00:54:45,111
when I was washing other people's clothes.

879
00:54:49,026 --> 00:54:50,342
My clothes are…

880
00:54:50,966 --> 00:54:52,422
either worn out or ripped.

881
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,110
People in my neighborhood
used to mock me for it.

882
00:54:55,974 --> 00:54:57,057
But one day, when I grew up

883
00:54:57,057 --> 00:55:00,346
and had enough money
to buy branded clothes for myself.

884
00:55:01,585 --> 00:55:02,585
This one.

885
00:55:03,605 --> 00:55:05,278
The neighbors stopped teasing me.

886
00:55:08,985 --> 00:55:10,205
That's how the world is.

887
00:55:12,192 --> 00:55:13,875
Judging everything from the outside.

888
00:55:15,866 --> 00:55:19,360
I just accept it and flow with it, that's all.

889
00:55:22,864 --> 00:55:26,727
But that doesn't mean everyone is like that.

890
00:55:27,972 --> 00:55:29,385
At least me.

891
00:55:32,393 --> 00:55:35,480
I don't care about
the branded clothes you wear.

892
00:55:37,331 --> 00:55:40,606
I just see you as someone who is skilled.

893
00:55:42,353 --> 00:55:43,353
And…

894
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:46,260
Your personality is quite okay.

895
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:51,864
So stop lying,

896
00:55:51,864 --> 00:55:53,184
it'll save you the effort.

897
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:56,872
And you won't have to wear
smelly clothes either.

898
00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:02,059
Thank you.

899
00:56:04,705 --> 00:56:06,757
I already lied to everyone. What can I do?

900
00:56:08,426 --> 00:56:09,941
Let me keep going like this.

901
00:56:10,931 --> 00:56:12,432
I want to save a lot of money.

902
00:56:13,362 --> 00:56:15,189
One day, if I have a wife and kids,

903
00:56:16,141 --> 00:56:18,101
I don't want them to struggle like I did.

904
00:56:20,979 --> 00:56:22,466
Are you thinking too far ahead?

905
00:56:23,188 --> 00:56:24,988
You should find a girlfriend first.

906
00:56:25,994 --> 00:56:28,680
If you're this stingy,
how do you expect any woman to like you?

907
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:31,030
You're right.

908
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:36,336
Anyway, thanks a lot today.

909
00:56:37,452 --> 00:56:38,719
When my birthday comes,

910
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:41,121
I'll invite you.

911
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,120
Okay.

912
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:01,770
Wow, a room this big,

913
00:57:02,303 --> 00:57:03,658
how much does it cost per night?

914
00:57:04,729 --> 00:57:07,884
Look, is your boss taking care of me

915
00:57:08,584 --> 00:57:10,162
just to please you?

916
00:57:10,162 --> 00:57:12,475
So that you won't quit, right?

917
00:57:13,642 --> 00:57:14,893
I guess so.

918
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:16,700
That's right, I knew it!

919
00:57:18,765 --> 00:57:20,005
So, when are you going to quit?

920
00:57:20,944 --> 00:57:22,708
The sooner the better.

921
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,377
I'll tell you first.

922
00:57:36,064 --> 00:57:38,017
Dad's going to tell you a nonsense story.

923
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,920
To be honest…

924
00:57:43,888 --> 00:57:45,088
When I collapsed,

925
00:57:46,832 --> 00:57:49,998
I thought I wouldn't get to
see my children's faces again.

926
00:57:54,582 --> 00:57:58,287
This event made me realize

927
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,272
what is the most valuable thing in my life.

928
00:58:06,299 --> 00:58:08,086
I spent time…

929
00:58:08,086 --> 00:58:09,819
Go trophy hunting outside the house.

930
00:58:11,691 --> 00:58:13,878
I forgot that our house…

931
00:58:15,088 --> 00:58:16,188
already has trophies.

932
00:58:16,837 --> 00:58:19,718
Both Prim and Pear, as well as Pround.

933
00:58:21,141 --> 00:58:22,840
And even little Ploen,

934
00:58:25,598 --> 00:58:27,247
all of you are my trophies.

935
00:58:32,974 --> 00:58:35,465
I want you to live your life, Prim.

936
00:58:38,152 --> 00:58:40,703
I want you to achieve everything you dream of.

937
00:58:44,279 --> 00:58:45,552
Life is short, dear.

938
00:58:47,446 --> 00:58:49,038
If you want to do something, do it now.

939
00:58:52,952 --> 00:58:54,166
Look at your mother.

940
00:58:56,744 --> 00:58:58,271
One day, she just left us…

941
00:59:04,413 --> 00:59:05,513
Maybe…

942
00:59:08,485 --> 00:59:10,992
I might end up joining her sooner than I think.

943
00:59:11,898 --> 00:59:15,304
Dad… Please don't speak like that.

944
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:17,674
Yeah, you're right.

945
00:59:20,972 --> 00:59:22,072
Mom.

946
00:59:24,073 --> 00:59:25,899
Please don't come to take me away yet.

947
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,836
I want to stay with our children first.

948
00:59:30,962 --> 00:59:32,215
Is this okay?

949
00:59:41,133 --> 00:59:43,760
Don't worry, Dad. You're still strong.

950
00:59:45,395 --> 00:59:46,575
You have to be with me.

951
00:59:47,123 --> 00:59:49,213
You're the one who has to be with me.

952
00:59:49,213 --> 00:59:50,313
Let's stay together.

958
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,310
A dream?

959
01:00:29,905 --> 01:00:30,905
You tell me.

960
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:34,129
What do I want to do?

961
01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:00,219
Dad…

962
01:01:26,472 --> 01:01:28,628
Two hundred thousand?
Why did you transfer this?

963
01:01:28,628 --> 01:01:30,323
You deserve this money.

964
01:01:30,323 --> 01:01:31,689
What happened, sweetie?

965
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:33,953
Messi mocked me, saying I don't have a dad.

966
01:01:33,953 --> 01:01:38,228
It's good to have the future daughter-in-law
and the secretary meet.

967
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:40,197
This is a family business issue, you know.

968
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:43,022
Can we keep "business" out of our family?

969
01:01:43,022 --> 01:01:45,002
Our family has been through a very tough time.

970
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:46,978
And how much Thee has to endure
the pain for us?

971
01:01:46,978 --> 01:01:49,933
So, the rumor that
you're dating the boss is true?

972
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:53,473
I guess I need to clear everything up
once and for all.
