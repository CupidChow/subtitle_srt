1
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,517
This year, I'm using Valentine's Day to
create the perfect atmosphere for Prim.

2
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:13,208
She'll finally admit her feelings for me,
just like I have thought before.

3
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:17,974
And your boss is super well-off.
He has good background and different lifestyle.

4
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:20,516
Do you think he will choose someone like us?

5
00:01:20,516 --> 00:01:22,560
So you're Morpheus, aren't you?

6
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
Yes, I am.

7
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,344
Love is something that no one can't resist.
Is it not true?

8
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:28,707
Is he your favorite author?

9
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:31,839
Without him,
we wouldn't have an author for the event.

10
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:34,059
I didn't want to waste your time.

11
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:35,642
But we can still be friends.

12
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:37,276
- Or, are you afraid?
- Afraid of what?

13
00:01:37,276 --> 00:01:40,262
You're afraid that I might steal
your secretary from you.

14
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:19,876
<i>Don't be afraid, my child.</i>

15
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,899
<i>Mom won't hurt you.</i>

16
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:26,316
<i>But you're not my mother.</i>

17
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,852
<i>What did you just say? I am your mother.</i>

18
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,201
<i>Don't argue with me.</i>

19
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,596
Secretary Prim, I…

20
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,640
Get up first.

21
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:51,940
Secretary Prim, I…

22
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,975
- I…
- It's okay.

23
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:57,424
In that case, I'll take a day off tomorrow.

24
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,567
Goodbye.

25
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,786
They were about to kiss,
the moment when their lips touched…

26
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:19,894
the actor just pushed the actress away.

27
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:22,311
Exactly, that leading actor pushed me…

28
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,773
I mean, he pushed the heroine.

29
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,685
I don't get it either.

30
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:30,247
What was up with that hero?

31
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:32,952
Do you two get why the actor had to
push the actress away like that

32
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:34,867
just when they were about to kiss?

33
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,019
Wait. Wait a minute.

34
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,874
Why did you do that, huh?

35
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:43,425
Was it because you had bad breath
after eating papaya salad?

36
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:44,495
I didn't eat it.

37
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,672
I already told you that this isn't my story.
It's about my friend.

38
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:55,101
I'm shocked. You have other friends besides me?

39
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:00,809
Alright, alright. Just tell me the rest.

40
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:02,858
What did that woman do next?

41
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,307
They were about to kiss, but they didn't.
That must be frustrating.

42
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:08,817
Yeah, it's frustrating.

43
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:13,934
I mean, the heroine, you know?
It must be frustrating.

44
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:17,443
The heroine is kind of interesting too.

45
00:04:17,443 --> 00:04:20,057
By the way, what series is this?
Tell me the name.

46
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:22,215
No, don't watch it. It's not fun.

47
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:26,631
Don't bother with the heroine either.
Just focus on the actor. Why did he do that?

48
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,353
Or does he not like women?

49
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:32,372
What?

50
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:35,975
Maybe he just realized,
right before kissing her,

51
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,138
that it's not his thing.

52
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:41,257
That doesn't seem likely.
He is the hero, after all.

53
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:43,769
I know him well enough to say
he is probably not like that.

54
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,026
Or is he?

55
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:49,787
No way.

56
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:52,624
I think the actor might have some issues.

57
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,179
I mean, maybe the man has emotional scars

58
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:03,148
or some kind of past trauma
about kissing and women.

59
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:04,619
That's why he acted like that.

60
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,689
I don't have any issues
about kissing women, okay?

61
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:13,539
My relative doesn't have any issues
about kissing women either.

62
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:15,691
Wait a second, where does "relative" come from?

63
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,423
You just said "friend" earlier.
Now you're saying "relative"?

64
00:05:18,423 --> 00:05:19,781
So, is it a relative or a friend?

65
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:22,483
I told you from the start
that it's my relative.

66
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,293
Did you mishear or imagine things?
Go get your ears checked.

67
00:05:24,293 --> 00:05:26,504
- Oh, really? Yeah?
- Yeah.

68
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:28,396
You don't have to know the guy, okay?

69
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:31,111
So, in this story, I…

70
00:05:33,214 --> 00:05:34,234
Friend…

71
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:37,764
- So, a friend? Be clear.
- No, no, not a friend. A relative.

72
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:38,924
Alright, a relative. Got it.

73
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:41,625
What should he do about this
so the woman doesn't feel bad?

74
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,820
Basically,
your boss refused to kiss you, didn't he?

75
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,025
- Yeah.
- Boom!

76
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:47,117
Well…

77
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:51,534
Why didn't he kiss you?
It was getting to the critical moment.

78
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:53,870
- What a shame.
- What shame?

79
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,332
I told you not to get involved with him.

80
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:57,492
It's good to get involved with him.
He is rich, anyway!

81
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,659
It's going to cause problems later, Pround.

82
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:03,105
If there is a problem, just break up.
It's not too hard.

83
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:05,521
Not hard? It's hard because it hurts, you know.

84
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:07,296
If it hurts, I can get over it anyway.

85
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:08,627
Hey, you little rascal.

86
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:10,119
That's enough.

87
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,070
I just remembered I have work to do.

88
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,659
I have to get back.
Pear, you take care of the bill. See you. Bye.

89
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:18,077
Prim, hey!
Please don't get involved with him!

90
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,492
Go for it! I'm cheering!

91
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:22,213
Hey! I'll stab you with these chopsticks!

92
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:23,301
I think…

93
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:27,751
I actually don't know.

94
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:28,770
What?

95
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,235
Hey? Where are you going, Pat?

96
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:32,940
Go poop.

97
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,964
Pat!

98
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,685
<i>Please help me! Anyone, please help! Anyone!</i>

99
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,460
<i>Please help me!</i>

100
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,483
<i>Anyone, please help me!</i>

101
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:24,698
Hi, Meow Meow. Are you hungry?

102
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,503
Eat up, eat a lot.

103
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:34,586
And don't get sick again, okay?

104
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,084
<i>Excuse me, you have chocolate on your mouth.</i>

105
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,601
No way! No, I won't think about it.

106
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:03,875
I need to find something to do
so I don't get distracted.

107
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:39,346
Well, I rarely get a day off
like other people do.

108
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:42,453
Primala is going to make the most of it!

109
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:59,470
You said
you're taking a day off today, didn't you?

110
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:02,245
I'm off next week.

111
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,899
Today, Miss Prim asked for a day off,
so they sent me to take care of you.

112
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:09,833
Do you want me to stay over
and keep you company?

113
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:12,300
You don't have to take care of me that much.

114
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,617
Well, if you want to go anywhere today, go.

115
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:16,939
But I want to stay with you.

116
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:18,696
I said no need.

117
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:19,789
But…

118
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:23,249
I'll drive to work myself.

119
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:26,789
Okay.

120
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:36,096
Do you want to eat?

121
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:56,922
Being free for too long can also become boring.

122
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:07,584
Hello, Kiew. What are you doing?

123
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:09,174
<i>I'm having a facial treatment.</i>

124
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:11,036
When will you be done?

125
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:13,788
One month for a full recovery.

126
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:16,335
That's it for now, I can't breathe properly.

127
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,230
Okay, okay. That's it.

128
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:26,932
Hello, June, what are you doing?

129
00:10:27,638 --> 00:10:29,194
I'm waiting.

130
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:30,705
What are you waiting for?

131
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:32,115
Interviewing the prime minister!

132
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:38,650
That's it for now, Prim.

133
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,919
When I have free time,
no one else is free either.

134
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:51,031
Am I just going to
be stuck at home alone today?

135
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,456
Nope, I'll go out and grab something to eat.

136
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:15,861
<i>A hallucination. It must be a hallucination.</i>

137
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:26,482
How did you get up here, sir?

138
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:29,699
I told the security guard a critical reason.

139
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:30,972
What reason?

140
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:33,582
I'm here to apologize to my girlfriend.

141
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:35,819
I don't think it's true.

142
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:36,871
It will be.

143
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:42,907
Secretary Prim,
I want to apologize for last night.

144
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,986
If it's about last night,
I didn't get mad at you.

145
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,590
Is that all? Goodbye.

146
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:53,905
What's his deal?

147
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:56,491
He won't kiss, but then he comes to apologize?

148
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,411
What a crazy person.

149
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:04,626
I'm not just here to apologize.

150
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:06,381
I'm going to take you on a trip too.

151
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:08,588
Give me a chance to make amends.

152
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:11,687
I have analyzed, synthesized,
and sorted everything out already.

153
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:14,206
I have prepared a list of activities
for the trip.

154
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:19,636
We can sip tea and listen to
an orchestra performance in a premium lounge.

155
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,701
Take a cruise to enjoy the river view.

156
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,591
Then, we can ride a helicopter to
enjoy the view of Bangkok's skyline.

157
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:29,637
And after that, we will fly
to Hong Kong for dinner.

158
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:31,934
Is it okay?

159
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:34,852
Boss, go on the trip by yourself.

160
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:40,250
Well, today is my day off,
and I just want to do something for myself.

161
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:50,294
<i>Crazy! Being in my room,
there's nothing to do anyway.</i>

162
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,807
You changed your mind?

163
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:01,259
Because your life revolves around just me.

164
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:04,558
My presence takes up more of your life
than the water in your body.

165
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:08,257
So, on your days off without me,
you wouldn't know what to do,

166
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:11,285
like your body's lacking water,
being dehydrated.

167
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,488
If you keep talking about water,
I'm not going with you anymore.

168
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:18,314
Okay, I won't talk about it.

169
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:21,432
Come with me, Prim.

170
00:13:25,213 --> 00:13:28,225
Okay, but you have to follow my way, okay?

171
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,306
And also travel in my style.

172
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:32,761
Sure, no problem. I'm fine with anything.

173
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:35,733
Are you sure about that?

174
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:43,355
You're going to take the bus for the trip?

175
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,424
Yes.

176
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,715
This is Thailand, Secretary Prim.

177
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:51,209
The average temperature is 40 degrees Celsius.

178
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:54,486
The air is filled with PM2.5 dust,
and traffic jams are everywhere.

179
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:56,032
Who goes on a bus for a trip?

180
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,619
Well, everyone does, you know.

181
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:02,307
In the morning, I took the bus
and transferred quickly to a boat.

182
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:05,700
Today, I want to ride the bus
in a chill, relaxed way.

183
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,355
But if you can't handle it…

184
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:10,488
Just go ahead.

185
00:14:15,243 --> 00:14:16,543
I can handle it!

186
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:18,963
It's just a bus.
Why wouldn't I be able to do it?

187
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:27,533
Don't tell me you're going on this one?

188
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,795
Yes. You can still
change your mind now, you know?

189
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:35,381
No! I told you, I'll let you have your way.

190
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:37,184
If you want to go anywhere, I'll go with you.

191
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:40,284
If you want to take this bus,
I'll take it, too.

192
00:14:43,662 --> 00:14:44,819
Hey!

193
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,743
Are you guys going to keep talking?
Going or not?

194
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:49,578
- We're going.
- If you're going, just get on the bus.

195
00:14:50,763 --> 00:14:51,775
Hurry up, guys.

196
00:15:12,697 --> 00:15:13,910
Are you sure you're okay, sir?

197
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:17,085
No problem. I could stand all day if I had to.

198
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:24,750
Are you okay?

199
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,385
Fare, please! Fare.

200
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:37,321
No need. I'll pay.

201
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,010
No card reader, huh? I understand.

202
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:56,625
Are you getting my nerves?

203
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:58,922
Oh, please wait a minute.

204
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:07,343
Thank you.

205
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:13,007
Who pays with a large bill like that?
They don't have change.

206
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:16,326
Why wouldn't I? The money I'm using is legal.

207
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:18,602
It's their duty to prepare the change for me.

208
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:51,435
How long are you going to lie down?

209
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,904
Okay, take big steps, go ahead.

210
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,300
Are you okay, sir?

211
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:10,336
Give me a minute.

212
00:17:18,152 --> 00:17:20,004
I'm ready to continue this adventure with you.

213
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,289
Do you like coming to this restaurant?

214
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,677
I have been coming here since I was a child.

215
00:19:00,446 --> 00:19:02,195
Pear and Pround also like this place.

216
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,209
You seem really close with your siblings.

217
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,277
I'm…

218
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,370
not close to my brother at all.

219
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:17,230
The reason we're close is because
we have been through a lot together.

220
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:21,755
What kind of things? Can I ask?

221
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,389
Well, my dad was a rocker, right?

222
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:30,102
He was very artistic.

223
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:34,323
He didn't really care much about money,

224
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:36,655
so he was often taken advantage of
by his bandmates.

225
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:42,026
However, after having three children,
he wanted a more stable job,

226
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:44,897
so he partnered with a friend
to open a music store.

227
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:49,144
In the end, his friend cheated again
and left the store with a debt.

228
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:52,937
My dad had to mortgage our house to the bank.

229
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:58,657
A fortune teller once told my dad
that he is unlucky,

230
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,610
and that whatever he does, it never goes well.

231
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:02,549
What happened next?

232
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:06,578
Well, my dad punched
the fortune teller in the face.

233
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:09,699
- For real?
- Yes.

234
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:22,668
Thank you for bringing me here.

235
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:25,021
You're welcome.

236
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,955
There's one more thing I want to tell you.

237
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:32,230
I really admire you.

238
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:35,719
You work hard for your family.

239
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,950
You paid off your dad's debt.

240
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,794
You raised your own niece,
and even sent your younger sibling to school.

241
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:42,949
How did you manage to sacrifice so much
for others all your life?

242
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,883
My mom taught me.

243
00:20:45,883 --> 00:20:49,799
She used to say that even though
our family isn't wealthy in money,

244
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,041
we choose to be rich in kindness
by sympathy for others.

245
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,714
If it's not too tricky, just do anything
that can bring happiness to others.

246
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,457
It's good,

247
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:02,937
but if it's too much, it will waste your time.

248
00:21:02,937 --> 00:21:05,979
And you won't be able
to do anything for yourself.

249
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:06,979
Do you understand?

250
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:09,712
I understand.

251
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:13,095
That's why I decided to resign.

252
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:15,959
I want to go out to find myself
and do something for myself.

253
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:20,124
I take back what I said.
Let's pretend I never said anything.

254
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:21,129
Forget what I said.

255
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:22,875
It's too late now.

256
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:33,825
It's almost time for you to leave me
and live your own life, huh?

257
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:44,072
I'm definitely going.

258
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,408
But today, I still have something fun
for you to do, sir.

259
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:50,762
What else?

260
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,024
What are you doing here?

261
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:51,437
Mom sent some snacks for you.

262
00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:55,489
Next time, I'll pick them up myself.

263
00:22:56,035 --> 00:22:57,222
Is that all?

264
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:01,988
Dad wants me to apologize to you
about that day.

265
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:07,755
If that day hadn't happened, you wouldn't
stand a chance against me, asshole.

266
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:13,635
Oh my gosh, Thee! Thee, oh no!

267
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,465
Stop! Stop right now!

268
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:19,045
What the heck is wrong with you guys?!

269
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:27,295
Forget it.

270
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:34,391
If you have time, go visit Mom and Dad.
They have been mentioning you a lot.

271
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:36,945
Today, they even talked about you and Prim.

272
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:40,692
What did they say?

273
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,712
Mom likes and admires Prim so much.

274
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:48,184
She even wants Prim to be a daughter-in-law.

275
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:53,914
As for dad, he is not satisfied
with you dating your secretary.

276
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:59,896
He is probably worried about how
it will affect the company's image,

277
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,234
and the family rules.

278
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,205
You know how much Laikong cares

279
00:24:05,205 --> 00:24:07,952
about the last name of the son-in-law
and daughter-in-law.

280
00:24:08,672 --> 00:24:10,145
I don't care.

281
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:13,218
You don't care, even though
there are people who completely disagree?

282
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:14,832
Yes,

283
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:16,372
and so what?

284
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:21,702
So, what exactly is the point
of everything you just said?

285
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:27,492
I'm just saying that I'm the black sheep
of the family, and no one cares.

286
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:31,233
I'm not involved
in the family business or anything.

287
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:35,712
So, I have the right to date Prim.

288
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,931
And if I want to be with her,

289
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:41,869
Mom and Dad probably won't mind.

290
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:43,380
Everyone will be okay with it.

291
00:24:44,077 --> 00:24:46,062
Everyone's okay, but I'm not okay.

292
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:48,423
You're not okay,

293
00:24:48,423 --> 00:24:51,683
but you can do nothing if Prim is okay.

294
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,416
Prim would never like someone like you.

295
00:24:58,283 --> 00:24:59,411
It's a waste of time.

296
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,121
I have told you repeatedly
to double-check your work to avoid mistakes.

297
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:21,832
I'm sorry, Prim.

298
00:25:21,832 --> 00:25:26,130
I completely forgot that the client dinner
has been postponed from today to next week.

299
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,558
What's the restaurant saying right now?

300
00:25:29,386 --> 00:25:32,062
The restaurant isn't picking up the phone.

301
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,812
I don't think I can cancel it.

302
00:25:35,812 --> 00:25:38,123
If I'm unable to cancel it, what should I do?

303
00:25:38,123 --> 00:25:40,403
You're responsible for all the costs.

304
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:49,131
My entire salary for the month
will be gone in an instant.

305
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,947
You have earned it.

306
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:54,841
You made a mistake.

307
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,538
I'm sorry.

308
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,430
I'm just kidding.

309
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,165
I'll take everyone out myself.

310
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:09,300
Hey. It's okay, Prim.
I made the mistake myself.

311
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,097
Why do you have to
take responsibility for it too?

312
00:26:12,097 --> 00:26:14,259
Well, it's a special opportunity.

313
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:18,720
A special opportunity? On the occasion of what?

314
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:22,508
Well, to treat myself,

315
00:26:23,788 --> 00:26:24,830
since I'm going to resign.

316
00:26:26,506 --> 00:26:29,555
Oh. Thank you, Prim.

317
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:37,939
Beautiful.

318
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:42,460
Excuse me,
how long are you planning to take to finish?

319
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,154
Everyone is waiting. We have already
missed the auspicious time. Hurry up.

320
00:26:45,154 --> 00:26:46,319
Don' interrupting me, huh?

321
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,206
I need to finish applying the lipstick
in case I meet someone today.

322
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:52,529
It's a full face and Botox,

323
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:54,837
but there's no husband in sight,
meaning there isn't one.

324
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,923
See?

325
00:26:58,923 --> 00:27:00,939
Look on the bright side, huh?

326
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:06,286
By the way, the writer,
Mr.Morpheus, or Mr.Tham,

327
00:27:06,286 --> 00:27:08,417
is really the boss's older brother.

328
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,220
Huh? Is that for real?

329
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,299
Yes, it's true.

330
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:17,414
I issued the cheque that day
and saw Mr.Tham's company name, right?

331
00:27:17,414 --> 00:27:22,103
So, I checked and searched.
I found out that they share the same last name.

332
00:27:22,103 --> 00:27:24,619
Then I kept checking,

333
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:26,461
and it turns out they're siblings.

334
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:29,300
The world is so small, huh?

335
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,144
Prim, if the fans knew this,
they'd probably scream like crazy, right?

336
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,444
But it's so weird.

337
00:27:36,444 --> 00:27:40,115
He is the boss's older brother from
the Theeranon family,

338
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:42,228
but he acts mysteriously like this.

339
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:45,295
Mysterious like this is what's charming!

340
00:27:47,074 --> 00:27:51,195
The older brother is this handsome,
romantic guy who writes books,

341
00:27:51,195 --> 00:27:53,704
while the younger is a skilled businessperson.

342
00:27:55,504 --> 00:27:58,516
Who should I choose?

343
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,027
Before choosing a guy,
should you pick a doctor first?

344
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:07,254
Not in a good state of mind.

345
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:08,412
Hurry, I'm hungry!

346
00:28:08,412 --> 00:28:09,839
Good at interrupting!

347
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:10,985
Good morning, everyone.

348
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:15,474
Speaking of which,
here comes the soulmate, clearly!

349
00:28:17,832 --> 00:28:19,142
Hello, Mr.Tham.

350
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:21,572
What brings you to the office?

351
00:28:21,572 --> 00:28:22,601
I came to see you.

352
00:28:26,243 --> 00:28:28,571
Look, the vibe seems like a soulmate.

353
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:29,832
But you seem like an outsider.

354
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:35,279
I'm just kidding.

355
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,051
I'm here to pick up the cheque from
the previous job.

356
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:38,563
Oh, I see.

357
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:40,245
So where are you all going?

358
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:41,295
We're going out for lunch.

359
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:42,915
Oh, I see.

360
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:44,831
In that case, can I join you?

361
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:46,899
- Sure! We'd love to have you.
- Of course!

362
00:28:47,448 --> 00:28:51,420
I want to thank everyone for
your support at the recent event.

363
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,529
Thanks to that,
my book sales exceeded the target.

364
00:28:57,349 --> 00:28:59,847
- So, I can join you guys, right?
- Sure, of course!

365
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,120
What? Tham's treating Prim to lunch?

366
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,738
Yeah, but it's not just the two of them.
They're going as a group.

367
00:29:09,432 --> 00:29:10,608
By the way,

368
00:29:10,608 --> 00:29:14,606
when did your brother get so close to
the staff in our office?

369
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:15,856
I'm so confused.

370
00:29:17,362 --> 00:29:18,899
Where are they going for lunch?

371
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,318
I don't know. Probably somewhere around here.

372
00:29:21,318 --> 00:29:23,414
I'm hungry too. Let's go grab something to eat.

373
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,435
Hey, hey!

374
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:28,772
Wait, where did he go?

375
00:29:30,176 --> 00:29:31,412
Such an all-rounder.

376
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:33,970
He is not only an executive,
but he is also an invisible person.

377
00:29:40,004 --> 00:29:41,004
Weird taste.

378
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:43,488
Was that the one that fell earlier?

379
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,856
Well. I have something to confess to everyone.

380
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:09,119
Actually, the reason why
we're all having lunch here today is

381
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:11,004
because of my mistake

382
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,402
that I forgot to cancel
the customer's reservation,

383
00:30:16,402 --> 00:30:19,977
so Prim had to step in and
take responsibility for me.

384
00:30:22,818 --> 00:30:27,936
But then, fate sent a white knight
on a horse to help Prim again.

385
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:32,729
Thank you, Mr.Tham, for helping Prim.

386
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,983
Otherwise, I'd probably
be eating instant noodles all month.

387
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:43,279
I'm happy to help. Thee's staff is mine, too.

388
00:30:47,256 --> 00:30:49,792
My staff is my staff, not someone else's.

389
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:09,865
Oh, Goody.

390
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:11,902
Do you think the same way as I do?

391
00:31:11,902 --> 00:31:13,781
Suddenly, the atmosphere shifted.

392
00:31:13,781 --> 00:31:16,891
- It got intense out of nowhere.
- True.

393
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:19,151
Do you want to have a meal together?
It's on me.

394
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:20,960
No need.

395
00:31:21,692 --> 00:31:23,692
I'll take care of my staff myself.

396
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:44,899
Mr.Tham, you can sit where I sit.

397
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:47,219
I'll go sit over there.

398
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:48,405
Okay, go ahead.

399
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:50,395
Come, come, come!

400
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:03,245
Everyone, feel free to order more.
This meal is on me.

401
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:05,953
No need. I already told everyone
that it's on me.

402
00:32:05,953 --> 00:32:08,959
Don't you understand? I said,
"I'll take care of my staff myself."

403
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,143
Don't get involved.

404
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,579
Are they really siblings?

405
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:16,001
Yeah, probably.

406
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,301
Well, Bhum is full.

407
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:24,680
Everyone's full. Right?

408
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,539
- Yes, yes.
- So full.

409
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:28,260
I'm full already.

410
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,783
Full of what? You haven't eaten yet.

411
00:32:33,107 --> 00:32:34,107
Full.

412
00:32:34,107 --> 00:32:35,899
- Full.
- Full already.

413
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:39,532
Oh, do you remember
the office pen ran out of ink?

414
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,989
Oh. It ran out yesterday.

415
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:43,500
- Right.
- Go buy some. Go buy some!

416
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,780
Yes, we need to hurry or else
we'll run out of lunchtime.

417
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,633
I'll go with you. I'll pick out a lucky color.

418
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,220
There's a store with a sale.
Let me take you there.

419
00:32:51,464 --> 00:32:53,596
I'm coming too. I just realized
I want to buy a pen to give to director Pat.

420
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,539
Yeah. Let's go.

421
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:56,642
Okay, we'll go first.

422
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,500
Goodbye, boss.

423
00:33:05,513 --> 00:33:08,232
I will stay and eat with everyone.

424
00:33:09,876 --> 00:33:12,864
Mind, the pen is out of ink.

425
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:14,874
My pen is still usable, though.

426
00:33:14,874 --> 00:33:17,223
The ink is out. I told you to go, so hurry up.

427
00:33:17,783 --> 00:33:18,783
Okay.

428
00:33:30,772 --> 00:33:32,266
Should we start eating now?

429
00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:33,993
Sure.

430
00:33:38,323 --> 00:33:42,391
Eat a lot so you have the energy to follow
the boss who likes to make you work hard.

431
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:47,281
Okay, thank you.

432
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:51,921
Let's eat fish, Secretary Prim.

433
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:54,159
Fish is rich in Omega and good for the body.

434
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,310
Eating fish might get
the bones stuck in your throat.

435
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,531
Let's eat this instead. It's easier to digest.

436
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:00,690
Don't eat that. This one tastes better.

437
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,049
- I think this one is better.
- That one's not that tasty.

438
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:04,947
- Prim, this one's easier to digest.
- This one looks tasty. This one.

439
00:34:04,947 --> 00:34:05,956
Enough.

440
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:09,561
Can you stop for now?

441
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:12,360
If I have to eat all of this,

442
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,107
I'll probably need
to go to the hospital.

443
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:20,920
Don't worry; I'll take you to
the doctor if something happens.

444
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,687
No need. I'll take her by myself.

445
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,962
You need to work, don't you? I'll take her.

446
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:28,779
But I said I'll take her myself.

447
00:34:28,779 --> 00:34:30,559
- I'll take her.
- I'll take her myself.

448
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,260
- I'm more suitable.
- I'm better.

449
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,038
I'm freer, I'm better, I should take her.

450
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,380
I said I should take her.

451
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,785
- I'll take her myself.
- I'm better.

452
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,404
- I'll go myself.
- I'll take her there.

453
00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:40,216
- I'll take her myself.
- You go back to work.

454
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:45,103
Is Mr.Tham really boss's brother?

455
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:48,487
Why does it feel like
there's some kind of grudge between them?

456
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:53,648
These siblings must have something going on.

457
00:34:54,689 --> 00:34:57,667
Or could they both…

458
00:34:58,307 --> 00:34:59,503
What?

459
00:34:59,503 --> 00:35:02,562
They might like me,
so they're competing to win me over.

460
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:06,354
Go see a doctor already. Just go!

461
00:35:08,144 --> 00:35:12,956
Wait, or is the tension between the two of them

462
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:16,406
because they're fighting over inheritance?

463
00:35:19,392 --> 00:35:21,234
- Oh! That's possible!
- Yeah.

464
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:22,316
Oh.

465
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:23,538
Hey, Prim!

466
00:35:25,428 --> 00:35:26,693
So? What's going on?

467
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:28,887
What's up with Mr.Tham and our boss?

468
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:32,695
Please don't ask me anything right now.
I can't handle it.

469
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:34,799
Are you okay, Prim? Are you feeling unwell?

470
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:40,335
No, I need to take some antacids.
I can't stand feeling bloated.

471
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,779
The boss is calling.

472
00:36:00,756 --> 00:36:01,888
Yes, boss?

473
00:36:18,338 --> 00:36:19,438
I am your boss.

474
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,814
If something happens, please let me know

475
00:36:22,585 --> 00:36:25,353
not to handle it yourself
or let someone else handle it.

476
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,823
Yes, I'm sorry, boss.

477
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:34,352
I made a mistake, and it won't happen again.

478
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:36,352
From now on, just ask me.

479
00:36:36,352 --> 00:36:37,571
Tell me directly.

480
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:40,931
Don't be afraid. Do you understand?

481
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,821
Yes, I understand.

482
00:36:49,264 --> 00:36:52,106
Can I ask you something now?

483
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:56,566
What is it?

484
00:36:58,511 --> 00:36:59,515
Well,

485
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:02,343
if I made another mistake,

486
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:05,414
will I pass probation next month,

487
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,145
or will you fire me?

488
00:37:22,678 --> 00:37:24,905
So, what did our boss say?

489
00:37:25,558 --> 00:37:28,332
Honestly, I got quite a scolding, Prim.

490
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:32,420
But the good news is that he said that
if I genuinely want to work here,

491
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,582
he'll give me another chance
and extend my probation for four more months.

492
00:37:35,582 --> 00:37:38,140
Really? That's great news! Congratulations!

493
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,620
Thank you so much!

494
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,665
I even found a place to stay
near the office, just in case.

495
00:37:47,086 --> 00:37:51,937
Wait, if your probation
is extended for four months,

496
00:37:52,844 --> 00:37:54,498
does that mean I won't be able to resign?

497
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:00,163
Oh, that's true.

498
00:38:03,432 --> 00:38:04,975
That boss is unbelievable.

499
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,601
Excuse me, auntie, which piece of chicken
is the cheapest and has the most meat?

500
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:17,060
Alright then, I'll take four of these
and one sticky rice, please.

501
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:18,873
The biggest one, please.

502
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:24,469
What's she doing here?

503
00:38:35,656 --> 00:38:38,180
- Are you Mind, the one who called yesterday?
- Yes, that's me.

504
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,260
Let me take you upstairs to see the room.

505
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,922
Okay, great. Thank you so much.

506
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,177
Don't tell me that girl is moving here?

507
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:01,560
No way!

508
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:06,239
On your left here is the parking area.

509
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:08,857
If you have a car, you can park it here.
And this way…

510
00:39:08,857 --> 00:39:10,474
Oh, hey, Kawee!

511
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,580
Done with work already? Perfect timing!

512
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:19,137
I was going to ask about last month's rent.
Did you transfer it to me?

513
00:39:20,315 --> 00:39:23,041
I already did,
but it was two to three days late.

514
00:39:25,898 --> 00:39:27,637
- Excuse me, I'll head off now.
- Alright.

515
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:36,548
Excuse me, but does that guy live here, too?

516
00:39:36,548 --> 00:39:39,580
Why do you call him that guy? Do you know him?

517
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,015
Oh, it's nothing.

518
00:39:43,553 --> 00:39:46,610
His name is Kawee. He lives here.

519
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,897
He's nice, but he tends to pay rent late.

520
00:39:52,528 --> 00:39:55,734
Isn't he rich? Why's he living here?

521
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:08,287
Please review this contract first.

522
00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:23,512
What? A blackout?

523
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:27,428
Oh, no! My work! My project!

524
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:31,776
Why does the power have to go out today?!

525
00:40:33,926 --> 00:40:35,926
<i>The building management announced earlier that</i>

526
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:38,426
<i>the power would be cut for an hour at 8 pm</i>

527
00:40:38,426 --> 00:40:40,494
<i>because it's Earth Hour day.</i>

528
00:40:40,494 --> 00:40:44,990
<i>So, anyone working overtime,
don't panic and remember to save your files.</i>

529
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,321
<i>Okay, thanks!</i>

530
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:48,939
<i>I better set a reminder.</i>

531
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:53,726
<i>Aren't you setting a reminder too?
You'll forget, I bet.</i>

532
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:56,060
<i>You're getting older and more forgetful.</i>

533
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,633
<i>Call me "old" and I'll smack you
as many times as my age!</i>

534
00:40:58,633 --> 00:41:02,454
<i>A genius like me doesn't need reminders.</i>

535
00:41:02,454 --> 00:41:05,603
<i>Besides, I always…</i>

536
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:09,486
<i>finish my work and head home by 5 pm.</i>

537
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:14,960
Miss Genius,

538
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,748
you forgot the power's out at 8 pm today!

539
00:41:18,748 --> 00:41:21,680
Oh no! What should I do now?

540
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,875
I need to go to the restroom,
and the power is out.

541
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:24,876
Okay…

542
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:31,542
Who turned off the lights? Who?

543
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:33,268
- Sir.
- Please don't take me!

544
00:41:33,268 --> 00:41:34,694
- Please don't take me!
- Calm down, sir.

545
00:41:34,694 --> 00:41:37,259
It's nothing serious, just Earth Hour.
The power's out for only an hour.

546
00:41:37,259 --> 00:41:39,092
Don't take me! I want to go home! I…

547
00:41:39,092 --> 00:41:40,289
I'm going home!

548
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:43,832
Let me go! Let me go! Please don't take me!

549
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,105
Ms. Bhum! Ms. Bhum!

550
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:33,755
It's me, Ms. Bhum!

551
00:42:33,755 --> 00:42:36,726
Gosh, I felt scared! I thought it was a ghost.

552
00:42:38,602 --> 00:42:42,579
If you're done being scared,
could you remove it, please?

553
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:45,364
- Huh? Remove what?
- Your hand from my butt.

554
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:56,575
Well, I'll go now. Excuse me!

555
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,992
Hey, wait, please!

556
00:42:58,992 --> 00:42:59,993
Yes?

557
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:04,679
I need to pee. Can you take me to the restroom?

558
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,226
Of course! Let's go.

559
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:13,399
Oh, dear…

560
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:17,027
- Take it slow, okay?
- Yes, yes.

561
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,739
Please don't take me! I want to go home!

562
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:21,939
- It's okay now, calm down.
- I want to go home! I want to go home!

563
00:43:21,939 --> 00:43:23,340
Boss, please calm down.

564
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,699
Can I not go? Can I? It's so dark.

565
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:29,074
Let me go! Let me go!

566
00:43:30,554 --> 00:43:34,978

567
00:43:34,978 --> 00:43:39,505

Meow Meow.

575
00:44:27,761 --> 00:44:29,603
Do you think our boss will be okay?

576
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:34,064
Why did he get so scared
when the lights go out?

577
00:44:36,379 --> 00:44:38,864
And there's that scar on his ankle.

578
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:46,566
<i>- Please don't take me! Please don't!
- Boss, calm down.</i>

579
00:44:46,566 --> 00:44:47,962
<i>I want to go home!</i>

580
00:44:53,512 --> 00:44:54,523
Get it away!

581
00:44:57,355 --> 00:44:58,849
I told you to get it away!

582
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:25,104
Hello, June?

583
00:45:25,104 --> 00:45:26,115
<i>What?</i>

584
00:45:26,828 --> 00:45:28,781
I'm calling about that matter.

585
00:45:28,781 --> 00:45:32,875
The one I asked you to look into,
the case of the kidnapped child 25 years ago.

586
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:34,621
What did you find?

587
00:45:39,296 --> 00:45:40,670
So, what's the deal?

588
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:42,939
Here's the thing,

589
00:45:42,939 --> 00:45:46,816
The kidnapped child back then
is the heir to the Theeranon Group.

590
00:45:46,816 --> 00:45:49,221
That child's name is Thee or Tham?

591
00:45:49,895 --> 00:45:53,042
I tried investigating,
but I couldn't find anything.

592
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,077
No records, no information at all.

593
00:46:39,156 --> 00:46:42,586
Am I that dazzling
that you're staring at me like that?

594
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:48,277
Just tell me directly. I'll sit here quietly
and let you stare at me all day.

595
00:46:49,035 --> 00:46:51,956
I have something I'm curious about,

596
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:54,844
but I'm not sure if I should ask.

597
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:59,612
You can ask me anything.
I'll answer whatever the questions may be.

598
00:47:02,015 --> 00:47:04,981
Is it about the four-month probation extension
I gave it to Secretary Mind?

599
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,596
It's not that.

600
00:47:16,491 --> 00:47:18,413
The question I want to ask is…

601
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:26,666
are you the prince who once saved me
when I was kidnapped?

602
00:47:35,165 --> 00:47:38,371
What are you talking about? Prince?

603
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:41,723
Wait, you were kidnapped?

604
00:47:42,717 --> 00:47:45,569
Yes, but it was a long time ago
when I was a child.

605
00:47:46,109 --> 00:47:51,390
Recently, I heard that
the Theeranon family heir was also kidnapped.

606
00:47:53,194 --> 00:47:56,395
Perhaps he was involved
in the same incident as I was.

607
00:47:57,813 --> 00:48:00,374
That person could be the prince
I have been looking for.

608
00:48:03,593 --> 00:48:05,698
You have a scar on your ankle,

609
00:48:06,512 --> 00:48:08,891
which might be from
being cut by a cable tie.

610
00:48:09,896 --> 00:48:11,717
Plus, you're also afraid of the dark.

611
00:48:13,317 --> 00:48:14,776
I can sense that,

612
00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:19,059
the person who was kidnapped with me,

613
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,714
the prince I have been searching for, is you.

614
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:32,850
Well, is it you?

615
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:41,855
You have misunderstood.

616
00:48:43,446 --> 00:48:44,451
Yes,

617
00:48:45,271 --> 00:48:48,212
someone from my family was kidnapped,

618
00:48:48,212 --> 00:48:49,610
but that person wasn't me.

619
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:51,943
It was my older brother.

620
00:49:01,881 --> 00:49:04,135
May I ask one more question?

621
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,638
How did you get the scar on your ankle?

622
00:49:13,213 --> 00:49:17,620
I got that scar while playing
football with my friends.

623
00:49:18,928 --> 00:49:22,920
I was tackled hard and ended up
losing both of my legs.

624
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,088
Luckily, the doctor was able
to stitch them up in time.

625
00:49:25,605 --> 00:49:27,328
So, is this true?

626
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:29,629
Do you believe this?

627
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,873
It's just a joke I used to play with Pat.

628
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:39,791
What's even funnier is that
I was never kidnapped,

629
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:43,789
and I'm not the prince you want.

630
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:14,696
<i>So, what's going on here?</i>

631
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,986
<i>Is it him or not?</i>

632
00:50:27,806 --> 00:50:28,965
Prim, Prim!

633
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,884
Did you see the post
in the secret group of Morpheus?

634
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:34,780
What post?

635
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:38,832
It's from the author, Morpheus,
who posted it a few years ago.

636
00:50:38,832 --> 00:50:41,249
He says that he was kidnapped as a child.

637
00:50:42,275 --> 00:50:44,164
Who was kidnapped?

638
00:50:44,164 --> 00:50:49,020
It was Tham. He wrote a blog post about it
before he became famous.

639
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,360
Actually, that post was deleted,

640
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,692
But the fans managed to capture it,
so they dug it up and reposted it.

641
00:50:55,712 --> 00:50:56,892
Can you take a look at it?

642
00:50:56,892 --> 00:50:57,898
Sure, here.

643
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,659
Prim, I'll leave my phone with you for now.

644
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:07,260
I'll go get the documents
for the boss in a moment.

645
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:17,447
<i>The room was dark, hot, and musty,</i>

646
00:51:18,772 --> 00:51:20,246
<i>with no light.</i>

647
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:27,043
<i>All I could hear was the sound of footsteps
walking back and forth in front of the room.</i>

648
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,150
<i>It felt like I was living in hell.</i>

649
00:51:31,517 --> 00:51:34,851
<i>I could only pray
to get out of there as quickly as possible.</i>

650
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:37,803
<i>Even though I felt hopeless,</i>

651
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:41,813
<i>I secretly hoped someone would rescue me.</i>

652
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:46,041
Our boss or Mr.Tham,

653
00:51:47,954 --> 00:51:49,304
who exactly is it?

654
00:51:59,824 --> 00:52:00,829
Hello?

655
00:52:02,326 --> 00:52:03,673
<i>Hello, Mr.Tham.</i>

656
00:52:05,131 --> 00:52:08,418
Do you have some time to meet with me?

657
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,812
Sure, I do.

658
00:52:22,978 --> 00:52:25,089
Did we were locked up together
when we were kids?

659
00:52:25,867 --> 00:52:26,873
Yes,

660
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,985
don't you remember that we were together?

661
00:52:34,413 --> 00:52:36,959
Actually, I was really shocked
by that incident,

662
00:52:36,959 --> 00:52:38,281
so I don't remember much.

663
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,320
In that case, is there anything you can recall?

664
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:46,906
I was locked up
in an abandoned house by someone…

665
00:52:46,906 --> 00:52:48,416
because Thee left me behind.

666
00:52:50,353 --> 00:52:51,961
Did our boss abandon you, Mr.Tham?

667
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:56,333
Being abandoned wasn't
really surprising for me.

668
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,214
When we were kids, Thee was smart,
so he moved to the same grade as me.

669
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:06,651
The kidnapped kid back then must have been
in 6th grade, around 12 years old.

670
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:11,551
At that time, he must have been
around 10 years old and in the 4th grade.

671
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,220
But he mentioned that he was really smart,

672
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,899
so he advanced a grade and ended up
in the same grade as his older brother.

673
00:53:15,899 --> 00:53:19,667
All the friends I was close with
left me to hang out with Thee.

674
00:53:23,885 --> 00:53:27,245
One day, Thee invited me to an aquarium
that was under construction.

675
00:53:30,493 --> 00:53:34,789
Then suddenly, he left me behind,
and I was kidnapped.

676
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,112
The event made Thee feel really guilty to me.

677
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,022
He thought he was the reason I was kidnapped.

678
00:53:59,523 --> 00:54:01,867
I wish I could remember more
about the incident.

679
00:54:03,271 --> 00:54:05,400
If you were a part of that incident too,

680
00:54:06,133 --> 00:54:08,363
could you help me recall it?

681
00:54:15,893 --> 00:54:21,657
<i>I can sense that,
the person who was kidnapped with me,</i>

682
00:54:23,107 --> 00:54:26,542
<i>the prince I have been searching for, is you.</i>

683
00:54:28,634 --> 00:54:30,241
You have been kind to me…

684
00:54:31,842 --> 00:54:34,942
because you think I'm the prince
you have been searching for,

685
00:54:37,779 --> 00:54:39,856
not because you like me.

686
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,771
The most fun outing in the world
is about to begin.

687
00:55:13,587 --> 00:55:16,053
Now I can follow you everywhere.

688
00:55:16,053 --> 00:55:17,804
Heaven is clearly on my side.

689
00:55:17,804 --> 00:55:19,130
It's hell, actually.

690
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:20,561
What are you doing here, boss?

691
00:55:20,561 --> 00:55:23,001
I'll stay and join the workshop with everyone.

692
00:55:23,614 --> 00:55:25,304
I'm thankful to Thee

693
00:55:25,304 --> 00:55:26,691
for letting me meet you.

694
00:55:27,398 --> 00:55:29,761
Do you like my brother or something?
Why do you want to talk to him so much?

695
00:55:30,882 --> 00:55:33,174
I have to remember Prim.
I have to remember her.
