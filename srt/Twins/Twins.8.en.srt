1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,740
I'm glad you're leaving the hospital.

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,400
But...

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,360
Are you sure about your decision
to live Sprite's life?

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,965
Why?

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,480
You agreed to let him live mine.

6
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:21,040
But...

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,040
But you don't have to be him.

8
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:26,320
I made this decision

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,100
because I still can't play
volleyball now.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,400
But you'll have to practice jiujitsu.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,400
Dad said he will take care of that.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,560
But...

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,540
I...

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,380
Salmon.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,100
From now on, I am Sprite.

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,660
Should we leave now?

17
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,207
Sprite must have taken care
of the expenses by now.

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,220
Okay, let's go.

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,360
Why didn't you stop him?

20
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,700
How can I do that?

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,220
He's not fully recovered.

22
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,140
I'll have to pretend to be Zee
for awhile longer.

23
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,480
Do you want to go now?
I'll give you a ride.

24
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,240
Do you want to have dinner
with me first?

25
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,200
That's a good idea.

26
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,120
Okay.

27
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,920
There's no need to rush.
I already called Coach.

28
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,480
How close are you and Coach Wit?

29
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,800
We were classmates, why?

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,340
Nothing.

31
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,700
I think he likes you.

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,900
Hey.

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,360
Don't say that again.

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,440
People might misunderstand.

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,540
Coach Wit and I are friends.

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,940
Really?

37
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,380
That's good.

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,380
Let's go get something to eat

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,380
before we separate.

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,020
If you pay, I can eat anything.

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,580
Come on. Let's go, Salmon.

42
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,960
Okay, Auntie.

43
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,420
Are there restaurants downstairs?

44
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,920
Zee.

45
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,080
You can stay in Sprite's room for now.

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,360
Zee.

47
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,240
If you want to be Sprite,

48
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,240
you must practice jiujitsu.

49
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,540
Are you

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,540
going to be okay?

51
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,940
I can practice once I am recovered.

52
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,020
I want to know

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,720
why you want to live his life.

54
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,960
I don't know what happened.

55
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,800
But if you want to tell me,

56
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm ready to listen.

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,680
Dad.

58
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,140
I'm not ready

59
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,940
to tell you anything right now.

60
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,500
If you both insist on doing this,

61
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,700
I will help you.

62
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay, Dad.

63
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,700
You should get some rest.

64
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,920
Get well soon, Zee.

65
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,300
This is the right thing to do.

66
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,040
I can be Sprite.

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,660
I don't have to be myself.

68
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,420
I can do whatever I want.

69
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,000
(Twins)
(Episode 8)

70
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,440
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to come in?

71
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,440
Oh.

72
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,640
Well...

73
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,700
Where are you going?

74
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,620
Aren't you going out?

75
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,320
I just finished cleaning the room.

76
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,900
I'm going to take the trash out.

77
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,140
I'll help you.

78
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,640
No, I'll do it.

79
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,980
You already cleaned the room.
I'll take the trash out.

80
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,680
No, I'll do it.

81
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,900
I'll do it.

82
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,900
No.

83
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,760
I'll do it.

84
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,020
No.

85
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,020
I'll do it.

86
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,480
No.

87
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,300
I'll do it.

88
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,720
No.

89
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,320
Come on.

90
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,300
Hey.

91
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,820
Are you okay?

92
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,380
You seem strange.

93
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,640
I...

94
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,360
I don't know

95
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,600
when I started to have this feeling.

96
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,160
I don't like it

97
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,020
when you mingle

98
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,640
or when you're close to someone else.

99
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
Does it mean

100
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,940
that I like you?

101
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,200
First.

102
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,340
I thought

103
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,000
you were nice to me

104
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,560
because you had feelings for me too.

105
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,880
Who said I don't?

106
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,340
Your heart is beating fast.

107
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,000
I think I like you too.

108
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,180
Are...

109
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,980
Are you sure, Zee?

110
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,920
I don't know if you believe me or not.

111
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,340
I don't kiss anyone I don't like.

112
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,180
Let's try it again.

113
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,080
That's enough.

114
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,460
Hello, Koh.

115
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,460
Where are you, Zee?

116
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,860
Everyone's waiting for you
to come and play.

117
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,620
Okay, I'll go now.

118
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,540
Koh wants me to join them.

119
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,220
But I don't want to go.

120
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,900
I want to stay here with you.

121
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,400
Go.

122
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,480
Don't make it a big deal.

123
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,700
Wait.

124
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,700
Pick up the trash first.

125
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,520
Did you start?

126
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,040
I did.

127
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,660
What about you, Deaw?

128
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:33,900
Me too.

129
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,160
You're finally here.
We have been waiting for you.

130
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,860
What were you doing?

131
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,040
I can sense a vibe.

132
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,460
Did I miss something?

133
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,300
What game are you playing?

134
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,740
Let me play with you.

135
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,680
Sure.

136
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,220
We just finished this game.

137
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,860
First and Zee. Come play with us.

138
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,460
Okay.

139
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,020
Can I be on the same team with First?

140
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,340
Zee.

141
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,340
What are you talking about?

142
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,160
Sure.

143
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,260
Jack.

144
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,640
Where were you?

145
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,080
I went home.

146
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,200
Do you want to play with us?

147
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,400
We're missing a person.

148
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,680
It's okay.

149
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,160
I...

150
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,480
You guys go ahead.

151
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,120
I'm tired.

152
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,180
Koh.

153
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,220
I'm sorry.

154
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,300
Can you not be like this?

155
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm unhappy.

156
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,940
The more I try to talk to you,

157
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,340
the more you ignore me.

158
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,540
Do you think I'm happy?

159
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,560
I'm sorry.

160
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,060
What should I do

161
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,600
to make it up to you?

162
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,960
Tell me.

163
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,900
I'll do anything.

164
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,520
Are you sure?

165
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,000
This has nothing to do with the team.

166
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,040
This is about us.

167
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,940
Fine.

168
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,500
Let's start then.

169
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,080
Sprite.

170
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,560
Sprite.

171
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,160
You are Sprite.

172
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,060
How's your leg?

173
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,660
How did you get hit by a car?

174
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,200
I'm feeling better now.

175
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,920
Att. Phu.

176
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,700
Where are you going?

177
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,340
We're going to get something to eat.

178
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,660
You?

179
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,440
I'm going to the club.

180
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,640
Huh?

181
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,640
Are you sure you can practice, Sprite?

182
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,060
Yeah.

183
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,720
I think you should wait
until you're recovered.

184
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,200
If you practice now, it will get worse.

185
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,740
Yeah.

186
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,200
I'll go alone.

187
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,280
We'll go get something to eat.

188
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,620
We'll meet you there.

189
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,120
What should we eat?

190
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,820
I don't understand you guys.

191
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,100
You're switching places
like in the movies.

192
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,260
What are you guys up to?

193
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,720
I'm going to see Salmon.

194
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,220
Go practice.

195
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,640
I'm so confused with them.

196
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,280
(Where are you?)

197
00:19:30,455 --> 00:19:31,564
(I'm at the bathroom)

198
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:34,638
(What is it?)

199
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:42,977
(Sprite)

200
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,500
Hello.

201
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,500
Where are you, First?

202
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,460
I'm in front of you.

203
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,220
Move.

204
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,320
No.

205
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,360
Why are you mad at me again?

206
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,760
Tell me.

207
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,360
Tell me.

208
00:21:07,385 --> 00:21:09,385
Come on, First.

209
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,860
Why are you mad?

210
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,380
What's the big deal?

211
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,660
You are mad at me.

212
00:22:14,343 --> 00:22:16,211
(Tan)

213
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,020
Zee.

214
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,580
Have you been waiting for a long time?

215
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,720
No.

216
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,300
Sprite wants me to give you
the jiujitsu uniform.

217
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,480
I'm sorry, Zee.

218
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,620
I understand if you don't forgive me.

219
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,160
It's my fault

220
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,800
for suggesting your mother
to have Sprite take your place.

221
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,631
I know

222
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,120
that you did it because you had
my best interests at heart.

223
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,900
I can't be mad at you.

224
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,960
Thank you.

225
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,700
Thank you for understanding.

226
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,700
I haven't ordered any drinks for you.

227
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,700
What do you want? I'll order it.

228
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,320
What about a cold latte?

229
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,320
Salmon.

230
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,220
I don't drink caffeine.

231
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,620
That's right.

232
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,660
I totally forgot.

233
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,820
Latte is Sprite's favorite drink.

234
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,160
What about iced chocolate?

235
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,560
I'll get it for you.

236
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,080
You and Sprite.

237
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,400
What about us?

238
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,960
No.

239
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,520
Nothing.

240
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,420
I'll order you a drink.

241
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,660
Hey.

242
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,180
What's the matter with you?

243
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,540
It's my place.

244
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,800
I was here first.

245
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,000
I was here first.

246
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,600
Go sit there.

247
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,320
What's the matter with you, Zee?

248
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,460
You're pissing me off.

249
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,040
I'm starving.

250
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,260
Greatness can only be achieved

251
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,800
with sacrifice, Tom.

252
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,540
What sacrifice?

253
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,040
Go sit beside Koh.

254
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,040
I don't want to sit next to him.
He always steals my food.

255
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,040
Huh?

256
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,560
Damn it.

257
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,480
Sam.

258
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,240
No.

259
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,200
You're slow. Go sit there.

260
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,180
Didn't you get
any martial arts training?

261
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,040
Of course I can do this.

262
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,820
Even Sprite...

263
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,060
Hey. Sprite.

264
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,400
Ouch, Sprite.

265
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,220
Damn it. That hurt.

266
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,360
Sprite, you're hurting me.

267
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,360
I surrender.

268
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,260
I surrender. You're really good.

269
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,260
Damn it. You're really good.

270
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,940
Right?

271
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,320
Let's do it one more time.

272
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,380
Where should I put this, Zee?

273
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,120
Over here.

274
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,300
You're right.

275
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,920
Yes!

276
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,940
We're done.

277
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,320
I'll show this to Mom and Dad.

278
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,780
Dad. Mom.

279
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,680
Zee.

280
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,140
I'm sorry.

281
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,460
I didn't mean it.

282
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,280
Let's do it again.

283
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,020
Do it again?

284
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,020
It wasn't easy.

285
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,320
You always make it seem so easy.

286
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,320
Do you know what I hate the most?

287
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,060
I hate that you always do this.

288
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,000
Zee.

289
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,200
It's not a big deal.

290
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,440
Zee.

291
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,840
Zee.

292
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
Wait, Zee.

293
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,620
Zee.

294
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:56,576
(Mom)

295
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,480
Hello, Mom.

296
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,720
Zee.

297
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,920
How are you?

298
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,280
You haven't called me.

299
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
I'm worried about you.

300
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
I'm good.

301
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,080
Don't worry about me.

302
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,240
Is Dad taking good care of you?

303
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,220
Yes.

304
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,220
He is.

305
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,980
Is that all you want to know?

306
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,800
I'm going to rest.

307
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,800
Wait, Zee.

308
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,800
So how are you?

309
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,480
I'm fine.

310
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,180
After you recover,

311
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,080
are you going to play volleyball again?

312
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,820
Do you ever think about
anything else besides volleyball?

313
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,500
I don't know why

314
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,000
I got injured.

315
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,960
I'm just afraid
that we will get in trouble

316
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,180
if someone finds out the truth.

317
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,680
If you're that afraid,

318
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,480
why did you allow him
to pretend to be me?

319
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,480
I'm hanging up.

320
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,540
Zee.

321
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,620
Fried chicken from your favorite place.

322
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,680
This restaurant is amazing.

323
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,680
Go ahead. It's your favorite.

324
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,680
If you're not going to eat, I will.

325
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,160
It's my favorite too.

326
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,900
I don't eat things like this.

327
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,400
Sprite.

328
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,760
I'm done.

329
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,760
Sprite, did you write the wrong name?

330
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,860
Sprite.

331
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,680
Why do you keep writing the wrong name?

332
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:26,171
(Kanthorn)

333
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,061
(Kanthee)

334
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,580
You suck.

335
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,180
You're acting like someone
who doesn't know how to fight.

336
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,311
Ever since you lost that match, huh?

337
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,660
Don't mess with me.

338
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,380
If this is all you can do,
you don't need to come anymore.

339
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,060
You're annoying me.

340
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,760
I didn't ask you to look at me.

341
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,140
Your old conflict hasn't been resolved
and you're going to fight again?

342
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,380
Let's not fight, Sprite.

343
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,180
Be careful.

344
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,380
Don't be so bold.

345
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,840
Calm down.

346
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,840
I'm begging you.

347
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,460
Why did you stop me?

348
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,400
I was so close to punching him.

349
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,740
Come on.

350
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,940
Calm down. No fighting in the club.
Did you forget that?

351
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,720
Didn't you see how he pissed me off?

352
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
I want to punch him in the face.

353
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,560
But I think

354
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,920
your two best friends are being strange.

355
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,560
Strange how?

356
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,820
You guys are closer to them.

357
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,280
Don't you notice it?

358
00:33:25,652 --> 00:33:28,132
Are you talking about

359
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,280
their performance or their behavior?

360
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,280
What behavior?

361
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,060
Let's take a lunch break.

362
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,800
Come back in 15 minutes.

363
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,510
Okay.

364
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,240
What's wrong, First?

365
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,340
Are you mad at me?

366
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,960
Wow.

367
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,800
You're so much better now.

368
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,800
Even Coach was complimenting you.

369
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,340
I've been working hard.
Of course I'm much better, Salmon.

370
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,200
You like to be complimented, don't you?

371
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,500
You must be exhausted.

372
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,500
But you won't be soon.

373
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,640
What do you mean?

374
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,420
I mean...

375
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,420
Once Zee recovers,

376
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,420
you won't have to pretend
to be him anymore.

377
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,440
So you can go back to jiujitsu.

378
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,860
What's with the face?

379
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,580
Aren't you happy
that you'll get to do jiujitsu again?

380
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,060
I...

381
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,680
Hey.

382
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,440
Zee wants to meet you.
Are you available today?

383
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,520
Do you want to come with me?

384
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,540
Namkhing, if you're not going
to clear the air with First

385
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,080
you should give up.

386
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,700
Ever since that day,

387
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,480
Zee just disappeared.

388
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,200
He never texted you again.

389
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,920
Is it because...

390
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:47,845
Well... You guys are overthinking.

391
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,000
Zee is an athlete.

392
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,780
He could be busy with practice.

393
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,460
Stop it. Nothing's going on.

394
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,720
Really?

395
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,860
Have you asked First about it?

396
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,600
I haven't.

397
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,240
I don't have the guts to do that.

398
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,740
Why don't you just call and ask him?

399
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,960
Where were you?

400
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,460
Were you waiting for me?

401
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,840
No.

402
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,840
You were gone awhile.

403
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,720
Well...

404
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,480
Zee.

405
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,060
Zee.

406
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,060
What's going on?

407
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,220
Because of how you are,

408
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,540
I can't go anywhere.

409
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,540
What did you say?

410
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,780
Are you going to miss me when I'm gone?

411
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,380
Why?

412
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,380
Where are you going now?

413
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,220
I want to be here with you forever.

414
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,200
Zee.

415
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,460
What's wrong?

416
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,760
Huh?

417
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,400
Are you free tomorrow?

418
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,380
Yeah.

419
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,560
Let's go out.

420
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,120
Sure.

421
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,860
What the hell, Deaw? You scared me.

422
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,260
You've been very jumpy lately.

423
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,300
I'm joking.

424
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,700
I invested everything I have,
how can I withdraw now?

425
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,720
Fine.

426
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,080
I have to do it.

427
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,400
Let me keep doing this.

428
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,360
If Coach finds out,
do you think he'll be okay?

429
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,880
You will get caught.

430
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,680
I have to go.

431
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:35,947
(Good luck, my amazing boy)

432
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,060
You're pretty cute too.

433
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,720
There is so much space.
Why do you have to walk so close to me?

434
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,540
I want to walk close to you.

435
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,080
Why?

436
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,800
Don't. I'm hot.

437
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,000
Why do you always act
like you don't want me around?

438
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:10,704
Can't you just let me do what I want?

439
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,600
Come on.

440
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,100
Sprite.

441
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,960
Aren't you going to practice?

442
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,880
Who is that? Is he your friend?

443
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:28,880
I don't know.

444
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,620
I don't know him.
He probably got the wrong guy.

445
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,920
Huh?

446
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,560
Hold on.

447
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,260
Hello, Tong.

448
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,180
I saw Sprite at the mall.
I don't know who he is with.

449
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,200
Come.

450
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,160
What's going on?

451
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,740
You walk so slowly.

452
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,460
Where are you taking me?

453
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,760
No.

454
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,160
Can you tell me who those two are?

455
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,520
I don't know them.

456
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,040
He probably got the wrong guy.

457
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,160
Then why did you run away?

458
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,260
I didn't.

459
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,060
Are you sure?

460
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,060
Do you owe them money?

461
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,400
Did you gamble?

462
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,600
Gamble? No.

463
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:27,960
Are you sure?

464
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,300
Yes.

465
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,020
I swear that I didn't.

466
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,540
I'm hungry.

467
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,960
Let's go find something to eat.

468
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,080
Please.

469
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,180
Huh?

470
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,000
I just saw him at the university.

471
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,320
What's going on?

472
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,740
Hey.

473
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
It's him.

474
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,680
How is that possible?
We just saw him at the university.

475
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,280
I forgot something.

476
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,940
I'll go get it.

477
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,280
See you at the car.

478
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,540
Go in.

479
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,540
You're not so foul-mouthed now, huh?

480
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,820
Not going to answer?

481
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,020
Are you being arrogant?

482
00:44:59,232 --> 00:45:01,872
Did you get a concussion
from the car crash?

483
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,160
Move.

484
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,080
I won't.

485
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,100
You think no one knows
what you're doing?

486
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,200
What are you talking about?

487
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,140
You and Sprite are the same person.

488
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,820
You think I can't tell?

489
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,220
You think we're stupid?

490
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,800
Losers.

491
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,160
Fuck you.

492
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,620
You're so foul-mouthed.

493
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,200
Don't blame us for kicking your ass.

494
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:24,680
Take that.

495
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,420
Damn it.

496
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,020
Your twin hurt us.

497
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,700
(Next Episode)
We have a little problem.

498
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,980
I'm afraid that if you come back now...

499
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,740
Can I have a bit more time?

500
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,080
Please wait for me.

501
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,500
Can I be you three times a week?

502
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,540
Tong.

503
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,300
Yeah?

504
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,800
Are you sure that there will be
no evidence that leads back to us?

505
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,040
You always take such good care of me.

506
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,680
Sprite.

507
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,820
I will agree to switch places
with you one more time, Sprite.
