1
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,520
My mother is sick.

2
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:45,137
So I have to take more part-time jobs.

3
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,630
That's why you haven't been
practicing much?

4
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,220
Yeah.

5
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,120
I don't want everyone to know

6
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,360
because I'll have less time to practice

7
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,360
and I'm afraid
I'll no longer be a starter.

8
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,730
But I'm not doing anything bad
like you're assuming.

9
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,520
Why don't we tell Coach about this?

10
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,020
He will probably understand.

11
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,250
So you don't have
to sneak around like this.

12
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,990
But...

13
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,960
What if he finds out and benches me?

14
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,090
You've always practiced hard.

15
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,980
Coach will find a way to help you.

16
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:51,354
So you won't have to be exhausted
taking part-time jobs.

17
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,340
So how is your mother?

18
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:07,425
Not good.

19
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,920
She must be under
the doctor's care at all times.

20
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,900
And... There are so many expenses.

21
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,010
Let me know
if I can help you with anything.

22
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,380
I might be able to help.

23
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,110
I'm sorry

24
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,110
for doubting you.

25
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,650
Yeah.

26
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,720
It's okay.

27
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,900
(Twins)
(Episode 11)

28
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,280
Hello, Zee.

29
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,060
Tom isn't a spy.

30
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,060
He's working part-time

31
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,570
because his mother is sick.

32
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,080
Good.

33
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,950
Who do you suspect?

34
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,530
I have to go. Someone's coming.

35
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,360
I can't take any more photos.

36
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,740
This is already getting suspicious.

37
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,730
Once this task is done,

38
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,730
don't forget our deal.

39
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,200
So Koh is the spy?

40
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,890
If there's a spy on the team,

41
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,460
it must be Koh.

42
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,730
Why would he do that?

43
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:58,830
This will only ruin him.

44
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,090
The other team's offer
might be interesting to him.

45
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,570
Do you think we should tell Coach?

46
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,770
If what we suspect is true,

47
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,610
Koh's future will be ruined.

48
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,670
He will never
get to play volleyball again.

49
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,010
Or should we ask him directly?

50
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,680
Are you nuts?

51
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,380
I'll try to gather
more evidence tomorrow.

52
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,380
I'll help you

53
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,750
to make up for the mess
I caused your team.

54
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,370
Okay.

55
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,050
Damn it, Zee. Why aren't you
doing this kind of thing?

56
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,170
Yes.

57
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,210
Come on. Let's do this.

58
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,350
What's the passcode?

59
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,150
I'm starving.

60
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,800
I'm exhausted today.

61
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,610
We're trying so hard
we should be on the national team.

62
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,880
Damn exhausting.

63
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,930
That's a given.

64
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,670
I'm sweaty. I need a shower.

65
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:40,940
Hey.

66
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,860
What are you doing?

67
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,130
I was just practicing.

68
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,730
Why don't you do that at the court?

69
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,260
Hey.

70
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,260
Go and take a shower

71
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,080
or we'll miss dinner.

72
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,640
Koh.

73
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,990
Are you all right?

74
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,600
You look bothered,

75
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,010
like someone who's having bad luck.

76
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,320
No.

77
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,730
I'll take a shower.

78
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,520
Okay.

79
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,530
That was close.

80
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,500
Damn, I forgot something.

81
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,490
What's up with you?

82
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,490
I think I have a stomachache.

83
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,490
Maybe it's gastritis.

84
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:01,930
You seem suspicious.

85
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,090
That was close.

86
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,130
Do you know his birthday?

87
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,410
I don't.

88
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,056
Do you have his Facebook?

89
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,080
Why don't you search for it?

90
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,490
I don't know his Facebook name.

91
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,890
I'll stop trying.

92
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,110
His phone will lock.

93
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,680
I'm sure Koh knows by now.

94
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,710
We should find out quickly.

95
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,220
I really don't understand

96
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,220
why he would do this.

97
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:52,920
People can't be trusted.

98
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,420
What are you doing?

99
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,090
Nothing.

100
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,570
I'm going to shower and sleep.

101
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,500
I'm hanging up.

102
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,070
Sam.

103
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,590
The match is coming up.
Are you stressed?

104
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,380
A little.

105
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,380
There are so many stressful things

106
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,210
going on in the team.

107
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,980
Well...

108
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,300
Stressful things?

109
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,380
What do you mean?

110
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,220
They say

111
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,220
someone has been leaking
our team's strategy.

112
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,340
Look at the last match.

113
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,010
The opposing team knew our every move.

114
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,670
Oh...

115
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,680
Or...

116
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,250
Do they have a ghost spy?

117
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,780
What ghost spy?

118
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,860
I shouldn't have told you about it.

119
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,690
Hey, Sam.

120
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:10,290
Yeah?

121
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,290
Did you like playing volleyball
since you were a kid?

122
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,450
No.

123
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,590
Really?

124
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,450
When did you realize

125
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,240
you liked playing volleyball?

126
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,610
When I saw Zee playing.

127
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,810
I was in middle school.

128
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,890
A friend invited me
to a volleyball match at school.

129
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,480
Zee was a starter then.

130
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,840
When I saw him playing,

131
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,310
I felt like he was so cool.

132
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,790
I started liking volleyball since then.

133
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,930
When I actually started playing,

134
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,320
I enjoyed it.

135
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,320
So I kept playing.

136
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm jealous of Zee.

137
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:54,850
Huh?

138
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,760
Why are you jealous of him?

139
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:02,868
You think about him

140
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,850
with every breath you take.

141
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,620
Honestly, do you like Zee that much?

142
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,810
Well...

143
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,810
I...

144
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,470
I really liked him then.

145
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,470
And now?

146
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,800
Now...

147
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,280
Now I...

148
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,130
You like me instead, right?

149
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,560
Tan.

150
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,450
Sam.

151
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,100
Yeah?

152
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,100
Be my boyfriend.

153
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,710
I've been chasing you for awhile now.

154
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,220
Okay?

155
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,380
I was waiting for you to ask me.

156
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Oh, it's here.

157
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,790
I thought I had to buy a new one.

158
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,590
Okay, I've got everything.

159
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,800
Hey.

160
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,610
We almost didn't win last time.

161
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,860
Do you think

162
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,580
it's strange that they knew our moves?

163
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,180
Yeah, I thought so too.

164
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:46,552
We only won after five sets.

165
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,560
I was exhausted.

166
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,580
Jack.

167
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,580
Should we ask Coach
for a day off tomorrow?

168
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:57,072
Please tell him. Please.

169
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,520
I think that would be difficult.

170
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,600
Based on our score,
I think he might make us practice more.

171
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,670
Will we make it for the final round?

172
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,670
I can't do five sets anymore.

173
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,670
This is so stressful.

174
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,640
But during a time like this,

175
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,570
we should try to stay calm.

176
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,570
Even though it's hard to do,

177
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,050
don't give up.

178
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,160
I have an idea.

179
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,020
Or...

180
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,020
Is our strategy too easy to read?

181
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,140
I don't think so.

182
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,220
It's pretty difficult.

183
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,630
Zee uses the same strategy
in every match.

184
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,250
I'm not surprised they figured him out.

185
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,380
You know

186
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,039
how much of a target he is.

187
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,290
You have a point.

188
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,970
Coach Wit said that

189
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,690
it seems like that team knows
our strategy.

190
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,300
What does he mean?

191
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,840
I don't know.

192
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,320
Is there a spy

193
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,600
on our team?

194
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,410
The other team

195
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,580
knows our weaknesses.

196
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,030
I think

197
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:32,810
if we let this continue,

198
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,530
it won't be good to our team.

199
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,970
Have you been watching too many series?

200
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,330
A monk

201
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,280
once taught me

202
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,650
not to trust people.

203
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:50,306
I must find out who the spy is.

204
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,240
You're being ridiculous. What the hell?

205
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,580
How is that possible?

206
00:19:00,858 --> 00:19:01,685
Nonsense.

207
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,580
Nonsense.

208
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,960
I've seen it in a movie.

209
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,880
I've come up with a strategy.

210
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,580
For our next match,

211
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,580
we'll be competing with a stronger team,

212
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,580
like the AKU team.

213
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,730
Always remember

214
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,180
that teamwork is one of the most
important things in volleyball.

215
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,180
No matter what happens,

216
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,840
trust your teammates.

217
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,680
Okay, go practice.

218
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,980
I'll send you the NSU strategy today.

219
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,250
Don't forget our deal.

220
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,430
I want to be a starter.

221
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,740
I'm sick of being their substitute.

222
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,560
I can assure you
that the clip is crystal clear.

223
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,780
Yeah, I'll send it over.

224
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,900
I won't forget.

225
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,220
I know everything.

226
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,300
I know that you're a spy for AKU.

227
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,970
What spy? I didn't do anything.

228
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,970
Are you going to confess or not, Koh?

229
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,630
Confess what?

230
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,610
I didn't do what you accused me of.

231
00:21:09,512 --> 00:21:10,490
Zee.

232
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,490
Are you going to confess?

233
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,600
Tell me what you're going to do.

234
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,020
Can this clip be use as evidence?

235
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,300
I'll send you the NSU strategy today.

236
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,310
So, Koh?

237
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,090
Don't forget our deal.

238
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,420
Tell me.

239
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,140
It wasn't me.

240
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,620
You're hurting me.

241
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,900
Confess.

242
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,180
It wasn't me.

243
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:32,807
What's going on?

244
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,460
Tell us everything, Koh.

245
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,930
Tell us what you did.

246
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,050
I didn't do it.

247
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,770
Tell us.

248
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,020
I didn't do it.

249
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,140
You're not going to confess?

250
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,660
Tell us.

251
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,840
Fine.

252
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,010
It was me.

253
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,180
I'm the spy for AKU.

254
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,450
Damn it.

255
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,760
Damn it, Koh.

256
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,080
So it was you

257
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,840
all along, wasn't it?

258
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,760
Why did you do that?

259
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,620
Did they hire you?

260
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,790
What's your reason
for betraying the team?

261
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,020
Why did you play dirty?

262
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,440
Why don't you tell us

263
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,720
how you're going
to take responsibility for this?

264
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,080
I don't know.

265
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,100
This is a really big deal, Koh.

266
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,240
If Coach finds out about this,
your future is ruined.

267
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,580
My future?

268
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,330
And how would it be different
than my future now?

269
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,720
I don't even get the chance

270
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,240
to actually play.

271
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,990
Because you weren't a starter,

272
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,920
you played dirty to make us lose?

273
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:00,790
Yes.

274
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,420
If I help them,

275
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,070
I'll become a starter at AKU.

276
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,580
Damn it, Koh.

277
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,960
Hey.

278
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,480
Hey.

279
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,750
Calm down, Mike.

280
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,290
You should calm down.

281
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,200
Starters like you guys

282
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,860
don't understand my fucking feelings.

283
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,180
But that isn't a reason
for you to betray your teammates.

284
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,820
We trusted you.

285
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,760
Because we thought you were a friend.

286
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm sorry.

287
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,710
Quit.

288
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,900
If you quit the team now,

289
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,180
I'll accept
that you've paid for your action.

290
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,290
Is quitting

291
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,300
enough to do that, Salmon?

292
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,970
I think Coach should know about this.

293
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,830
But if you quit now,

294
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,590
you'll still have a chance
to play volleyball.

295
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,140
Because volleyball

296
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,140
is something you really love, isn't it?

297
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,760
But you made a mistake.

298
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,010
Isn't that right, Koh?

299
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,980
Think about what you did.

300
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,540
What you did to the team...

301
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,930
Was it the right thing to do?

302
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,980
I'm sorry.

303
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,640
Following a dream

304
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,930
requires effort.

305
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,360
But the effort must be put
in the right place.

306
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,520
Don't do this again, Koh.

307
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,090
Because you might not
get another chance.

308
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,430
Do you think I did the right thing?

309
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,420
About Koh?

310
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,290
I don't know.

311
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,280
Why did you want to give him a chance?

312
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,750
I just think

313
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,540
that if it were you,
you would've wanted the same chance.

314
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,340
Chance?

315
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,220
I didn't do anything wrong.

316
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,390
We are hiding something from the team

317
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,940
even though it doesn't affect
the team negatively.

318
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,880
It's different.

319
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,170
How?

320
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,940
I don't understand

321
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,090
why you're always so nice to others.

322
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,830
Isn't that a good thing?

323
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:09,830
No.

324
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,690
I want you to only be nice to me.

325
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,640
Can I ask you something?

326
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:28,920
Yeah?

327
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,650
Are you happy when you're with me?

328
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,370
Of course.

329
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,020
Why do you ask that?

330
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,300
We've known each other for a long time.

331
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,760
I don't want to be your friend anymore.

332
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,160
What do you mean?

333
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,210
All this time,

334
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,210
you've always taken care of me.

335
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:00,920
From now on,

336
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,750
let me take care of you.

337
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,300
I like you.

338
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,230
Be my girlfriend.

339
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,750
Okay.

340
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,020
What are you doing?

341
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,440
First.

342
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,520
Is there something
you want to tell me, Zee?

343
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,450
I saw you and Salmon hugging.

344
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,730
Why can't we do that?

345
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,730
Salmon and I are dating.

346
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,130
Dating?

347
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,680
What are you talking about?

348
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,740
What about me?

349
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,590
How does my dating life

350
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,020
involve you?

351
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,680
It doesn't?

352
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,260
So what have we been doing?

353
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,580
Move.

354
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,090
What am I to you, Zee?

355
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,950
You told me that you liked me.

356
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,470
Let go.

357
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,450
Whether it's now or whenever,

358
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,130
I never liked you.

359
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,840
Please stay away from me.

360
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,380
You're annoying.

361
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,650
Salmon and I have been friends
since we were kids.

362
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,250
I'm telling you the truth.

363
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,250
Don't you believe me?

364
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,220
Whether it's now or whenever,

365
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,850
I never liked you.

366
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:55,322
You didn't seem to care about me before.

367
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,400
But now you're good to me.

368
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,180
You're messing with my head
like I'm an idiot.

369
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,330
What do you want from me, Zee?

370
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:08,420
Hey, Mike.

371
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,560
Hey.

372
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,880
Is Koh crazy?

373
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,220
He just quit.

374
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,090
The match is coming up.

375
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,020
What is he thinking?

376
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,400
Is he running away from his creditors?

377
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,530
His creditors?

378
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,240
How did you come up with that?

379
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,640
Tom.

380
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,740
But I don't think

381
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,760
that's possible.

382
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,140
He doesn't seem
to have financial issues.

383
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,140
Maybe...

384
00:32:43,652 --> 00:32:45,522
He has a problem.

385
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:51,910
I think he's just bored.

386
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,290
Tom.

387
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,940
Bored? He's desperate
to join the national team.

388
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,680
Did anyone manage to contact him? Deaw?

389
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,180
I couldn't reach him.

390
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,530
I've tried calling several times.

391
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,130
His phone is turned off.

392
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,760
Just let him go. Come on.

393
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
Hurry up, so we can practice.

394
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,640
Okay.

395
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,150
Hurry up.

396
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:32,380
Hey.

397
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,920
Pass it when you're done.

398
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Okay. I'm working on it.

399
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,420
How are you, First?

400
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,060
I watched you practicing today.

401
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,750
You seemed distracted.

402
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,100
I'm sorry.

403
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:03,664
I've been thinking
about something lately.

404
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:08,920
Well...

405
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,010
Dad.

406
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,450
Did Zee talk to you about anything?

407
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,420
Why are you asking about him?

408
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,100
Don't you notice

409
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,070
that he seems strange lately?

410
00:34:29,256 --> 00:34:31,116
He hasn't been back at the dorm
for many days, Dad.

411
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,642
I've noticed

412
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,220
that he's been working harder

413
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,840
and playing better.

414
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,550
His performance is back to where it was.

415
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,300
But I think...

416
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,900
Are you guys fighting?

417
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,470
If you do, make sure
to clear the air before the match.

418
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,470
Don't let it affect the team.

419
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,940
Got it?

420
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,420
Okay.

421
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:03,180
Your uncle told me that Tonkla is back.

422
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:05,341
Don't forget to call him.

423
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,570
Center.

424
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,330
Block here.

425
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,500
What is it, Tonkla?

426
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,910
Are you free today, First?

427
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,540
Do you want to hang out?

428
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,790
I haven't seen you in a long time.

429
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,280
I've missed you.

430
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,440
Yeah.

431
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,440
Sure.

432
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,940
Where do you want to meet?

433
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,460
Well... Why don't we meet
at my faculty?

434
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:00,600
Okay.

435
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,660
Yeah! See you then.

436
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,420
See you.

437
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,420
First.

438
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,210
Come on.

439
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:50,680
Hey.

440
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,130
You have a guy waiting for you.

441
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,430
I'm pretty jealous.

442
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,970
Wow.

443
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,970
See you later. Bye.

444
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,730
Yeah, see you.

445
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,400
See you.

446
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,560
Look at them.

447
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,340
We haven't hung out in a long time.

448
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:27,520
When I came back,
you were the first person I thought of.

449
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,020
I'm so happy

450
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,020
you agreed to come.

451
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,500
I'm sorry I didn't reply to your texts.

452
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,040
I've been busy.

453
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,640
Hey.

454
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,640
You don't have to apologize.

455
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:43,940
I get it.

456
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,520
I know volleyball requires
a lot of your effort.

457
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,570
I just want you to know that I like you.

458
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,660
That's all I want.

459
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,510
Do you really like me?

460
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,610
Yes.

461
00:38:04,232 --> 00:38:06,560
I'm curious. Why do you like me?

462
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,890
Do we need a reason to like someone?

463
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,760
I just know that when you play sports,

464
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,760
you look so charming.

465
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,290
When you play in a match,

466
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,310
I can't stop looking at you.

467
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,970
If I didn't change schools then,

468
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,970
we wouldn't have broken up.

469
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,080
I'm glad

470
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,080
that you like me.

471
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,030
But...

472
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,400
I...

473
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,740
Hey.

474
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,480
It's okay.

475
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,220
Here.

476
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,220
Try this, First.

477
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,250
It's good.

478
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:21,670
Okay.

479
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,430
What should I do?

480
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,650
I haven't explained to First.

481
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,100
If I confess that I'm not Zee,

482
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,100
will he be even angrier?

483
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,610
Of course.

484
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,610
I would be.

485
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,880
The two of you are always

486
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,370
up to no good.

487
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,340
I don't need you
to rub salt in my wound.

488
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:00,310
What?

489
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,140
He deserves to be mad at you

490
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,430
because you messed with his head.

491
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,320
What should I do?

492
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,440
I've told you.

493
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,160
If he's still angry,
just keep making it up to him.

494
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,520
That's the only way.

495
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,840
How unfortunate.

496
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,840
I didn't do anything at all.

497
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,610
As Sprite, you didn't do anything wrong.

498
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,960
But don't forget that you're Zee to him.

499
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,370
I'm scared.

500
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,860
Sprite.

501
00:40:39,068 --> 00:40:40,578
If you really like him,

502
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,180
you should talk to him.

503
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,270
Be sincere and tell him everything.

504
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,260
I'm scared that he'll hate me.

505
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,720
I have no idea. Now that Zee is back,

506
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,410
how is he treating his teammates?

507
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,670
About that...

508
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,440
I'll help you.

509
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,640
How are you going to do that?

510
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,590
I'll ask Sam to find out.

511
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,620
You seem close to him.

512
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,530
What's going on between you two?

513
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,110
Haven't you heard?

514
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,100
I won't tell you.

515
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:39,890
I have to go.

516
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,890
I'm meeting Sam.

517
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,480
First.

518
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,740
Let's take a photo.

519
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,140
I'll upload it on my Instagram.

520
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,830
Sure.

521
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,220
What filter do you want?

522
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:56,570
This one.

523
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,130
This?

524
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:01,150
One, two, three.

525
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,150
Okay.

526
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,360
That's cute.

527
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,450
Yeah.

528
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:27,880
(Who are you with, First?)

529
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,380
First.

530
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,210
First.

531
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,790
What's the matter?

532
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:55,460
Nothing.

533
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,460
Can you help me pick out a present?

534
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,810
My mother's birthday is coming up.

535
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,290
Sure.

536
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,400
Shall we go then?

537
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,040
Let's go.

538
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,060
Have you found something you like?

539
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,940
I have not, First.

540
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,760
I'll check out some other pieces there.

541
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,450
Okay.

542
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,770
We need to talk.

543
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,110
What is it?

544
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,240
Why didn't you reply to my texts?

545
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,240
Why should I?

546
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,560
Why are you doing this, First?

547
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,310
Do what?

548
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,970
How am I supposed to feel
seeing you hang out with someone else?

549
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,420
I don't care how you feel.

550
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,770
I have the right to date anyone I want.

551
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,670
I have something important to tell you.

552
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,420
But I don't think it matters anymore.

553
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:49,610
What's so important?

554
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,320
Have you forgotten what you said to me?

555
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,040
You said you never liked me.

556
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,620
So what the hell are you doing now?

557
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,720
Why do you always mess with my head?

558
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,200
Is this entertaining?

559
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,080
First.

560
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,180
That wasn't me.

561
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,240
I'll order some drinks.

562
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,460
A cold latte for you, Sprite.

563
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,460
A cold chocolate for you, Zee.

564
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:12,460
So?

565
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,390
What do you want to talk to me about?

566
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:16,540
I'll start practicing in three days.

567
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,420
Are you sure you can handle it?

568
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,420
Why?

569
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,040
Don't you want me to return?

570
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,290
No.

571
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,380
While you were pretending to be me,

572
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,380
what did you do?

573
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,380
Tell me everything.

574
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,150
I like First.

575
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,090
Can I be you three times a week?

576
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,620
Come on.

577
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,340
Why is this so difficult?

578
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:17,610
This is exhausting.

579
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,000
Sprite.

580
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,390
I will agree to switch places
with you one more time, Sprite.

581
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,260
Because I need to find evidence
that Tong and Boy beat me up.

582
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,420
First.

583
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:12,810
Are you free on Saturday?

584
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,120
Let's hang out.

585
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,840
Let me practice with you.

586
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,490
Leave me alone.

587
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,900
First.

588
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,490
Why are you mad at me?

589
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,490
Can't you just tell me?

590
00:48:58,170 --> 00:48:59,490
You said those words to me.

591
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,450
How dare you ask me that question?

592
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:14,633
I'm so full.

593
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:17,660
I can't eat anything else.

594
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,240
We haven't been out in a long time.

595
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,780
We're here now.

596
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,020
I'm glad you get
to play volleyball again.

597
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,250
But I still can't catch the bad guys.

598
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,760
I don't know when this mess will end.

599
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,040
What evidence have you found?

600
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,300
I heard the two of them
talking in the bathroom

601
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,610
about the surveillance cameras.

602
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,720
If I get the footage from those cameras,

603
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,300
I'll probably find out who they hired.

604
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:02,180
I need the evidence to bind them,

605
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,610
so they can't get away with it.

606
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:06,600
If I don't, they'll never confess.

607
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,600
But...

608
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,240
All the cameras there were broken.

609
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,120
Surveillance cameras?

610
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,890
We came here that day.

611
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,760
What if those two walked by this place?
