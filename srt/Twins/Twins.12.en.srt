1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,720
Where's the evidence you mentioned?

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,540
I got footage from the
restaurant's surveillance cameras.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,900
Did you have a conflict
with anyone, Sprite?

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,830
No.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,060
They were probably hired by those two.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,060
They're cowards.

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,320
I want you to help me.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,250
I want to know who those three are.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,250
Okay.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,370
They probably go to my university.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,600
I'll keep you updated.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,740
Zee.

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,450
I need to ask you something.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,050
Did you talk to First?

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,220
He's suddenly ignoring me.

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,320
He saw me and Salmon together.

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,280
He nagged me.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,310
I got annoyed.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,310
So I told him Salmon and I were dating.

20
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,160
Zee.

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,150
I told you not to tell anyone.

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,150
Are you guys actually dating?

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,330
Yeah.

24
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,170
I don't have a crush on First.

25
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,370
You've got to fix

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,950
whatever mess you caused.

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,290
I have to go.

28
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,300
First, please.

29
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,450
Listen to me.

30
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,210
What else do you have to say?

31
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,840
Give me a chance to explain.

32
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,640
Say whatever you want to say.

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,410
I've been hiding something from you.

34
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,100
The one who said mean things

35
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,100
and hurt your feelings

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,130
wasn't me.

37
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,160
Actually,

38
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,230
I have a twin.

39
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,090
What the hell are you talking about?

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,730
I'm Sprite.

41
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,300
I'm Zee's twin.

42
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,920
What the hell are you two up to?

43
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:48,780
Huh?

44
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,930
Zee was ambushed and injured.

45
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,930
He had to spend months in the hospital.

46
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,060
I pretended to be him,

47
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,060
so he could still be
on the volleyball team.

48
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,640
So you lied to everyone
at the association?

49
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,640
It was necessary, First.

50
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,040
After he recovered,

51
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,700
he came back to play volleyball.

52
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,850
But I was the one

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,730
who asked to switch places with him.

54
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,700
Because I wanted to be close to you.

55
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,770
You two switched places

56
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,060
and messed with my head.

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,770
You think I'm so stupid?

58
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,310
That's not what I think.

59
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,670
But that's what you've been doing.

60
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,700
Wait.

61
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,000
You're Sprite.

62
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,600
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,370
This is my fault.

64
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,370
I have no excuses.

65
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,370
Give me a chance, First.

66
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,490
Let me fix things.

67
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,370
Let me know you better.

68
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,560
I want to be with you.

69
00:05:04,823 --> 00:05:06,150
You can do whatever you want.

70
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,820
It has nothing to do with me.

71
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,700
(Twins)
(Episode 12)

72
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,500
What the hell is this?

73
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,060
This is messed up.

74
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,130
Which Zee is calling me?

75
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,290
I won't let you mess with my head again.

76
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,990
You two switched places
and messed with my head.

77
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,990
You think I'm so stupid?

78
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,250
It was necessary, First.

79
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,250
After he recovered,

80
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,250
he came back to play volleyball.

81
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,470
But I was the one

82
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,760
who asked to switch places with him.

83
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,120
Because I wanted to be close to you.

84
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,000
Get ready.

85
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:34,770
Get your guard up.

86
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,340
Ready?

87
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,420
Yes, move.

88
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,060
Good, get your fists up.

89
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,060
Movement.

90
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,100
Good.

91
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,250
Move forward.

92
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,250
Hold it, Sprite. Hold it.

93
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,340
Hurry up. One, two, go.

94
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,170
Use your knee. Go ahead.

95
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,160
Escape.

96
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,940
Escape.

97
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,030
Can you?

98
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:03,227
Good.

99
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,300
Get ready.

100
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,100
Escape. Get ready.

101
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:10,034
Go!

102
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,050
Flip him.

103
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,690
Okay, pull.

104
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,690
Escape. Get up.

105
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,030
Okay, control.

106
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,410
Submission.

107
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,810
Submission.

108
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,100
Good.

109
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,720
That's enough.

110
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,160
Enough.

111
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,500
Nice.

112
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,290
Awesome.

113
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,560
Zee.

114
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,720
This is the real Zee.

115
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,720
Zee.

116
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,720
Always do that. Awesome.

117
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,050
Do this well on the real day.

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,010
Okay.

119
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,160
Of course I miss you.

120
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,490
I only have one girlfriend.

121
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,580
I'll take you out
for a great meal today.

122
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,760
Dress up and wait there.

123
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,380
Dress up and make yourself look pretty.

124
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,120
Okay?

125
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,200
Babe, please hold.

126
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,780
What the hell?

127
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,060
Don't you remember me?

128
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,060
The guy you ambushed a few months ago.

129
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,130
What the hell are you talking about?

130
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,250
I don't get it.

131
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:51,928
The surveillance cameras' footage
show all your faces clearly.

132
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,379
How dare you still act innocent?

133
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,410
Make a choice.

134
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,387
Are you going to come with us
or should we hand it over to the police?

135
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,930
I forgot to ask, but she's cute.

136
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,355
She's cute and has many followers.

137
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,730
I told you she's the real deal.

138
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,540
Hey.

139
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,480
Hey, what the hell?

140
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Let go. What are you doing?

141
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,780
I know about the horrible things
you've done.

142
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,660
If you don't want the police
to get involved, follow me.

143
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,420
Get up.

144
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,230
Come here.

145
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,640
Damn it.

146
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,640
Ouch, my back.

147
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,290
Hey.

148
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,680
You guys.

149
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,880
Shit.

150
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,340
Calm down. You're scaring me.

151
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,800
Calm down? You want me to calm down?

152
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,800
My life is ruined because of you.

153
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:06,950
Damn it.

154
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,810
Try walking in my shoes.

155
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,820
Damn it.

156
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,650
I have the evidence that you beat me up.

157
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,200
Are you going to confess or
should I report it the police?

158
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,930
Huh?

159
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,390
Tell me.

160
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,510
You want the evidence, right?

161
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:33,700
Zee.

162
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,760
What the hell?

163
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,750
This is the evidence you need.

164
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,970
He confessed

165
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,480
that you guys hired him to beat me up.

166
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,080
That's not true.

167
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,935
You're accusing me.

168
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,070
You're trying to hurt us.

169
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,720
Yeah.

170
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,490
We have no idea.

171
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,140
Don't make false accusations.

172
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,380
I don't even know who he is.

173
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,280
Fuck you.

174
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,090
Let's find out who's lying.

175
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,080
I have all the evidence.

176
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,280
I'm giving you only two options.

177
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,530
You can confess

178
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,210
or you can defend yourself
against the police.

179
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,290
Fine.

180
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,330
We hired him.

181
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,650
Tell us what you want us to do.

182
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,180
You guys must quit the jiujitsu club.

183
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,780
Leave me and my brother alone.

184
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,420
Or we'll report the police.

185
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,150
So?

186
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,000
Do your best today.

187
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,280
Today is the last match.

188
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,110
Do your best.

189
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,980
Do what we've been practicing.

190
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,900
I guarantee that we'll win.

191
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,100
Let's warm up.

192
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,260
Yes, Coach.

193
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,640
I get to play today.

194
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,650
Zee.

195
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,220
Start warming up.

196
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,680
Do your best.

197
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,300
Win this match for the team.

198
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,520
I'm so ready today.

199
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,790
Where did he go? He's not picking up.

200
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,140
Tan.

201
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,930
It's almost time.

202
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,180
Why is Sprite not here yet?

203
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,810
Call him again.

204
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,010
Yes, Coach.

205
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,030
Where the hell is he?

206
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,760
I'm going to die of a heart attack
because of you one day.

207
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,080
Why are you here?

208
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,130
Don't you have a match today?

209
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,460
I'm here to ask for your support.

210
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,090
You know that I have a match today.

211
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,010
You have feelings for me too, don't you?

212
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:30,810
Wait.

213
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,790
You're being ridiculous.

214
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
Wait for me, First.

215
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,103
If I win,

216
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,822
I'll bring you the gold medal.

217
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,833
I'll ask you to be my boyfriend.

218
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,300
I have to go.

219
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,300
Good luck to you too.

220
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,250
Where the hell are you, Sprite?

221
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,480
Sam.

222
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,940
Are you okay?

223
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,760
Why do you look so worried?

224
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,410
I don't know either, Salmon.

225
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,530
I suddenly feel anxious.

226
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,560
I think you might be worried
about the match.

227
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,640
It's okay.

228
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,060
Just do the best you can.

229
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:26,101
(Men's Volleyball Championship Match)

230
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,380
All right. Welcome to
the volleyball match

231
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,530
between universities.

232
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,190
This is the final match

233
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,140
between NSU and AKU.

234
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,220
Today's match is considered
a big match.

235
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,080
Stay tuned and find out the winner.

236
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,040
The winner will get this trophy.

237
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,830
Do your best today.

238
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,450
Good luck, Zee.

239
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,080
Number 2 is serving.

240
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,820
Oh, no. That was bad.

241
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,120
NSU is still unable to control the ball.

242
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,410
Next is AKU's turn

243
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,250
to serve the ball to NSU.

244
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,040
He could take it.

245
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,670
He sent the ball over.

246
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,420
To number two.

247
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,020
Number nine.

248
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,120
Wow.

249
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,610
Keep going.

250
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,940
Calm down. Move back.

251
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,930
The serve came through.

252
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,320
He took it.

253
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,920
Number two hit the ball.

254
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,120
The ball was sent over.

255
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,440
Block him.

256
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,250
We won.

257
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,870
Amazing.

258
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,640
Great job.

259
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,350
Who sent you the ball?

260
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,070
You did.

261
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,240
Wow.

262
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,860
You did so well today, First.

263
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,690
I'm so proud of you.

264
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,130
Okay.

265
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,780
You're awesome, First.

266
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,008
Coach, please come to the center.

267
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,810
Surround him, guys.

268
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,760
Come on.

269
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,780
Let's go.

270
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,440
NSU, we did it. Yes!

271
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,600
(Jiujistu Championship Match)
Let's go. Come on.

272
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,810
Sprite, just a little swing.
Do the same thing.

273
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,430
Be careful.

274
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,210
Good job.

275
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,260
Good, awesome.

276
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,490
Go.

277
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,140
Good job.

278
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,070
Tan.

279
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,880
I'm sorry

280
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,040
that you got hurt and couldn't compete.

281
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,220
It's fine.

282
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,220
I don't blame you.

283
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,520
It was an accident.

284
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,200
Fortunately, I was fast
and it wasn't a big injury.

285
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
This is pretty big.

286
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:32,640
Tan.

287
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,470
This victory

288
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,280
is for you.

289
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,660
Why are you giving it to me? It's okay.

290
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,760
You should keep it, man.

291
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,340
It will make me feel better.

292
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,690
Thank you so much, Tan.

293
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,870
You're talented.
Why are you thanking me?

294
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,770
It's an exchange.

295
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,580
You helped me with Sam.

296
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,990
You even got injured.

297
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,960
Sam has been taking care of me.

298
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,510
He's doing a great job.

299
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,510
You no longer need me.

300
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,160
Yeah.

301
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,610
I haven't been needing you for a while.

302
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,980
I am aware.

303
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,310
Thank you.

304
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,910
I didn't think
you would celebrate with us.

305
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,010
Come on. Both my sons won.
How can I not join?

306
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,540
It's a shame
our matches were on the same day.

307
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,080
So Mom didn't get to see me play.

308
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,660
But I went to the match.

309
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,010
I'm sick of you.

310
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,010
Hey, don't say that.

311
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,930
How about this, dear?

312
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,860
If your matches are on
the same day again,

313
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:26,690
I'll go see Sprite
and Dad will go see Zee.

314
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,720
What do you think?

315
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,380
Great idea, Mom.

316
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:31,946
Zee.

317
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,180
Don't be too hard on yourself.

318
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,560
You might injure yourself.

319
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,030
Okay, Dad.

320
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,140
Sprite.

321
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,930
How's your jiujitsu practice?

322
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,060
It's fun.

323
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,250
I like it.

324
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,540
I have fun at practice.

325
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,930
I get to play and compete.

326
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,340
You definitely take after me.

327
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,720
Let's eat.

328
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,450
I bought all these delicious dishes.

329
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:10,830
Zee.

330
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,570
Put some food on his plate.

331
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,060
Enjoy your meal.

332
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,260
Enjoy your meal, Mom.

333
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,040
Thank you.

334
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,490
We haven't solved
a jigsaw puzzle in awhile.

335
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:54,700
Yeah.

336
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,600
Ever since you destroyed mine.

337
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,600
I didn't mean it.

338
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,420
You weren't careful.

339
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,440
I was so young back then.

340
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,180
I was too.

341
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,620
But I was careful.

342
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:18,690
Zee.

343
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,160
If I ever made you mad
unintentionally in the past,

344
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,720
I'm sorry.

345
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,720
I didn't mean to haze you

346
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,400
or make you upset.

347
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:31,840
Yeah.

348
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,200
Never mind.

349
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,460
I was young then.

350
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,000
I got mad and angry
like a child would be.

351
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,130
After thinking about it,

352
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,520
it wasn't a big deal.

353
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,450
You can't say that.

354
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,680
You're my brother, Zee.

355
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,650
It doesn't matter if it's big or small.

356
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,520
I should pay more attention to you.

357
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,170
Me too.

358
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,620
Do you want to solve any puzzle?

359
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,620
If you do, just buy one.

360
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,150
We're going to do it together, right?

361
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,290
Let's solve it together.

362
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,100
Medploy leaked the clip?

363
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,490
Does Namkhing know about this?

364
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,460
I knew that you would be up here alone.

365
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:25,960
Why are you here?

366
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,460
Do you remember
the necklace I bought you?

367
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,120
Will you be so kind and accept it?

368
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,280
You said you would give me your medal.

369
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,680
I gave the medal to Tan.

370
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,050
Even though I don't have a medal,

371
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,960
I do have a heart to offer.

372
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,210
What are you saying?

373
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,420
Nonsense.

374
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,930
Don't act so cold to me, First.

375
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,960
What about us?

376
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,160
What have you decided?

377
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:30,820
Just forget it.

378
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,480
It never happened.

379
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,480
It was over the moment you lied to me.

380
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:42,940
Come on, First.

381
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,040
How long are you going to sulk?

382
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,330
I've gone over and beyond for you.

383
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,470
Are you really not going to forgive me?

384
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,240
That had nothing to do with us.

385
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,260
You once told me

386
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,180
that you liked me for who I was.

387
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,640
I don't know a person called Sprite.

388
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,470
I thought I had a crush on Zee.

389
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,370
Now you tell me you're not Zee.

390
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,270
How do you think I feel?

391
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,790
I'm sorry, First.

392
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,940
Give me a chance to make it up to you.

393
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,140
If you still like me,

394
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,390
be my boyfriend.

395
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:40,150
Get to know the person called Sprite
one more time.

396
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,470
Please, First.

397
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,680
Please.

398
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,080
Okay.

399
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,310
Fine.

400
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,420
Hey.

401
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,070
Okay.

402
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,140
All right.

403
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,570
You won't be confused anymore.

404
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,510
Okay.

405
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:49,810
All right.

406
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,940
They haven't announced
the university representatives.

407
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,620
Even if I don't make it,
I still have many more years to go.

408
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,410
Don't worry.

409
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,090
Get a lot of rest.

410
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,820
It's late.

411
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:00,760
Okay.

412
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,760
Good night, Mom.

413
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:09,660
I think

414
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,000
your mother will understand.

415
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:14,980
Yeah.

416
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,250
I just hope

417
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,250
that the association will notice me.

418
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:22,890
Yeah.

419
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,460
And...

420
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,800
Did you apply for the loan?

421
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:28,800
I did.

422
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,650
I applied the same time as you.

423
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,507
Okay.

424
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,160
And...

425
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,900
How is your mother now?

426
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,790
She's... okay.

427
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,050
She's getting supportive treatment.

428
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:55,960
If you need my help with anything,

429
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,260
please let me know.

430
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:00,820
Okay.

431
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,270
Thank you.

432
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,170
I miss Koh.

433
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,280
Yeah, you're right.

434
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,660
Ever since he left the team,

435
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,930
I haven't been able to reach him.

436
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,470
I heard he has dropped his classes.

437
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,300
Yeah.

438
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,680
Tan.

439
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,140
Yeah?

440
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,880
I made you some food.

441
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,850
I don't want to eat.

442
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,090
What do you want to eat?

443
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,300
Do you want something from Auntie Tim?

444
00:37:33,445 --> 00:37:34,660
I want to eat you.

445
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,610
Tan.

446
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:43,020
Can I look at your wound?

447
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,850
Does it still hurt?

448
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,930
Yeah, a little.

449
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,610
You seem to care a lot about me.

450
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,550
Tan.

451
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,560
You didn't get to compete, but it's okay.

452
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,350
I have a consolation prize for you.

453
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,490
Yeah?

454
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,700
Come closer.

455
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,330
Can you do that again?

456
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,610
You want a small prize or a big prize?

457
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,650
A big prize.

458
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,640
First told me everything.

459
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,720
I can't believe you leaked that photo.

460
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:15,740
Yes.

461
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,720
So what?

462
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,030
You knew everything from the start.

463
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:27,160
But you manipulated me
into getting information from people.

464
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,290
Yes.

465
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,900
I had fun and enjoyed
seeing you so desperate.

466
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,760
Enjoyed, Medploy?

467
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,290
Do you see me as a clown?

468
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,290
Aren't we friends?

469
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,160
Come on, Namkhing.

470
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:55,391
You really think people
want to be friends with you?

471
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,510
Since you're getting smarter,

472
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,220
let me tell you something.

473
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,565
Actually,

474
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,960
May and I never wanted
to be friends with you.

475
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:17,550
But you are smarter
and get better grades.

476
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,270
You have a better life.

477
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,970
You're prettier.

478
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,850
Most importantly,

479
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,410
you were dumb enough
to let us trick you.

480
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,820
So being friends with you

481
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,874
for benefits isn't strange, right?

482
00:40:40,842 --> 00:40:44,250
I think there's nothing left
for us to talk about.

483
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,400
I'll get going then.

484
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:49,447
May, let's go.

485
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:59,000
Pay for this meal.
You're rich, aren't you?

486
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,560
Oops... I forgot.

487
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,600
Since we won,

488
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,810
the U Volleyball Champions Cup

489
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:15,580
earlier,

490
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,310
three of you did a great job

491
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,310
and caught the eye of the association.

492
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,640
So they've been chosen
to try out for the national team.

493
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,420
The people who will be
trying out for the national team...

494
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,860
The first person is

495
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:32,820
Jack.

496
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,070
The second person is

497
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:44,990
Zee.

498
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,420
The last person is

499
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:01,910
First.

500
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,730
I'm so proud of you.

501
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,710
I've seen your improvement

502
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,320
from all the matches you've competed in.

503
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,890
Thank you so much for your hard work

504
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,100
that paid off.

505
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,730
Even though

506
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,730
we have not made it
to the national team,

507
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,140
the previous match

508
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,140
was a great experience

509
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,140
that will make us stronger

510
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,680
and better.

511
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,000
I want all of you

512
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,640
to remember

513
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,680
the friendship between your teammates

514
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,160
who have gone through
ups and downs with you

515
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,300
during these two months.

516
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,820
I want all of you

517
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:00,700
to keep fighting

518
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,400
and improving.

519
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,490
Don't give up on volleyball just yet.

520
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,670
All right.

521
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,560
This is only the first stage.

522
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,290
Please don't give up.

523
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,040
I want to thank all of you

524
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,540
for working so hard.

525
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,970
I want you

526
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,980
to keep practicing hard

527
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,530
to reach your dream

528
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,950
of trying out for the national team.

529
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,680
NSU, fighting!

530
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:35,000
Fighting!

531
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,410
I was looking for you.

532
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,570
But you were out here
shooting a music video.

533
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,900
I was just thinking about some stuff.

534
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,020
Why? Are you worried about me, Captain?

535
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:18,700
Asshole.

536
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,560
I'm just a little down.

537
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:28,362
You know I've devoted
my whole life to volleyball.

538
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,500
But I failed miserably.

539
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:37,820
You didn't fail.

540
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,300
There's always a chance.

541
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,120
You might not make it this time,

542
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,440
but you will next time.

543
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,850
But I'm happy

544
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,060
that you made it to the national team.

545
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,700
You'll get to join
a big club in the future.

546
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:55,430
So you won't have to work so hard
to make money like you do now.

547
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,810
Are you really okay with it?

548
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,520
What did your mother say?

549
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,280
I don't know.

550
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,570
I haven't worked up
the courage to tell her.

551
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,110
Let's go drink.

552
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,140
I'll pay.

553
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,900
You're so stingy.
Are you really going to do that?

554
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,360
Come on.

555
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,050
Of course.

556
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,620
Do you want to go or not?

557
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,980
Can I eat something else instead?

558
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,380
You're dirty.

559
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,300
I'm only dirty to you.

560
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,810
If you do make it to the national team,

561
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,090
we won't get to be together like this.

562
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,500
I will be so lonely.

563
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,300
Can I ask you something?

564
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,820
What was

565
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,540
our relationship to you?

566
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,780
I don't know.

567
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,320
I think...

568
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,520
I'm happy with what we have now.

569
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,890
What about you?

570
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:24,680
Yeah.

571
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,590
What we have now

572
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,110
is not bad at all.

573
00:46:34,244 --> 00:46:35,820
You are my best friend.

574
00:46:39,135 --> 00:46:41,170
I'm not ready to lose you,

575
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,860
But I...

576
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,450
I can't see us being more than friends.

577
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,840
I'm glad you're honest.

578
00:47:02,345 --> 00:47:04,805
So... Are we going to drink or what?

579
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,790
This is the only time I'll pay.

580
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,520
Of course. The captain is paying.

581
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,090
Let's go, my dear friend Mike.

582
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,740
I'll pay for the drinks.

583
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,990
Come on.

584
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,230
I'm so lucky you're paying.

585
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:30,960
Hurry up.

586
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,290
Why are we running?

587
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,020
So you'll be excited.

588
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:40,540
You've held my hand for too long.

589
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:51,820
I'm on a date with my boyfriend.
If I don't hold his hand,

590
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,210
what should I be holding?

591
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,750
You're being silly.

592
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:00,530
It hurts.

593
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,230
Are you hurt?

594
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,970
You always care a lot about me.

595
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:17,220
Then...

596
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,540
Can I kiss you right here?

597
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,210
No way.

598
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,340
First.

599
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,370
You're slow.

600
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,370
How am I slow?

601
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:07,860
I'm not.

602
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:15,640
Come on.

603
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,000
Popcorn?

604
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,490
It smells good, try it.

605
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,320
It smells so good.

606
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,870
What are you talking about?

607
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,190
Your hand.

608
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,730
It's so bouncy.

609
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,900
What?

610
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,340
Oh.

611
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,600
First, look.

612
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,100
The view is amazing.

613
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:15,400
It's romantic.

614
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:19,570
Do you like it?

615
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,230
I like being with you.

616
00:50:26,776 --> 00:50:28,030
Let's take a photo.

617
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,290
Okay.

618
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,730
Let's use your phone.

619
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,490
Okay.

620
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:46,180
Smile.

621
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,380
Let's take a look.

622
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,810
We look so cute.

623
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:01,420
Yeah, you're so cute.

624
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:05,160
I'm blushing.

625
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,130
Salmon.

626
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:18,600
Yeah?

627
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,550
Why did you put it on me?

628
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,220
Do you know

629
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,190
how important this necklace is to me?

630
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,950
I want you to take care of it.

631
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,870
Thank you.

632
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,530
I'll take the best care of it.

633
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:32,200
Get the ball.

634
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,040
Go.

635
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:55,680
Why did you

636
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,670
ask me to play volleyball with you?

637
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,680
I miss it.

638
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,000
I got attached to it.

639
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,280
From now on,

640
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,370
I wouldn't get to do this anymore.

641
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,340
But when we're together,

642
00:53:18,524 --> 00:53:19,804
I can be your volleyball.

643
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:23,910
How?

644
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,910
You want me to play you?

645
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,000
Then...

646
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,488
Can I play you all night?

647
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:44,520
Are you up for it?

648
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,850
Do you want to try?

649
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:15,700
First.

650
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,050
I...

651
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:25,950
I don't think I like you anymore.

652
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:30,980
Huh?

653
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:32,980
What do you mean?

654
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,820
I...

655
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,700
I think I love you.

656
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,110
Okay.

657
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,370
Okay.

658
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,550
If we get so busy with our practices,

659
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,980
don't fall out of love with me.

660
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:01,570
No.

661
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,480
Why?

662
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:05,090
No.

663
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:08,860
I can't do that to you.

664
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,740
Come on.

665
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:15,720
You too.

666
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:19,330
Don't fall out of love with me.

667
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:22,010
Okay.

668
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,320
I promise.

669
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,570
I promise too.
