1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,560
Sprite.

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,460
Do you realize what you did wrong?

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,000
I only went out for awhile.
I didn't plan to not go practice.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,820
If you don't practice,

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
how will you be a volleyball player?

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
I don't want to be a volleyball player.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,980
Sprite.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,740
You're young.
You don't know what you want.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,560
You're the big brother.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,680
You're supposed to be a role model
for your brother.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,680
Look at Zee.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,680
He's very focused on practicing.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,480
Calm down.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,480
He's still young.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,100
You're always taking his side.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,600
That's why he did that.

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,920
You are twins.

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,560
I raised you the same way.

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,520
Why are you two so different?

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,960
Every child

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,300
is different, Rin.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,940
But they're my children.

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,980
I have their best interests at heart.

24
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,580
Come on.

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,260
They're my children too.

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,640
Sprite.

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,940
Come with me.

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,240
Where?

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,020
Let's go practice jiujitsu.

30
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,020
Okay.

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,220
Zee.

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,060
Come here.

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,180
How was today's practice?

34
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,240
Good.

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,400
You're amazing.

36
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,100
Remember

37
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,080
that you're my only hope.

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,700
(Twins)
(Episode 4)

39
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,400
That's it for today.

40
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,920
See you tomorrow.

41
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,900
You can go home.

42
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,520
Yes, Coach.

43
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,460
Coach.

44
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,560
Where have you been?
Why haven't you been practicing?

45
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,180
I called your father.

46
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,660
He said you didn't come home.

47
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,480
Is something going on?

48
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,220
Well...

49
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,240
I...

50
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,180
Is it possible for me

51
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,280
to only practice in the evening?

52
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,960
Why?

53
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,120
During the afternoon...

54
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,400
I have things to do.

55
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,140
I'm unable to come for practice.

56
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,460
Is there anything
more important than practicing?

57
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,440
It is important, Coach.

58
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:18,712
I need to talk to your father about it.

59
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,620
But...

60
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,200
Actually,

61
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
I would like you to practice
with your friends.

62
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,440
So we'll be able to plan your strategy.

63
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:29,955
I don't see how practicing alone

64
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,980
without me is better.

65
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,080
Do you

66
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,900
want me to stay in the evening as well?

67
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,120
Yes, Coach.

68
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,680
Let's stick to the same schedule.

69
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,540
Stay focused, Sprite.

70
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,680
Yes, Coach.

71
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,880
You should practice
jiujitsu too, Sprite.

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,360
Coach always ask me about you.

73
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:15,800
Hey.

74
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,800
It's that guy.

75
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,680
I'll try.

76
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,100
Good for you.

77
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,020
Let me come with you.

78
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,500
Sure.

79
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,220
He has to try?

80
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,860
Try to do what?

81
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,600
May I borrow your bike?

82
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,620
This one is mine. Take it.

83
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,360
See you. Bye.

84
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,140
Bye.

85
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,100
He's gone.

86
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,080
Damn it.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,980
I don't think I need your help anymore.

88
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,740
Sprite.

89
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,980
Yeah.

90
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,220
Where is he riding to?

91
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,220
Damn it.

92
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,600
Where did he go?

93
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,300
Why were you following me?

94
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,740
No.

95
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,020
I wasn't following you.

96
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,720
Don't lie to me.

97
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,280
I saw that you've been
following me for awhile now, Sam.

98
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,120
Huh?

99
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

100
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,720
Why did you make me
ride all the way here?

101
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,600
It's tiring.

102
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,640
Don't try to change the topic.

103
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,680
Tell me why you were following me.

104
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,140
I should be asking you.

105
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,240
You.

106
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,940
What are you forcing Zee to do?

107
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,900
Huh?

108
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,900
Are you a fan?

109
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,080
A fan?

110
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,420
What do you mean?

111
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,600
Well...

112
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,080
A fan who follows him around.

113
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
Tell me.

114
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,760
What are you forcing him to do?

115
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,440
Oh.

116
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
I'm not Zee's fan.

117
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,900
But I want to be your boyfriend.

118
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,640
Hey.

119
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,900
Or...

120
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,320
Were you following me because...

121
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,880
Don't come near me.

122
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,900
Are you embarrassed?

123
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,900
Embarrassed?

124
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,100
I'm not.

125
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,300
I see.

126
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,980
I'm so confused now.

127
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,240
You look cute being confused.

128
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,440
May I have your Line ID?

129
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,860
You're too cute.

130
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,500
Wait.

131
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,160
Don't go.

132
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:15,435
You haven't given me your Line ID.

133
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,840
I won't give it to you.

134
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,320
That's crazy.

135
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,320
Sam.

136
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,320
The next time I see you...

137
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,520
I won't let you go.

138
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,160
One.

139
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,000
Two.

140
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,020
Three.

141
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,280
Four.

142
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,280
Five.

143
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,980
Hands on your waist.

144
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,420
Get ready.

145
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,520
One.

146
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,600
Two.

147
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,180
Three.

148
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,040
Four.

149
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,400
Five.

150
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,200
Shake it off.

151
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,280
Phu.

152
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,700
Is Att still sick?

153
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,320
Yes, Coach.

154
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
He said he got the flu.

155
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,320
Okay.

156
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,120
Tan.

157
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,680
Yes?

158
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
Why is Sprite missing again?

159
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,260
I told him

160
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,260
that we would be practicing
like it was a competition today.

161
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,580
Well...

162
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,560
He went to the bathroom.

163
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,300
He has diarrhea.

164
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,740
I'll go get him right now.

165
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,320
Okay.

166
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,060
Let's continue.

167
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,060
Come on.

168
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,600
I'm sorry. The number can't be reached.

169
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,500
What the hell are you doing, Sprite?

170
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
You don't even have your phone with you.

171
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,640
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,020
Where is he? Shit.
Coach is looking for him.

173
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,660
Tan.

174
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,500
Sprite, damn you.

175
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,460
You didn't pick up my calls.

176
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,700
I was rushing here.

177
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,860
Hurry. Coach is asking for you.

178
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,060
Sprite is here, Coach.

179
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,780
What are you wearing?

180
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,540
Go get changed and come practice.

181
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,200
Thank you, Coach.

182
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,820
Let's take a five-minute break.

183
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,940
Woo!

184
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,380
- Let's take a break.
- Yes!

185
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,980
Put the ball away.

186
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,000
First of all.

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,520
Put the ball away.

188
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,680
I'm here.

189
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,360
Where have you been?

190
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,220
Yeah.

191
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,660
He's right.

192
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,560
You...

193
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,910
What are you wearing?

194
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,540
Well...

195
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,280
I...

196
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,880
I went to...

197
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,160
Where?

198
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,980
Don't be nosy.

199
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,200
Are you looking for trouble?

200
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,800
Who killed him?

201
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,620
Koh.

202
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,400
- Koh.
- Deaw.

203
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,740
Jack.

204
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,420
I'm dead.

205
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,860
I think he's guilty.

206
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,640
Yeah.

207
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,240
What?

208
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,780
Tom.

209
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,940
That's suspicious.

210
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,740
Suspicious how?

211
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,660
Trust me, Koh is the villain.

212
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,900
You're the villain.

213
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
You're the most talkative.

214
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,160
You, Deaw.

215
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,780
Deaw.

216
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,160
Open it. It's a wolf.

217
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,180
Open it.

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,180
It's the fortune teller.

219
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,180
Shit, Koh.

220
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,360
Which card did you get?

221
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
I trusted you.

222
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,340
Haha.

223
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,480
That's vicious.

224
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,540
You didn't believe me.

225
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,540
This card suits you, Deaw.

226
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,500
The fortune teller.

227
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,280
This is the truth about a human's heart.

228
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,940
It's hard to be certain.

229
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,760
Okay.

230
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
You're difficult to understand.

231
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:41,225
Shuffle.

232
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,480
Let's play again.

233
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,340
Let's go. Shuffle the cards.

234
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,880
What are guys doing?

235
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,280
We're playing a game, Zee.

236
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,800
Shuffle.

237
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,440
Let me play with you. It looks fun.

238
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,440
No, I'm leaving.

239
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,440
But I still want to play.

240
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,080
It's getting late.

241
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,080
Come on.

242
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,520
Fine.

243
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,220
Come on.

244
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,380
I know.

245
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,260
I'm sleepy.

246
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,380
Sam.

247
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,380
If you're late, I'll lock the door, Sam.

248
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,660
Tom.

249
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,320
Get me a bottle of water too.

250
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,160
I have to go to bed, Zee.

251
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,760
Good night.

252
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,740
Well...

253
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,440
I need to go pray before bed.

254
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,200
I'll get going then.

255
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,140
What about me?

256
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,860
Hey.

257
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,860
What's the matter with them?

258
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,620
Why do they hate me that much?

259
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,540
Huh?

260
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,460
It's not me.

261
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,460
They hate Zee.

262
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,240
Damn it.

263
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,860
Shit.

264
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,080
They left the cards here.

265
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,080
I'll play on my own.

266
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,080
What are the rules?

267
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,080
This one is my favorite.

268
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,740
The wolf.

269
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,500
What is Zee trying to do?

270
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,340
He seems like he wants
to be friends with us.

271
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,720
I don't trust him.

272
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,720
You should learn

273
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,720
to let go of the past, Koh.

274
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,400
Don't overthink it.

275
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,500
How can I let go?

276
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,120
Don't you remember what he did?

277
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,620
He never cared about anyone in the past.

278
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,620
But now

279
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,620
he's much better.

280
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,620
Being friends

281
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,620
is good for the team.

282
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,060
He's being nice.

283
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,460
That's why I don't trust him.

284
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,400
What is he trying to do?

285
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,760
People

286
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,120
can always be good.

287
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,880
Good people

288
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
can make mistakes,

289
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,880
but they realize

290
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,160
that they've made mistakes

291
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,160
and stop making them.

292
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,160
Can you stop it?

293
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,680
I know the monk taught you well.

294
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,900
Do you want to live in the temple?

295
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,060
Meditating and praying

296
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,420
will make you calmer.

297
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,380
Go get ordained.

298
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,780
For how long?

299
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,200
Two.

300
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,500
I'll get you ordained
during the new year.

301
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,700
Eat some more.

302
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,340
I'm full.

303
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,040
Do you want some water?

304
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,860
You probably don't like hospital food.

305
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,560
Is there anything you want to eat?
I'll get it for you.

306
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,560
It's okay.

307
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,620
Do you want to watch TV?

308
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,380
No.

309
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,820
Everyone's trying to help you.

310
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,140
Auntie

311
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,600
and Sprite.

312
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,600
Don't be mad at them.

313
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,900
Are you sure

314
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,900
that they're doing it for me, Salmon?

315
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,420
Why do you say that?

316
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,780
I didn't ask Sprite to help me

317
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,780
or pretend to be me.

318
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,920
Having him as my twin

319
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,520
really sucks.

320
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,120
Zee.

321
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,480
Hello.

322
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,540
Hello.

323
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,140
How is he?

324
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,620
He is so much better.

325
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,480
He's still young.

326
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,620
He is able to recover quickly.

327
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,620
There's nothing to worry about now.

328
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,620
We just need to monitor him
a little longer.

329
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,400
If he's fine, he can go home.

330
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,720
Well...

331
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,040
Will he be able
to practice volleyball then?

332
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,820
He needs to recover first.

333
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,100
He must avoid working out.

334
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,420
If he gets physical therapy often,

335
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,000
he'll recover faster.

336
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,260
Please excuse me.

337
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,280
Thank you.

338
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,040
Do you really want to quit?

339
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,960
Don't quit.

340
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,980
Practicing with you

341
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,160
is damn fun.

342
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,420
If I wanted to quit,

343
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,060
would you believe me?

344
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,060
No.

345
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,060
I'll never believe that.

346
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,000
Hello, Coach.

347
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,480
Sprite.

348
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
You can't miss
anymore practice sessions.

349
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,940
The competition is getting closer.

350
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,140
Yes, Coach.

351
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,320
I have something important to tell you.

352
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,780
From tomorrow onwards,

353
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,780
we will be practicing somewhere else.

354
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,780
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

355
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,780
Okay, let's continue.

356
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,060
Come on.

357
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,380
Get up.

358
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,860
Are you okay?

359
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,860
You don't look well.

360
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,280
I don't think I'm okay.

361
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,660
You did this to yourself.

362
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,800
I have to be okay.

363
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,900
Why are you crying, Mom?

364
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,600
I'm not.

365
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,600
Are you hungry?

366
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,520
Is there anything you want to eat?

367
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,980
No, Mom.

368
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,840
I don't want to just lie here.

369
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,200
You'll be fine soon.

370
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,800
Fine?

371
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,940
No one knows how many
physical therapy sessions it'll take.

372
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,660
I want to compete.

373
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,900
I don't want to be a burden to anyone.

374
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,560
Come on, be patient.

375
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,440
Sprite is helping us at the moment.

376
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,060
Help?

377
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,340
Did you even ask me

378
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,060
if I wanted his help or not?

379
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,720
This tryout

380
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
is your dream, isn't it?

381
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,900
Is it my dream

382
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,420
or your dream?

383
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,800
Everything I do is for you.

384
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,220
I was doing everything

385
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,020
you wanted.

386
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,160
You should leave.

387
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,500
I want to be alone.

388
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,640
Are you awake?

389
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Wake up.

390
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,900
Mike, wake up.

391
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,760
Go shower.

392
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,720
Mike.

393
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,720
Go shower.

394
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,520
Wake your friends up.

395
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,620
What are you doing?

396
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,740
Go shower.

397
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,160
Go shower.

398
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,980
Get ready in five minutes.

399
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,000
Wake up.

400
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,000
Wake up.

401
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,500
Just one more minute.

402
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,520
Get up.

403
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,280
No.

404
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,280
Wake up.

405
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,520
Hurry up.

406
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,640
Zee.

407
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,600
Wake up.

408
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,820
Zee, wake up.

409
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,100
Zee.

410
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,540
No.

411
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,540
I know.

412
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,880
I'm waking up.

413
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,480
Wake up.

414
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,160
Okay.

415
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,860
That's my bed.

416
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,180
Get out of my bed now.

417
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,900
Okay.

418
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,200
Wake up.

419
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,320
Zee.

420
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,320
If you won't get up, I'll leave.

421
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,440
Hurry up

422
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,920
or Coach will punish you.

423
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,020
Okay.

424
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,960
Zee.

425
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,560
Why are you late?

426
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,380
Zee, why are you always late?

427
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Did you call me?

428
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,260
Yes, why are you late?

429
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,320
I'm sorry, Coach.

430
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,440
When I become less strict,
you guys are less disciplined.

431
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,460
Only a few of you were on time.

432
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,640
Most of you were late.

433
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,860
You didn't rush your friends.

434
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,280
You know

435
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,280
that volleyball is a team sport.

436
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
If you keep doing this,

437
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,260
do you think we'll be able
to compete with other teams?

438
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,140
You have a match this week.

439
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,140
We shouldn't go, right?

440
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,860
Tell me

441
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,520
what I'm supposed to do.

442
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,900
Captain, what do you think?

443
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,480
I think...

444
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,600
Should we clean the gym as punishment?

445
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,360
But...

446
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,060
Coach.

447
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,240
I was the last to come.

448
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,240
I'll take the responsibility.

449
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,520
Don't punish one person, Coach.

450
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,720
If you want to punish us,

451
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,460
you should punish the whole team.

452
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,100
Hey.

453
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,700
It has nothing to do with us.

454
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,040
Sacrifice will lead to peace.

455
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,820
I don't care about your peace.

456
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,100
That's enough.

457
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,620
Stop arguing.

458
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,420
Make a decision, Captain.

459
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,060
Who should get punished?

460
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,180
First and I
will take responsibility, Jack.

461
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,800
Why me?

462
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,820
Well...

463
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,320
I woke up late.

464
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,780
You woke me up late.

465
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,660
Is it my responsibility?

466
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,580
All right, Jack? Let's do that.

467
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,900
Then you two must clean
the gym every day

468
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
for two weeks.

469
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,340
Is that okay, Coach?

470
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,060
All right.

471
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,520
Let's practice.

472
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,920
Come on.

473
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,580
Damn it.

474
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,820
Hello, Auntie.

475
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,460
Hello, Salmon.

476
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,060
Are you here to see... Zee?

477
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,960
Yes, dear.

478
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,980
I just dropped by to see how he's doing.

479
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,520
Zee?

480
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,240
He...

481
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,240
He's fine.

482
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,300
Okay.

483
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,140
But I'm worried, Auntie.

484
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,120
What happened?

485
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Well...

486
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,740
The tryout is getting closer.

487
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,780
But...

488
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,680
His performance...

489
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,360
You can see for yourself.

490
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,880
Then the tryout...

491
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,240
Come help me, Salmon.

492
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,180
Please excuse me.

493
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,220
Goodbye.

494
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,920
What?

495
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,420
Look at Zee. He isn't focused.

496
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,260
What are you talking about?
He's doing great.

497
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,940
Zee.

498
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,760
Mrs. Rin.

499
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,940
Hello, Coach.

500
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,980
Are you here to see Zee?

501
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,880
Yes.

502
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,800
I dropped by to check on Zee
and see how he's doing.

503
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,800
How are you?

504
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,180
I'm good.

505
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,180
How are you?

506
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,620
I'm good.

507
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,680
Coach.

508
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,560
If you don't mind,

509
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,760
I would like to ask you

510
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:35,180
to be a bit more strict on Zee.

511
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,820
I heard that
the tryout is getting closer.

512
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,860
- Right?
- Yes.

513
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,320
Please be strict on him.

514
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,260
Sure.

515
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,940
I'm making the team work harder.

516
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,300
But I will

517
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,640
be extra strict on Zee.

518
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,100
Thank you.

519
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,620
Hey, I'm sorry.

520
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,260
What the hell?

521
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,960
They are very close.

522
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,060
Pass me the water, Jack.

523
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,560
Why are you staring at me?

524
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,880
What?

525
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,980
I wasn't staring.

526
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,980
What are you talking about?
You were staring at me.

527
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,900
Damn it.

528
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,900
That was a loud burp.

529
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,380
Have some manners.

530
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,120
Do you need any antacid?

531
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,300
People outside the gym
must have heard you.

532
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
I'm so sorry.

533
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,320
It wasn't intentional.

534
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,740
What's there to drink?

535
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,740
Here you go.

536
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,160
Give me one.

537
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,500
For me?

538
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,120
It's mine.

539
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,180
Thanks, man.

540
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,180
Think of it as my compensation

541
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,540
for getting punished for you.

542
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,780
He's not arranging bottles anymore?

543
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,780
He probably got lazy.

544
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,720
Is he ever lazy?

545
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,240
Not minding other people's business

546
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,140
is a way to let go.

547
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,340
But we are humans.

548
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,240
Even I can't do it.

549
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,500
Zee.

550
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,400
Yeah.

551
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,520
Sam.

552
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,900
Yes?

553
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,520
Can you do me a favor?

554
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,400
What favor?

555
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,980
Do you know Namkhing?

556
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,340
She's a fan of mine.

557
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,340
Is she First's sister?

558
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,100
Well...

559
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,420
I want to talk to her.

560
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,900
What's going on, Zee?

561
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,620
It's nothing.

562
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,080
She took a photo of me.

563
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,360
I want the photo.

564
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,520
We're friends on Facebook.

565
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,240
Aren't you her Facebook friend?

566
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,780
No.

567
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,240
Do you want me to call her?

568
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,540
Do it.

569
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,500
Hello, Sam.

570
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,420
Hello, Namkhing.

571
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,580
Zee wants to talk to you.

572
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,220
Hello.

573
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,000
Ahh!

574
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
She must be excited.

575
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,620
Namkhing, it's me Zee.

576
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,040
I want to see you.

577
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,500
Do you want to see me?

578
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,500
Where? When?

579
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,360
I'm always available for you.

580
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,420
Okay.

581
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,180
Thank you, Namkhing.

582
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,840
That's all.

583
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,000
Thanks, Sam.

584
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,180
Why do you think Zee wants to see me?

585
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,900
I don't know.

586
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
He contacted you.

587
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,900
That means he likes you.

588
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,900
Do you think

589
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,900
he's going to confess his love to me?

590
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,220
Namkhing.

591
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,460
Can you stop daydreaming? Wake up.

592
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,680
Zee is mine.

593
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,000
He's mine.

594
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,180
He's mine.

595
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,440
No, he's mine.

596
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,560
He's mine.

597
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,560
Stop arguing.

598
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,540
Zee.

599
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,140
Namkhing, act cool.

600
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,520
How long have you waited?

601
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,880
Let me pay for this meal.

602
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,740
I'm so happy

603
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,760
that you are meeting up with us.

604
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,500
Why do you want to see me?

605
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
Well...

606
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
I wanted to...

607
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,980
If this is a secret,

608
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,620
I'll leave.

609
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,280
So you can talk to her freely.

610
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,040
It's actually not a secret.

611
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,200
I just want to know

612
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,200
how we met.

613
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,200
I...

614
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,420
I want to know how we met.

615
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,280
Did we meet

616
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,980
because of First?

617
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,200
I like you.

618
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,460
I've liked you ever since I saw you
at the gym with First and Dad.

619
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,220
Dad?

620
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,940
What do you mean?

621
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,320
How could you forget it?

622
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,260
Coach Wit is our father.

623
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,920
Father?

624
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,820
(Next Episode) The match tomorrow
is extremely important to us.

625
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,820
NSU, let's do this!

626
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,460
Hey!

627
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,360
Based on your performance now,
you shouldn't even be a starter.

628
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,260
I made up my mind.

629
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,020
If you want him to be me,

630
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,560
then I'll be him.
