1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,020
I forgot something.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,020
I'll go get it.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,260
See you at the car.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,500
Go in.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,520
You're not so foul-mouthed now, huh?

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,620
Not going to answer?

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,120
Are you being arrogant?

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,560
Did you get a concussion
from the car crash?

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,980
Move.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:24,980
I won't.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,080
You think no one knows
what you're secretly doing?

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,180
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,440
You and Sprite

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,220
are the same person.

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,840
You think I can't tell?

16
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,400
You think we're stupid?

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,800
Losers.

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,560
Fuck you.

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,600
You're so foul-mouthed.

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,200
Don't blame us for kicking your ass.

21
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,880
Take that.

22
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,880
Your twin hurt us.

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,400
Shit.

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,380
How are you?

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,800
If you do this again, I'll tell Coach.

26
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,360
You should know

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,720
that you're in trouble
because of your twin.

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,980
Loser.

29
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,080
Are you all right?

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,020
Why didn't you tell me

31
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,020
that Sprite didn't get along with them?

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,360
Hello, Salmon.

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,220
I think I know

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,960
who beat me up then.

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,500
Really, Zee?

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,200
Who hurt you?

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,180
How did you find out?

38
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,180
Sprite had a conflict
with some seniors from the club.

39
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,820
Someone from the club?

40
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,820
Are you sure?

41
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,440
I just got beaten up by them.

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,280
Really?

43
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,420
Are you all right?

44
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,600
I'm fine.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,720
But I think they know
that I'm not Sprite.

46
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,500
This is bad news.

47
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,960
What should we do?

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,460
They found out.

49
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,040
I'm going to file a police report.

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,580
You can't do that.

51
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,740
You can't file a police report.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why, Salmon?

53
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,460
If you do,
there will be an investigation.

54
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,320
Everyone will find out about the switch.

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,800
It will affect your tryout.

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,540
And you expect me to let them go?

57
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,720
I think you should wait
until the match is over.

58
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,820
I think we should tell Sprite first.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,120
Calm down, Zee.

60
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,360
Let's think this through

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,420
and try to figure something out.

62
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,040
Please.

63
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,300
Sprite.

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Just order.

65
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,780
This meal is on me.

66
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,660
Why?

67
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,705
You don't have to.

68
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,520
Why?

69
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,520
You agreed to come on this date.

70
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,520
It's fine.

71
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,520
Okay.

72
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,360
I'll order everything

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,620
since you're paying.

74
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,240
I don't think that's good.

75
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,120
What about this one?

76
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,560
No, too many vegetables.

77
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,460
I don't like vegetables.

78
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,700
No.

79
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,720
Yes.

80
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:40,607
(Zee found out who beat him up)

81
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:43,459
(Take care of this immediately)

82
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,220
First.

83
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,120
I need to make a call.

84
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,600
I'll be right back.

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,580
Excuse me.

86
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,240
I'll have the truffle cream sauce,

87
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,780
the truffle pizza,

88
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,540
and the pork steak
with black pepper sauce.

89
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:48,210
(They're hugging, don't tell us
nothing's going on #ZeeSalmon)

90
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:55,578
(Zee probably doesn't care,
he's still here after all the comments)

91
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,200
(Twins)
(Episode 9)

92
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,320
How did Zee find out about that?

93
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,840
They got into a fight.

94
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,420
Tong slipped and told him.

95
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,780
Did Zee say

96
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,440
what he's going to do now?

97
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,740
I didn't dare ask him.

98
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,000
He was in a really bad mood.

99
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,360
You should try and talk to him.

100
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,400
Okay.

101
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,400
I'll talk to him.

102
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,400
Thank you so much for letting me know.

103
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,660
Yeah.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,820
Why are you giving this to me?

105
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,980
I think it's pretty.

106
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,400
It suits you.

107
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,860
Do you buy this for everyone?

108
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,200
Why do you ask that?

109
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,900
Be honest with me.

110
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,900
Is there something I don't know about?

111
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,420
No.

112
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,580
What about you and Salmon?

113
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,580
Huh?

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,580
Can you tell me the truth?

115
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,260
What's going on between you and Salmon?

116
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,300
I've told you before
that I don't have feelings for her.

117
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,900
Why won't you address this rumor?

118
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:45,715
(Tonkla: What are you doing, First?
I miss you)

119
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,400
Who is that?

120
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,480
Who is that?

121
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,080
Do I have to tell you?

122
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,340
Come on, let's eat.

123
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,900
Please.

124
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,130
Don't be mad.

125
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,460
Just eat.

126
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,950
Hello, First.

127
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,340
What is it, Ms. Mischievous?

128
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,220
First.

129
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,610
Can I go meet you at your dorm?

130
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,890
Why do you want to see me?

131
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,450
I'm lonely.

132
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,600
Both you and Dad are never home.

133
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
You're coming because you miss me
or someone else?

134
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,620
Come on, you always know what I'm up to.

135
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,580
Fine, come then.

136
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,100
But don't cause any trouble.

137
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,760
Yes! Thank you.

138
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,790
I love you the most.

139
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,600
Come on, Medploy.

140
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,980
Zee is there.

141
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,500
Zee.

142
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,720
First.

143
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,700
Namkhing.

144
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,050
What?

145
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,600
We need to talk.

146
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,790
Sprite.

147
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,450
We need to talk.

148
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,480
Follow me.

149
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,260
I'll help you.

150
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,260
Come on.

151
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,240
That's enough.

152
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,460
Stop it.

153
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,490
What is it?

154
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,840
I want to ask you for a favor.

155
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,900
Can you talk to Zee for me?

156
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,160
I want to extend our switch.

157
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:08,730
Why?

158
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,880
What's your problem?

159
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,780
I...

160
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,090
I know why Zee got hurt.

161
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,090
Why didn't you tell me that you had
a conflict with people from the club?

162
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,850
You let Zee meet those people.

163
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,210
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,380
Don't apologize to me.

165
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,010
The person you should
apologize to is Zee.

166
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,930
Listen to me, Salmon.

167
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,180
I didn't mean to conceal the truth.

168
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,980
But I don't have any evidence.

169
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,220
Also,

170
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,220
I still need to find evidence.

171
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,460
I still have issues
to resolve with First.

172
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,810
Zee is calling me.

173
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,560
Hello, Zee.

174
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,680
Let's postpone
our meeting today, Salmon.

175
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,040
Okay, sure.

176
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,040
Where are you going today?

177
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,220
I'm not going anywhere.

178
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,490
I just feel tired.

179
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,320
Don't be mad at me.

180
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,410
We'll meet in a few days.

181
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,410
No.

182
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,000
We have a little problem.

183
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,510
I'm afraid

184
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,430
that if you come back now...

185
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,490
Well...

186
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,320
Zee.

187
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,080
Sprite.

188
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,450
Can I have a bit more time?

189
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,040
Please wait for me.

190
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,040
Wait for what?

191
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,310
Do I have to be beaten up again

192
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,970
for you to be happy?

193
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,180
No.

194
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,430
I...

195
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,070
I know everything.

196
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,272
You're the reason I got hurt.
Isn't that right?

197
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,960
How dare you ask me
to give you more time.

198
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,810
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,650
But...

200
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,920
I...

201
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,610
Well...

202
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,840
If you come back now,
we'll have a problem.

203
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,080
What problem now?

204
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,780
I like First.

205
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,600
I want to be near him.

206
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,370
Is that loud and clear?

207
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,270
Please, Zee.

208
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,200
Please.

209
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,670
How about this?

210
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,670
Can I be you three times a week?

211
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,680
Please.

212
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,760
Zee.

213
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,260
So that's why.

214
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,100
Why are you here to see me?

215
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,540
Do you know about Zee and that Salmon?

216
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,540
So what's going on? Are they dating?

217
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,380
How would I know?

218
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,670
Well...

219
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,260
You see him every day.
I thought you would know.

220
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,600
Do I have to know
every single thing about him?

221
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,970
You suck.

222
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:03,880
Huh?

223
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,850
What about you?

224
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,420
What about me?

225
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,470
I'm your little sister,

226
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,470
so tell me the truth.

227
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,720
Is something going on
between you and Zee?

228
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,050
What something?

229
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,840
You guys seem strangely close now.

230
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,910
There's nothing going on.

231
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,330
We're just teammates.

232
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,420
Are you sure?

233
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,440
Yeah.

234
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,170
Why are you so curious?

235
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,160
I like Zee,
so it's normal for me to be curious.

236
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,470
I'm jealous. People seem to like him.

237
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,370
Hey.

238
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,680
Ms. Mischievous.

239
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,300
Stop being nosy.

240
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,690
All right?

241
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,660
Hey.

242
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,560
Is this Zee's account?

243
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,050
Let me see.

244
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,870
I would like to explain
about the situation.

245
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,870
Salmon and I have been friends
since we were kids.

246
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,160
We are very close.

247
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,760
The angle of the photo
made it misleading.

248
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,760
You might have misunderstood.

249
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,850
We were not hugging.

250
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,720
Salmon was helping me with the necklace.

251
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,060
There is nothing more than that.

252
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,560
I hope you understand.

253
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,350
I want you to focus on my ability
and my volleyball matches.

254
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,000
I have one more favor to ask.

255
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,220
Please comment politely. Thank you.

256
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,570
Shit.

257
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,030
Odd.

258
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,510
So odd.

259
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,880
Look at this.

260
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:03,660
What's going on?

261
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,710
Someone said you are cool

262
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,910
for clarifying
your relationship with Salmon.

263
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,430
Really?

264
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,180
Can I see it?

265
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,020
Here.

266
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,270
First.

267
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,210
Hey.

268
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:40,940
Yes?

269
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,700
An important match

270
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,610
is coming up soon.

271
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,740
I would like all of you

272
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,870
to practice harder.

273
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:51,980
We cannot

274
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,890
lose this match.

275
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,220
You know that, right?

276
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,770
- Yes.
- Yes.

277
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,590
Let's practice.

278
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:00,930
Let's go.

279
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:06,680
Wait, Zee.

280
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,510
How are you?

281
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,780
You've been working hard lately.

282
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,100
Are you all right?

283
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,560
Yes, Coach.

284
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,000
This match is really important.

285
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,820
Do your best.

286
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,470
Don't forget
that the association is watching you.

287
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:26,900
Yes, Coach.

288
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,510
Go practice.

289
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:44,693
(I won't forget,
don't forget what you said)

290
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:48,224
(No problem, I'll talk to Coach)

291
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:50,651
(Just make his team unable to play)

292
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,672
(I'll send you the full clip later)

293
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,020
Hello, Mom.

294
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,300
I'm on a break.

295
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,770
I've been practicing hard.

296
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,770
I have to go back soon.

297
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,660
The real match is coming up.

298
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,080
Yes.

299
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,830
I always work hard.

300
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,440
Don't worry, Mom.

301
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,180
You know very well
that I'll do anything to make you proud.

302
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,810
I'm sure that I'll make it
to the national team.

303
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,870
Just wait and see.

304
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:57,610
Yes.

305
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,428
Here.

306
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:09,690
Try it.

307
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,180
There.

308
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,540
Look.

309
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,650
Good.

310
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,490
It's okay.

311
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,010
Come on, pass me the ball.

312
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,840
Hurry.

313
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,840
Come on.

314
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,050
Look.

315
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,570
Ouch.

316
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,660
Ouch.

317
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,870
Are you going to mess up your hand?

318
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,060
Hey.

319
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,200
Be careful. It hurts.

320
00:21:59,090 --> 00:21:59,710
See?

321
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,270
Your finger is dislocated.

322
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,530
Be gentle. It hurts.

323
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,810
Put some ice on it and stop practicing.

324
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,420
I get distracted when I do nothing.

325
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,880
You don't talk to me
when we're in the room.

326
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,500
I don't know what I must do to make you
not jealous about me and Salmon.

327
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,460
I'm not jealous.

328
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,130
Stop practicing. Go.

329
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,160
First.

330
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,970
Go.

331
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,190
Everyone left.

332
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,610
Be gentle.

333
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,480
Let me see.

334
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,400
Be gentle.

335
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,760
You're lucky it isn't swollen.

336
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,000
I put in too much force.

337
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,710
Will it be healed in time?

338
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,260
You must keep putting ice on it.

339
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,260
Put some ice on it.

340
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,970
I'll get the gel and spray for you.

341
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,010
We can do this in our room.

342
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,010
We have gel there.

343
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,650
What are you talking about?

344
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,160
I mean we can go back to our room
for the cold gel.

345
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:22,870
What are you thinking?

346
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,090
Or...

347
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,520
Ouch.

348
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:32,580
I'm sorry.

349
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,210
Did I hurt you?

350
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,810
You always care about me.

351
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,810
That's not true.

352
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,490
I like it
when you don't speak your mind.

353
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,160
The more you don't,

354
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,160
the cuter you are.

355
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,200
That's not the case.

356
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,100
Let me prove it.

357
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,580
Zee.

358
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,040
I'm sorry.

359
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,730
I didn't mean it.

360
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,540
Let's do it again.

361
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,540
Do it again?

362
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,540
It wasn't easy.

363
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,740
You always make it seem so easy.

364
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,740
Do you know what I hate the most?

365
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,520
I hate that you always do this.

366
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,450
Zee.

367
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,320
We can do this again.

368
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,350
Sprite.

369
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,860
I will agree to switch places
with you one more time, Sprite.

370
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,060
Because I need to find evidence
that Tong and Boy beat me up.

371
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,230
Me.

372
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,650
Go.

373
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,200
Good.

374
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:36,820
Good.

375
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,690
You're doing so well, Zee.

376
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:45,890
Yeah.

377
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,140
What did you eat this morning?

378
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,450
Yeah.

379
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,560
Hey.

380
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,350
Be this good on the real day,

381
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,490
mate.

382
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,600
I'm glad he can play well.

383
00:27:59,130 --> 00:27:59,780
Let's continue.

384
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,480
Come on.

385
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:18,900
First.

386
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,050
First.

387
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,380
What were you daydreaming of?

388
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,210
You'll get hurt.

389
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,450
Stay focused.

390
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,450
Come on.

391
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,300
Let's continue.

392
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:46,223
(Two days later)

393
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,680
Thank you.

394
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,720
How have you been lately?

395
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,970
Are you tired from practicing?

396
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,440
Well...

397
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,220
I'm exhausted.

398
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,740
Ever since we lost that match,

399
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,610
our training schedule
has been more hardcore.

400
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,910
If you're exhausted,

401
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,760
you must eat more.

402
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,350
This meal is on me.

403
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,200
Really?

404
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,690
Can I order more?

405
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,010
Sure, go ahead.

406
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,580
Here.

407
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,300
Thank you.

408
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,300
How have you been lately?

409
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,190
I haven't talked to Zee at all.

410
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,240
Zee?

411
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,140
Well...

412
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,640
He has been a little quiet.

413
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,060
He might be a little stressed out
about something.

414
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,060
Especially with First.

415
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,520
He's been acting weird around First.

416
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,520
Weird?

417
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,320
Weird how?

418
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,780
Well...

419
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,780
He doesn't talk much to First.

420
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,640
They might talk when you're not around.

421
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:04,920
Well...

422
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,570
You're an overthinker, aren't you?

423
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,560
I'm starting to get jealous.

424
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,040
Yeah.

425
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,880
I can't help it.

426
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,170
Eat up.

427
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,340
Here.

428
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:32,750
Thanks.

429
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,440
Is it good?

430
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,370
Very good.

431
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,570
It's good because I was feeding you.

432
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,310
Get the ball.

433
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,700
Here.

434
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:34,840
Take it.

435
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,530
Deaw.

436
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,770
Come practice with me.

437
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:57,680
Do you want to be my partner?

438
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:01,990
Tong.

439
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:02,680
Yeah?

440
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,940
Are you sure

441
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,940
that there will be
no evidence that leads to us?

442
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,490
They said they didn't
leave anything there.

443
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,040
The surveillance cameras
there don't work.

444
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,760
I'm just afraid
that if Sprite finds any evidence,

445
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,220
we'll all get in trouble.

446
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,120
Why are you so afraid?

447
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,500
What a pussy.

448
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,590
Damn it.

449
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,210
Who?

450
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,460
Hello.

451
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,080
Yes, Coach.

452
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,080
What?

453
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,180
Let's go practice.
What are you waiting for?

454
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,260
Zee.

455
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,400
Why aren't you coming back
to the dorm to sleep?

456
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:48,058
(Male volleyball match
2nd tryout)

457
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,050
Zee, your water.

458
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,620
Where did Zee go?

459
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:08,200
Huh?

460
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,200
He was here just now.

461
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,980
He walked out.

462
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,320
He probably went to the bathroom.

463
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,320
He'll be back.

464
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,080
Yeah, he'll be back.

465
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,010
But the match is starting soon.

466
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,640
Guys.

467
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,760
Let's have a chat by the court.

468
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,740
Hurry up. It's almost time.

469
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,930
Yes, Coach.

470
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:38,930
Sprite.

471
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:39,480
Yes?

472
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,650
Do your best.

473
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,020
You're the first to go.

474
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,930
Yes, Coach.

475
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,170
Sprite.

476
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,960
Are you okay? You seem stressed.

477
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,630
I'm fine.

478
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,630
I'm just stressed out about the match.

479
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,200
Are you afraid of losing?

480
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,840
No.

481
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,010
Go warm up.

482
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:07,680
I'll be right there.

483
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,700
Okay.

484
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,470
Hurry up.

485
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,380
It's been awhile. Where did Zee go?

486
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,380
He's been gone for awhile now.

487
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,120
Is he all right?

488
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,680
I think it's almost time.

489
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,170
Should we make a switch, Coach?

490
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:02,600
Salmon.

491
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:03,850
Call Zee.

492
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,560
He's not picking up.

493
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,240
The match is starting soon.

494
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,560
What should we do?

495
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,310
How about this?

496
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,340
Koh will replace Zee.

497
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,640
Awesome. This is your time
to shine, Koh.

498
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,530
I've been waiting for this moment.

499
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,540
This match's Outside Hitter
will be on a roll.

500
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,730
There Zee is.

501
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,520
I'm here.

502
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,490
How are you, Zee?

503
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:15,880
I'm better now.

504
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,180
You've been taking care of me,

505
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:22,830
so I've gotten much better.

506
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,630
Thank you, Salmon.

507
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:25,760
So...

508
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,070
What's going on between you and Salmon?

509
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:29,800
What does it have to do with you?

510
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,180
Do you really have feelings for me?

511
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,080
I want you to care
about the person in front of you now.

512
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,420
That's how I really feel.

513
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,410
Tan.

514
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,290
Sam.

515
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:45,910
Come here.

516
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:46,830
Sam.

517
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:47,760
Don't fight.

518
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:48,570
Ouch, it hurts.

519
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,210
Come here.

520
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,650
Thank you for always
being there for me.
