1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,160
I see that you've been practicing hard.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,400
I think

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,400
we will win next time.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,400
Of course.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,360
Zee must be happy about this.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,520
If the team wins, he must be.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:22,760
Right?

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,840
Yeah.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,340
I almost forgot.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,960
Zee asked me to give this to you.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,480
Here.

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,380
It's very important to Zee.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,640
He wears it all the time.

14
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:40,912
Let me help you.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,760
No.

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,860
Now.

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,860
Come on.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,580
Wow.

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,580
You look so much like Zee.

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,840
Yeah.

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,200
Where did Sprite go?

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,820
Sprite. Where are you?

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,200
Sprite.

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,540
I'm here.

25
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,160
When did you get here?

26
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,800
I'm looking for Zee.

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,520
Zee. Where are you?

28
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,560
You're back, Zee. I've missed you.

29
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,560
Sprite.

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,380
Zee.

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,120
You're back, Sprite.

32
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,400
I'm sick of you.

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,020
Stop it. I'm tired. Cut it out.

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,320
I really want to thank you.

35
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,460
After seeing you talk to your teammates,

36
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,920
I was so happy.

37
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,540
Ever since they started
talking to me nicely,

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,920
I've done better.

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,040
If Zee returns and sees
everyone collaborating,

40
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,040
it will be good for him.

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,240
Thank you.

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,160
Wear it and don't take it off.

43
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,480
I don't want to.

44
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,900
I told you to wear it.

45
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,860
Get going.

46
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,700
(Twins)
(Episode 7)

47
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,120
Come help me, Att.
How long is the belt? Measure it.

48
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,120
How many inches?

49
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,660
Is it new?

50
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Tan.

51
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,680
What happened to your back?
Why is it red?

52
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,680
A sign of love.

53
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,240
Are you dating someone?

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,800
Not yet.

55
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,080
But I will be dating soon.

56
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,700
Wow.

57
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,700
How shameless.

58
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,960
What's the matter with you guys?

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,560
Tan.

60
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,560
What happened to your back?

61
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,500
A sign of love.

62
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,620
You're being ridiculous.

63
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,180
Yeah.

64
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,140
Those guys are starting
to be nice to me.

65
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,300
You mean First and the others?

66
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,700
Yeah, he's my best friend.

67
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,440
You have new friends now.

68
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:40,952
You must have forgotten about me.

69
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,060
You're no longer important.

70
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,564
Let's compete in taking shots.

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,120
Sure.

72
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,300
But there's only three of us.

73
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,180
Zee.

74
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,980
Do you want to
compete taking shots?

75
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,740
Why did you ask him?

76
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,640
Sure.

77
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Fine.

78
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:20,841
But you can't drop the ball.

79
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,680
Anyone who drops it
has to run around the court.

80
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,680
I'm in.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,600
Come on.

82
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,400
Go.

83
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,360
There.

84
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,160
Hey.

85
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,000
Deaw.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,480
Shit.

87
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,400
Are you okay?

88
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,840
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

89
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,360
Get up slowly.

90
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,920
Let's dress your wound.

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,940
Get up slowly.

92
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
Does it hurt?

93
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,280
Shit.

94
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,300
It's okay.

95
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,180
Is this how
people normally dress a wound?

96
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,580
Something like that.

97
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,580
What were you guys doing?

98
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,360
We were just passing the ball around.

99
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,180
But I put in too much force.

100
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,380
Be more careful next time.

101
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,760
Okay.

102
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,200
Thank you, First and Zee.

103
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,360
My lips hurt a little.

104
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,160
I guess

105
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,620
my luck isn't too good nowadays.

106
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Do you really want
to be friends with us, Zee?

107
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,840
Of course.

108
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,960
Why?

109
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,960
We're fine with it,

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,620
but you're the problem.

111
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,100
Me?

112
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,620
I will improve myself.

113
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,400
Can you really do that?

114
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,700
Yeah.

115
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,840
But...

116
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,200
You brought Deaw here
to dress his wound.

117
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,640
Fine.

118
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,640
I accept you.

119
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,860
Yeah.

120
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,620
Me too.

121
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,940
Are you dating Salmon?

122
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,740
What? Dating who?

123
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,400
What?

124
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,400
Who took a picture of me and her?

125
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,880
So are you dating her?

126
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,340
No.

127
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,620
Salmon was just helping me
with the necklace.

128
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,640
We've been friends since we were kids.

129
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,260
That is the truth.

130
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,540
Don't you believe me?

131
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,700
It doesn't matter what I believe.

132
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,640
But what matters
is the people who see this.

133
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,000
What do they believe?

134
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,055
(She's using Zee to be popular)

135
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,970
(So what's going on?)

136
00:09:29,923 --> 00:09:32,134
(Get out, Salmon)

137
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:35,337
(Is her real name Salmon?
Her name is so fake, #ZeeFirst only)

138
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,200
Salmon and I are friends.

139
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,200
There's nothing more.

140
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,240
Friends don't put necklaces
on each other.

141
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,020
Why not?

142
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,240
What are you doing?

143
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,060
Here.

144
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,740
I'll put it on for you.

145
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,740
No.

146
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,540
What the hell are you doing?

147
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,540
You were curious.

148
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,540
So I'm proving it to you.

149
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,060
Idiot.

150
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,740
What's the matter with you?

151
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,040
Salmon is getting dragged.

152
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,340
Serves her right

153
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,340
for getting involved with Zee.

154
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,940
Should we report this?

155
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,780
We don't know who took the photo.

156
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,740
Is it violating her rights?

157
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,200
Why should we care
about the person who took it?

158
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,680
We should be thanking them

159
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,280
for capturing the perfect moment.

160
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,500
But...

161
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,660
This will affect Zee's reputation.

162
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,660
People might misunderstand him.

163
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,500
What do you mean?

164
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,940
No one's criticizing him.

165
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,380
Don't you want to know

166
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,320
why Salmon

167
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,960
was helping Zee with the necklace?

168
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
They're so close.

169
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,900
Do friends

170
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,240
actually do that?

171
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,180
I don't know.

172
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,380
She says that she's friends with him.

173
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,380
She's acting innocent.

174
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,080
I can tell from her eyes.

175
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,300
She deserves to get dragged.

176
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,640
Tell your father to fire her.

177
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,420
Fire her?

178
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,420
Yeah, that's right.

179
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,420
Trust me.

180
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,900
If she gets fired,

181
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,820
no one will come between you and Zee.

182
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,300
Well...

183
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
Except for...

184
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,300
The shipping online.

185
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,300
So what's going on?

186
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,620
Yeah.

187
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,760
People who are dragging Salmon

188
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,660
are fans of Zee and First.

189
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,900
Yeah.

190
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,380
Why don't you ask First?

191
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,380
Is it true?

192
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,800
How can it be true?

193
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,300
Zee and First hate each other.

194
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,480
Everyone knows that.

195
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,700
Anything can happen.

196
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,080
Who knows?

197
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,220
Zee might have a crush on First.

198
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,340
Think about it. Why would
he ask you about First?

199
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,340
Right?

200
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,120
Zee and First?

201
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,280
Yeah.

202
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,440
That's awesome.

203
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,120
We've been waiting for awhile now.

204
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,900
Where are Salmon and Coach Wit?
Are they coming?

205
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,480
Hey.

206
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,220
Is there really a tryout today?

207
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,400
Yeah.

208
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,120
Did Coach postpone the tryout?

209
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,460
But he would've told us.

210
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,460
Yeah.

211
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,100
I'm sorry I'm late.

212
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,660
Coach just told me

213
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,960
to take care of you today.

214
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,300
We'll start by picking teams of six
and then we'll compete.

215
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,740
If you score, you get a point.

216
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,240
A total of three sets.

217
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,360
I'll record the competition

218
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
and send it to Coach to evaluate
your individual performance.

219
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,660
Aren't we going to wait for Salmon?

220
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,560
She said there's no need to wait
and that we can start.

221
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,140
Where did they go?

222
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,820
Salmon and Coach Wit

223
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,820
have been called in
for a meeting at the association.

224
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,400
Come and pick your team.

225
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,860
Let's go.

226
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,120
Help me.

227
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,920
Hurry up.

228
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,720
First, why are we not on the same team?

229
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,360
Don't make it a big deal.

230
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,140
Does anyone want to switch with me?

231
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,580
Do you want to switch, Mike?

232
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,580
Yeah, switch with me.

233
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,920
Me. I do.

234
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,640
Okay.

235
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,400
Jack.

236
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,480
Jack.

237
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,820
It's okay.

238
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,080
Focus.

239
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,540
It's okay.

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,720
Try again next time.

241
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,980
Come on, guys.

242
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,920
Great.

243
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,160
Are you okay?

244
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,860
I'm fine.

245
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,480
Shit.

246
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,980
Is the amazing Zee back?

247
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,540
Try again.

248
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,860
Zee.

249
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,700
The last one was amazing.

250
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,700
I was so surprised.

251
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,820
You must have great moral support.

252
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,580
I do, so what?

253
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,140
Hey.

254
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,800
Deddeaw.

255
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,260
Let's get something to eat.

256
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,720
Things are getting too sweet here.

257
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,260
Mike.

258
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,260
Why did you ask to switch teams?

259
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,260
Nothing.

260
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,440
Do you care?

261
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,880
Why did you not want to be on my team?

262
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,000
Why?

263
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,840
Honestly,

264
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,000
how long are you going to be like this?

265
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,240
Ever since we lost,
you've been acting this way.

266
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,620
It makes me uncomfortable.

267
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,620
Why are you so mad at me?

268
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,620
Why did we lose?

269
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,840
We lost because you didn't trust me.

270
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,960
Listen to me.

271
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,580
I made that decision
because Zee was at a better position.

272
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,760
How could I have known
that he wouldn't be able to score?

273
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,760
He usually scores.

274
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,720
You seem to trust him

275
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,660
even though you know
that he has been doing poorly lately.

276
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,660
You still keep pushing him.

277
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,020
You know I make decisions for the team.

278
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,020
Even though I made a mistake,

279
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,820
you don't have to ignore me.

280
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,600
If you don't understand,

281
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,360
then you don't understand.

282
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,800
Hold on, Mike.

283
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,280
Stop acting like this.

284
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,280
It makes me uncomfortable.

285
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,940
I've sent the video to Coach Wit.

286
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,780
He has chosen his starters.

287
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,140
He has chosen

288
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,440
First,

289
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,620
Jack,

290
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,980
Deddeaw,

291
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,440
Mike,

292
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,040
Sam,

293
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,100
Tom,

294
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,520
and last but not least,

295
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,820
Zee.

296
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,220
I'm happy for you.

297
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,820
Look at them, Koh.

298
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,220
I'm happy for you.

299
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,820
Okay.

300
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,480
The Zee and First ship

301
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,500
is sailing again.

302
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,600
Koh.

303
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
You're not going to stop, huh?

304
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,420
Let's practice.

305
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,500
Good job.

306
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,200
Come on. Let's go.

307
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,940
You're pretty good.

308
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,300
I thought I wouldn't make the cut.

309
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,100
Yeah.

310
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,760
I worked hard.

311
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,760
Let's practice. Where are you going?

312
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:35,440
Here.

313
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,400
Fried chicken party.

314
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,100
What's the matter with you?

315
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,580
To celebrate being chosen.

316
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,900
Fried chicken at 11 p.m.?

317
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,180
We can eat whenever we want.

318
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,900
Come on. Let's eat.

319
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,460
Eat on your bed.

320
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,860
No.

321
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,860
I want to eat here.

322
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,860
Eat there.

323
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,340
I said I want to eat here.

324
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,480
I said no.

325
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,760
Here.

326
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,860
There.

327
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,760
Here.

328
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,880
You dropped it.

329
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,860
I told you so.

330
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,620
Go eat there.

331
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,640
Hey.

332
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,300
You're still going to eat here?

333
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,880
I will.

334
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,560
Eat up then.

335
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,300
Come on.

336
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,960
First.

337
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,260
What now?

338
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,880
Zee.

339
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
All done.

340
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,680
Good that I saw it.

341
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,500
Yeah.

342
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,620
Thanks.

343
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,880
Keep stretching.

344
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,560
Move.

345
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,180
Is something wrong?

346
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,080
You two

347
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,080
seem mad at each other.

348
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,260
Did you have a fight with Jack?

349
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,180
Don't butt in.

350
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,180
I'm not butting in.

351
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,840
I'm just worried.

352
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,260
Are you pissing me off?

353
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,040
I'm not.

354
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,200
But I can't help but butt in.

355
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,200
Sorry, I mean be worried.

356
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,160
You two are so close.

357
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,100
Now you're close to him.

358
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,020
Isn't that good?

359
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,860
Do you like Jack?

360
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,200
Like him? No.

361
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,200
You're being sarcastic.

362
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,600
You're protective of him.

363
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,220
Don't act like you know everything.

364
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,440
You wouldn't know.

365
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,640
I don't know.

366
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,640
I would be

367
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,040
if someone I like starts
getting close to someone else.

368
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,060
Hey.

369
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,820
What are you guys talking about?
Let's practice.

370
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,220
I will.

371
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,800
I have to go.

372
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,480
I'm coming.

373
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:14,920
Hey.

374
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,620
Do you want it?

375
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,480
First and Zee

376
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,160
seem so close.

377
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,320
Here.

378
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,440
Do you want it?

379
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,840
Take this.

380
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,160
They seem so cute together.

381
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,440
I'm happy for you.

382
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:45,404
(Tan Incoming Call)

383
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,280
Hello.

384
00:26:58,267 --> 00:26:59,527
You called at the right time, Tan.

385
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
I wanted to talk to you.

386
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,640
About what?

387
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,640
Are you going to tell me
that you like me?

388
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,640
Tan.

389
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,620
Don't joke around with me.

390
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,080
I'm serious.

391
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,120
Okay.

392
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,620
What is it, Sam?

393
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,780
Well...

394
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,740
I think Zee and First

395
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,240
are more than friends.

396
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,240
What do you mean?

397
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,520
I can't explain.

398
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,220
These two...

399
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,420
When they're together,

400
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,680
they have some kind of chemistry.

401
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,100
Are they really dating?

402
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,140
Then you must be heartbroken.

403
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,140
Don't tease me.

404
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,660
I'm stressed.

405
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,560
Are you free tomorrow?
Let's go eat some cakes.

406
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,040
Well...

407
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,820
Tomorrow?

408
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,500
Fine.

409
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,020
I'm going

410
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,020
not because I want to eat.

411
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,580
I just need to relax a little.

412
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,580
Okay, I haven't said anything.

413
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,520
I'll hang up now.

414
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,200
Bye.

415
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,580
See you tomorrow.

416
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,180
I didn't come here
to let you stare at me eating.

417
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:43,044
How can I not look at you?

418
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,060
You're enjoying the cake.

419
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,980
Are you less sad after eating it?

420
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,780
Sad?

421
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,820
I'm not sad.

422
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,440
Huh?

423
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,660
So you tricked me into buying you cake.

424
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,700
You're pretty sneaky.

425
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,540
You're a messy eater.

426
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,200
Thank you.

427
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,900
Hey.

428
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,640
I wanted to ask you

429
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,640
about Zee and First.

430
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,880
Did Zee ever tell you about First?

431
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,880
Like...

432
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,320
They're dating.

433
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,820
They're just flirting.

434
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,160
Or they're both into it.

435
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,620
I don't know either.

436
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,200
Tan.

437
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,360
Will I get any information from you?

438
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,040
I'm not sure about information,

439
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,160
but you'll definitely get love from me.

440
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,700
Sam.

441
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,380
Can I ask you a favor?

442
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,840
What?

443
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,820
Stop liking Zee

444
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,820
and like me instead.

445
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,140
Let me take care of you.

446
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,360
What are you looking at?

447
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,760
Old volleyball clips.

448
00:30:57,676 --> 00:30:59,136
Are you and First dating?

449
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,580
Do we look like people who are dating?

450
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,240
You guys are always together.

451
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,820
You also take care of him.

452
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,160
Fried chicken party.

453
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,580
I'm closest to him.

454
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,280
I see.

455
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,700
You guys are roommates.

456
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,040
Yeah. He also takes good care of me.

457
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,760
Wake up, Zee.

458
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,160
The ball will hit here.

459
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,860
Your arms must be straight.

460
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,040
Make them straight.

461
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,640
Try again.

462
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,020
Are you tired?

463
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,020
I'm good.

464
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,900
Really?

465
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,760
Yeah.

466
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,460
It wasn't tiring.

467
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,580
Your water, Zee.

468
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,820
Thanks.

469
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,000
Are you tired today?

470
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,000
A little.

471
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,020
But you did so well today, Zee.

472
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,080
Really?

473
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,740
Yeah.

474
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,760
Hey.

475
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,340
You were perfect today.

476
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,420
Are you sure?

477
00:32:59,420 --> 00:32:59,900
Yeah.

478
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,280
Swear on it.

479
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,500
What the hell?

480
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,520
That was probably
the best version of me.

481
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,260
I'm pretty sure.

482
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,400
Hey.

483
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,560
Were you lying?

484
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,020
You're not.

485
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,320
I did better.

486
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:25,820
Really?

487
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,880
Why don't you ask Sam?

488
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,520
Are you okay?

489
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,680
Hey.

490
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,540
Can I ask you a question?

491
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,600
Yeah.

492
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,100
You asked for a scholarship last term.

493
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,440
Is it still available?

494
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,920
Are you interested?

495
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,720
Yeah.

496
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,720
And...

497
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,120
Is there any program
that gives you an allowance?

498
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,780
Yeah.

499
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,980
I got a loan from the Student Loan Fund
for my expenses.

500
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,580
If you're interested,

501
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,280
I'll take you to meet the staff.

502
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,700
Thank you.

503
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,440
Oh, yes.

504
00:35:02,807 --> 00:35:03,547
Hello, Mom.

505
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,320
Hi, Mike.

506
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,640
Are you done practicing?

507
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,380
Yes, what is it?

508
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,440
Have you been working hard?

509
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,440
Don't let Coach down.

510
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,360
He chose you as one of the starters.

511
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,920
I always work hard, Mom.

512
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,520
Good, how are your teammates?

513
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,260
I think the last match was horrible.

514
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,880
It will be difficult
to make it to the national team.

515
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,600
I didn't want to lose, Mom.

516
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,500
But you know
that volleyball is a team sport.

517
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,740
Based on what I saw,
it wasn't your fault.

518
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,200
I already talked to Coach.

519
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,380
What did you say to him?

520
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,400
I think I know
who's the weakest on the team.

521
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,340
So I asked him to do another tryout.

522
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,920
What did you say?

523
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,680
I have to go.

524
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,400
Bye.

525
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,300
Did you have another argument
with your mother?

526
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,740
She is a former volleyball player.

527
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,520
She should know
that you win some, you lose some.

528
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,740
Even though we lost,

529
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,500
we have a chance
to make it up next time.

530
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,520
How would you know? Your family
doesn't expect anything from you.

531
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,220
Doesn't expect anything, huh?

532
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,320
You played so well, Koh.

533
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,720
You did too, Zee. Your shot was amazing.

534
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
I'm playing so well.

535
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,880
Okay, see you.

536
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,360
I'll get my towel.

537
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,460
Are you close to Koh?

538
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,060
Not really.

539
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,360
He talks to me.

540
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,500
Why?

541
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,680
Are you protective?

542
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,880
Protective?

543
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,480
You seem to be protective of me

544
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,920
because I've been close to someone else.

545
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,340
You're making things up.

546
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,340
I don't care who you're close to.

547
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,640
It has nothing to do with me.

548
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,200
But if I have a new best friend,

549
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,940
you'll be lonely.

550
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,180
It's none of my business.

551
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,760
Even though I'm close to the others,

552
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,840
they're your friends too.

553
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,560
But I feel like

554
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,440
I'm closer to you
and you're more special

555
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,480
than the others.

556
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,720
Even though I'm close to the others,

557
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,320
I feel like

558
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,440
I'm closer to you
and you're more special

559
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,360
than the others.

560
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,860
What are you doing?

561
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,200
Aren't you going to come in?

562
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,360
Oh.

563
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,840
Where are you going?

564
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,360
Aren't you going out?

565
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,000
I just finished cleaning the room.

566
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,660
I'm going to take the trash out.

567
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,900
I'll help you.

568
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,900
No, I'll do it.

569
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,900
You already cleaned the room.

570
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,140
I'll take the trash out.

571
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,140
No, I'll do it.

572
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,940
I'll do it.

573
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,660
Hey.

574
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,560
I'll do it.

575
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,380
No.

576
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,940
I said I'll do it.

577
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,720
No.

578
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,700
I'll do it.

579
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
I'll do it.

580
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,300
No.

581
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,820
Are you okay?

582
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,500
You seem strange.

583
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,040
I don't know

584
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,360
when I started to have this feeling.

585
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,220
I don't like it

586
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,220
when you mingle

587
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,140
or when you're close to someone else.

588
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,020
Does it mean

589
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,620
that I like you?

590
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,220
First.

591
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,360
I thought

592
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,860
you were nice to me

593
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,360
because you had feelings for me too.

594
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,300
Who said I don't?

595
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,640
(Next Episode)
I'm unhappy.

596
00:45:02,271 --> 00:45:03,491
The more I try to talk to you,

597
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,075
the more you ignore me.

598
00:45:05,693 --> 00:45:06,753
What should I do?

599
00:45:07,461 --> 00:45:08,281
Tell me.

600
00:45:09,294 --> 00:45:10,234
I'll do anything.

601
00:45:11,647 --> 00:45:12,407
Fine.

602
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:14,510
Let's start then.

603
00:45:21,836 --> 00:45:23,596
Your two best friends

604
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:24,447
are being strange.

605
00:45:25,027 --> 00:45:26,407
How?

606
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,432
You guys are closer to them.

607
00:45:28,661 --> 00:45:30,661
Don't you notice it?

608
00:45:32,556 --> 00:45:34,056
When Zee recovers,

609
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:35,947
you will no longer
have to pretend to be him.

610
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:43,848
Are you going to miss me when I'm gone?

611
00:45:51,397 --> 00:45:53,797
I want to be here with you forever.
