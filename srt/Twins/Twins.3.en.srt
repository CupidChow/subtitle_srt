1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,800
Ouch. Let go.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,400
Damn it, Tan. It hurts.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,740
What the hell are you up to?

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,740
Tell me.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,740
I'm practicing with you.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,240
What do you want me to do?

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,560
Hey.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,180
Hey, it hurts.

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,440
Don't change the topic.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,200
Where have you been?

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,040
You asked me to tell Coach you were sick

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,040
and now you want to practice at night.

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,040
What the hell are you up to, Sprite?

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,120
I'm not doing anything.

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,780
I don't believe you.

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,780
I've told you.
I don't care if you believe me or not.

17
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,600
Ouch.

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,020
What's the matter with you?

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,880
It really hurts.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,020
I'm leaving.

21
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,680
Fine, don't tell me the truth.

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,200
(Twins)
(Episode 3)

23
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,480
Shit, where did he go?

24
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,480
Ouch.

25
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,320
Don't make a sound.

26
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,240
What are you up to, Sprite?

27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,680
You're hurting me.

28
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,960
Sprite?

29
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,900
I'm not him.

30
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,440
So...

31
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,000
Are you Sprite's twin?

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,660
Of course, I'm Zee.

33
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,140
Okay, you're Zee.

34
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,340
But I followed Sprite here yesterday.

35
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,220
Where the hell did he go?

36
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,960
Why are you following me?

37
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,680
Because you haven't answered
my question.

38
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,860
How would I know?

39
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,180
He has legs. He can walk anywhere.

40
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,120
You're pissing me off.

41
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,900
Zee.

42
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,460
Who is this?

43
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,460
Is he your friend?

44
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,460
No, I don't know him.

45
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,440
He's cute.

46
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
What did you say?

47
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,920
Can I have your Line ID?

48
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:34,032
Sam.

49
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,200
Let's go practice.

50
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,400
My bike.

51
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,080
Don't you dare think
that I don't know it's you, Sprite.

52
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,420
Is he really not your friend?

53
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,860
I said I don't know him.

54
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,640
I'm very happy, Zee.

55
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,840
You let me walk by your side today.

56
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,160
This is the first time

57
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,380
since we've known each other

58
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,800
that you've come close to me.

59
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,480
Do you like me?

60
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,240
Hey.

61
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,960
I'm so sleepy.

62
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,820
I didn't get enough sleep last night.

63
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
It's your fault, Jack.

64
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,780
I turned on the lights to work.
Stop complaining.

65
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,780
Do you want to move somewhere else?

66
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,480
I don't think anyone wants to move now.

67
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,520
Right?

68
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,800
I don't want to.

69
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
But if we are content,

70
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,240
we will be happy.

71
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,580
So wise.

72
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,960
What's going on here?

73
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,460
What are you discussing?
Why aren't you practicing?

74
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,300
We got here at the same time.
It's nothing.

75
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,620
Nothing?

76
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,620
So why are you making an excuse?

77
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,620
Something's off.

78
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,380
Hey.

79
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,180
It's nothing. We're like brothers.

80
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,660
Brothers. I see.

81
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,000
Come on, let's practice, brothers.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,700
Brothers, right?

83
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,140
Be brave, man.

84
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,780
Let's go.

85
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,600
Yeah, let's go.

86
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,220
How was my new move today, Tan?

87
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,240
It's cool, but mine was cooler.

88
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,000
Wow.

89
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,580
Sprite.

90
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,980
Why are you here now?

91
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,980
You didn't come in the afternoon.

92
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,800
Coach was so pissed.

93
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,580
Hey.

94
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,080
I'll stay out of it.

95
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,080
I'm leaving.

96
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,940
I'm leaving now, Tan.

97
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,760
See you later, bye.

98
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,240
Okay.

99
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,880
Sprite.

100
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,460
Where have you been?

101
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,060
None of your business.

102
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,240
Yeah?

103
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,580
I know everything.

104
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,580
Know what?

105
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,780
Stop pretending to be your twin.

106
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,200
You're ridiculous.

107
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,200
Yeah?

108
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,640
If you don't tell me the truth,

109
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,380
I'll tell your father about it.

110
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,520
Damn it, Tan.

111
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,920
I can help you keep your secret.

112
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,080
But you have to let me hit on Sam.

113
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,020
But it's okay if you disagree.

114
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,920
I won't help you anymore.

115
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,060
Fine, I've switched places with Zee.

116
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,260
Your twin got hurt a little.

117
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
Why do you have to do this?

118
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,100
You know very well

119
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,100
what will happen
to an athlete who doesn't practice.

120
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,200
Coach might ask the substitute player
to play instead.

121
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,400
Also, I don't know
when he'll fully recover.

122
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,600
Are you that generous?

123
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,840
Was that a compliment or a criticism?

124
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,260
It's a compliment.

125
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,700
So you have to pretend to be him
until he recovers?

126
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,100
Of course.

127
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,320
Good.

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,240
So I can go watch
your volleyball practice sessions.

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,380
I want to look at Sam.

130
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,680
What do you like about him?

131
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,900
If you fall in love with someone,

132
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,900
you'll get it.

133
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,520
Hey. Wake up.

134
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,760
Go get changed and let's practice.

135
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,860
Hey.

136
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,240
You're daydreaming.

137
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,420
I'm so sleepy.

138
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,980
Where were you?

139
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,080
Answer me, Zee. Where were you?

140
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,320
Oh, no. I got caught.

141
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,460
Fine, I'll tell you.

142
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,260
I was out partying.

143
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,540
You went partying?

144
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,540
It was just a party.
Don't act all serious.

145
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,940
It's normal to want to have fun.

146
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,980
What's with the face?

147
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,140
Are you upset with me?

148
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,200
You're an athlete.

149
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,700
You shouldn't be one
if you aren't disciplined.

150
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,660
You said that.

151
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,160
But I already went.

152
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,160
I mean... You can tell Coach.

153
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,580
I will. You don't need to tell me.

154
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,700
Think about it carefully.

155
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,780
If you tell him,
who do you think he'll believe?

156
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,720
You told me
that I was his favorite, didn't you?

157
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I think...

158
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,280
We should be friends.

159
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,280
Damn it.

160
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,700
Get out. I hate you.

161
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,420
Up to you.

162
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,700
I don't care if you hate me.

163
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,100
Just don't fall for me, all right?

164
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,660
Be careful.

165
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,660
I will make you my friend.

166
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,700
This is so heavy.

167
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,460
This isn't even mine.

168
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,460
Sprite.

169
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,460
Damn you.

170
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,680
If I didn't need your help with Sam,

171
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,920
I wouldn't be carrying
your stuff home like this.

172
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,380
I haven't had much time
to take care of you, Mom.

173
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
I will practice hard.

174
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,100
So you'll be comfortable in the future.

175
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,080
Okay.

176
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,020
Take care of yourself, Mom.

177
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,740
Okay.

178
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,440
I'm going to bed.

179
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,340
Good night.

180
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,460
Are you sick?

181
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,280
No.

182
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,580
Okay.

183
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,560
Good.

184
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,360
Take care of yourself.

185
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,500
Don't get sick.

186
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,880
I think I have a cold.

187
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,260
Zee.

188
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,380
Ouch.

189
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,200
First.

190
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,120
What's up with you and Zee?

191
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,640
Nothing, I just don't like him.

192
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,640
We know about that.

193
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,240
Do you think Zee is acting strange?

194
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,200
He follows you everywhere you go.

195
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,740
It's almost like...

196
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,860
Like what?

197
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,300
Why?

198
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,500
We're just wondering

199
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,180
if Zee has a crush on you.

200
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,640
Why are you so curious, Koh?

201
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,680
Caring too much
about other people's business

202
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,220
is...

203
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,280
Being nosy.

204
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,840
You guys are being nosy again.
Let's practice.

205
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,060
Come on, let's go.

206
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,060
What are you all doing?

207
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,400
Come on.

208
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,320
I don't find it strange.

209
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,600
It's normal. They're roommates.

210
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,640
It's not strange
to be close to your roommate.

211
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,280
We need to talk.

212
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,640
Where are you taking me, First?

213
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Let's practice then.

214
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,820
Come on.

215
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
This is because of you, Sam.

216
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,620
Let them be.

217
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,420
Come on.

218
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,100
Where are you taking me, First?

219
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Hey.

220
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,100
Why are you doing this?

221
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,900
What did I do?

222
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Huh?

223
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,460
You're following me around
and staring at me.

224
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,960
And you also...

225
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,740
Also what?

226
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,480
And you are also pissing me off.

227
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,680
I'm not.

228
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,060
Like I said, I want to be your friend.

229
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,060
Have you asked me?

230
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,390
I told you last night.

231
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,700
You dragged me here
to talk to me in private.

232
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
If you don't want to be friends,

233
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,740
what do you want?

234
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,460
What do you really want?

235
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,740
What do you want?

236
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,420
Where are you going?

237
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,640
Move.

238
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
I won't. So what?

239
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,300
You're not going to move?

240
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,340
You won't?

241
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,780
I will never be your friend.

242
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,540
Stop bothering me.

243
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,660
First.

244
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,920
You will pay for this.

245
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,380
Ouch.

246
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,020
Zee, practice hard.

247
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,200
Okay?

248
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,160
Coach, please take care of him.

249
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,440
Sure.

250
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,540
First.

251
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
This is Zee.

252
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,560
Your new friend.

253
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,560
Okay.

254
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:38,004
Zee will practice volleyball with us
every weekend.

255
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,080
You can give him advice.

256
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,960
Okay.

257
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,120
I'll leave him to you.

258
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,140
Okay.

259
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,280
I'm First.

260
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,520
Do you want to play?

261
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,800
How is Zee?

262
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:42,252
Good, he's determined.

263
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,060
I have a dream.

264
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,460
I want him to be a volleyball player.

265
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,300
If he continues to work this hard,

266
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,280
he'll make it to the national team.

267
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,620
Coach.

268
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,440
I'll leave him to you.

269
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,260
Why do you like volleyball?

270
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,260
I really like volleyball.

271
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,800
I want to be a great player.

272
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,160
If I make it to the national team,
my father will be proud of me.

273
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,640
Zee.

274
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,440
Did you hear what I said?

275
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,280
You don't like talking to other people?

276
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,200
Can you shut up?

277
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,840
Zee.

278
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,980
If you want to go under,

279
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,400
you must put your hands
together like this.

280
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,920
Then twist your arms.

281
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,000
Use this area to receive the ball.

282
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,060
Do you understand?

283
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,880
What are you daydreaming about?
Stay focused.

284
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,100
If you are determined,

285
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,120
you will make it to the national team.

286
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,360
Your mother will be so proud of you.

287
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,620
Keep practicing.

288
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,740
Can you shut up?

289
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,240
I'm glad I stayed longer
to practice with you.

290
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,340
Will you only practice at night
from now on?

291
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,340
I think so.

292
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,580
But I need to discuss with Coach first.

293
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,480
Give it a shot.

294
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,440
He might agree to it.

295
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,080
You can talk to him,

296
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,340
but I'm not sure if he'll let you.

297
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,680
I must give it a shot.

298
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
I'm not free in the afternoon.
What else can I do?

299
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,880
Yeah, whatever. Are you two leaving now?

300
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,380
Yeah, I'm leaving now.

301
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,760
Thank you so much

302
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,800
for practicing with me today.

303
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,780
It's fine.

304
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,960
Where did he go?

305
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,360
I'm glad he's not here.

306
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,460
I'll do the asking this time.

307
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,840
Where have you been?

308
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,520
You went to party, didn't you?

309
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,320
How dare you criticize me?

310
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,260
I won't tell anyone.

311
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,260
So... let's call it even.

312
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,140
Sorry, I forgot that we were
supposed to live separately.

313
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,140
Your side of the room is messy.

314
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,640
So help me clean it.

315
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,520
Do it yourself.

316
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,560
How do I win his heart?

317
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,080
First, wait for me.

318
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,600
You didn't wait for me.

319
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,020
We're roommates.
We should go eat together.

320
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,480
What's with the face? Why are you upset?

321
00:27:47,715 --> 00:27:48,875
I'm upset because of you.

322
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
All I did was invite you to eat.

323
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,060
Don't start criticizing.

324
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,340
Don't start.

325
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,340
I'm not trying to piss you off.

326
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,880
I'm just inviting you to go eat with me.

327
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,500
You are pissing me off right now.

328
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,980
I'm sorry.

329
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,840
I'm really sorry.

330
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,880
About the past and the present.

331
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,080
Please forgive me.

332
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,860
You think a simple apology from you

333
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,220
will make everything okay?

334
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,100
Move.

335
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,720
This isn't a simple apology.

336
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,720
I really mean it

337
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,580
even though I didn't do anything.

338
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,660
I have no idea
what happened in the past.

339
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,820
I'm glad you really mean it, Zee.

340
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,400
In Buddhism,

341
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,780
feeling guilty

342
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,760
means you know what's right
and what's wrong.

343
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,460
Zee, my beloved Zee.

344
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,560
Zee is so handsome.

345
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,660
Right? He looks better every day.
Don't you think so?

346
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,520
I want to look at Zee forever.

347
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,820
He's so hot. Look at him.

348
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,120
His significant other must be so lucky.

349
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,800
You're right.

350
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,520
He's looking at you.

351
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,000
Send it to the group chat.

352
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,100
Keep fighting, Zee.

353
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,540
What?

354
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,020
What?

355
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,020
Hey.

356
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,780
Namkhing.

357
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,340
First.

358
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,340
Why are you here?

359
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,040
Well... I...

360
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
I'm here to see you.

361
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,880
You're such a liar.

362
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,880
I'm going to tell Dad.

363
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,480
Okay, fine.

364
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,840
I'm here to see Zee.

365
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,120
You tricked Dad into telling you
where we're at, didn't you?

366
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
You always know my moves.

367
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,860
What are you laughing at?

368
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,860
Nothing.

369
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,900
You really are his sister.

370
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,240
Yes.

371
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,660
He knows everything you're up to.

372
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,220
All right.

373
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,640
I'll tell Coach
not to let any outsiders in.

374
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,480
Especially you three.

375
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
- You can't, First.
- Please.

376
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,180
Don't be so mean to us, First.

377
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,780
First.

378
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,840
I'm your sister.
Can't I come and watch you?

379
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,300
Don't use me as an excuse.

380
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,300
I told you that Zee isn't a good person.

381
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,820
Stop having a crush on him.

382
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,040
You're just jealous of him.
You're the bad guy.

383
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,420
Namkhing.

384
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,140
If you don't leave now, I'll tell Coach.

385
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,380
Come on, First.

386
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,820
Don't tell Dad, First.
You're bullying me.

387
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,820
Good luck, Zee.

388
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,600
Do you think she knows
that he isn't the protagonist?

389
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,220
I don't think she knows.

390
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,900
But I think...

391
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,380
They're not doing a good
job disguising themselves.

392
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,200
Do you want to watch a movie or chat?

393
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Yeah, you guys keep talking.

394
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,680
What are you guys watching?

395
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Damn it.

396
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Hey.

397
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,320
The guy's in disguise?

398
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,560
Yeah.

399
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,260
I'm so nervous.

400
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,580
The girl is about to find out.

401
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,020
Don't go that way.

402
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,480
I think the girl knows.

403
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,720
This is so exciting.

404
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,660
She'll find out.

405
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,620
She'll find out.

406
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,820
Why do I have to take a shit now?

407
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,160
What are they doing?

408
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Damn it.

409
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,620
They see each other now.

410
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,635
(Watch the next episode)

411
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,600
Damn it.

412
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,880
We have to wait for the next episode.

413
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
What the hell?

414
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,860
Let's go take a shower.

415
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,860
Come on.

416
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,740
What a bummer.

417
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,320
I have a movie recommendation for you.

418
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,000
Okay, sit down.

419
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,240
Which movie? Tell us.

420
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,480
I forgot.

421
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,580
Huh?

422
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,560
What a waste of time. Let's go.

423
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Come on, let's go.

424
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,340
Oh, I remember now.

425
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,920
This one.

426
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,820
I can't hold it in anymore.

427
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,480
What movie?

428
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,460
Spell it.

429
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,220
T...

430
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,580
Okay, T.

431
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,280
W.

432
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,420
I.

433
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,960
I don't remember.

434
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,840
You don't remember? Come here.

435
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,620
What a waste of time.

436
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,860
Go shower.

437
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,300
Mike, bring the iPad.

438
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,120
Hurry up.

439
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,140
I'm begging.

440
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,240
You keep going out. You shouldn't
be afraid of getting caught.

441
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,900
Can we talk later?

442
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,900
Where have you been?

443
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,400
Damn it.

444
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,380
I really need to go.

445
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,380
Where are you going again?

446
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,700
Get out of the way.

447
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,640
I won't.

448
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,100
Move.

449
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,240
Where were you?

450
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,000
I said get out of the way.

451
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,140
Where were you?

452
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,600
Tell me.

453
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,600
Move.

454
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,960
Tell me.

455
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,940
I said move.

456
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,680
Tell me.

457
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,380
Move.

458
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,940
It's over now.

459
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,000
Do you still want to talk?

460
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,640
Thank you very much

461
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
for taking care of Zee.

462
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,740
I'll leave him to you.

463
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,220
I've been very busy.

464
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,220
Okay, thank you.

465
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,220
Thank you very much.

466
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,060
Mom.

467
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,420
Zee, how are you?

468
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,480
Are you hungry?

469
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,860
Yeah?

470
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,440
No, Mom.

471
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,660
It's okay. Lie down.

472
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,240
What did Coach say about me?

473
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,460
Well...

474
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,120
Will he be upset

475
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,720
that I can't go to the tryout

476
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,040
even though I tried so hard?

477
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,140
Don't worry, Zee.

478
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,400
This year

479
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,400
you'll get to go to the tryout.

480
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,860
Huh?

481
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,360
How is that possible, Mom?

482
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,780
I'm still injured.

483
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,020
I won't be able to practice.

484
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,020
Why, Mom?

485
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,500
Tell me.

486
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,480
Mom.

487
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,600
What's going on?

488
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,220
Tell me.

489
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,220
Calm down, Zee.

490
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,980
Sprite offered

491
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,020
to help.

492
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,360
He's been practicing for you.

493
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,360
Zee.

494
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,000
What? Sprite?

495
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,680
This is my life, Mom.

496
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,480
That's right.

497
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,920
Because I know

498
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,640
that this tryout is important to you.

499
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,640
So what does Sprite have to do with it?

500
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:17,415
You're being unreasonable.

501
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,620
Why are you shouting at me?

502
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,400
Never mind.

503
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,600
Hello, Auntie.

504
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,580
Hi.

505
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,580
How are you feeling?

506
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,120
How was practice today?

507
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,120
Are you talking about Sprite?

508
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,880
He is...

509
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,120
You also agreed to let
Sprite take my place?

510
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,380
Well...

511
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,160
Sprite isn't taking your place.

512
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,040
I'm sorry, Zee.

513
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,420
You don't have to apologize.

514
00:41:16,695 --> 00:41:19,035
I made the decision on my own.

515
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,060
I made the decision.

516
00:41:22,312 --> 00:41:25,072
I'm worried about you and your future.

517
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,960
If you want to be mad at me,

518
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,980
it's fine.

519
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,620
I'm sorry, Zee.

520
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,620
Get out. I want to be alone.

521
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,240
Zee.

522
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,900
I said get out.

523
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,115
Is it possible for me
to only practice in the evening?

524
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:14,250
Is there anything
more important than practicing?

525
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:15,836
It is important, Coach.

526
00:42:16,102 --> 00:42:17,828
You should practice
jiujitsu too, Sprite.

527
00:42:18,922 --> 00:42:20,243
It's that guy.

528
00:42:20,396 --> 00:42:21,239
I'll try.

529
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:23,692
Tell me what you're forcing him to do.

530
00:42:24,247 --> 00:42:27,286
Are you sure that they're doing it
for us, Salmon?

531
00:42:30,023 --> 00:42:32,352
Having him as my twin really sucks.
