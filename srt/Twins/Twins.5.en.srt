1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,280
How can you forget it?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,440
Coach Wit is our father.

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,880
Coach Wit

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,360
is First's father.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,380
Yes.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,620
But...

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,220
What does that have to do with us?

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,580
Actually I want
to know more about First.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,640
What do you want to know about him?

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,700
I want to know why he's so mad at me.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,380
I'm not so sure.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,640
But...

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,980
First always says you're arrogant.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,220
When he does that,
Dad always scolds him.

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,440
He's right.

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,940
But I don't think you are arrogant.

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,780
Yes, you're very cool.

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,300
That's right. You are the coolest to us.

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,600
After meeting you,

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,320
I realized

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,680
that you are so brilliant.

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,660
You are fucking brilliant.

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,640
Okay, Namkhing.

24
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,140
I think...

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,200
First probably doesn't like you
because he feels neglected by Dad.

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,460
Because Dad cares more about you.

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,240
He always talks about you.

28
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,660
First is probably just hurt.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,300
I have...

30
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,640
I have a favor to ask you.

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,640
How can I help you?
I'm willing to do anything.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,060
What should I do
to make First not mad at me?

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,700
Well...

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,940
I...

35
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,600
I don't have feelings for him or anything.

36
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,400
I just don't want any tension
between me and him.

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,440
I see.

38
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,160
You're afraid that your tension with him
will affect our relationship?

39
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,120
Something like that.

40
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,340
Please help me.

41
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,200
(Twins)
(Episode 5)

42
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,260
Hey.

43
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,760
What should I do
to make it up to you?

44
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,920
I know you're mad.

45
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,980
Tell me what I have to do.

46
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,880
You're pissing me off.

47
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,260
What Namkhing said was true.

48
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,260
First.

49
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,240
Coach Wit doesn't prioritize me
over you.

50
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,340
What are you talking about?

51
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,420
I see your facial expression
when you talk to him.

52
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,080
It seems like he doesn't listen to you.

53
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,360
None of your business.

54
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,920
I know that it's none of my business.

55
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,940
What do I have to do

56
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,140
to make you not mad at me?

57
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,140
Leave me alone.

58
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,560
Let's be friends.

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,300
Move.

60
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,060
Please.

61
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,600
Get out of the way, Zee.

62
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,240
You won't answer.

63
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:34,155
So let's be friends.

64
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,140
I'm not your friend.

65
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,140
I am.

66
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,460
Don't play hard to get.

67
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,180
Having a handsome friend like me

68
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,440
is good, isn't it?

69
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,960
You're annoying.

70
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,900
Hey.

71
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,420
Huh?

72
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,520
Why is he so detemined?

73
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Is he crazy or what?

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,040
Come on, Zee.

75
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,460
You should eat.

76
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,580
Here.

77
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,360
Zee.

78
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,800
You haven't eaten anything all morning.

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,980
Come on.

80
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,180
What should I do
to make you not mad at me?

81
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,720
I'll help you, Auntie.

82
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,960
Zee.

83
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,080
Let me help you. Come on.

84
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,020
Wow.

85
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,320
It smells so good.

86
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,940
Your food looks so good, Auntie.

87
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,880
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.

88
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,640
Okay?

89
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,240
Zee.

90
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,100
Is there something else
you'd like to eat? I'll get it for you.

91
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,540
I'm not hungry.

92
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,940
But you must eat.

93
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,080
Auntie said you haven't
eaten anything all day.

94
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,480
Salmon, tell my mother to go home.

95
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,800
Zee.

96
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,300
Why did you say that?

97
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,980
Auntie is probably so upset.

98
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,080
I understand that
you're mad at everyone.

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,080
But I'm begging you.

100
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,120
You must recover.

101
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,840
So you'll be able to compete.

102
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,000
Please, Zee.

103
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,480
Listen up.

104
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,320
The match tomorrow

105
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,100
is extremely important to us.

106
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,220
I want you to stay focused

107
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,060
on the match.

108
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,760
Play well like we've been practicing.

109
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,120
Come on.

110
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,860
NSU, let's do this!

111
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,320
Yes!

112
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,520
Let's go.

113
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,540
We're going to focus on the takedown.

114
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,540
The first step is very important.

115
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,100
It doesn't matter if it's the single leg
or the double leg.

116
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,260
The competition is getting closer.

117
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,880
Coach.

118
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,400
Hey.

119
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,000
The match is tomorrow.
Why are you late?

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm sorry, Coach.

121
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,340
Hurry up and go get changed.

122
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,100
You're the last pair for today.

123
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,480
Okay.

124
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,200
Let's go.

125
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,500
Get ready.

126
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,360
We're going to do the sparring.

127
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,020
Be careful of those two.

128
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,900
They have their eyes on you.

129
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,640
We'll see about that.

130
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,520
Ready, fight.

131
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,760
Sprite.

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,820
Damn it.

133
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,440
Stop.

134
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,360
- I said stop.
- Fuck you.

135
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,360
The competition is so close.

136
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,980
Why are you fighting?

137
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,680
Should I disqualify both of you?

138
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,420
- I'm sorry, Coach.
- I'm sorry, Coach.

139
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,900
Go practice.

140
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,520
Don't let this happen again.

141
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,860
Do you understand?

142
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,920
Go in.

143
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,760
I'm about to.

144
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,760
Block.

145
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,560
I need one more.

146
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,300
Are you in?

147
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,720
Is it complete?

148
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,600
Zee.

149
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,400
Come and sit with us.

150
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,840
Are you asking me to join?

151
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,780
Not me.

152
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,780
Not me.

153
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,200
Definitely not me.

154
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,760
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

155
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,760
You're so hung up on the little things.

156
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,740
We're competing tomorrow.

157
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,100
Zee is part of the team.

158
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,860
I agree with Jack.

159
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,320
We're the same team.

160
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,860
It's better to be friends.

161
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,180
Zee.

162
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,640
Hey.

163
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,480
Coach once said

164
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,840
that volleyball is a team sport.

165
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,020
I think

166
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,820
if we can read each other's minds,

167
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,440
tomorrow will turn out great.

168
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,100
Right, First?

169
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah.

170
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,000
As the team captain,

171
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,760
I believe in all of you.

172
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,700
I think

173
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,400
we should do our best tomorrow.

174
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,200
Come on.

175
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,500
Let's go.

176
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,660
Zee.

177
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,460
Come on.

178
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,660
Three, two, one, NSU.

179
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,540
Three, two, one.

180
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,240
NSU, yes!

181
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,680
Ladies and gentlemen.

182
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,060
It's the volleyball match
between universities.

183
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,760
This is the first match from Group A.

184
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,840
The match is between NSU and KNT.

185
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,440
Let's find out
who's going to be the winner.

186
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,500
Good luck, Zee.

187
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,340
Stay focused, Zee.

188
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,800
First.

189
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,720
First.

190
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,000
The match is over.

191
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,560
KNT defeated NSU with a score of 3:0.

192
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,380
Take a break.

193
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,900
Let's go have a seat.

194
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,900
Take it slow.

195
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,820
What the hell did you do, Zee?

196
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,180
We've never lost like this before.

197
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,700
I was watching the game.

198
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,520
Do you realize that you suck?

199
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
It's like you don't
even know how to play.

200
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,280
Yeah.

201
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,840
We've kept quiet because you were good.

202
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,940
Based on your performance now,
you shouldn't even be a starter.

203
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,140
You suck.

204
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,140
You made us lose and you hurt First.

205
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,220
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,560
Do you think that's enough?

207
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,700
We shouldn't be fighting.

208
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,960
Let's take a deep breath.

209
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,120
They are right.

210
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,900
You're not focused, Zee.

211
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,900
I set the ball, but you couldn't score.

212
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,620
Let's not fight.

213
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,680
Calm down.

214
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,660
Shut up, Sam.

215
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,660
You saw that he wasn't focused.

216
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,660
Why are you taking his side?

217
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Were you not focused

218
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,820
or did you play bad intentionally?

219
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
What do you mean?

220
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,460
I meant what I said.

221
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,780
You really suck.

222
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,220
I really want to know

223
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,300
if Coach will still take you side.

224
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,880
It is my fault

225
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,300
that First got hurt.

226
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,020
I'm sorry for not being able to score.

227
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,020
But it doesn't mean

228
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,440
it was my intention to play badly.

229
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,760
You're saying that we didn't lose

230
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,760
because you couldn't score?

231
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,220
Was I the only one on the team?

232
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,420
You're blaming me.

233
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,540
Volleyball is a team sport.

234
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,540
But if you're not focused,

235
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,300
then don't say we're only blaming you.

236
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,780
Fine.

237
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,120
It's my fault.

238
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,980
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,820
I admit it.

240
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,300
Are we done?

241
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,460
Shit.

242
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,300
Did he apologize?

243
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,020
Jack.

244
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,780
Are you still mad?

245
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,860
You should relax.

246
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,180
Come on. There's no need to hurry.

247
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,340
Come on.

248
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,340
Sprite is probably on his way.

249
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,940
Where the hell are you, Sprite?

250
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,720
I'm here, Coach.

251
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,880
You were almost late. You're next.

252
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,920
Go ahead.

253
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,860
Good luck, Sprite.

254
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,660
Go ahead.

255
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,580
Sprite.

256
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,740
Where were you?

257
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,100
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

258
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,080
I was at the jiujitsu match.

259
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
It was today?

260
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,320
After the volleyball match?

261
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,180
How did it go? Did you win?

262
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,060
I'm sorry.

263
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,720
This is my fault.

264
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,580
All I do is cause trouble.
Dad was right.

265
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,660
Why are you apologizing?

266
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
It isn't your fault.

267
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,880
It is.

268
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,400
It really is.

269
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,980
I lost the jiujitsu match.

270
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,280
I made the team
lose the volleyball match.

271
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,900
I really suck.

272
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,060
I'm not surprised
the team criticized me.

273
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,800
How can I be as good as Zee?

274
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,940
I lost.

275
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,800
I lost every match.

276
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,400
Are you tired, Sprite?

277
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,460
Of course. I'm exhausted.

278
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,460
Hey.

279
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,500
How did you get in?

280
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,500
I just walked in.

281
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,840
Did you expect me to fly in?

282
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,480
And...

283
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,480
Why did you come to see me?

284
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,480
I'm here to give you emotional support.

285
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,480
You lost, but it's fine.

286
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,060
Just keep practicing.

287
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
Try again next time.

288
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,720
Okay.

289
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,280
I have to go.

290
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,120
You should get some rest.

291
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,480
Don't forget to eat my cake.

292
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,120
Bye.

293
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,800
It's okay.

294
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,460
Hey.

295
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,640
Do you need to take a break?

296
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,940
Okay, I'll do that.

297
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,340
How are you?

298
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,560
I'm fine.

299
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,360
Go practice.

300
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:33,038
(Where are you?)

301
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:35,475
(I went to the gym and I didn't see you)

302
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,882
(You skipped again, didn't you?)

303
00:23:37,907 --> 00:23:39,928
(You never come home)

304
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:42,921
(Come home today)

305
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,860
Sprite.

306
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,920
Are you all right?
Why do you look so stressed out?

307
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,160
Lately...

308
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,560
Dad has been demanding me
to come home.

309
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,940
I don't know how to lie to him anymore.

310
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,260
Is there something on my face?

311
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,120
I think you should tell him.

312
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Tell Dad?

313
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,100
Yeah.

314
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,980
At the end of the day,

315
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,200
you are both his sons.

316
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,260
I'm sure he can help keep a secret.

317
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,060
Also,

318
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,520
you won't need to lie to him anymore.

319
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,240
Salmon.

320
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,360
Do you really think it will be better

321
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,600
if I tell him?

322
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,960
He will definitely scold me.

323
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,780
One more thing.

324
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,780
Mom doesn't want him to know.

325
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,080
But at least

326
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
if you tell him,

327
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,320
you won't have to sneak around
like this anymore.

328
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,020
The worst case scenario

329
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,800
is him scolding you.

330
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,400
But you won't have to lie
to him anymore.

331
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,820
I will try

332
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,680
to talk to your mother about it.

333
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,200
But I really think

334
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,920
you should tell your father.

335
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,300
I understand.

336
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:33,820
Pretending to be
someone else is exhausting.

337
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,920
I understand how tired you are.

338
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,120
Why are you here?

339
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,400
I followed you.

340
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,520
Ouch.

341
00:26:12,055 --> 00:26:12,715
See?

342
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,860
Don't hurt yourself
trying to get away from me.

343
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,180
I promise that
I will not piss you off anymore.

344
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,140
Do you fight with your father?

345
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,120
None of your business.

346
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,520
There's something
I want to tell my father.

347
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,000
But I don't know if I should.

348
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,200
What do you think I should do?

349
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,340
It's up to you.

350
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,420
So you agree with me, right?

351
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,620
What you do is your business.

352
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,220
It has nothing to do with me.

353
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,540
Good.

354
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,580
At least you listened to me.

355
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,100
Thanks.

356
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,200
You are shameless.

357
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,120
Your leg.

358
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,600
You should put some ice on it.

359
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,800
I'm worried about you, First.

360
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,780
First.

361
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,780
Does your leg still hurt?

362
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,660
It's better now.

363
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,880
It's a shame you got injured.

364
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,160
Tom.

365
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,300
We all know why he got injured.

366
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,380
It doesn't seem
like he's going to recover soon.

367
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,100
You caused this problem.

368
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,300
Zee.

369
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,960
Don't be mad at Tom.

370
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,160
It's nothing.

371
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,540
How can I be mad at him?

372
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,160
I really did injure First.

373
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,700
Hurry up, Sam.

374
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,100
All right.

375
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,720
Get well soon, First.

376
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,400
First. Zee.

377
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,120
Why are you calling the name
of the person who made us lose?

378
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,120
Koh.

379
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,980
Blaming your teammate

380
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,280
isn't very nice.

381
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,080
Where are you guys going?

382
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,460
We're going to play games
at the common area. Do you want to join?

383
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,100
First. Zee.

384
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,000
Come play with us.

385
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,660
Deaw.

386
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,920
Why are you inviting
the person who made us lose?

387
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,040
If you invite him one more time,

388
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,780
I'll hide your religious book.

389
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,900
It's okay.

390
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,900
I remember every word in the book.

391
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,400
There's no point hiding it.

392
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,600
Thank you for inviting me, Deddeaw.

393
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,420
Maybe next time.

394
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,840
I'm tired.

395
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,460
Next time.

396
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,900
I'll get going then.

397
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,840
Give it to me. I'll help you.

398
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,260
Ouch.

399
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,800
I'm sorry.

400
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,320
You probably can't do this on your own.

401
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,980
I'll do it for you.

402
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,020
Can I ask you a question?

403
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
Can't we talk
to each other nicely, First?

404
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,520
I know

405
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,680
I've done a lot of things

406
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,680
that made you feel bad.

407
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,920
I'm sorry

408
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,080
for everything I've done to you.

409
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,080
I'm really sorry.

410
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,340
I really want us to be friends, First.

411
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,100
We both have been though a lot.

412
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,100
I understand.

413
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,560
How would someone like you understand?

414
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,160
We are roommates.

415
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,160
You can talk to me.

416
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,160
So I'll understand you more.

417
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,720
It's my business.

418
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,720
It has nothing to do with you.

419
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,840
But it does.

420
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,840
You were listening to me just now.

421
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,240
I wasn't.

422
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,240
You're just shameless.

423
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,360
But I'm really worried about you.

424
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,360
I'm sorry

425
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,640
for hurting you.

426
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,160
I've made a decision.

427
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,700
I'll go out tonight

428
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,680
to do what you suggested me to do.

429
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,100
I didn't make any suggestion.

430
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,360
I don't care what you do.

431
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,240
I'll be right back.

432
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,540
I'll bring some massage oil
when I return.

433
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,680
What you're trying to say

434
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,680
is that you're going
to sneak out and party.

435
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,060
Do you trust me?

436
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,840
I might not be able to tell you now,

437
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,400
but one day I will.

438
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,560
I have to go.

439
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:26,940
Jack.

440
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,800
What?

441
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,840
Why are you so quiet today?

442
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,640
Are you thinking about how we lost?

443
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,020
Hey.

444
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,080
Yeah.

445
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,780
If I wasn't the team captain,

446
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,240
would we have lost?

447
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,720
It has nothing to do
with whether you are captain or not.

448
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,880
Let me ask you something.

449
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,340
Why didn't you pass me the ball?

450
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,100
Don't you trust me?

451
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I feel like

452
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,880
you've been ignoring me lately.

453
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,840
That's not true.

454
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,600
You know well
that we understand each other.

455
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,300
You know that it wasn't intentional.

456
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,880
Really?

457
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,220
Why doesn't it feel like that to me?

458
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,220
Mike.

459
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,320
Never mind.
I'll forget about it tomorrow.

460
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,800
I thought you have forgotten
how to come home.

461
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,800
You keep missing practice sessions.

462
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,760
Do you think you're good enough?

463
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,420
Why are you being irresponsible?

464
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,140
You have been going late every day.

465
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,260
You think I don't know?

466
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,580
Coach Keng reports to me.

467
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,580
Whatever you do...

468
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,300
Think of my face.

469
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,180
Take this seriously.

470
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,000
You never satisfy me.

471
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,620
All you do is cause trouble.

472
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,620
Do you realize what will happen

473
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,080
if you don't practice?

474
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,600
Are you done?

475
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,320
So I can talk.

476
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,580
I have something to tell you

477
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,020
about Zee.

478
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,640
Zee.

479
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,720
What is it?

480
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:07,720
Hey.

481
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,000
Did you cause him any trouble?

482
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,380
Yeah.

483
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,500
It is a problem.

484
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,640
What happened?

485
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,380
Zee got hurt because he was assaulted.

486
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,580
He has to recover at the hospital.

487
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,240
So I volunteered
to take his place and play volleyball

488
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,460
because he needed to compete.

489
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,980
That's why I've been busy

490
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,590
practicing both sports.

491
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,780
So I haven't been home much.

492
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,520
What?

493
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,040
That means

494
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,540
you have been pretending
that you are Zee?

495
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,540
It is necessary, Dad.

496
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,540
I'm exhausted.

497
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,540
I practice volleyball all day

498
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,540
and I have to practice jiujitsu too.

499
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,960
I volunteered to take his place

500
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,360
because I wanted to do
something nice for him.

501
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,000
But in the end,

502
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,060
all I do is cause trouble.

503
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,060
I'm a trouble maker.

504
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,140
Why

505
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,800
are you telling me this now?

506
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,240
I was afraid the truth will come out.

507
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,120
Mom doesn't want you to know.

508
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,240
What was she thinking?

509
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,140
And...

510
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,560
So...

511
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,240
How is Zee?

512
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
He's at the hospital.

513
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,560
You can go visit him.

514
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,160
I have an early
volley practice session tomorrow.

515
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,180
I'm leaving soon.

516
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:44,980
Don't go.

517
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,500
Why don't you sleep here tonight?

518
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,940
You haven't been home in days.

519
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,460
Don't make me even more worried.

520
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,480
Is anyone suspicious?

521
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,640
Do you know how to play volleyball?

522
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,240
I get criticized every day

523
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,640
because I made the team lose.

524
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,720
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

525
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,400
I'll tell Coach
that you won't be joining.

526
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,940
Where are you going to take me?

527
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,840
Go.

528
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,420
You'll be late.

529
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,920
What are you doing?

530
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,200
Huh?

531
00:38:13,162 --> 00:38:14,580
I'll be right back.

532
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,580
I'll bring some massage oil
when I return.

533
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,960
Hey.

534
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,220
I'm sorry.

535
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,400
I didn't mean to not go back.

536
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,020
But it was important.

537
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,780
I was in a hurry this morning.

538
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,300
I forgot to buy you the massage oil.

539
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,820
Zee.

540
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,360
Are you going to join us for lunch?

541
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,680
Sam.

542
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,760
What should I do?

543
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,900
First is mad at me.

544
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
What should I do
to make him not mad at me?

545
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,940
Why are you

546
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,960
and First

547
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,560
suddenly...

548
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,360
We're on the same team.
We should be on good terms.

549
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,360
How wise.

550
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,360
Let's go eat, Sam.

551
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,060
Let's go.

552
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,900
No one cares that I'm trying to be good.

553
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,560
Damn it.

554
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,180
Shit.

555
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,920
This morning.

556
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,240
I don't know why
Dad had to pick me up early.

557
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,660
I forgot to buy it.

558
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,620
You missed your chance.

559
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,840
Sprite.

560
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,060
Can you help me ask Sam out?

561
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,720
Hey.

562
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,500
You have his number.

563
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,120
Ask him out yourself.

564
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,400
Fine, I'll do it.

565
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,080
Let's finish carrying it.

566
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,640
It's so heavy.

567
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,640
Who left it here?

568
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,700
Hurry up. We're almost there.

569
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,320
Yeah.

570
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,760
Wow.

571
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
How nice of you.

572
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,140
We were going to help you,
but you already finished cleaning up.

573
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,140
I just recovered from an illness.

574
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,180
I can't carry anything heavy.

575
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,720
Bullshit.

576
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,320
You wanted to help,
but what took you so long?

577
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,860
Since we're all here,

578
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,240
why don't we go get some food?

579
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,520
Good, let's go.

580
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,480
I'm starving.

581
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,480
Sprite.

582
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,160
Your luck hasn't been great lately.

583
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,880
Maybe you should visit the temple.

584
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,600
Good idea.

585
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,340
My life has been hectic lately.

586
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,340
I don't know if Dad will be taking me
somewhere again tomorrow.

587
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,420
Let's eat.

588
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:45,860
Come on.

589
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,400
Why didn't you tell me
we were coming to the hospital?

590
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,060
What if Mom finds out?

591
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,940
I'll take care of it.

592
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,480
Mom will scold me.

593
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,120
You did the right thing.

594
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,900
I deserve to know.

595
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,340
Zee is my son too.

596
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,100
Zee is much better now.

597
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,100
You don't have to be so worried.

598
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,100
I didn't think you would come.

599
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,100
Sprite.

600
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,760
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

601
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,080
You said you wouldn't tell anyone.

602
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,540
You didn't tell me

603
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,080
how bad his injuries were.

604
00:41:53,808 --> 00:41:56,368
I didn't think
you would have time for him.

605
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,360
Zee is my son too.

606
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,200
Does Sprite really have to pretend
to be Zee?

607
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,820
Let Sprite take care of this.

608
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,660
He volunteered to do it.

609
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,760
Sprite had to play volleyball.

610
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,060
He isn't good at it like Zee.

611
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,000
So what?

612
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,340
Please stop arguing.

613
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,460
I made up my mind.

614
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,060
Once I get out of the hospital,

615
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,260
I'm moving in with Dad.

616
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,240
Zee.

617
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,480
If you want him to be me,

618
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,480
then I'll be him.

619
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,440
Sprite.

620
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,540
I need to talk to you.

621
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:31,561
(If you want to meet Sam)

622
00:43:31,586 --> 00:43:33,632
(Try texting him)

623
00:43:33,657 --> 00:43:36,538
(I know you have his number)

624
00:43:36,563 --> 00:43:38,850
(Tell him you're close to Zee)

625
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,320
I can't help it.

626
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,420
Why is Sam so cute?

627
00:43:51,903 --> 00:43:55,396
(What are you doing?)

628
00:43:55,421 --> 00:43:58,763
(Are you free?)

629
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,418
(Meet me at the cafe)

630
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:07,386
(Why should I go?)

631
00:44:09,597 --> 00:44:11,816
(We're not close)

632
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,193
(I'm going to tell you about Zee)

633
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:25,990
(We're not close, but I'm close to Zee)

634
00:44:32,688 --> 00:44:34,524
(Which cafe?)

635
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,840
Excuse me.

636
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,320
I would like to order another drink.

637
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,240
What did you want to tell me about Zee?

638
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,420
Zee is the first thing
you're going to ask about?

639
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,560
I want to know about him.

640
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,940
I already told you that I like him.

641
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,020
I don't mind
that you have a crush on him.

642
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,680
I can wait.

643
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,680
I'm very good at waiting.

644
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,880
Wait for what?

645
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,200
Wait for you to stop liking him

646
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,200
and start liking me instead.

647
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,100
Listen to me.

648
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,640
I don't like you.

649
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,860
I know.

650
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,860
You'll like me one day.

651
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,520
Nonsense.

652
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,360
Hello?

653
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,640
What should I do?

654
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,040
What?

655
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,920
Now I have to be Zee completely.

656
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,500
What did you say?

657
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,880
What are you going to do

658
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
with this switch?

659
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,200
Don't you want to be yourself again?

660
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,200
He told my parents

661
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,520
that he's going to become me.

662
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,520
Even if he recovers,

663
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,520
he can't play volleyball.

664
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,140
He can't even leave the hospital.

665
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,460
Why does he want to become you?

666
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,820
I don't know.

667
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,140
He's probably mad at me.

668
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,380
But I have to keep pretending
to be him, right?

669
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,380
At least until he's recovered.

670
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,080
Honestly,

671
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,300
when you lost the last match,

672
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,680
Coach Keng seemed mad at you.

673
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:31,860
I know.

674
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,860
But you won.

675
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,300
He should be happy about that.
It's okay.

676
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,000
What a disaster. And now what?

677
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,440
You have to pretend to be Zee forever?

678
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,080
But it's much better
than when I first started.

679
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,780
First talks to me sometimes.

680
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,340
Huh?

681
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,200
Were you able to win his heart?

682
00:47:09,874 --> 00:47:12,135
(Next Episode)

683
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,580
Zee and First are together.

684
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,420
Do you guys have a crush on each other?

685
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,780
Why do I have to stay away
from my friend?

686
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,780
Just because they're mocking?

687
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,780
When you play volleyball,

688
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,500
you must communicate with your heart

689
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,500
or you won't be able to play as a team.

690
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,320
Are they really dating?

691
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,000
Be my boyfriend
and I'll tell you everything.

692
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,640
Ouch.

693
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,640
Is every volleyball player this violent?

694
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,180
For him,

695
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,500
I'll do anything.

696
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,060
You only believe
what you see on social media.

697
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,060
First and I are friends.
