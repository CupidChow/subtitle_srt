1
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:54,850
All right, guys.

2
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,850
Now,

3
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,340
we will play according to our plan.

4
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:00,570
Okay?

5
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,740
Get ready to play.

6
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,466
Okay.

7
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,720
Let's go.

8
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,760
Coach.

9
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,060
If this continues,
we'll definitely lose again.

10
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,830
This match is really important.

11
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,200
Do your best.

12
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,890
Don't forget
that the association is watching you.

13
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,690
Yes, Coach.

14
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,300
(Twins)
(Episode 10)

15
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,070
Cheers, guys.

16
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,049
Deaw.

17
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,310
All right.

18
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,100
You did so well today.

19
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,160
I have a reward for you.

20
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,270
You'll get three days off.

21
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,540
Awesome.

22
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,490
Bottoms up.

23
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,860
Hello, Zee.

24
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,730
Yes, Salmon?

25
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,950
Are you all right?

26
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,440
I'm better now.

27
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,380
Are you staying at your dad's tonight?

28
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:53,630
Yes.

29
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,990
I'll see you there.

30
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,120
Do you want anything?

31
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:58,960
No.

32
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,080
And...

33
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,930
How was the match, Salmon?

34
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,840
Of course we won.

35
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,130
Everyone did their best.

36
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,200
Especially Sprite.

37
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,920
See you later, Zee.

38
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:13,980
Okay.

39
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,300
Drink up.

40
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,200
Come on.

41
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,680
Wow.

42
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,250
Not too much.

43
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,520
Sam.

44
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,280
Come on, bottoms up.

45
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:36,410
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

46
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,680
Are you okay, Sam?

47
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,510
I'm going to meet Zee at home.

48
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,140
You can stay with your friends
at the dorm.

49
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,390
Thank you for doing this for Zee.

50
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,870
Of course.

51
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,020
Bottoms up.

52
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,730
Are you sure?

53
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,588
Ew.

54
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:08,430
Awesome.

55
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,990
Will Sam be all right?

56
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,660
I don't think so.

57
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,170
Wow.

58
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,000
More.

59
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,710
Not too much.

60
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,530
Keep pouring.

61
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,540
Wow.

62
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,130
Coach.

63
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,150
I... Please excuse me.

64
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:25,960
Hey.

65
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,490
Why?

66
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,880
I have some errands to run.

67
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,140
Go ahead.

68
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,080
Thank you.

69
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,020
Did you finish it, Sam?

70
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,590
Yes.

71
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,350
More.

72
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,980
Come on.

73
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,570
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

74
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,600
Cheers.

75
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,250
Let's go.

76
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,240
Let's go. You spilled it.

77
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,370
Why does my throat hurt so much?

78
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,780
What's wrong?

79
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,560
You never loved me.

80
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,090
Sam.

81
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,470
I love you so much.

82
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,360
Zee.

83
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,060
Where are you taking me?

84
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,400
I'm not done drinking.

85
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,150
Hey.

86
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,040
Are you sure you can handle him?

87
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,040
He's completely wasted.

88
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,710
Yeah.

89
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,120
I'll take care of him.

90
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,320
You should take care of your friends.

91
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,880
Okay, get him back to the dorm.

92
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,570
Let me know when you're there.

93
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,470
Okay.

94
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:33,930
Come.

95
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,890
Who is this?

96
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,290
Is that you, Tan?

97
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,620
Let go.

98
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,540
I want to keep drinking.

99
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,540
I'm not done drinking.

100
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,160
Get in the car.

101
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,730
Hey.

102
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,260
Hey.

103
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,420
See you.

104
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,210
Who is that?

105
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,270
Can he be trusted?

106
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,650
Yeah.

107
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,520
He's my friend. We can trust him.

108
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,280
How do you know him?

109
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,510
You've never mentioned him before.

110
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,520
A friend from primary school.

111
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,110
Come on.

112
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,740
Let's go back.

113
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,870
Take off your shoes, Mike.

114
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,210
Take off your shoes.

115
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,240
Hey, do it properly.

116
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,190
I'm sick

117
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,780
of drunkards.

118
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,260
Thank you so much

119
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,690
for always being there for me.

120
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:47,171
I don't know
what I would do without you.

121
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,290
You are wasted.

122
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,860
That's enough.

123
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,250
Can we do it?

124
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,200
No.

125
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,460
You should sleep.

126
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,490
First.

127
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,170
First.

128
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,080
First.

129
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,280
You're so drunk,
but you managed to come up here.

130
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:54,690
Who's drunk?

131
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,360
You're drunk.

132
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,080
Why do you like to come up here
and stare into space?

133
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,930
It makes me feel good.

134
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,120
Is something bothering you?

135
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,100
No.

136
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,020
I feel like you're mad at me.

137
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,510
Why are you mad at me?

138
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,020
Be honest with me, Zee.

139
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,640
Do you really have feelings for me?

140
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,640
Why do you ask that?

141
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,960
You didn't seem to care about me before.

142
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,230
But now you're good to me.

143
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,830
You're messing with my head
like I'm an idiot.

144
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,060
What do you want from me, Zee?

145
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,380
Well...

146
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,890
I'm sorry.

147
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,060
All you do is apologize.

148
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:17,940
Maybe...

149
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:28,880
I was confused

150
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,480
for treating you like that.

151
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,600
But I want you to know

152
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,120
that if sometimes.

153
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,140
I accidentally act cold to you,

154
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,590
don't take it personally.

155
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,250
I want you to care
about the person in front of you now.

156
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,040
That's how I really feel

157
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,880
and who I really am.

158
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,620
What are you talking about?

159
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,900
What you said on the rooftop...

160
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,850
What did you mean?

161
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,130
What?

162
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:05,840
You said

163
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,490
that if you act cold to me,

164
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,840
don't take it personally.

165
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,730
I just

166
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,340
didn't want you to overthink it.

167
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,740
I might not be able to do that.

168
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,290
Okay.

169
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,690
I understand.

170
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,740
Where am I?

171
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,070
How are you? Do you have a headache?

172
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,160
A little.

173
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,000
How did I get here?

174
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,220
I called Zee last night.

175
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,220
He said you were wasted.

176
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,700
So I went to get you.

177
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,770
I was worried.

178
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,220
Okay.

179
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,780
Take a shower and let's eat.

180
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,240
Okay.

181
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,730
Tan.

182
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,020
Yeah?

183
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,960
Last night,

184
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,960
I didn't do
anything embarrassing, right?

185
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,250
Well...

186
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,050
Tan.

187
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,740
Where are you taking me?

188
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,490
He's so heavy.

189
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,740
Oh, Sam.

190
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,420
Tan.

191
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:06,970
Hey.

192
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,300
Sam.

193
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,060
Come here.

194
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,810
Sam.

195
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,060
Don't move.

196
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,710
Ouch, it hurts.

197
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,850
Come here.

198
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,850
Sam.

199
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,850
What are you doing, Sam?

200
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,140
Don't speak.

201
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,440
Sam.

202
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,150
Stay still.

203
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,900
I'll do it.

204
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,450
Don't move.

205
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,450
Stay here.

206
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,300
Take off your shirt.

207
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,860
Okay, Sam.

208
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,900
Right now.

209
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,570
No.

210
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,110
Wow.

211
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,010
Did you make this, Tan?

212
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,220
No.

213
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,120
I got it from Auntie Tim's shop
around the block.

214
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,520
How did you know
that I like to eat porridge?

215
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,940
I think a hot bowl of porridge

216
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,940
is good for a hangover.

217
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,180
You're considerate.

218
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,340
I want to take better care of you.

219
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,312
But I don't know if you'll let me.

220
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,400
I'm not stopping you.

221
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,330
Let's eat.

222
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:42,830
Okay.

223
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:54,620
Wow.

224
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,510
Auntie Tim's porridge is delicious.

225
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,170
I eat this every day.

226
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:00,520
Really?

227
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,940
Is it good? Let me feed you.

228
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:10,890
Wow.

229
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,170
Do you want some more?

230
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,380
I need some water.

231
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,560
Ouch.

232
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:17,311
(Eat this when you're up)

233
00:30:17,336 --> 00:30:18,436
(I went home, see you on Tuesday)

234
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,640
Why did you get just one?

235
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,600
I want us to share.

236
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,730
That's enough.

237
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,210
You probably finished it.

238
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,220
Is it good?

239
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:42,420
First.

240
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,210
We haven't been on a boat in awhile.

241
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,210
You're being ridiculous.

242
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,010
Excuse me.

243
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,010
You can't sit there.

244
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:57,740
Shit.

245
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,540
Ouch.

246
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,420
What's wrong?

247
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,110
Electric shock.

248
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,900
Why are you touching me?

249
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,960
Can't I do that?

250
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,670
Stop.

251
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,920
You're asking for trouble, huh?

252
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,100
How are you, Zee?

253
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,880
I'm better now.

254
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,850
You've been taking care of me,
so I've gotten much better.

255
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,140
You're exaggerating.

256
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,570
Thank you, Salmon.

257
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,010
Go practice.

258
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,360
Zee.

259
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,340
We need to talk.

260
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,590
Zee.

261
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:34,860
Zee.

262
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,480
So... What's going on
between you and Salmon?

263
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,140
What does it have to do with you?

264
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,250
I was confused
for treating you like that.

265
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,830
But I want you to know

266
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,660
that if sometimes

267
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,660
I accidentally act cold to you,

268
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,040
don't take it personally.

269
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,730
I want you to care
about the person in front of you now.

270
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,450
That's how I really feel

271
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,810
and who I really am.

272
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,110
Hey.

273
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,060
First, you were able to block.

274
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,630
Come.

275
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,900
This seat is taken.

276
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,950
Lying is a sin, First.

277
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,040
I'm not scared.

278
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,180
I'll see you guys in hell.

279
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,280
Did you have a fight with First?

280
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,460
I'm confused too.

281
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,660
He's ignoring me.

282
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,440
Did you make him mad or something?

283
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,770
I really don't know.

284
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,880
Is it good?

285
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:44,800
I'm First.

286
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,010
Do you want to play?

287
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,170
Don't make me hate you even more.

288
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,290
That's your business.

289
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,680
Come.

290
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,060
First, don't. Calm down.

291
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,600
Can't you just apologize?

292
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,690
Where are you going?

293
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:34,780
Move.

294
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,780
I won't. What are you going to do?

295
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,380
Hey.

296
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,150
Wait for me.

297
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,240
You didn't wait for me.

298
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,840
We're roommates. Let's eat together.

299
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,060
What should I do
to make you not mad at me?

300
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,060
Move, Zee.

301
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,260
You won't answer, so let's be friends.

302
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,680
I'm not your friend.

303
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,320
I am.

304
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,320
Come on.

305
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,660
I'll do it.

306
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,150
Fried chicken party.

307
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:10,880
Tom.

308
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,500
Tom.

309
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,500
Tom.

310
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:21,384
Tom.

311
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,240
Tom.

312
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,860
I'm sorry.

313
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:24,420
Tom.

314
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,150
Are you okay?

315
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,130
Are you okay?

316
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:27,980
Are you okay, Tom?

317
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,530
Are you all right?

318
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,520
Are you okay?

319
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,520
Yes, Coach.

320
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,770
Go ahead and practice.

321
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,770
I'll take a quick break.

322
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,300
Are you okay?

323
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,640
Be careful.

324
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,320
I'll be back. I'll check on him.

325
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,940
What's wrong with him?

326
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,020
Yes.

327
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,140
Yes.

328
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,140
Well...

329
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,360
I'll take care
of the rest of the medical fees

330
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,780
as quickly as possible.

331
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,180
But...

332
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,180
Please take care of my mother.

333
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:41,980
Okay.

334
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,230
Thank you.

335
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,580
Tom, how are you?

336
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:55,900
Oh.

337
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,020
Why are you here alone?

338
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,020
I...

339
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,500
I was on the phone.

340
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,370
It's nothing.

341
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,220
Then...

342
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,240
I'll get going.

343
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,130
Okay.

344
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,530
I'm okay with anything.

345
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,490
I'll do everything.

346
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,490
I just need the cash.

347
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,280
My teammates?

348
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,540
They don't know.

349
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,830
If Coach finds out, I'll be in trouble.

350
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,210
Yeah. Thanks, man.

351
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,770
What is Tom up to?

352
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,390
It seems like that team knows
our strategy.

353
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,840
What does it mean?

354
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,250
Is there a spy

355
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:42,650
on our team?

356
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,460
No matter what happens,

357
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,040
trust your teammates.

358
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,640
Zee.

359
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:51,640
Don't forget our deal.

360
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,900
I want to be a starter.

361
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,960
I'm sick of being their substitute.

362
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,730
I don't want to be your friend anymore.

363
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,020
Is there something
you want to tell me, Zee?

364
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,770
If I didn't change schools then,

365
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,340
we wouldn't have broken up.

366
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,620
I'm scared.

367
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,760
If you really like him,

368
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,570
you should talk to him.

369
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,720
Be sincere and tell him everything.

370
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,420
Honestly, do you like Zee that much?

371
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,730
I really liked him then.

372
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,570
And now?

373
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,840
Now I...
