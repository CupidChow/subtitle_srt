1
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,140
What are you reading?

2
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:40,960
Huh?

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,460
First.

4
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,320
Stop being mad at me. Please.

5
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,860
Please, First.

6
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,100
Please, First.

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,140
Please.

8
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,260
Yes!

9
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,940
I won.

10
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,140
Sam.

11
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,180
You think you're handsome, huh?

12
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,600
Hey.

13
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,780
Let's continue.

14
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,620
Create a room, Koh.

15
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,480
Do you need the poster?

16
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,000
Are you done, Koh?

17
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,760
Let me play.

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,880
Come on. Let's play, Zee.

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,740
Come on, Zee.

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,800
Zee.

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
This hairstyle looks good on you.

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,280
You're so obvious.

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,580
What do you think, First?

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,920
Will you let Zee play with us?

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,020
Up to you. Do whatever you want.

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,980
I don't think First wants him to.

27
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,560
Can you guys stop taking sides?

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,560
We're just enjoying the game.

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,180
I really want to play.

30
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,080
Koh.

31
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Create a room and invite Zee.

32
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:22,860
Hold on.

33
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,600
Done.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,600
Tell me the code.

35
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,800
H?

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,640
Zee, the code.

37
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:48,364
D G K H N F.

38
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,400
(Twins)
(Episode 6)

39
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,380
I'm sorry I broke the promise.

40
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,960
I really had something important to do.

41
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,000
Feel free to scold me.

42
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,320
But please don't be like this.

43
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,220
It makes me uncomfortable, First.

44
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,740
Leave me alone.

45
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,480
When you're mad,

46
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,240
I should try to make it up to you, right?

47
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,220
This will be the last time
that I will tell you

48
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,900
to leave me alone.

49
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,540
Tan.

50
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,420
Damn it, Sprite.

51
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,340
- Come on, Sprite.
- Come.

52
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:08,980
Hey.

53
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,360
Why are you upset?

54
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,500
Come.

55
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,320
Ouch.

56
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,280
Ouch.

57
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,580
Come.

58
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,400
Hey.

59
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,880
Ouch.

60
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,000
When you're mad, I should try
to make it up to you, right?

61
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,340
This will be the last time
that I will tell you

62
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,720
to leave me alone.

63
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,020
Damn, Sprite.

64
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:03,005
It really hurts.

65
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,860
Sprite.

66
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,200
Who are you mad at?

67
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

68
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,860
Don't let it out on us.

69
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,360
I'm sorry. I was too rough.

70
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,700
Who are you upset at, Sprite?

71
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,520
Why are you that upset?

72
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,040
Damn.

73
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,200
First hates me.

74
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,260
He told me to leave him alone.

75
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,780
So why are you upset?

76
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,780
You're just friends.

77
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,260
Yeah, just friends.

78
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
I think

79
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
if you don't want him to hate you,

80
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,640
you should keep being nice to him.

81
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,640
He'll give in eventually.

82
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,940
By the way...

83
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,060
Which First are you talking about?

84
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,020
Yeah.

85
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,940
Hey.

86
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,500
Where is he going, Tan?

87
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,560
I don't know.

88
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,300
Come on, Tan.

89
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,600
Hey.

90
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,040
Tan.

91
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,480
First who?

92
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:35,448
(Two volleyball players from
a well-known team are in love #ZeeFirst)

93
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,580
Hey.

94
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:40,840
(Two volleyball players from
a well-known team are in love #ZeeFirst)

95
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:47,620
(I love this, shipping #ZeeFirst)

96
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:53,181
(#ZeeFirst only, what great chemistry)

97
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:58,212
(What kind of looks are they
giving each other? #ZeeFirst)

98
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,020
Shit.

99
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,020
Is this for real?

100
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,560
We have to tell the others.

101
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,440
All he does is cause trouble.

102
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,720
Higher.

103
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,460
Better.

104
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,180
Zee and First are together.

105
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,360
Is what we see in social media true?

106
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,840
Yeah.

107
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,440
They used to hate each other.

108
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,860
When did they become so close?

109
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,860
Or...

110
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,400
Is something going on
that we don't know about?

111
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,980
Hey.

112
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:28,987
Haven't you seen
the posts on social media?

113
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,980
What are you talking about?

114
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,800
Teammates turned lovers.

115
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,680
People are shipping them online.

116
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,420
Yeah.

117
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,440
Those two?

118
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,440
I don't think so.

119
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,540
I think it's possible.

120
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,900
What if Zee and First like each other

121
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,280
and become a couple?

122
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,840
Hey.

123
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,340
Are you sure?

124
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,260
Go ahead.

125
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,200
Hey.

126
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,620
Do you guys have a crush on each other?

127
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,040
You only believe
what you see on social media.

128
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,760
First and I are friends.

129
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,640
Friends?

130
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,120
I saw your photos on social media.

131
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,220
Like...

132
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,080
Lovey-dovey.

133
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,080
What the fuck?

134
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,080
We're all friends here.

135
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,080
Don't you guys have any?

136
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,360
Hey.

137
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,000
Fuck you.

138
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Calm down.

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,980
You're the one without friends.

140
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,560
Calm down.

141
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,720
Don't let me find out

142
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,940
that you guys have a crush on each other.

143
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,640
He's pissed.

144
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,120
He's really mad.

145
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,820
All done.

146
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,520
Not yet.

147
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:03,519
Coach asked us to paint the court lines.

148
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,440
Paint the court lines?

149
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,300
What are you looking at?

150
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,100
You're looking at me too.

151
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,900
I'm not.

152
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,860
Huh?

153
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,800
If that's the case, how do
you know I was looking at you?

154
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,440
You've seen the posts
on social media, right?

155
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,440
Yeah.

156
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,280
I have.

157
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,140
Are you uncomfortable?

158
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,320
Of course I am.

159
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
Strangers are making things up.

160
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,540
It's too late to fix anything.

161
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,440
Just ignore it.

162
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,260
You should spend your time training me.

163
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,640
Who said I was going to train you?

164
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,640
People might misunderstand us even more.

165
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,660
I will find a way to tell
everyone that it's not true.

166
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,800
Just ignore it.

167
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,300
The netizens will care
about something else in a few days.

168
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,380
You don't seem upset at all.

169
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,140
Just ignore it.
Pay attention to your ankle.

170
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,100
There.

171
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,440
Does it still hurt?

172
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,840
Here.

173
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
Take it.

174
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,680
If you can't do as promised,
don't make a promise.

175
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,540
Did you wait for me that day?

176
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,480
I'm sorry

177
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,260
for breaking my promise.

178
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,820
A promise only has meaning
if you do as you say.

179
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,240
From now on, I promise.

180
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,700
Don't promise to do something
if you can't do it.

181
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,120
Then I'll just ask.

182
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,540
Ask what?

183
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,100
Can you be my volleyball practice buddy?

184
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,720
I don't want to practice alone anymore.

185
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,160
Please.

186
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,000
Receive.

187
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,340
First.

188
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,340
You're going to be my practice buddy?

189
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,340
When you play volleyball,

190
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,340
you must communicate with your heart

191
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,060
or you won't be able to play as a team.

192
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,840
If you fight the same way, the
competitor will figure out your moves.

193
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,840
Even I can.

194
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Sprite.

195
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,960
Damn it.

196
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,800
Sprite.

197
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,760
If you fight the same way,
the competitor will figure out your moves.

198
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,700
Yeah.

199
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,520
I'll discuss with Coach

200
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,520
about changing my style.

201
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,100
Damn, you're messed up.

202
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,160
You look like a dog.

203
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,460
Hey, don't fight. Please don't fight.

204
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,260
None of your business, Att.

205
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,640
Yeah, none of your business.

206
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,840
Let's not get into a fight.

207
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,120
If you do, it won't look
good for both of you.

208
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,620
I'm in a good mood today.
I don't want to fight with anyone.

209
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,920
Unbelievable.

210
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,940
Yeah.

211
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,820
Hey.

212
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,000
Damn it.

213
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,760
Hey.

214
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,800
Focus on the practice.

215
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,900
How am I not focused?

216
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,560
Be more focused.

217
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,320
Come here.

218
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,060
Do the under.

219
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,380
When you do the under,
you must go even lower.

220
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,740
Go lower.

221
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,200
Yeah.

222
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,160
Your arms must be straight.

223
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,720
Straight.

224
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,720
So it's easier to receive the ball.

225
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,660
You don't normally do this.

226
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,140
I'm not used to it.

227
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,780
Hey. Don't be upset.

228
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,860
Fine, let's try it again.

229
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,200
Receive the ball.

230
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,680
Come.

231
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,700
If you do that,
your teammates will get injured.

232
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,980
If I don't do that,

233
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,760
how will you be close to me?

234
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,680
You told me

235
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,840
that we must communicate
with our hearts when we play.

236
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,160
I want to communicate with you.

237
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,340
You don't have to physically
be that close to communicate.

238
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,380
Wipe that smile off your face.

239
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,360
Why are you mad?

240
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,360
Receive.

241
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,240
Zee is working hard.

242
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,620
Why has Zee been practicing early?

243
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,760
He must be afraid
he won't be a starter.

244
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,780
Jack.

245
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,660
Let's discuss about us.

246
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,660
What?

247
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,600
You're going to pass me the ball.

248
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,380
Let's talk about that later.

249
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,060
Guys, gather around.

250
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,720
Okay.

251
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,820
Coach wants me to tell you guys something.

252
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,760
Wait, where is he?

253
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,440
He's not here today.

254
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,440
He's in a meeting with the board.

255
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,260
So he wants me to tell you.

256
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,780
He must be discussing how we lost.

257
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,460
So he has been pressured
by the university.

258
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,400
But...

259
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,400
There's always a winner and a loser, Tom.

260
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,360
I must say

261
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,060
that the last match

262
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,140
did not turn out well.

263
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,840
Even though it was the first match...

264
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,100
If that's all you are capable of,

265
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
forget about the tryouts
for the national team.

266
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,180
Coach wants me to remind you

267
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,540
that there will be an internal tryout

268
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,540
among team members.

269
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,860
Everyone must practice harder.

270
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,860
Especially Zee.

271
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,900
You must work harder than others, Zee.

272
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,440
Who's going to volunteer
to practice with Zee?

273
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,720
Raise your hand.

274
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,360
First.

275
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,900
Why don't you practice with him?

276
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,480
You're like a couple anyways.

277
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,960
A couple.

278
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,860
Are you guys still not done
being nosy netizens?

279
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,160
I'll help him practice, Salmon.

280
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,900
If you guys can't talk nicely,

281
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,300
then don't talk to me.

282
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,680
Are you uncomfortable?

283
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,740
If you're uncomfortable
practicing with me,

284
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,060
just tell me.

285
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,280
What are you going to do?

286
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,280
I'll stay away.

287
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,800
Why do I have to stay away
from my friend?

288
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,380
Just because they're mocking us?

289
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,880
I'm just pissed at them.

290
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,820
Do you want me to take care of it?

291
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,960
What are you going to do?

292
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,640
I'll punch them.

293
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,840
Nonsense.

294
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,120
Are you still going to help me?

295
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,480
Yeah.

296
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,480
I already told Salmon that I will.

297
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:55,507
Thank you, bestie.

298
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,000
I have something to do.

299
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,300
I have to go.

300
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,620
See you later.

301
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,680
What's the matter with him?

302
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,780
Come on.

303
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,780
You're practicing early.

304
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,560
Yeah.

305
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,560
I don't want to be a liability.

306
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,580
Is that all?

307
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,540
What do you want to ask me?

308
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,540
I'll answer yes or no.

309
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,840
Do you have a crush on First?

310
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,860
Come on.

311
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,580
You also believe
what you see on social media?

312
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,400
No.

313
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
I was just curious.

314
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,460
We're all friends.

315
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,680
Don't forget

316
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,680
why I'm here.

317
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,220
How are you dealing
with the rest of the team?

318
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,840
Have you made any friends?

319
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,380
It makes me sick.

320
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,680
Why does everyone hate Zee?

321
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,800
I'm not sure either.

322
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,420
When I became the team manager,

323
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,060
I noticed that everyone hated him.

324
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,120
The Zee we knew and the Zee now

325
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,120
are totally different.

326
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,240
I really want to know
what happened to him.

327
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,060
Yeah.

328
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,060
But he's the same to me.

329
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,160
You're the only one.

330
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,640
But everyone on the team

331
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,340
hates him.

332
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,540
Salmon?

333
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,660
Yeah?

334
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,300
Do you think everyone can be nice to him?

335
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,960
Of course. I think it's possible.

336
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,860
But the problem is

337
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,920
that Zee won't be nice to anyone.

338
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,860
Zee.

339
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,620
That was a long break.

340
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,400
Okay, I'm going.

341
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,200
Where are you going later?

342
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,120
Do you know that you're annoying, Mike?

343
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,120
Why?

344
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,600
It seems like you want something from me
and you're always being sarcastic.

345
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,880
Do I want something from you? Yes.

346
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,880
But I'm not being sarcastic.

347
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,400
This is how I normally am.

348
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,040
You're only normal when we fuck.

349
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,320
Just tell me what you want.

350
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,860
I've said everything, Jack.

351
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,180
What's wrong with you?

352
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,820
Guys.

353
00:28:59,784 --> 00:29:00,820
Do you want me to help you
with the dishes?

354
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:06,960
Hey.

355
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,940
Are you guys fighting?

356
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,560
You can talk to me.

357
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,120
I'm not good with advice,
but I can help you.

358
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,360
Zee.

359
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,680
What the fuck is wrong with you?

360
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,340
Why are you pretending to be nice?

361
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,480
Why would I be pretending?

362
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,480
I just want to be nice to you.

363
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,480
We're on the same team.

364
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:36,481
Let's clear the air and not fight.

365
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,520
I'll help with the dishes.

366
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,180
Zee is crazy.

367
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,380
Yeah.

368
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,520
You're crazy, not him.

369
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,260
Zee.

370
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,760
Stop practicing and clean the floor.

371
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,340
Wait a minute.

372
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,340
Put the ball away and clean the floor.

373
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,040
Okay.

374
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,200
What?

375
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,800
I need the mop.

376
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,180
I'm sorry.

377
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,700
That was a bit rough.

378
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,080
Just take it and clean the floor.

379
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,860
What the hell?

380
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,840
Ugh.

381
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,340
Zee.

382
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,340
I have a question.

383
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,500
Go ahead, what is it?

384
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,700
Sam.

385
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,640
Yes?

386
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,260
Well...

387
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,580
I saw Zee doing this.

388
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,580
Keep your voice down.

389
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm sorry, Sam.

390
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,740
Well...

391
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,080
I want to do it too.

392
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,640
Can you teach me?

393
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,040
Fine.

394
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,600
Really?

395
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,980
Have you had lessons before?

396
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,280
A little.

397
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,660
Then...

398
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,180
Can you teach me as well?

399
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:42,980
Okay.

400
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,920
I was wondering where my dear Sam went.

401
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,920
You're here.

402
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,000
Let's play games.

403
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,140
Do you want to?

404
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,800
If Zee's playing,

405
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,140
I'm not playing.

406
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,980
What about you, Mike?

407
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,040
Do you want to play?

408
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,920
I don't really want to play anymore.

409
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,620
Wait for me, Koh.

410
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,100
Tom.

411
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,300
What about you?

412
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,000
My mother is calling.

413
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,780
Go ahead.

414
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,440
What?

415
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,198
Yes, Mom?

416
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,700
What's the matter with them?

417
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,840
Okay, I'll get going then.

418
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,060
Huh?

419
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,400
Jack.

420
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,640
Hey.

421
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,000
What the hell?

422
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,640
Zee.

423
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,960
Please teach me.

424
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,060
Teach me too.

425
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,240
Fine.

426
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,560
Look, Deddeaw.

427
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,500
Okay.

428
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,260
Hey.

429
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,260
So cool.

430
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,260
Sam.

431
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,680
Look.

432
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,680
There.

433
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,980
Follow me.

434
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,560
Okay.

435
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,540
Do this.

436
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,540
Your arm.

437
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,540
Twist.

438
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,520
Hey.

439
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,280
Good.

440
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,000
So cool.

441
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,840
Gently. Ouch. Do it gently.

442
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,420
The last match

443
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,420
was tiring and a waste of time, Mom.

444
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,640
It's Zee's fault

445
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,960
that we lost.

446
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,440
Don't say that about your teammate.

447
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,240
He was probably tired.

448
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,620
No one wants the team to lose.

449
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,980
Okay, then I'll stop talking about this.

450
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,440
Mom.

451
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,060
I'll stay with you at the hospital
on my day off.

452
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:42,815
Is there anything you would like to eat?

453
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,760
I'll get it for you.

454
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,360
Anything's fine.

455
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:50,140
Just seeing you
will make me feel so much better.

456
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,560
That's all I need to be happy.

457
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,100
Okay, Mom. I'll see you soon.

458
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,820
That hit was amazing.

459
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,640
You should aim a little higher next time.

460
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,760
The other team is tall. It's hard.

461
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,920
Here.

462
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,440
Water.

463
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,100
What's wrong with you?

464
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,680
You guys didn't get any water.

465
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,700
You must be tired.

466
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,200
So I got you some.

467
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,200
What are you trying to do, Zee?

468
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,340
Being kind to other people

469
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,340
is a good thing.

470
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,340
Thank you, Zee.

471
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:56,834
Can we talk to each other nicely?

472
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,360
Talk nicely?

473
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,680
Yeah, we're on the same team.

474
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:04,839
You guys and I don't see eye to eye.
Don't you find it strange?

475
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,400
Hey.

476
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,760
Just tell us what you want, Zee.

477
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,420
Don't pretend to be nice.

478
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,420
Yeah.

479
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,420
Your little act

480
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,860
can't fool any of us.

481
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,660
What did I do to deserve so much hate?

482
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,680
You don't remember

483
00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:32,924
what you said to us?

484
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,760
Let's calm down.

485
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,920
Breathe in.

486
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:53,920
Breathe out.

487
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,500
What the hell did you do, Zee?

488
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,020
I will make you be friends with me.

489
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,800
Tom, let's practice. Come on.

490
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,040
Don't act confused. Come on.

491
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,880
Come on, Koh. Let's practice.

492
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,640
Hey.

493
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,480
Come.

494
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,880
You set the ball so well, Jack.

495
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,240
It's true.

496
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,360
What's the matter with you?

497
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,700
When we practice, pass me the ball often.

498
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,520
Of course I have to do that.

499
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,520
So I can score.

500
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,660
Fine.

501
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,140
Thank you.

502
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,760
It's fine.

503
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,220
Just stay focused.

504
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,900
Okay.

505
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,060
I'll keep practicing.

506
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,820
Pass me the ball again.

507
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,500
Show me everything you've got.

508
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,420
Damn it.

509
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm tired.

510
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,440
It's hot.

511
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,780
Today...

512
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,780
It's strange.

513
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,820
Are you tired?

514
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,640
Yeah, give me the ball.

515
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,500
What are you looking at?

516
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,500
Do I look strange?

517
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,500
Yeah.

518
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,220
Why are you naked?

519
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,260
We're all men here.

520
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,740
This is normal, isn't it?

521
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,580
I didn't do well during practice today.

522
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,360
My wrist hurts a little.

523
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,120
You hit the ball too fast and too hard.

524
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,120
I took a video of the practice session.

525
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,740
Do you want to get it checked out?

526
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,200
Hey.

527
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,820
Let me see it.

528
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,660
It could be dislocated.

529
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,140
Don't come near us.

530
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,560
You're being nice because you really
want to be friends with us?

531
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,680
Yeah. Are you just pretending?

532
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,240
Here.

533
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,740
Massage your wrist with some cream.

534
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,840
I'm being nice to you all

535
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,000
because I want to.

536
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,120
I'm not pretending.

537
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,360
Someone once told me

538
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,920
that when it comes to volleyball,

539
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,920
we must communicate with our hearts.

540
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,620
That's how we should play.

541
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
If I don't treat my teammates nicely,

542
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
why am I playing this sport?

543
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,220
We're on the same team.

544
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,440
If we can communicate well,
then it's a good thing, right?

545
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,380
Fine.

546
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,840
I'm fine with it.

547
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,700
You?

548
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,700
Good.

549
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,500
Thank you, First.

550
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,700
Yeah.

551
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,040
You were waiting for me.
Did you miss me that much?

552
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,900
Stop daydreaming.

553
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,900
I don't miss you.

554
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,420
What a waste of time.

555
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,420
I thought you do.

556
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,420
Hey.

557
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,020
What do you want to ask about Zee?

558
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,520
I want to know

559
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,520
about Zee and First.

560
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,100
Is it true?

561
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,660
About Zee and First?

562
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,320
Well...

563
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,480
So many people are shipping them.

564
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,840
You're good at making things up.

565
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,840
I'm not.

566
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,200
Do you

567
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,200
know about them?

568
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,980
I do.

569
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,740
Are they dating?

570
00:43:28,949 --> 00:43:30,040
Do you want me to tell you?

571
00:43:32,144 --> 00:43:33,180
If you do,

572
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,800
you must give me something.

573
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:36,800
What?

574
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,800
What do you want?

575
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,260
Well...

576
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,900
Be my boyfriend

577
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,900
and I'll tell you everything.

578
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,540
No. I'll find out on my own.

579
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,100
Why should you put in the effort for that?

580
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,680
Be my boyfriend
and I'll tell you everything.

581
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,580
Don't mess with me.

582
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,460
Don't tell me then.

583
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,300
You're annoying.

584
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,300
Ouch.

585
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,940
Is every volleyball player this violent?

586
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,540
For him, I'll do anything.

587
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,220
(Next Episode)
Come and pick your team.

588
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,100
First.

589
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,100
Why are we not on the same team?

590
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,420
Don't make it a big deal.

591
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,420
Does anyone want to switch with me?

592
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,020
Me. I do.

593
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,140
Why did you ask to switch teams?

594
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:46,920
Nothing.

595
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,280
Do you care?

596
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,280
Stop acting like this.

597
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,140
It makes me uncomfortable.

598
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,980
I don't like it

599
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:56,980
when you're close to someone else.

600
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,980
Does it mean

601
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,980
that I like you?

602
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,840
Stop liking Zee

603
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,740
and like me instead.

604
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,000
Let me take care of you.
