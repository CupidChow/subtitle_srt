Yes.

27
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,660
P' Zee.

28
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,560

29
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,240
that I'm one of the candidate just like you

30
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,960
P' Zee isn't happy?

31
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,040
I don't see you smile.

32
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,640
Why do I have to be happy?

33
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,720
I known that I'm going to be the candidate

34
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,980
Live report for P' Zee
NSU Volleyball fan page.

35
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,960
Now Namkhing, Medploy and May.

36
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,080
are waiting for an interview with the
university's official volleyball athletes

37
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,820
Of course.

38
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,860
P'zee must be one of them

39
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,580
I'm happy for P' Zee as well.

40
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,840
We cheered until we couldn't even sit down.

41
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,020
P'Zee is the best. Our talented star
and the NSU team.

42
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,440
Yay!

43
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,420
Namkhing move away.

44
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,420
Hey, they're here. Hurry
up and go record him.

45
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
Wait, Namkhing, move!

46
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,620
Oh, Oh! Oh, I can't see them.

47
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,620
Hey, Don't fight each other

48
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,880
- Zoom in on my face.
- I don't want to live anymore.

49
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,580
Please wave your hand. Yay!

50
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,380
Wow

51
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,060
Hey, Namkhing, behind you.
Oh, that's it, P' Zee has arrived.

52
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,760
You mind if I borrow him for a minute?

53
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,180
How is P' Zee? Are you tired?

54
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,080
How do you feel about
being selected as an athlete?

55
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,300
I'm good.

56
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,180
Hm! I'm always cheering for P' Zee.

57
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,740
P' Zee is the best.

58
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,980
And after this, where will you go
for the athletes training session?

59
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,420
Hmm! I can't tell you about the location

60
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,820
Sending encouragement is enough.

61
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,520
Please excuse us

62
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,280
Aw

63
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,620
Excuse me.

64
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,820
Hey, P'Zee of Namkhing.

65
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,920
Bye bye.

66
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,700
It’s sad. I only caught a little bit.

67
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,860
It's okay.

68
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,100
The NSU team members are very cute.

69
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,420
Let's send encouragement
to P'Zee and the NSU team together.

70
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,880
Yes, because after this the NSU
team will be gathering for practice.

71
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:19,471
We are the fan page for P'Zee NSU Volleyball.
We will be rooting for P'Zee and the NSU team.

72
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:24,980
And if there is any further update,
We will hurry and tell you. Bye bye.

73
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,820
Sprite.

74
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,260
Oy, What's up?

75
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,260
Your performance is good today.

76
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,100
Oy, Who is this? The
future of the national team.

77
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,404
Oh, if you have a future
for the national team.

78
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm also a future
Olympic gold medalist.

79
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,300
You're exaggerating.

80
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,500
Sprite!

81
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,240
You don't respect me at all.

82
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
You have no respect for me at all.

83
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,300
I do

84
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,360
You think just beating me once
means you'll be better than me?

85
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Have I told you alreay?

86
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,500
You will never be able to
be a university athlete.

87
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,840
Remember my face.

88
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,440
I will definitely win over you.

89
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,280
Fuck you! Sprite.

90
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,800
You wanna piece of me?

91
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,960
Why did you bother me first?

92
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,500
Watch your mouth

93
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,780
You just have connections, so you
think you can do anything you want?

94
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,440
Is it because of you suck?

95
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
You've got a big mouth. Should
I give you another beating?

96
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,300
Fuck

97
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,100
That's all you have?

98
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
You are so weak!

99
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,740
Remember my words

100
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,000
Fucking Sprite!!

101
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,760
Can you confirm that you didn't instigate?

102
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,560
Yes.

103
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,700
But the witness told us that

104
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,480
You punched him first, Mr. Krantee.

105
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,016
There are no CCTV
in that area. There were

106
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,660
only witnesses who gave
consistent information.

107
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,100
You are the one
who attacked Mr. Sorawit first,

108
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,540
Mr. Sorawit and Mr. Nattawut
were more injured.

109
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,640
And confirmed that you
acted first, Mr. Krantee.

110
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,020
If it's already decided, why
are you calling me to ask?

111
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,200
Sprite.

112
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,520
I want to talk to you.

113
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,920
Did you know what you were doing?

114
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,360
Yes.

115
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,960
If you want to scold, scold me.

116
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,960
Just scold and you're done, Dad.

117
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,160
Why do you behave like this?

118
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,160
Starting a fight with a senior.

119
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,160
You know the rules of the club.

120
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,320
I'm not the one who started it.

121
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,180
Club rules also apply in clubs.

122
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,180
not outside the club

123
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
Your actions is very disrespectful to me

124
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
because I am the club's advisor.

125
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,620
If you don't follow the rules,
and something like this happens,

126
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,400
How can I show my face?

127
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,600
Leave it there

128
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Or put it somewhere else.

129
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:54,780
And besides, the rules
are created by people.

130
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,180
If it's not useful, why
should we keep them?

131
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,180
Sprite.

132
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,780
You play sports, but you don't
know how to respect the rules.

133
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,020
How can you be called an athlete?

134
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,220
It’s up to you.

135
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,420
I shouldn't have raised you.

136
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,000
Why did you raise me then?

137
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,320
Why don't you raise Zee instead

138
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,320
Oh, I forgot.

139
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,560
Mom didn't choose me.

140
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,800
So dad has to take care of me, right?

141
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,600
Sprite.

142
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,440
All the documents are ready?

143
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,340
Yes.

144
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,020
Look at the list. Who is sleeping with who?

145
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,760
Everyone

146
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,780
we will practicing.

147
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,260
for qualifier test here

148
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,180
This is the room key, coach.

149
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,620
We'll draw for roommates.

150
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,620
Then put the luggage in the room.

151
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,480
I'll give you 20 minutes.

152
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,160
I'll meet you on the field.

153
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,940
OK

154
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,540
Yes.

155
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,480
Come, everyone, let's draw lots.

156
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,720
Oh, I'm so glad, Koh,
that we're in the same room too.

157
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,180
Fuck!

158
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,680
I have to listen to your bedtime prayers?

159
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,560
Praying is a way to edify the mind.

160
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,740
Makes us conscious,
concentrated and wise. Enough!!

161
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,060
Stop it.

162
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,835
What, I sleep in the same room as you?

163
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,160
You want to sleep with me?

164
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:06,535
Ha, you looked at me.

165
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,440
No.

166
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:09,435
Oh, so who did I sleep with?

167
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,240
Jack, You slept with me.

168
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,560
Don't be such a jerk

169
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
You can't escape me, my friend.

170
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,540
Oh, I have never left you.

171
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,980
P' TOM

172
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,800
Oh!

173
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,280
Oh, I'm so excited.

174
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,680
I can sleep with you.

175
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,060
Oh, I want to sleep with P'Zee.

176
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,080
Don't be bossy! You sleep with me

177
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:40,412
All right.

178
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,040
So it means.

179
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,020
Salmon, I'd like a single room.

180
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,035
I'm the key of the team.

181
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,060
Can't I just ask for this?

182
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,180
Zee, But the rooms are full.

183
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,180
Zee just sleep with First.

184
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,440
Who do you think you are?

185
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:04,255
If you want me to sleep with a teammate,
I will sleep with Coach Witch.

186
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,860
First, I'm sorry on behalf of Zee.

187
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,160
It's okay, Salmon.
I don't need an apology on his behalf.

188
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,440
Or from him

189
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,160
How did you fall asleep so early?

190
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,580
Hey!! Mike,

191
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,340
Get up and unpack your stuff.
You haven't unpacked it yet.

192
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,340
Get up! Oh!

193
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Don’t be sneaky.

194
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,500
Hey, haha. Ko!

195
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,260
P' Tom, I think we should
rearrange the bed. Okay?

196
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,580
Um, how should I arrange it?

197
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,180
Um.

198
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,700
Zee thinks that he's
so cool, don't you think?

199
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,600
How do you think it's cool?

200
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,520
I'm much cooler than that.

201
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
I give ten points for skill.

202
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,320
But give a million points for his ego

203
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,160
My name is Go.

204
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
but my ego is not high as his.

205
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,120
Be grateful for what you have.

206
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,420
Be happy for what you have.

207
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,300
Then you're the luckiest one

208
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Stretch. Come. Hurry. Come.

209
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,320
Come on, come on.

210
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,500
It's you.

211
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,120
Come on.

212
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,140
Mike, if I set it up for you,
you should catch it nicely.

213
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,660
Oh, so what's not good about me?

214
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,660
Oh, I guess I'm not good at receiving.

215
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,360
Do you want me to scold you?

216
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,120
But can you scold other people?

217
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,920
Keep practicing

218
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,120
Let's do it again.

219
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,860
P' First, should we go
practice with P' Zee?

220
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,300
No, it's a waste of time.

221
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,080
Focus on practicing

222
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:22,680
Put your hand up, OK,

223
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,020
One. Oh!

224
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,580
Two. Oh!

225
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,300
Three. Oh!

226
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,360
Okay, that's enough for today.

227
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,660
Than.

228
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,180
Yes.

229
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,580
Why doesn't Sprite come?

230
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,860
Uh oh, that's.

231
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,860
Sprite…

232
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Uh, no problem, whatever.

233
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,860
Anyway, call friends to practice too.

234
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,860
Yes, coach.

235
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,280
I’m not used to see your
good friend skip training.

236
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,880
And when will his leg heal?

237
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,220
I'm not sure.

238
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:23,360
Or he is bored after being
investigated by the committee.

239
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,840
Yes, if it were me, I would.

240
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,520
Let me know if there's anything.

241
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,220
Sprite is really good too.

242
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,220
Also he is under pressure from the seniors.

243
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,220
Thank you very much.

244
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,220
But anyway, I'll try talking to Sprite.

245
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,500
If you learn anything, tell me.

246
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,480
See you.

247
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,480
Stunning.

248
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,320
Stunning.

249
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
Set the ball like this.

250
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,460
Oh, Well done.

251
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,040
P' Zee.

252
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,600
I picked up a ball for you.

253
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,000
Oh, Sam, you're never scared.

254
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,680
Let it go. It was done willingly.

255
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,260
Water drops on the rocks every day,
but the rocks just ignore it

256
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,560
Holding on to too much
causes a lot of suffering.

257
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,760
Less clinging, less suffering.

258
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,340
If you don't cling to it,
there won't be any suffering.

259
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,560
Amen

260
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,860
Sam, come here.

261
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,320
It hurts.

262
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:11,652
No, I will fight for it

263
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,540
Fight, fight?

264
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,900
Why don't you put this
much effort into volleyball?

265
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
Let me take a break.

266
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,800
Jack,

267
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
You used all my soap, right?

268
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,020
I didn't use all of it.

269
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,660
How would I use your things?

270
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,480
I'm so tired

271
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,260
I'm thirsty.

272
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,380
Excuse me.

273
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,380
Do you have anything to eat?

274
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,900
It's very hot.

275
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,840
Jack, take it

276
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,840
One more for Ryo.

277
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,500
It is so hot in here

278
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,780
Why don't you pick it up nicely?

279
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,520
So why is it?

280
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,520
It made other bottles fall.

281
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,160
It's just a falling bottle.
Why are you being serious?

282
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,580
I’m next I’m next

283
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,160
You guys are good at fooling around

284
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,160
Isn't it time to fool around?

285
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,160
How serious are you?

286
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,360
Well, have you ever laughed before?

287
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,820
Zee.

288
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,580
The stone will be heavy.

289
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,260
If you keep holding it.

290
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,260
You have to let loose

291
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,880
Amen

292
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,340
Go, go, practice.

293
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,340
Such a waste of time

294
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,020
Come here. Come here.

295
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,300
Set it up for me nicely, Jack.

296
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:51,440
Let's practice.
Set it up for me nicely, Jack.

297
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,000
Let's practice.

298
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,480
Good.

299
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,920
Ah, Deddaew

300
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,020
Do it more

301
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,480
I think First can jump higher than this.

302
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,400
Hey First, show us what you
got. Don't be such a big mouth.

303
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,680
First, hold your hands up high.

304
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,120
I'd like it to be a little higher, please.

305
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,540
First!

306
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,860
Hey, are you okay?

307
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,100
First! First! First!

308
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,100
Hey!!

309
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,840
Wake up.

310
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,960
Oh!

311
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,960
Who did it?

312
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,220
It's me.

313
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,700
Why don't you apologize?

314
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,300
I didn't mean to.

315
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,160
Oh, didn't you mean it?

316
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Hey, hey, hey! Come on!

317
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
First don't!! First!!

318
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Can't you just apologize?

319
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Calm down

320
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,600
That's enough.

321
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,520
Practice, there's nothing now

322
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Go Go Go.

323
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,120
Sprite, it's me Than.

324
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,280
I'm your friend.

325
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,480
What's wrong with you?

326
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
I'm just teasing.

327
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,760
Aren't you coming home?

328
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Why do you care?

329
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,000
Yes, I care.

330
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,380
But your father doesn't.

331
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,500
The coach kept asking me every day.

332
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,980
Why don't you come to practice?

333
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
Do you think I wanna do it?

334
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,160
I went to practice and met Tong.

335
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,940
It makes me angry.

336
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,460
How about your dream?

337
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,820
Anyway, I'm on the university
athlete list. I won't lose it

338
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,320
I hope it stays that way.

339
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,060
Yes!

340
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,880
So where are you going?

341
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,300
It is a secret.

342
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,800
Yummy.

343
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,880
Are you starving?

344
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,940
You ate 3 dishes already

345
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,940
I'm hungry.

346
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,860
You want to be chased back by him, Sam?

347
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,820
But P' Zee, he's sitting alone, P' First.

348
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,120
Never mind!

349
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,340
Oh Daew, don't be stingy.

350
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,520
I'm not stingy, but Koh ate all of my food.

351
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,520
Eat the vegetables then.

352
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,060
Vegetables are delicious and nutritious

353
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,020
It's not a sin.

354
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,020
Aren't you afraid of sin?

355
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,260
I'm a vegetarian only
on Buddhist holy days.

356
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,240
I can't be vegetarian for every meal,
or else i won't have any strength.

357
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,920
Fuck Ko,

358
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,120
You just eat yours.

359
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,480
Why are you so greedy?

360
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Give it back to me.

361
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,640
Fuck it, Give it back!

362
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,540
Fuck Ko.

363
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,540
Hey!

364
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,660
The meal is already proportioned out.

365
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,180
Just eat what you are served.

366
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,920
Don't make a loud noise.

367
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,120
It's annoying

368
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,340
When did I annoyed you? Zee!

369
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,340
It's true.

370
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,340
If you're annoyed, go eat somewhere else.

371
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,300
Being an athlete if you don't have
discipline... Well, don't be an athlete.

372
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,960
Zee!

373
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,220
Please take it easy.

374
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,220
Ko.

375
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,880
Please don’t start a fight.

376
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,600
We are not the one who started it.

377
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Jack, Eat.

378
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Don't mess with them. It's a waste of time.

379
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,600
Take it easy everyone.

380
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,520
Hurry up and eat, the coach
will punish you if you are late

381
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,640
Eat.

382
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,300
Don't be over confident.

383
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,300
Over confident people will not be succeed.

384
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,420
Please calm down, everyone.

385
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,860
Being angry is stupid.
Being angry is crazy.

386
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,860
Stupid and a bad mouth,

387
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,060
wants to stand out so bad .

388
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,380
Don't make a mistake.

389
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,380
People are waiting to aggravate you.

390
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,260
Eat it, Sam.

391
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,780
Zee.

392
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,960
I think you should speak
nicely to your teammates.

393
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,720
The coach saw the team feeling awkward,
so I have to warn you.

394
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,600
Why should I do it?

395
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,840
Rules are rules.

396
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
If it's wrong, it has to be said directly.

397
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,440
Otherwise, how will they know?

398
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,140
I know.

399
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,840
But there's a better way to say it.

400
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
There won't be any problems.

401
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
I don't care.

402
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,840
What will others think of me?

403
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,380
I don't want Zee to be like this.

404
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,180
It's better to be close to
your teammates, right?

405
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,660
Volleyball? It takes unity
from everyone in the team.

406
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:14,520
Let's do this. If Zee,
doesn't know what to say.

407
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,160
Just smile like this.

408
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,380
I'll try.

409
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,100
Thank you, Zee.

410
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,720
You're the cutest.

411
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,420
I did it for you, Salmon.

412
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,420
Try smiling like that now.

413
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,620
That's really funny.

414
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,940
I'd rather go practice.

415
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,800
You're trying so hard to look cool

416
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,560
Hey, Seven o'clock.

417
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,860
Hey! Daew.

418
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,940
Hey! Koh,

419
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,540
Undressing in public is a shameful thing.

420
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,920
Oh, please, please, please.

421
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,340
We are all men

422
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,080
Well, you have to let it go, don't you?

423
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,080
I can't.

424
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,520
Koh! Why don't you pull it harder?

425
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,000
P’ Zee.

426
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,740
What's wrong, Sam?

427
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,880
Uh,

428
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,880
I want to invite P'Zee
to have dinner together.

429
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,980
I can't. I have an appointment with Salmon.

430
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,500
Oh, yes.

431
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,000
Oh, it hurts.

432
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Don't cry, Sam.

433
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,880
Are you bothering me?

434
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,360
Huh, what did you say?

435
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,040
Don't make me hate you even more.

436
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,720
Mind your own business

437
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,840
What took you so long to show up?

438
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,960
You told me to come and still
said bad things happened to me.

439
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,020
Can you behave yourself?

440
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,020
This is my request.

441
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:24,160
Follow the club rules so
there won't be any problems.

442
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,160
And it's not a burden on the coach.

443
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,080
Is this all you're asking for?

444
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,500
Yes.

445
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,680
And the coach wants to talk to you.

446
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,680
Go talk to him too.

447
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,720
And what happened to Tong and Boy?

448
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,140
They need to be punished , and so do you.

449
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,840
Please behave well

450
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,280
If they don't bother me again.

451
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,700
Hello Zee,

452
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,700
Hello Salmon,

453
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,080
Wanna go have dinner together?

454
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,740
You want to go outside?

455
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,740
Yes, I'm bored.

456
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,900
Okay, which restaurant
do you want to go to?

457
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,900
There are restaurants nearby.

458
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,980
Oh, around here?

459
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,100
Oh, there's an interesting restaurant.
I'll share the location with you.

460
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,660
OK.

461
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,860
Uh, but I'm busy doing a report.

462
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,820
You will go together. Or
are you heading there first?

463
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,100
We can meet at the restaurant.

464
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,360
Okay, then I'll finish my
report and I'll catch up quickly.

465
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,900
See you.

466
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,700
Hello, Where are you?

467
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
I'm outside

468
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,880
Hey, what?

469
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,340
Well, you're late,

470
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,340
So I'll go wait at the restaurant.

471
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,900
Okay, OK, I'll change my clothes.
I'll catch up quickly.

472
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,760
Yes!

473
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,340
See you.

474
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,820
Park here.

475
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,220
How much?

476
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,180
Thirty baht.

477
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,980
Can i transfer money via phone?

478
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,860
Yes.

479
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,960
OK.

480
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,120
Thank You.

481
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,020
How much?

482
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,320
Forty baht.

483
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,980
Where is my wallet?

484
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,980
It was still here

485
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,740
or it got lost while I was on the scooter.

486
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,780
Hey, is he Sprite or not?

487
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,960
Let me see.

488
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,960
Hey, that's right. Their
faces are exactly the same.

489
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,260
Tong said he likes
coming to restaurants here.

490
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,260
I don't think it's wrong.

491
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,940
Get him! What the fuck are you waiting for?

492
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,900
This isn't funny.

493
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,540
It was still here .

494
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,420
Hey!

495
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,520
Sorry, I didn't look.

496
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,760
So why don't you look carefully?

497
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,400
What are you looking at?

498
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,620
I'm looking at the coach's beloved child.

499
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,860
Am I the coach's beloved child?

500
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,860
So who are you?

501
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,320
Hey!!

502
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,860
Hey! Go ahead.

503
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,800
Break his leg.

504
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,820
You.

505
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,920
Are you alive?

506
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,900
You.

507
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,040
You.

508
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,000
Zee!!

509
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,280
(Next Episode)
What happened to Zee?

510
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,280
Come on, what happened?

511
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:10,980
Zee.

512
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,440
Sorry, coach.

513
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,560
Coach, what did you say?

514
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,560
Coach's beloved child? Are
you listen to him carefully?

515
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,940
It's such a relief to eat that much.

516
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,900
You used your privilege to
sneak out and play around

517
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,220
Why did you come here?

518
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,220
I'm going to bed now.
