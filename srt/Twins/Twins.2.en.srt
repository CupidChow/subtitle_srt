1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,375
Is it good?

2
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:11,400
Yeah.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,500
But us leaving the house...

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Are you scared Mom will scold you?

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,280
We'll only be out for a short while.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,460
Mom won't find out.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,100
What if she does, Sprite?

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,480
She won't. How will she know?

9
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:30,105
Come on, Zee.
Let's go play with Salmon.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,480
But...

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,780
Fine. If she finds out,
I'll take the responsibility.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,520
I will.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,300
What do you want to play today?

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,520
Let's ask Salmon.

15
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:54,609
Do you want to play with robots?

16
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:57,132
- Hey, be nice.
- Do you want to play with robots?

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,660
Hey.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,180
The twins.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,900
You look so alike.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,900
Are you guys aliens?

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,040
Don't mess with us.

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,440
Zee.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,020
Hey.

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,480
I didn't do anything.
You fell on your own.

25
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,840
Zee.

26
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,400
(Twins)
(Episode 2)

27
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,640
Sprite, what happened to Zee?

28
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,580
Sprite.

29
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,760
Tell me what happened.

30
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,700
I saw him lying injured on the floor.

31
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,120
Is Zee all right?

32
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
Salmon.

33
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,680
What happened?

34
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,000
Sprite.

35
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,640
Where is Zee?

36
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,220
Zee was probably assaulted, Mom.

37
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,480
He was passed out when I saw him.

38
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,440
So I brought him to the hospital.

39
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,400
Who is related to Mr. Kantorn?

40
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
Me. I'm his mother.

41
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,280
The doctor would like to speak to you.

42
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,380
Please come this way.

43
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,280
The doctor said that Zee will need
2-3 months to recover.

44
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,960
Then he'll be back to normal.

45
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,940
I don't know what I should do
about his competition.

46
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,140
Does this mean

47
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,500
he will not be able to compete?

48
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,700
I guess.

49
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,640
What should we do?

50
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,680
This is something
Zee has been training for.

51
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,040
I don't want it
to turn out this way either.

52
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,340
But what else can we do?

53
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,840
If there's anything I can help with,

54
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,840
please let me know.

55
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,280
It's okay.

56
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,180
I'll take care of this.

57
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,720
Damn it. He wasn't hurt.

58
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,420
I thought you took care of this.

59
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,860
So what the fuck is this?

60
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,940
What the hell happened?

61
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,140
This is about Sprite, right?

62
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,100
Yeah.

63
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,520
I sent someone to beat him up.

64
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,180
You saw the photo. It was him.

65
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,560
Damn, I don't know.

66
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Did those guys trick us?

67
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,580
Damn it.

68
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:08,532
You guys are the bastards who did it.

69
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,780
You don't have any evidence,
how can you accuse us, Sprite?

70
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,280
You want evidence, huh?
I'm going to beat you up.

71
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,060
You want evidence, huh?

72
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,620
Stop it, Sprite.

73
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,660
Stop.

74
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,820
Hey. Let go of me.

75
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,240
Come here, Sprite.

76
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,180
Calm down. Damn it.

77
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,060
Where are you going?

78
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,760
Come with me.

79
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,680
I'm going to beat them up. Let go.

80
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,380
Come here.

81
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,380
Tan, I'm going to beat them up.
Let me go.

82
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,380
What the hell is wrong with you?

83
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,860
What the hell is wrong with you?

84
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,460
They tried hurt me first.

85
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,960
What did they do to you?

86
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,400
Tong and Boy sent someone to beat me up.

87
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,720
Damn it.

88
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,540
But why are you not hurt?

89
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,200
I wasn't the one who got beaten up.

90
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,560
That's why I'm stressed.

91
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,680
Who then?

92
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,060
My twin.

93
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,660
Huh?

94
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,200
You have a twin?

95
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,040
Yeah.

96
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,200
This is a surprise to me.

97
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,660
How is your twin?

98
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,360
He is severely injured.

99
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,420
He has a volleyball competition
coming up.

100
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,440
I don't think he'll recover in time.

101
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,720
Mrs. Rin, it's me.

102
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,560
Hello, Coach.

103
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,340
I'm calling about Zee.

104
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,780
About Zee...

105
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,620
Okay.

106
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,560
Zee didn't come to practice yesterday.

107
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,220
I'm not sure if...

108
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,580
About yesterday...

109
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,980
He was with me.

110
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,440
We had a errand to run.
I'm sorry for not informing you.

111
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,440
Really?

112
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm just worried
that if he doesn't practice,

113
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
it will affect his tryout results.

114
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:48,580
It was an important errand.
I'm so sorry.

115
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,000
Sure, I shouldn't be worried about him.

116
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,980
I'm sure you understand

117
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,280
that if he misses his practice sessions,
his chances of getting chosen

118
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,640
will become lower.

119
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,680
It's not like that.

120
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,620
Thank you so much for caring about Zee.

121
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,120
No worries.

122
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,920
Thank you.

123
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,720
I also care about you, Mrs. Rin.

124
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,480
I need to go now.

125
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,940
Please take care of Zee.

126
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:20,460
Of course. Goodbye, Mrs. Rin.

127
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,460
Goodbye.

128
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,220
Yes, Mom.

129
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,700
Jack.

130
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,700
Come on. I'll help you with the armband.

131
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,800
Why would you do that?

132
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,040
Come on.

133
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,980
Stretch your arm.

134
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,360
Do you want something from me?

135
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
No, I don't.

136
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,400
I just want you.

137
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,400
Hey.

138
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,760
I just want you to pass me the ball.

139
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,960
Get lost.

140
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,960
I was kidding.

141
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,540
It was a joke.

142
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,720
Jack.

143
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,260
Do you know where Zee is?

144
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,820
I don't.

145
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,920
Coach said that he had an errand to run.

146
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,080
I think it's an excuse.

147
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,880
I agree.

148
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,780
What are you guys talking about?

149
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,340
Get up. Let's practice.

150
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,340
Is everyone here?

151
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,540
Besides Zee, we are all here.

152
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,400
Let's go.

153
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,760
Guys.

154
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,600
Let's start practicing.

155
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,720
- Okay.
- Okay.

156
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,860
Coach.

157
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
When will Zee be back?

158
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,940
I think he'll be back today.

159
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,120
Zee is here.

160
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,520
Damn it.

161
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,160
I'm sorry I'm late.

162
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,860
Is something wrong with him?

163
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,300
He knows how to apologize?

164
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,920
How amazing.

165
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Is the world coming to an end?

166
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,540
Just act normal and don't talk.

167
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,020
Stay calm.

168
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,760
Zee and Salmon. You're here.

169
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,620
Come practice.

170
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,480
Hey.

171
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,440
Hurry up.

172
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,240
Okay.

173
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:35,060
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

174
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,640
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

175
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,700
Switch.

176
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,040
Count. One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

177
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,180
Come on. Let's do this.

178
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,060
Come on.

179
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,300
Me.

180
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,840
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

181
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,040
Zee.

182
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Zee.

183
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,880
Do you want to practice with me?

184
00:15:19,905 --> 00:15:22,380
Sure, get the ball.

185
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,640
Hurry up.

186
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Go there.

187
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,720
Guys.

188
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,180
Have you divided yourself into teams?

189
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,180
Yes.

190
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,340
Go get ready.

191
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,840
Let's go.

192
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,700
Are you all right, Zee?

193
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,680
I feel sick, Coach.

194
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,740
May I take a break
and watch the others practice?

195
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,900
Go sit down.

196
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,980
Salmon.

197
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,580
Yes?

198
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,780
Take care of Zee.

199
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,780
Yes, Coach.

200
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,800
I don't know anyone. Who is who?

201
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Then listen carefully.

202
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
I'll introduce
every single one of them to you.

203
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,340
Let's start with

204
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,460
the Outside Hitter on the left.

205
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,600
He's First.

206
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,240
He's the Outside Hitter.

207
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,240
I'll repeat that. Outside Hitter.

208
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,820
The one behind First

209
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,780
is Mike.

210
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,940
He's on the right.

211
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
He's the Opposite Hitter.

212
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,200
The middle one who's next to First

213
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,340
is Deddeaw.

214
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,700
His position

215
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,700
is the Middle Blocker.

216
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,200
The one on the right

217
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
who passes the ball to the others

218
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,760
is Jack.

219
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,060
He's the Setter.

220
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,280
That's his position.

221
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,960
Jack is the captain.

222
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,580
Captain?

223
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,360
So many people.
I can't remember all of them.

224
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,440
What about the one behind?

225
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
The one who's wearing
a different pair of shorts.

226
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,660
That is Sam.

227
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,080
He's the Libero.

228
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,920
The Libero.

229
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,460
He can't play in front.

230
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,560
Libero.

231
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,800
Yeah.

232
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,240
Sam is the youngest in the team.

233
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,320
There's one more.

234
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,740
Tom.

235
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,740
Do you see the guy who ties his hair?

236
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,000
Tom plays the position

237
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
of the Middle Blocker.

238
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,600
Tom has been on the team
before you have.

239
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,220
He was probably on the team
when Zee started getting serious.

240
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,320
The rest are substitutes.

241
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,220
You don't remember, do you?

242
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,600
I'll send you a text to remind you.

243
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,520
Just try to remember their faces.

244
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,940
What position does Zee play?

245
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,860
Zee?

246
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,420
Zee and First play the same position.

247
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,420
They're both Outside Hitters.

248
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,880
Outside Hitters.

249
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,580
Yeah.

250
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,640
Who is Zee closest to on the team?

251
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,880
No one?

252
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,320
Yeah.

253
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,420
Besides me,
Zee doesn't talk to anyone else.

254
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,420
Huh?

255
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,420
He doesn't have any friends?

256
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,020
Damn it. How was he living his life?

257
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,100
This is good.

258
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,320
You twins are so different.

259
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,300
Why?

260
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Zee doesn't eat fried food.

261
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,960
That's up to him.

262
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,060
He doesn't know what's good.

263
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,560
Here, try it.

264
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,100
Do you want me to get fat?

265
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,560
It's really good.

266
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,920
Fine.

267
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,220
First.

268
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,760
Why did you stop walking?

269
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,760
First.

270
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,680
What's the matter?

271
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,440
You seem to have a great appetite.

272
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,180
You must be so comfortable
with skipping practice to go have fun.

273
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,400
What are you staring at?

274
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,140
At Coach's favorite player.

275
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,024
I'm his favorite player?

276
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:30,207
This is the guy who once told me
that I was Coach's favorite.

277
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,220
Have you met him before?

278
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,220
Yes, we bumped into each other once.

279
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,560
Why?

280
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:38,585
Did Zee have a problem with First?

281
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,620
Zee has many enemies.

282
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,520
Stop talking about this.
Meena is coming.

283
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,600
I didn't you know eat fried chicken.

284
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,000
I thought you didn't like it.

285
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,340
It's good. Do you want a bite?

286
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,426
Do you want it?

287
00:20:58,355 --> 00:20:59,267
It will make me fat.

288
00:21:23,372 --> 00:21:24,747
(Sprite: I have diarrhea, tell Coach)

289
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,060
Dad, I'll crash at Tan's for awhile.

290
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,380
Why? You have a home.
Why aren't you coming home?

291
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,560
Come on. I have diarrhea
and didn't make it to practice.

292
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,260
I already told Coach.

293
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,420
I'm not going to embarrass you.

294
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,680
I'm hanging up. My stomach hurts.
I need to use the bathroom.

295
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,120
Wait, Sprite.

296
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,400
Zee.

297
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,580
What are you doing here alone?

298
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,580
Nothing.

299
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,760
Let's go practice. Come on.

300
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
You're slacking, Sam.

301
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,640
This is all we have? Where is the rest?

302
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,360
Sprite said that he has diarrhea.

303
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,960
Att said that he has a fever, Coach.

304
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Then tell them

305
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
to get well soon.

306
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Come on. Let's practice.

307
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

308
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,460
Guys.

309
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,100
Based on our practice schedule,

310
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,160
we'll practice receiving the ball today.

311
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,960
Let's start with Zee.

312
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,480
You'll be the Attacker.

313
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,869
Zee.

314
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:04,960
Coach was calling you, Zee.

315
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,480
I'm sorry, Coach.

316
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,820
What did you say earlier?

317
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,880
Damn it.

318
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,680
Coach's favorite, listen carefully.

319
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,280
First, why don't you be the Attacker?

320
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,280
It's fine, Zee.

321
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,120
Stay focused.

322
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,080
Oh, dear.

323
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,120
Zee.

324
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,800
Come here.

325
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,480
What's going on?

326
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Are you worried about something?

327
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,360
I feel like I can't focus today, Coach.

328
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,980
I'm sorry.

329
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,400
Just be focused.

330
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,400
You don't need to apologize.

331
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,820
You seem off today.

332
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,100
Go practice.

333
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,080
Yes, Coach.

334
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,340
Why does he seem off today?

335
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,920
That's right. He usually plays very well.

336
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,460
Look at this.

337
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
What?

338
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,360
Did you see Zee?

339
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,260
His poses were so funny.

340
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,260
That's not it.
You must push your butt out.

341
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,860
Like this?

342
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,560
Yeah.

343
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,440
You guys keep finding faults with him.

344
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,140
Guys.

345
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,420
Don't you guys have bad days too?

346
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,720
Why are you making fun of Zee?

347
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,700
You're defending him.

348
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,320
Do you like him?

349
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,180
It's none of your business.

350
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,180
Huh?

351
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,980
None of my business?

352
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,800
I'm hungry. Let's go grab some food.

353
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,890
First.

354
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,020
What?

355
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,400
Can I ask you about Zee?

356
00:25:29,801 --> 00:25:30,880
No.

357
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,080
I just want to know
if Zee is sleeping at your place.

358
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,100
Not mine.

359
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,100
Huh?

360
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,100
Where is he sleeping at?

361
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,460
Probably with Coach.

362
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,160
He's really the favorite.

363
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
I'm so confused.

364
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,160
What does he think about us?

365
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,560
Let's calm down.

366
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,540
Zee probably has his reasons.

367
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,300
Calm down?

368
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,300
He's above us and doesn't want
to hang out with us, huh?

369
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Are you okay with that, First?

370
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,660
Hey.

371
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,320
What are you guys talking about?

372
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,200
About you.

373
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,010
I heard it. Let me join the conversation.

374
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,660
Don't worry, Zee.

375
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,660
We weren't criticizing you.

376
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,900
If you want to, just say it to me.

377
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,240
Don't talk behind my back.

378
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,240
Man up.

379
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,120
You're all right.

380
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
Damn it.

381
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Are you a pervert?

382
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,320
Bam, bam, bam.

383
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,040
Wait, hold on.

384
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,560
Do I have something on my face?

385
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,860
I'll wipe it off for you.

386
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,760
Go wash your hands first.

387
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,700
I thought I was going
to touch your face with them.

388
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,080
Touch your own face.

389
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,080
Are you sure?

390
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,140
Damn it. Are you a pervert?

391
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:23,047
My hands stink.

392
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,860
Are you all right, Sprite?

393
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,580
Zee.

394
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,120
I'm fine.

395
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,520
I had a chat with Auntie today.

396
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,300
She said that Zee wouldn't eat.

397
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,800
He's probably worried
about his injuries.

398
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,080
What should we do?

399
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,280
Go give him emotional support.

400
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,280
How?

401
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,940
You should go see him
at the hospital often.

402
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,080
Feed him food. I think he'll eat.

403
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,260
You're right.
I'll ask Coach for a leave to see him.

404
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
Thanks for the suggestion.

405
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,120
Coach Wit is calling.

406
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,040
You should head up, Sprite.

407
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
You should head up, Zee.

408
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
I have to go. Bye.

409
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Hello, Coach.

410
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Okay.

411
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,386
I know which building to go to,
but which room?

412
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,620
Tong. Tom.

413
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,380
Did you just call my name?

414
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,280
Do we sleep in the same room?

415
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,220
You're asking me?

416
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,680
Yeah, aren't you Tom?

417
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,280
I'm Jack.

418
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,440
I was a little confused.

419
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,440
So do we sleep in the same room?

420
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,660
No, aren't you sharing
a room with First?

421
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,540
Oh, right.

422
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,220
That's right. Thanks, Jack.

423
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,140
Come on. Let's go.

424
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,140
I'm Jack.

425
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,100
Why are you here?

426
00:30:32,462 --> 00:30:34,300
To sleep.

427
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,300
Is this my bed?

428
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,060
Don't mess with my stuff.

429
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,580
Where's my stuff?

430
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,580
It's not here.

431
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,220
So where is it?

432
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,480
Are you messing with me?
This isn't the first time.

433
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,680
Do you think I'm messing with you?

434
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,540
I'm not.

435
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,580
Honestly.

436
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,960
So why are you here?

437
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,380
I'm here to sleep.

438
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,220
Okay, I'm not supposed to sleep here.

439
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,160
Then please tell me

440
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,600
where my room is.

441
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,960
You asshole.

442
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,400
You really are messing with me.

443
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,240
Open the door, First.

444
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,240
Where am I supposed to go now?

445
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,120
I'm really not messing with you.

446
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,080
What is he up to?

447
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,940
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry for not telling you.

448
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:24,420
I almost got punched.

449
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,720
First thought I was messing with him.

450
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,160
But he hasn't found out, right?

451
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,220
No, but tell me.

452
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,220
Did Zee have a problem with First?

453
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,040
He really hates me.

454
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,320
Zee?

455
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,300
Zee didn't talk nicely to anyone.

456
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,300
That's it?

457
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,500
Are you sure?

458
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,160
That's not it.

459
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,400
He was too arrogant to share a room
and he talked shit about his teammates.

460
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,160
I'm not surprised he has no friends.

461
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,640
What was he thinking
sleeping with Coach Wit?

462
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,000
How was your sleep
with Coach last night?

463
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,820
Can I not sleep
with him anymore, Salmon?

464
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,180
I can't sneak out to practice jiujitsu.

465
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,580
Okay, then share a room with First.

466
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,120
Sharing a room with him is good.

467
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,320
If you can win his heart,
you can win the whole team's heart.

468
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,600
Because First is...

469
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Who's calling me?

470
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,060
Hello, Meena.

471
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,060
Okay, I'll head there now.

472
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,580
I have to go.

473
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,280
Go practice. Don't wait for me.

474
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,600
Win First's heart?

475
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,376
I need one more player.

476
00:34:18,845 --> 00:34:20,142
This one.

477
00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:24,267
One more player.

478
00:34:25,974 --> 00:34:27,005
Block right here.

479
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,400
Coach, hello.

480
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
What is it, Zee?

481
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,960
I have a favor to ask you, Coach.

482
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,520
I want to change my room.

483
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,220
You've moved in with me.

484
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,500
Is there a problem?

485
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,420
No, staying with you is great.

486
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:57,120
I've been practicing late,
so I don't want to bother you.

487
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,240
So I think it's better
for me to share a room with a teammate.

488
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
Huh?

489
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,460
But you have to move back in with First.

490
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,880
First.

491
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,400
First.

492
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,460
First, open the door.

493
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,082
First.

494
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,120
First.

495
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Why are you shouting, Zee?

496
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,140
I just want to go in my room.

497
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,180
First.

498
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,000
You opened the door.

499
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,209
Nothing's going on.

500
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Thanks for worrying.

501
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,180
Okay.

502
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,440
Why are you moving back in?

503
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,440
Come on.

504
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,400
Staying with a friend
is better than staying with Coach.

505
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,180
A friend?

506
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,780
Do you remember
what you said to me on the first day?

507
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,980
I don't. What did I say?

508
00:36:12,815 --> 00:36:14,255
Damn it, you asshole.

509
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,220
I'm not an asshole.
I really don't remember.

510
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,640
Why are you so mad at me, First?

511
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,580
Hey.

512
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,400
I'm not mad.

513
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,040
But I don't like you.

514
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,960
I'm sorry for making you dislike me.

515
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,240
But Coach wants me to stay here,
so that's what I need to do.

516
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,080
I'm fine staying here
even though you don't like me.

517
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,573
I'm okay.

518
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,140
If you don't move,
I'm going to carry you.

519
00:36:52,165 --> 00:36:54,640
What the hell are you doing?
Are you crazy?

520
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,120
I'm not crazy.
I'm just a bit of an asshole.

521
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,120
I don't care what you do.

522
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,620
But leave me out of it.

523
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,440
(Sprite: I'll go in
for practice tonight. Wait for me.)

524
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,820
(Tan: What time are you coming?)

525
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,720
(Sprite: A little late. 9-10 p.m.)

526
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,627
(Tan: So late)

527
00:37:57,112 --> 00:37:58,534
(Sprite: Don't complain)

528
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,660
What are you watching?

529
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,960
I forgot. We have to live together
even though we don't like each other.

530
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,869
Fine, I'll leave you alone.

531
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,940
First.

532
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,240
First.

533
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,080
Are you asleep?

534
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,080
First.

535
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,200
Are you asleep?

536
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,100
Damn it, Tan.

537
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,200
It hurts.

538
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,880
What the hell are you trying to do?

539
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,158
Tell me.

540
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,460
I'm practicing with you.
What do you want me to do?

541
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,460
Damn it, Tan.

542
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,080
Don't change the topic.
Where have you been?

543
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,600
You asked me to tell Coach you were sick
and now you want to practice at night.

544
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,800
What the hell are you up to, Sprite?

545
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,540
Tell me.

546
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,107
Ouch.

547
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,720
(Next Episode)
Ouch.

548
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,520
Don't make a sound.

549
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,740
What are you up to, Sprite?

550
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,240
You're hurting me.

551
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,240
Sprite?

552
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,520
I'm not him.

553
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,320
Are you Sprite's twin?

554
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Of course, I'm Zee.

555
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,060
Zee.

556
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,320
He's cute.

557
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,320
Huh? What?

558
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,460
Can I have your Line ID?

559
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:22,480
This is the first time since we've known
each other that you're close to me.

560
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,280
Do you like Zee?

561
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,100
I'm sleepy.

562
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,640
You can tell Coach.

563
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,440
I will. You don't need to tell me.

564
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,120
I think we should be friends.

565
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,660
Do you think Zee is acting strange?

566
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,560
He follows you everywhere you go.

567
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,100
It's almost like...

568
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,240
Like what?

569
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,200
I'm just wondering
if Zee has a crush on you.

570
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,780
Why are you doing this?

571
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,360
You're following me around
and staring at me.

572
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,360
Where are you going?

573
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,860
Move.

574
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,140
You're not going to move?

575
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,840
I will never be friends with you.

576
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,120
Stop messing with me.

577
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,380
Oh, no. I got caught.

578
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,500
Be careful.

579
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,280
I will make you my friend.
