[Bloody Romance]

18
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,540
City Master?

19
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,590
You're here?

20
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,260
City Master.

21
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,780
Did you need something from me?

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,290
Do you know where Chu Ten is?

23
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,710
Did he create trouble?

24
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,710
Your little pretty boy

25
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,100
has been secretly following the Torture Chamber Master lately.

26
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,070
Just now, he even snuck into his room to steal gu powder

27
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,170
and was caught red-handed.

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,080
City Master! I wouldn't dare to let him do that!

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,410
I can confront him!

30
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,070
Get up.

31
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,230
I don't understand why you're panicking. Why wouldn't I believe you?

32
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,550
It's just... you are his master.

33
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,910
What happens afterward...

34
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,930
I will let you do as you want, City Master.

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,050
Xing Feng! Let me out, you hear me?

36
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,170
We are all Shadows! Don't think you are better because you serve the City Master!

37
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,780
City Master just doesn't know that I'm the better one!

38
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,140
If she knew, she'd definitely let me take your place!

39
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,350
What else should I know about you?

40
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,800
City Master!

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,220
Xing Feng isn't trustworthy!

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,210
I saw him add a lot of mysterious gu powder

43
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,830
in the rouge he was making for you.

44
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,640
Oh? Really?

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,060
Indeed!

46
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,850
With one word from you, I can become your shadow!

47
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,970
I'd always be there for you. I'll follow your lead. City Master!

48
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,210
City Master! Look at me!

49
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,970
I'm young and handsome!

50
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,740
That means you snuck into Xing Feng's room

51
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,750
for me and not for Liu Guang?

52
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,700
Of course! In my heart,

53
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,510
how could that old hag, Liu Guang, compare with you?

54
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,480
Liu Guang has pretty good taste!

55
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,280
Looking at your pretty face, I am a little moved!

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,450
City Master! Take me as your shadow!

57
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,540
Then what about Liu Guang?

58
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,900
You only need to say one word for that!

59
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:06,120
You'd really go through fire for me?

60
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,230
I promise! I will go through fire to the death for you!

61
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,760
Very well.

62
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,800
Then go!

63
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,520
City Master!

64
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,540
This isn't what I meant!

65
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,710
Didn't you want to go through fire for me until your death?

66
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,410
Go on then!

67
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,380
No, City Master! This isn't what I meant!

68
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,700
You useless servant! How can you compare yourself with Xing Feng?

69
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,130
City Master!

70
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,910
City Master, spare me!

71
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,130
Your hypnotizing murder skills are indeed the best in the world.

72
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,510
Without your flame gu insect,

73
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,440
it wouldn't have worked so perfectly.

74
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,900
Liu Guang,

75
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,410
how long has it been since we last worked together?

76
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,300
Today's act made me remember the past. I really miss it.

77
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,180
Let's not talk about those matters of life and death. It's all in the past.

78
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,860
All right, let's not talk about them.

79
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,690
Then come and drink some alcohol with me.

80
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,510
Let's talk about choosing a new shadow for you, hmm?

81
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:14,360
Shadows need to be handsome and dignified.

82
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,140
He also needs a perfect bodily figure!

83
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,120
All right. This time, his name would be Chu Eleven, right?

84
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,670
Yes!

85
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,820
Then, let's go with Chu Eleven.

86
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,980
I will do as you say.

87
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,080
Chang An!

88
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,780
Chang An!

89
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,780
Chang An!

90
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,170
Chang An!

91
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,540
Chang An!

92
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,320
Chang An!

93
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,840
Younger Sister Mei.

94
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,160
Older Sister Wan Xiang.

95
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,330
You sure have a lot of spare time. You slept until now.

96
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,970
Where are you going now?

97
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,010
I'm looking for my shadow.

98
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,860
You...

99
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
don't know?

100
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,650
Know what?

101
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,460
Liu Guang's shadow has died. There is a stage set up at Chuixing Tower now.

102
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,870
It's for a martial arts competition to find her a new shadow.

103
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,550
Even my useless Er Yue went.

104
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,360
I saw your Chang An leave early in the morning. Now...

105
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,440
he should already be on the competition stage.

106
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,850
You are quite loyal. Learn from me.

107
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,010
Go out and admire the flowers, enjoy the sound of the birds.

108
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,300
After two to four hours,

109
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,330
your Chang An will be back.

110
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,390
He won't come back anymore.

111
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,100
All the Shadows in Guihua City went.

112
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,710
Even if your Chang An wants to,

113
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,420
he doesn't have the ability to win.

114
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,750
Chang An isn't someone who likes being below others.

115
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,170
If he gets the chance to rise to the top,

116
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,340
he will give it his all.

117
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,950
Stop.

118
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,570
You've been sitting there for a long time, right?

119
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,630
This is my favorite place in Guihua City.

120
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,250
I was in a bad mood,

121
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,990
so I came to sit here.

122
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,060
The Shadow you are willing to give up your life for,

123
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,970
is now trying to become Liu Guang's new shadow.

124
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,930
You feel like he has abandoned you.

125
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,130
Miss Liu Guang rarely goes out to do missions.

126
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,120
If Chang An is able to be her shadow,

127
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,140
it'd be better for him.

128
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,750
Let's not talk about whether Chang An can win or not.

129
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,690
Let's just talk about you.

130
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,460
You are clearly unwilling,

131
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,950
yet you pretend to be a nice person.

132
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,010
Then what should I do?

133
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,630
Am I supposed to go to Chuixing Tower and stop him from competing?

134
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,680
At least you could first ask him!

135
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,820
Perhaps he'd be able to convince you.

136
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,040
Chang An must have his own reasons.

137
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,450
I shouldn't drag him down.

138
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,800
All right!

139
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,000
Since you trust him that much,

140
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,690
then you should really return and think about

141
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,300
how you can stop being his burden,

142
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,650
instead of sitting here and crying.

143
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,110
If you want to make your mark in Guihua City,

144
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,440
you must be capable enough

145
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,240
to have others submit to you.

146
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,060
Just like these gu fireflies.

147
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,490
If you are powerless,

148
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,580
you wouldn't be able to tame them.

149
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,670
Chang An to the stage!

150
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,680
Chang An wins! Ru Feng to the stage!

151
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:55,040

152
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,040
Chang An wins! Er Yue to the stage!

153
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,370
This shadow is quite a good fighter.

154
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,570
In looks...

155
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,610
He seems familiar.

156
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,930
He is Wan Mei's Shadow.

157
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,630
In Wan Mei's and Wan Xiang's Shadow competition,

158
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,000
wasn't he that boy who was so weak that he couldn't even raise his head?

159
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,270
Precisely.

160
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:10,520
This girl, despite other things, has a lot of luck.

161
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,770
If you like him, just take him.

162
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,570
We agreed on a martial arts competition.

163
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,980
We have to do as we said.

164
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,690
No matter how close we are,

165
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,830
I cannot allow you to break the rules for me.

166
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,580
You always think on my behalf.

167
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,550
Xing Feng!

168
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,790
Send a few more people up there. I want to test

169
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,330
how capable he really is.

170
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,570
Yes!

171
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,120
I'm tired from watching all day.

172
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,870
Since you like him, then let's speed it up.

173
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,980
Let's see if he has the right to become your shadow.

174
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,110
Good! Well fought!

175
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:12,410
Starting from today, you will be Supreme Assassin Liu Guang's shadow.

176
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,410
From now on, your name will be Chu Eleven.

177
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,040
Work well. Don't disappoint me.

178
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,150
I have a request!

179
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,170
City Master, I hope you will fulfill it!

180
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,410
- Speak!
- I know I am not worthy of being a Supreme Assassin's shadow.

181
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,210
I came to this competition for my master, Wan Mei.

182
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,290
Last time while carrying out a mission, Master Mei was soft-hearted

183
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,530
and didn't kill Shen Mo. It was a big crime.

184
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,450
But now Master Mei wishes to make up for her past mistakes. I hope that you, City Master,

185
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,390
will give her another chance.

186
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,390
Since you won,

187
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,870
I will let you choose one more time.

188
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,700
You either become Liu Guang's shadow,

189
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,310
or...

190
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,840
I will strip of your skin and make it into a lantern!

191
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,220
I beg you, City Master, to give Master Mei one more chance!

192
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,190
Foolish bastard!

193
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,650
Men!

194
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,540
Wait!

195
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,470
City Master, it is good to be loyal.

196
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,790
If he is not willing to follow me, I will not force him.

197
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,020
Shadows can be chosen again, but I must get rid of

198
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,870
this ungrateful bastard!

199
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,560
- City Master--
- He's just a shadow!

200
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,290
Do you need to care so much?

201
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,680
He...

202
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,830
is handsome!

203
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,910
Fine. Since Miss Liu Guang begged mercy for you,

204
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,690
I will spare you.

205
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,210
Go back!

206
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,030
City Master!

207
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,400
City Master, please give me one more chance!

208
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,690
City Master.

209
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,710
How about we give them the new mission we received a few days ago?

210
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,090
I surely will not disappoint you and finish the mission!

211
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,710
If I fail again, may I die a horrible death!

212
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,020
Since you two are so sincere,

213
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,720
how can I refuse?

214
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,930
[Kill Han Xiu during the last few days of December in the twelfth year of Tianyou]

215
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,970
Your Majesty.

216
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,630
Your Majesty, Grand Tutor Yue is requesting an audience.

217
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,170
- Have him come in.
- Yes.

218
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:28,550
Summon Grand Tutor Yue into the palace!

219
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,700
You deserved to die.

220
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,250
Greetings, Your Majesty.

221
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,400
Rise, Grand Tutor.

222
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,330
Thank you, Your Majesty.

223
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,640
I awoke in fear for the second time last night.

224
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,700
Before I had a chance to call for someone, she was there waiting by my bedside.

225
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,720
Since this palace maid is suspicious,

226
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,160
we cannot neglect it. Your Majesty is very clear-sighted.

227
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,290
It is our glory and luck.

228
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,990
You are indeed on my side. It sounds nice even when you are fawning over me.

229
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,410
These words were spoken from the heart.

230
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,660
That's enough, Grand Tutor. Tell me.

231
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,900
Why did you come into the palace in such a hurry?

232
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,680
A spy came to report that Prince Ning, Li Siyuan, has been doing many things lately.

233
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,980
He has not been staying in his place.

234
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,180
Prince Ning?

235
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:50,460
Recently Prince Ning has been living like a hermit. There's no need to worry about him.

236
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,210
Grand Tutor,

237
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,120
you are too focused on him.

238
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,990
Maybe his 'living like a hermit' is actually him biding his time.

239
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,510
I am quite suspicious of him.

240
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,190
Then in your opinion,

241
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,890
what should I do?

242
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:18,390
Kill him like this palace maid?

243
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,710
Grand Tutor, he is my older brother.

244
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,910
He is also the famous Grand Protector,

245
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,960
who was promoted personally by the previous king.

246
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,120
I have tracked down Prince Ning's wet nurse.

247
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,980
If you believe me, then let me test him.

248
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,930
Summon Prince Ning to the palace to see the King!

249
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,460
Greetings, Prince Ning.

250
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,700
The moon is beautiful tonight.

251
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,840
His Majesty and the Grand Tutor are waiting in Hanlian Pavilion to have tea with you.

252
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,410
I will... lead the way.

253
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,600
Thank you, Eunuch.

254
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,440
This way, Your Highness.

255
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,260
Only you, Grand Tutor, are not afraid to block my moves.

256
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,700
You must be the most forthright man in our times.

257
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,570
Your Majesty had a great game plan set up. If not for you undervaluing me,

258
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,390
how could such a humble person as myself rise to this position?

259
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,630
Your words seem to have a deeper meaning.

260
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,220
Prince Ning has hidden himself away for so many years.

261
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,370
Your Majesty, you have already lowered your guard against him.

262
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,030
He's a blind man!

263
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,810
Although he was talented in the military as a youth,

264
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:14,340
he's useless now. You do not need to worry so much about him.

265
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,010
Your Majesty, don't you think that his sudden illness in the past

266
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,920
was a little too coincidental?

267
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,540
Yes.

268
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,750
The court was a mess then.

269
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,860
If he hadn't suddenly ended up blind,

270
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,980
I wouldn't have let him live until today.

271
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,920
So, I've always had a suspicion,

272
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,980
as to whether or not he is truly blind!

273
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,310
If he was pretending to be blind, he'd be leaning on a stick

274
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,390
or getting someone to support him.

275
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,470
Prince Ning is not that stupid.

276
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:05,120
So, I have always been guarded against him.

277
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,220
This way please, Your Highness.

278
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,580
Oh, I deserve to die! It's all my fault!

279
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,780
It's not your fault, Eunuch Yu. I'm just a useless blind man.

280
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,420
- We will arrive up ahead?
- Yes. Is Your Highness injured?

281
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,970
I'm fine.

282
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:40,120
Your Majesty, Prince Ning is here.

283
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,190
Greetings, Your Majesty.

284
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:05,070
Prince Ning, the King prepared tea

285
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,750
and has been waiting for you.

286
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,450
Your Majesty, sorry to make you wait.

287
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,800
Is someone else coming?

288
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,820
You are in luck today.

289
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,780
The King sent someone to go fishing.

290
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,490
Fish are the fattiest and most delicious in winter.

291
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,540
His Majesty wants you to enjoy it with him.

292
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,230
Then I am in luck.

293
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,790
I love eating fish.

294
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,290
Thank you, Your Majesty.

295
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,820
What is that sound?

296
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,540
If you want to taste fresh fish, you must kill it while it lives.

297
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,460
I am too ignorant.

298
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,710
Your Highness.

299
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,100
What is it? Proceed.

300
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,550
Grand Tutor, you must be joking.

301
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:38,070
With His Majesty here, I have no right to give the order.

302
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,520
It's fine with me.

303
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,400
Prince Ning is our guest today after all.

304
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,920
All right, then I will go ahead.

305
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,080
Carry on.

306
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,100
Proceed!

307
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,870
This fish is moving about quite a lot.

308
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,730
It must be quite large.

309
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,600
Your Highness came to visit today.

310
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,330
Of course, a big fish must be chosen.

311
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,610
Your Majesty,

312
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,260
I thank you.

313
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,270
An infant baby

314
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,590
had a mother who refused to leave his side.

315
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,890
Countless numbers of battles.

316
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,850
The gratitude for her love and care cannot be forgotten.

317
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,770
He tied up his hair and set off.

318
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,680
The youth had a clear goal

319
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,080
to wait until he had made a name for himself

320
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,150
and then return to avenge his mother.

321
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,710
Your Majesty, the fish soup is ready.

322
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,810
Your Majesty.

323
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,830
Grand Tutor.

324
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,500
Your Highness.

325
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,160
Please enjoy.

326
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,680
Thank you, Eunuch Yu.

327
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,800
[Tingzhu Courtyard]

328
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,530
Gong Zi,

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,900
this is the five-flavor stew I made for you,

330
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,140
both nourishing and calming.

331
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,320
You haven't eaten since you came back from the palace. You need some nourishment.

332
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,170
Gong Zi, what's wrong?

333
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,030
Are you feeling ill again?

334
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,650
I'll go get medicine!

335
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,690
There's no need.

336
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,350
In the past... In the past, I asked you

337
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,570
to investigate something in the Xuanji Palace in Nanjiang.

338
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,220
Go and reinvestigate it right away!

339
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,920
But Gong Zi...

340
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,880
I'm fine.

341
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,170
I'm fine!

342
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,910
Even if I cannot live for long,

343
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,290
I must find a way

344
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,730
to have Yu Qingya

345
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,610
die before I do!

346
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,570
In the city of Jinling,

347
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,420
a net was slowly closing over the grand merchant,

348
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,440
Han Xiu.

349
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,560
Han Xiu is very wealthy.

350
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,870
It's said he started a business selling salt and got rich overnight.

351
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:41,090
Now, even the great Liang's military eats his food.

352
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:46,180
However, a rich merchant like him is actually an adoring husband.

353
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,130
[Target: Han Xiu]

354
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,130
[Age: 35]

355
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,130
[Title: Salt Magnate]

356
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,130
[Description: Seeks money, political power, and land]

357
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,710
[Difficulty: 3.5 out of 5 stars]

358
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:00,470
Here's the duck-blood noodles, enjoy!

359
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,890
It's so rare for Young Sir Zhang to come here and all you can treat him to is street food?

360
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,000
What's wrong with street food?

361
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,520
Your sister-in-law loves eating street food.

362
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,860
Older Brother, stop showing off your love for your wife in public.

363
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,020
I might be used to it,

364
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:20,040
but Young Sir Zhang is still unmarried. He might not be able to take it.

365
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,550
The whole world knows that Minister Han loves his wife dearly.

366
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,850
All I can do is envy him.

367
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,380
After we finish eating, let's go somewhere

368
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,340
to have some wine and listen to some music?

369
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,600
In that case, why are we still eating? Let's go now!

370
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,750
Let's go! I'll take you somewhere with great wine and great food.

371
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,470
The hardest part about killing Han Xiu, isn't Han Xiu himself.

372
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,510
It's his younger brother, Han Yue.

373
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,040
He has been training with swords since he was a child and is quick on his feet.

374
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,470
But most of all, he worships his brother, so he practically never leaves his side.

375
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,770
He was the same person who barged into Shen Manor's medicine room

376
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,670
and ruined our plans.

377
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,230
Young Sir Zhang, this way, please.

378
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,010
Let's go!

379
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,590
The place I talked about is here.

380
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,380
Jinfeng House. There's a girl here called Xu Ruxian.

381
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,220
She's beautiful and dances better than anyone else.

382
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,350
Or we could go to that building over there, Yixiang Hall.

383
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:15,980
It's plain but refined. Best for if we just want to drink wine and talk.

384
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,210
Brother Zhang, which one do you want to go to?

385
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,010
I heard there's a place here called Xiangfen Pavillion.

386
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,120
They have the best Nüerhong wine in the city. It's been matured for twenty years.

387
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,270
You can't buy it anywhere else, although no one is sure if this is true or not.

388
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,500
How could I forget about Xiangfen Pavillion?

389
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,050
I guarantee you haven't heard

390
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,490
the song that their girl, Mu Dan, sings.

391
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,460
I'll take you there.

392
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,710
Madam Xu,

393
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,490
can't we hear something more refined?

394
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,710
Stop playing, get back inside.

395
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:29,020
