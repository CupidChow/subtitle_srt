[Bloody Romance]
[Episode 35]

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,090
Could a letter written in blood really make Chang An abandon so many men?

18
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,060
Before I left, Wan Mei solemnly told me

19
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,420
if she ran into difficulty, her shadow

20
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,310
definitely wouldn't just sit by and watch.

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Xie family's successive generations of ancestors above,

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,170
today you have an unfilial descendant, Xie Huan. Previously, I made a promise to someone.

23
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,200
Now I must temporarily leave Fengming Mountain to go rescue her.

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,670
With this action, I will let down my royal blood,

25
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,980
let down the kindness of my ancestors, and even more let down the common people.

26
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,560
I apologize for this.

27
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:51,420
King of Chu! King of Chu! King of Chu!

28
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,660
This is my first order.

29
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,460
It is difficult, but everyone must carry it out one hundred percent.

30
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:07,020
Only in this way will the Wu land have a gleam of hope.

31
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,170
The smell of this incense is simple and elegant. It penetrates my heart.

32
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,290
Even my headaches are a lot better.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,620
Miss Wan Xiang, your fragrance indeed lives up to its reputation.

34
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,830
Thank you, City Master.

35
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,520
It's just that lately I haven't been sleeping well.

36
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,220
There's something I've thought about over and over but still don't understand.

37
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,080
I'd like to trouble you to give me an answer.

38
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,420
I will say all I know without reserve.

39
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:55,260
I remember you and Wan Mei entered the city at the same time.

40
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,230
Moreover, you are sworn enemies. Are you not?

41
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,940
Yes.

42
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,270
She stole your position as Supreme Assassin.

43
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,400
You must really hate her. Do you not?

44
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,190
Yes.

45
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,610
Then this is strange. That day at the Bi'an Chamber,

46
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,960
why did you kneel down and plead mercy for her?

47
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,020
I was temporarily confused.

48
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,590
Raise your head and look at me while talking.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,780
Answer me again what I just asked you.

50
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,720
Master Mei! Master Mei!

51
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,150
Master Mei, something happened to Master Xiang!

52
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:02,200
City Master will not let her off! I'm begging you to save her! Please, save her!

53
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,540
Have you determined if that is a bone from Cha Wu?

54
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,430
I can't be sure.

55
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,160
You're scared to even recognize your own mother's bones?

56
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,610
That's ridiculous.

57
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,310
Cha Wu isn't my mother.

58
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,350
If she were my mother, how could I kill her with my own hands?

59
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,730
Oh? Really?

60
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,850
But at Chuixing Tower, when faced with my colored glass eye,

61
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,120
this isn't what you said.

62
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,820
You said that your mother recognized you in the middle of your fight,

63
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,680
so she let you off and sacrificed herself.

64
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,820
I was talking nonsense.

65
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,910
Consider yourself lucky.

66
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,830
I think this is really your mother's leg bone.

67
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,420
Take a look. This sword scar on here

68
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,390
is precisely what she received

69
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,320
on her mission to Jinling seven years ago.

70
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,450
If you really want to prove that Cha Wu isn't your mother,

71
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,240
break this leg bone,

72
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,960
crush it into dust, and I will believe you.

73
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,720
Break it.

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,560
How useless you are.

75
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,980
Do you want to die?

76
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,890
It's not that easy.

77
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,730
Even if Cha Wu was my mother

78
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,660
she sacrificed herself to save me! How is that wrong?

79
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,560
What have I done wrong?

80
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,360
You have a lot of nerve! You and your mother deceived me!

81
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,650
And you go so far as to ask me what you did wrong?

82
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,060
I won't give in! I won't give in!

83
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,500
There's no use in not giving in!

84
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,180
Unless you mistakenly think that I'll allow you to defend yourself?

85
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,090
Unless you mistakenly think that with your usual behavior,

86
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,190
somebody here will stand

87
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,610
and speak up for you?

88
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,620
Do you see there's no one? That's really amusing.

89
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,150
Wan Xiang, that's the bone of an arm.

90
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,560
City Master is deceiving you.

91
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,910
Wan Xiang came to Guihua City to look for her parents. That's human nature.

92
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,030
Cha Wu sacrificed herself for her daughter.

93
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,270
That is also right and proper.

94
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,760
Besides, Guihua City has existed for a hundred years.

95
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,820
There's a rule, that even if you are the City Master,

96
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,160
you can't decide everything on your own and you can't wantonly take any rash actions.

97
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:00,430
Miss Wan Mei, with what status are you standing there,

98
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,580
saying those words to me?

99
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,070
I, Supreme Assassin Wan Mei, give up my sword to demonstrate my sincerity.

100
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,980
To the 13th City Master Cha Luo,

101
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,590
I issue a challenge.

102
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,250
Formerly in Guihua City, you were as small as the shadow of an ant.

103
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,950
Lately, however, you've become the King of Chu.

104
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,300
Even after a short absence, people change and should be judged anew. Congratulations.

105
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,160
So that blood letter was your congratulatory gift

106
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,390
to purposely make me leave and to profit from my misfortune?

107
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,690
It's true that Wan Mei is in difficulty. His Majesty has already issued an decree

108
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,820
giving Cha Luo complete authority over Guihua City.

109
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,530
If I were to get involved at this time, I would be defying an Imperial edict.

110
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,730
You calculated correctly that I would leave.

111
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,500
Your affection for her was enough to make you choose honor over your life.

112
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,980
In addition, Wan Mei is trapped in this difficulty

113
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,320
because of you.

114
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,860
Do you realize that if I turn around and go back now,

115
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,950
I can ruin your plans?

116
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,030
But have you thought about

117
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,460
that I especially waited for you on the route you'd take

118
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,030
just to take advantage of the time you'd hesitate

119
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,370
and kill you with my sword?

120
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,190
Two years ago in the Bi'an Chamber, you used your sword against me.

121
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,960
You must know that you still don't measure up to me.

122
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,930
How would you know that back then, I didn't hold back?

123
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,440
It's meaningless for the two of us to fight each other. It would be better for you to disband your soldiers.

124
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,030
So that you can go back to the court and say the Jiang City rebel army has retreated

125
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,550
and be rewarded for merit you don't deserve?

126
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,410
Even though Jiang City's location is good, the Liang Army is always glaring like a tiger just watching its prey.

127
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,590
You will eventually be attacked from the front and the rear.

128
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,620
So you and I should set up a trap and annihilate the Liang Army?

129
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,580
I've already taken the appropriate measures.

130
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,060
Gong Zi, you have military power only because of these troubled times.

131
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,630
If the world were at peace, what use would you be to the King of Jin?

132
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:46,810
Even apart from you, Great Liang is still around.

133
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,180
The countries of Liang and Jin have been poised to fight for a long time. They are evenly matched.

134
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,610
At any time, they might convert to being friends. At that time, I and my independent soldiers,

135
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,360
would most probably become your biggest asset.

136
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,800
Why should I believe you?

137
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,850
I swear on Wan Mei's life,

138
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,830
that my words are worth a thousand gold.

139
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,920
I've carefully thought it through. Even if they hadn't removed my gu blood insects,

140
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,130
I'm definitely not a match for City Master.

141
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,700
So this battle can't just depend on martial arts ability.

142
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,750
I must use every trick.

143
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,810
What trick are you referring to?

144
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,870
I need a type of poison. Extremely poisonous.

145
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,740
After taking it, it will flare up in the time it takes to drink a cup of tea.

146
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,080
It must travel both through the entire body and the bloodstream, where it will dissolve.

147
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,410
There is such poison, but the taste of powerful poisons

148
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,640
are very strong. Lately, City Master has been very careful. You won't have any opportunity.

149
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,790
It's not for the City Master to eat.

150
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,340
Before the battle, I will take the poison myself. At the time of the competition,

151
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,580
I'll wound the City Master with my sword.

152
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,790
Using my own blood as poison, I'll dissolve it into her wound.

153
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,430
I'll force her into death.

154
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,480
You can't! If that's the case, I absolutely won't give you the poison. There must be another way.

155
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,590
You know that... this is the best way.

156
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,590
I should have died three years ago.

157
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,840
As of now, I've lived these extra thousand days and nights.

158
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,530
Even though there's a sense of loss, but I don't regret it.

159
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,940
City Master, you sent for me?

160
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,930
Your new shoes are very nice looking. Who made them for you?

161
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,350
I just received them from Jigu Pavilion.

162
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,230
Their appearance is so brightly colored.

163
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,610
Whoever made them was very diligent.

164
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,630
What have you summoned me here for?

165
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,450
Lately, I've had nothing to do,

166
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,350
so I prepared a present for you. Take a look.

167
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,540
How about it? This

168
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,360
is Guihua City's most skillful hand. Liu Yun's hand.

169
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,120
Do you like it?

170
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,960
City Master, you've gone too far!

171
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,870
This is Guihua City.

172
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,420
In Guihua City, I, Cha Luo, am justice.

173
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,350
I am God! If anyone dares to be my enemy,

174
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,170
I can chop her up into a pulp and feed her to the dogs.

175
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,730
All I did was chop off one of her hands.

176
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,760
I didn't kill her or take her life.

177
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,860
Where did I go too far?

178
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,890
Losing a hand makes her life worse than death. What more do you want?

179
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,780
Do you feel sorry for her?

180
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,610
It's just insignificant Liu Yun.

181
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,820
Is she that important to you?

182
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,090
Then I dare to ask you something.

183
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:10,380
Liu Yun never sets foot outside. What crime did she commit?

184
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,560
Coveting something that doesn't belong to her. That's her crime!

185
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,660
Think about Liu Guang. Liu Guang's friendship with you was like that,

186
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,620
but she never sent clothes to you!

187
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,390
That's because Liu Guang knew your temperament! She wouldn't dare!

188
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,990
Liu Guang didn't dare, but Liu Yun did dare!

189
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,690
City Master, Guihua City is like this today

190
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,620
- because of the old people's contributions.
- All right! That's enough!

191
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,420
What more do you want to say? That I neglect former ties?

192
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,960
Are you saying I'm venomous and heartless?

193
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,930
All right. Since that's the way it is, while she's still alive,

194
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,700
plead for her life.

195
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,000
Isn't that your favorite thing, pleading leniency for others?

219
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,590
Chang An!

220
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:56,000
♫  that you and I can listen to the rain
as we stand under the eave.  ♫

221
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,690
The day Gong Zi left Guihua City,

222
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,690
Cha Luo impatiently occupied this place.

223
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:16,810
After that, the first thing she did was look for an excuse

224
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:21,560
to call me to Chuixing Tower. She wanted me to die.

225
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,240
I argued strongly for what was right. Cha Luo was at a loss for words and made her move.

226
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,360
To my surprise, in front of City Master,

227
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,160
they all stood up and begged for leniency for me.

228
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,690
Even though Guihua City is dark, human feelings still dwell here.

229
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,920
They probably still remembered that you risked your life and went to the palace to ask for the royal decree

230
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,650
and saved every one of Guihua City.

231
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,200
But now among those, a lot have already died.

232
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,720
In the last few days,

233
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,270
the number of bodies thrown into the Rebirth Pool is much more than in the last few months.

234
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,350
The gu insects haven't had enough time to digest them all.

235
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,180
It's made the pool's water darker.

236
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,020
Yesterday evening, Cha Luo called Wan Xiang here.

237
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,360
She wanted her to break her mother's bones with her own hands

238
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,660
and grind them into dust.

239
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,600
I really couldn't watch.

240
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,570
At that time I used my position as Supreme Assassin

241
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,160
to issue a challenge to Cha Luo.

242
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,330
Wan Mei, you have no chance of succeeding.

243
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,720
Not necessarily. Cha Luo's king gu is biting her more and more frequently.

244
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,460
Her power has greatly decreased. I might have a chance.

245
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,770
But I won't let you take that risk.

246
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,770
These days while you were gone, I was able to manage things by myself.

247
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,850
It still won't do.

248
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,860
Leave with me first and wait until I organize a few things.

249
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,030
I'll bring men here to attack Guihua City.

250
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,410
But the people who pled for me can't wait for that day.

251
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,980
Chang An, I'm the same as them.

252
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,940
We're just pitiful people in this chaotic world.

253
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,230
I can't just stand and watch them die for me.

254
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,650
Wan Mei, I didn't abandon Jiang City's troops

255
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,600
to return to Guihua City

256
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,210
and watch you go to your death.

257
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,750
Chang An, believe me. I do have a chance.

258
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,990
You also know that I have an obstinate temperament.

259
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,770
If you make me abandon them and leave by myself

260
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,630
then I would rather go to my death.

261
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:54,720
Subtitles and Timing brought to you
by the Bloody Romantics @viki.com

262
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,330
You rushed back here. When was the last time you slept?

263
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,770
Three or four days ago. It's not too bad.

264
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,200
How can you call three or four days of riding not too bad?

265
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,970
Don't keep staring at me.

266
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,370
Hurry and lie down to rest for a while.

267
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,890
Then I'll rest for as long as it takes to drink a cup of tea.
(approx. ten minutes)

268
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,150
I'll call you when it's daybreak.

269
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,370
Chang An, it's not that I want to deliberately deceive you,

270
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,590
but you've already lost too much because of me.

271
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,560
I don't want you to do anything for me again.

272
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,130
I have some instructions to pass on. I will leave after that.

273
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,940
Miss, please speak.

274
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,510
Chang An is back.

275
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,170
Then, does he know that you are prepared to consume poison to die together with City Master?

276
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,920
He doesn't know any of that.

277
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,550
I only said that I issued a challenge to City Master, and there'll be an all-out battle risking my life.

278
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,900
Then I gave him some medicine to allow him to sleep.

279
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,700
Earlier, you said that you had some instructions to pass on.

280
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,600
I presume they are concerning Chang An, too?

281
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,770
That's right.

282
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,760
Chang An's deep lethargic sleep will last for at least two days.

283
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,160
I will engage in battle with Cha Luo the day after tomorrow. Guihua City will definitely be in a state of unrest.

284
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,260
I want to ask you to take that opportunity to get Chang An away quickly.

285
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,400
Yes.

286
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,390
I will definitely carry out what has been entrusted to me.

287
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,570
When Chang An does wake up,

288
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,330
can I trouble you to pass a message on to him?

289
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,330
Tell him that

290
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,920
I am perfectly contented

291
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,280
that I could see him again

292
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,590
in this final hour.

293
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,750
In the future, as long as he is living well,

294
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,110
that will be the best way to cherish me.

295
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:38,460
♫  Worthy of the strength of character that you possess.  ♫

296
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:46,960
♫  Who will admit to defeat along this long and difficult road? I have already made up my mind to wander in the Jianghu realm.  ♫

297
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,500
♫ The loneliness of time past connected together
as music notes.  ♫

298
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,960
♫  Unintentionally and ambiguously passing through several places.  ♫

299

♫  A little small thought leads the way.  ♫

300

♫ Who will guess it, who will open it up?  ♫

301
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,900
♫  The cruelty of the long night leveled the concentration.  ♫

302
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,400
♫  I drink this cup of blessing voluntarily.  ♫

303
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,700
♫ So many times, one after another, in matchless despair.  ♫

304
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:29,000

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,170
You must live well.

309
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:07,670
♫  Who will admit to defeat along this long and difficult road? I have already made up my mind to wander in the Jianghu realm.  ♫

310
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:16,420
♫  That which ended in time past carved out loneliness. It's never been for either of us to betray the other.  ♫

311
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:25,190
♫  Except the sword in the hand dancing alone in the wind. It is still here, waiting.  ♫

312
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:33,900
♫  The dancing breeze in early spring brings with it temperature. The boundary which should not be crossed provokes envy.  ♫

313
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,220
♫  The crows and peacocks are in a place where it is silent.  ♫

314
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:46,830
♫  The way home is cut off, leaving behind loneliness.  ♫

315
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,490
♫ The loneliness of time past connected together
as music notes.  ♫

316
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,760
- Miss Wan Mei!
- What happened?

317
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,660
Your shadow, Chang An, snuck back into Guihua City and attempted to assassinate the City Master just now but failed.

318
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,040
City Master asked me to tell you--

319
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,740
Miss Wan Mei! Miss Wan Mei!

320
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,660
Miss Mei is here. I did not accuse your shadow falsely.

321
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,200
Even though he defected from Guihua City,

322
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,130
- he still hasn't given up his evil intentions.
- Why?

323
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,130
Cha Luo and I have a hostility that was imprinted from my entire family being exterminated.

324
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,810
This matter has nothing whatsoever to do with Master Mei.

325
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,830
Why did you come here courting death?

326
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:42,620
It took you long enough to get here. Fortunately, I had experts protecting me.

327
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,860
Otherwise, I wouldn't know how many times I would have died if I had waited for you.

328
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,270
I feel that his Master Mei and he are in this together.

329
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:05,300
He must have been afraid that his Master Mei would lose to me in the battle,

330
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,040
so he came to assassinate me on his own.

331
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,990
Definitely not!

332
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,110
It doesn't matter what you say anymore.

333
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:20,090
The only way to determine is to bring you to the torture chamber

334
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,080
to torment and torture you at length,

335
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,190
for you to tell the truth.

336
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,400
Isn't that right, Torture Chamber Master?

337
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,560
City Master, you are right. I will take him to the Torture Chamber now, to be rigorously interrogated.

338
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,070
But it appears that you

339
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,990
might be too lenient with this Chang An.

340
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,360
Why don't I send someone else?

341
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,260
There is no need. I will definitely not be lenient this time.

342
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,060
Take him away.

343
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,020
I earnestly beg City Master to advance the challenge.

344
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:07,700
Advance it? How soon should the advance be?

345
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,020
Now.

346
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,460
What do you treat this place as? Should it be changed just because you say so?

347
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,490
Or do you think that... Do you think that you can still defeat me,

348
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,570
when the gu blood insects have been extracted from your body,

349
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:32,000
and save your pitiful shadow?

350
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,130
I say it changes nothing.

351
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,910
You still have one more day and night.

352
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:47,930
Prepare very well for your last moments.

353
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,830
This golden hammer is small and heavy.

354
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,200
It was used to break walnuts for the City Master in the past.

355
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,360
Later, I will start from here

356
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,600
and break your bones piece by piece.

357
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:37,120
I will not miss even a single piece. The best outcome

358
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,130
is that you'll never walk again. Are you prepared?

359
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,240
I can't lose. I can't lose.

360
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,330
If I die together with Cha Luo,

361
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,350
Xing Feng will definitely not let Chang An off.

362
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,240
The moon is round today. Is the king gu insect

363
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,170
going to turn against City Master again?

364
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,130
Yes. Even though it is so,

365
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,820
your Master Mei still doesn't have any chance of winning.

366
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,360
If City Master wins,

367
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,360
Guihua City will really become a purgatory on earth.

368
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,830
There will be no more light from any star henceforth.

369
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,000
Even if City Master is no good in ten thousand ways,

370
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,030
she never let me down, so I definitely will not let her down, either.

371
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,760
That is not what is making you hesitate.

372
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,790
But rather, it's whether or not it is worth it for her

373
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,760
to live how she is currently living.

374
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:35,200
She has killed so many people and appears to have gained great fame,

375
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,470
but every step that she takes

376
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,740
is on the edge of a dagger.

377
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,400
She's having a very hard time and you know that.

378
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,470
Your saying all of this just because you hope that your master will live.

379
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,190
Not only is she my master,

380
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,560
she is the person whom I love.

381
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,270
It can be said that

382
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:12,130
she's the only person whom I care about in this world.

383
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,530
Of course, I hope that she will live.

384
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,880
Then why were you so stupid?

385
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,980
Why didn't you take her away secretly? Why must you walk right into the trap?

386
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:27,920
Wan Mei constantly thinks about everyone in Guihua City.

387
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,470
She is unwilling to leave.

388
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,600
I don't want her to be worried and troubled her entire life.

389
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,150
I thought about it for a long time and finally decided to gamble on it.

390
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:45,960
Unfortunately, you lost your gamble.

391
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,990
I didn't gamble on being successful in the assassination of Cha Luo.

392
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,200
Rather than that, I bet on you, Torture Chamber Master.

393
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,430
I will not betray City Master until the day I die.

394
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,970
Torture Chamber Master, you previously said that

395
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,700
as long as I was unswerving in my loyalty

396
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:28,760
toward my master, disregarding my life for her sake,

397
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,970
would you show us mercy and let us go.

398
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,430
Up to today, I've wanted to ask,

399
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,960
why did you say such things?

400
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:55,540
- Why? I don't know why.
- I know why.

401
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,590
Seeing me

402
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:04,240
reminds you of the person you were in the past.

403
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,070
In your heart, even though you are with Cha Luo,

404
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:13,400
living in such madness up until now, you're regretting it, too.

405
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,970
Even if you understand me, so what?

406
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,470
Even if I show you mercy, your Master Mei will still not be able to defeat City Master.

407
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,270
I have read the materials.

408
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:31,340
You once studied the Jiayi Mental Cultivation.

409
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,970
You know how to transmit power to other people.

410
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,030
You want to pass your internal power to Wan Mei?

411
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,340
That is right.

412
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,860
You are undergoing such severe punishment right now.

413
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,600
If you don't have your internal power to sustain you, you will die without a doubt.

414
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,330
If I don't do this,

415
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,830
how am I able to convince you, Torture Chamber Master?

416
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:06,340
After all, the condition that you set down, from the beginning, was that

417
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:11,760
I must disregard my own life for the sake of my master.

418
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,030
Have you thought about this before? Even if she receives your internal power,

419
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,460
Wan Mei still might not be able to win.

420
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,200
At least it will be fair.

421
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,460
If time could be turned back,

422
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,540
back to ten years ago,

423
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,330
when Cha Luo was not the Cha Luo of now,

424
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,430
and Guihua City was not a river of blood...

425
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,770
I, Chang An,

426
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,970
gambled on you, Torture Chamber Master,

427
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,960
that you also hope to see all those things again.

428
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:16,000
