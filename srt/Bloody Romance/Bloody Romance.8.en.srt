[Bloody Romance]

16
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,420
It seems that this yard has been left unattended for a long time.

17
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,740
I'll tidy it up.

18
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,260
You're injured. You'd better take a break.

19
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,390
Master, your finally have your own place.

20
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,720
I must clean it quickly,

21
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,990
in order not to delay your resting time.

22
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,620
I'm going to Yunjing Pavilion to pick up some things.

23
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,730
Master, do you want to come with me?

24
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,730
Master.

25
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,990
Are you still thinking about Han Xiu?

26
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,980
Han Xiu was willing to follow Shao Yao into death.

27
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,900
It had nothing to do with you.

28
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,530
He could have died in a different place

29
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,670
or at a different time,

30
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,510
but he still decided to kill himself in front of me,

31
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,110
which offered me a chance for survival.

32
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,050
You think that one more good person died because of you?

33
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,140
I don't know, either.

34
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,580
You are taking this too seriously.

35
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,990
That is

36
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,430
bad for you.

37
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,320
I was just thinking

38
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,170
that in the future, I need to repeatedly do what I just did.

39
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,300
What is it for?

40
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,430
If there are no other reasons,

41
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,320
other than for survival,

42
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,580
then I...

43
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,560
I'd rather die.

44
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,560
Do you really think

45
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,380
that you have the courage to commit suicide?

46
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,580
If the next mission is to kill another person, do me a favor

47
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,470
and kill me immediately.

48
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,840
Don't let me suffer here anymore.

49
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,170
[Suiguzi Pavilion]

50
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,630
Around the middle of every month, the King Gu Insect turns in you, increasing your qi and blood.

51
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,290
I know that you're in pain,

52
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,640
but the more you suffer,

53
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,330
the calmer you must be.

54
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,940
The full moon isn't until two more days,

55
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,000
but I've already felt disruptions in my qi today.

56
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,890
When others receive the king gu insect, they gain a century's worth of power.

57
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,620
Only I

58
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,370
have to endure such torment every month.

59
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,160
It's my fault.

60
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,820
That time when Cha Ru threatened

61
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,450
to expose our love relationship to Lan He,

62
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,910
I just didn't want to encumber you,

63
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,100
so I agreed to plant the anti-sex substance inside myself to show my resolution.

64
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,040
To my surprise, she also went to you

65
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,430
and imposed the condition of deactivating my anti-sex substance to trick you into planting that insect into your body.

66
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,410
It is not your fault.

67
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,170
It's the fault of Lan He, that evil woman.

68
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:14,740
If she hadn't incited me and Cha Ru to fight

69
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,960
which caused destruction to both me and her,

70
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,910
we wouldn't be like this right now.

71
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,860
She is the criminal.

72
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,890
As long as I, Cha Luo,

73
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,080
am still alive,

74
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,790
I will definitely do everything possible

75
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,410
to make Lan He's blind son

76
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,930
die a cruel death.

77
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,050
Oh, yes...

78
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,420
I forgot to tell you,

79
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,340
the person I sent out

80
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,840
has already found

81
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,180
a way to send news to the palace.

82
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,640
What?

83
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,030
Chang An!

84
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,590
It's late.

85
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,530
Master, you are still awake?

86
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,140
You haven't slept, either.

87
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,510
The Torture Chamber Master had another task for me.

88
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,730
Even though I don't really understand martial arts,

89
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,810
the technique you used just now to come down from the roof

90
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,950
is much better than the one you use during our missions.

91
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,950
Once you become a Heavenly Assassin, you will learn techniques a hundredfold stronger.

92
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,810
I couldn't sleep and only came out for some fresh air.

93
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,680
I thought this looked like a swing,

94
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,660
so I fixed it.

95
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,480
The lady who lived here before

96
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,840
liked to swing on this swing.

97
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,780
She swung so high.

98
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,580
Later someone sabotaged the swing.

99
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,870
She fell down,

100
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,310
hit her backbone, but didn't die immediately.

101
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,300
What happened to her?

102
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,130
Do you really want to know what happened to her?

103
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,780
It's getting late, Master.

104
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,590
Please rest soon.

105
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,210
Let me go! Put me down! Put me--

106
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,960
Are you crazy?

107
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,280
Yes.

108
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,280
I am crazy.

109
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,480
Why did you save me?

110
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,740
I really don't want to live anymore.

111
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,730
Ever since I was young,

112
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,910
so as not to burden my father

113
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,800
and to earn a bite of food for my younger brother,

114
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,070
beginning at six years old,

115
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,550
I went and picked cotton for people.

116
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,230
I picked until all ten of my fingers were ruined.

117
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,820
Later... Later in the chaos of war,

118
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,400
I couldn't find work, so I went and carried dead people

119
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,940
and buried their corpses.

120
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,660
But so what?

121
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,410
My father...

122
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,370
My father sold me for no more than two bags of grain.

123
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,050
Then I came here.

124
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,330
This place has white rice,

125
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,800
white flour, and water for showering heated up by charcoal.

126
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,930
It is like a place raised by gods.

127
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,320
But here, in order to survive,

128
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,140
I have to kill people.

129
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,290
I have to kill people without ever stopping.

130
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,930
I just can't do it! I can't!

131
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,120
But if I don't kill, I will die;

132
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,850
then sooner or later, I will die anyway.

133
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,900
So why should I keep fighting on here?

134
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,500
But still, you went through so much to get here.

135
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,560
Why does that matter?

136
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,980
In this world...

137
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,050
In this world, there is no one who cares about me.

138
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,120
I care about you.

139
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:51,120
You only care... because if I die,

140
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,820
you also have to die. But don't worry.

141
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,600
Liu Guang has already said that she likes you.

142
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,800
When I die,

143
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,170
you can become her shadow.

144
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,280
I won't become Liu Guang's shadow.

145
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,240
Today is your birthday.

146
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,590
I cooked longevity noodles for you.

147
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,560
They're in your room.

148
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,240
There's no meat right now, so I could only make vegetarian noodles for you.

149
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,140
You like your food salty, so I added some pickled vegetables.

150
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,970
You've starved too much in your life, so you have bad digestion

151
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,580
and you shouldn't eat too many peppers. I only added a little.

152
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,800
You're still young, so if you pay attention in the future, it can be cured.

153
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,970
Tasty!

154
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,650
This is the first time I've had longevity noodles in my life.

155
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,300
Tastes good!

156
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,010
You're only eighteen years old. It's not that you don't want to live,

157
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,110
you're just very tired.

158
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,220
It's all right if you're tired. All you have to do is rest.

159
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:06,270
There will be many more people who will care about you in the future, not just me.

160
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,660
Today is my birthday.

161
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,680
- I want to swing on the swing.
- Sure.

162
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,130
- I want to go behind the mountain to watch the setting sun.
- Good.

163
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,600
Is it that today,

164
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,640
no matter what I say,

165
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,290
you'll agree?

166
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,090
Yes, it is.

167
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,630
We...

168
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,550
Can we leave here?

169
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,010
Together.

170
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,690
Sure.

171
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,510
Come sit with me.

172
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,660
One time.

173
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,150
Just this one time.

174
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,930
Hold tight. It's dangerous.

175
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,250
With you here, I'm not afraid!

176
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,570
This feeling is great. It feels like we're flying!

177
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,220
Chang An,

178
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,890
why are you so nice to me?

179
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,790
Because...

180
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,490
Because you treat me well, Master.

181
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,790
So... What if I wasn't your master?

182
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,290
Would you still treat me this well?

183
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,650
I'm going to count to three. If it flies away,

184
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,240
you're just treating me with a false sense of affection.

185
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,490
If it doesn't fly away,

186
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,350
you are treating me sincerely.

187
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:11,190
One, two,

188
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,780
three.

189
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,760
In any case,

190
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,450
I won't betray you.

191
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,050
Hold on.

192
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,480
Next to the cliff is a pile of rocks.

193
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,580
A sheepskin bag is in the crack of the rocks.

194
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,820
There is a porcelain bottle with a pill in the sack.

195
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,690
Eat the pill and dive into the water after ten minutes.

196
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,220
This pill can help you hold your breath underwater

197
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,110
and stay conscious for a long time.

198
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,490
After you enter the water, you must dive as deep as possible.

199
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,380
Keep submerged until you can feel another current.

200
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,710
Then follow that current.

201
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,740
Why are they taking so long to bring it back?

202
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,300
City Master, Twelve's actions are swift. He should soon be back.

203
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,180
He is Twelve, you are Thirteen.

204
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,810
- You are both new here this month.
- Yes.

205
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,400
Speed up your movement!

206
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,930
You don't have to look at me like you've seen a ghost.

207
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,360
I've already promised the Torture Chamber Master

208
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,230
that I won't kill anyone this month.

209
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:28,480
This is the skin nourishing powder specially blended for me by the Torture Chamber Master.

210
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,810
Prepare and steep it for me according to the proper sequence.

211
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:35,640
Even if you can't do this right I won't kill you.

212
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,380
Skinning you alive will do.

213
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,840
You aren't Twelve!

214
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,570
Who are you?

215
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,590
Exactly, who are you?

216
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,820
Take off your skin mask.

217
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,410
City Master! Are you all right?

218
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,780
Light the smoke signal! Send out everyone! Chase after him!

219
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,410
Yes!

220
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,260
[Tingzhu Courtyard]

221
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,590
Who is it?

222
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,490
Come out.

223
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,480
Don't force me to make a move.

224
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,300
[Mei]

225
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,090
If you can read this letter, it means that you have already succeeded in leaving Guihua City.

226
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,840
In these next few days Guihua City will be in turmoil.

227
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,160
While they are distracted, use this opportunity to get away.

228
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,310
The landlady of the Fenglai Inn and I have known each other for a long time.

229
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,100
She can prepare a horse and rations for you and tell you

230
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,240
how to get out of the pass. You have to hurry.

231
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,050
No need to wait for me, remember that!

232
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,680
Guihua City is in turmoil? No need to wait?

233
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,720
Six hundred taels?

234
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,340
You're letting me escape by myself.

235
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,600
Even if I escape to the ends of the earth, won't it be meaningless?

236
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:20,060
I saw you once, at Chuixing Tower.

237
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,260
Cha Luo made you fight with another shadow.

238
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,910
You suffered a serious wound that day as well.

239
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:34,500
But I thought that you wouldn't necessarily lose.

240
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,310
I am just an Earthly Assassin's shadow.

241
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,120
You've overestimate me, Gong Zi.

242
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,560
When people are at a critical juncture,

243
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,960
they won't hide their actual strength.

244
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,330
When I brushed by you that day,

245
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,890
I noticed that your breathing pattern and internal power

246
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,260
are not that of Guihua City. Tell me.

247
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,670
What is your motive

248
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,410
in coming to Guihua City?

249
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,590
I, Cha Luo, wish to see you, Gong Zi.

250
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:10,880
Just now there was an assassin who unsuccessfully tried to kill me and he escaped into Tingzhu Courtyard.

251
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,960
I ask you, Gong Zi, to grant me permission to look for the assassin.

252
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,800
It looks like you didn't succeed in your mission.

253
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,450
I may have failed this once, but I'll succeed one day.

254
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,930
Will you have another chance?

255
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,700
As long as you are willing to give it to me.

256
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,990
After all, we have a common enemy.

257
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,380
I, Cha Luo, wish to see you, Gong Zi.

258
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,810
Gong Zi, please give your consent.

259
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,840
City Master, Gong Zi's internal power is profound.

260
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,140
If someone entered Tingzhu Courtyard, there's no way he wouldn't know.

261
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,480
So what you're saying is

262
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,700
that this person belongs to Tingzhu Courtyard?

263
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,360
I'm not sure, I'm just guessing.

264
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,410
Then let's go on in and catch him in the act and clear this up.

265
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,860
Wait!

266
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:37,030
There was indeed a person who entered Tingzhu Courtyard,

267
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,510
but he's now gone.

268
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,860
Go look for him somewhere else.

269
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,700
Gong Zi, this assassin's skill is exceptional.

270
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,060
His qinggong technique is even more admirable.
(Martial arts move - running swiftly and quickly)

271
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,870
I'm afraid that if the assassin is hiding in the Tingzhu Courtyard

272
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,640
it would not be good for you, Gong Zi.

273
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,760
If you don't say anything, then we're going to enter.

274
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,490
Let me go in and see.

275
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,370
What I've said once,

276
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,140
I won't say again.

277
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,760
Master. Master!

278
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,520
Gong Zi.

279
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,020
- How is it?
- I can't be sure

280
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,170
how much longer my internal power can hold out.

281
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,240
Go to that cabinet

282
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,680
and help me bring the medicine bottle on the second shelf.

283
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,480
What does this mean?

284
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,600
I'm not sure.

285
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,460
How's Liu Guang?

286
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,850
She's injured badly.

287
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,250
She's lost quite a bit of her power, but it's not life-threatening.

288
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,950
Looks like he held himself back.

289
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,260
You can't make a move today.

290
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,700
Why can't I?

291
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,070
At worst, my qi and blood will churn for half a month.

292
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:50,040
I, Cha Luo, have never been afraid to suffer in all my life.

293
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,350
Today, I just want to settle accounts with him.

294
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,750
Chang An! Chang An, it's great that you're here.

295
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,230
You're alive! I thought I'd never see you again.

296
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,610
Why didn't you leave?

297
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:23,420
Why would I leave? You made all those preparations for yourself.

298
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,700
If your life is exchanged for mine,

299
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,480
then I'd be another Han Xiu. How could I go on like that?

300
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,550
I never did think about leaving here alive.

301
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,150
You must live. For me.

302
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,770
For me, you have to live well.

303
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:54,980
If we want to live, first we have to break this deadlock.

304
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,800
Do you also get the feeling that Tingzhu Courtyard

305
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,950
is a little strange today?

306
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:11,210
In the past, Gong Zi always answered us calmly.

307
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,770
But this time he seemed so irritable.

308
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,740
It is a bit unusual.

309
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,750
Three days ago Yue Ying went away, but I still haven't found out where.

310
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,500
But she took Gong Zi's most able bodyguard with her.

311
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,300
Oh?

312
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,220
So what are we waiting for?

313
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,920
I, Cha Luo, wish to see Gong Zi.

314
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:15,350
Gong Zi's not feeling well. He's already asleep.

315
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,510
What are you doing here?

316
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,650
City Master, Gong Zi said

317
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,960
he had some things he wanted to ask me regarding the mission,

318
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,330
so he called me over to Tingzhu Courtyard.

319
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,960
Why do you need to dress this way for him to hear the details of a mission?

320
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:36,480
This is Tingzhu Courtyard's wish. My status is low,

321
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,930
I couldn't disobey.

322
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,430
How is Gong Zi not feeling well?

323
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,620
I am skilled in medicine. I can help treat Gong Zi.

324
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,770
Gong Zi just said...
