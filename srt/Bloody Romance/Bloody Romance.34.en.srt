[Episode 34]

17
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,850
How is it? Is there another memorial for me to approve?

18
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,740
Your Majesty is very diligent. All of today's memorials

19
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,340
have all been evaluated and finished.

20
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,190
Recently this Liang Army has been very discontent.

21
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,230
Your Majesty is very powerful. This Liang Army

22
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,440
looks like it's well trained and powerful,

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,760
but it's like a plate of sand, lacking in organization.

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,920
If they go to war with our army, they will collapse after the first attack.

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,780
Stop your flattery.

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,470
I keep you by my side

27
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,400
because I want to hear the truth from you.

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,930
Your Majesty, will you

29
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,700
forgive me

30
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,570
for speaking bluntly?

31
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,860
Say it.

32
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,820
Even though we have a strong well-trained army,

33
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,270
it lacks...

34
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,610
A commander?

35
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,270
Your Majesty is brilliant.

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,180
Then you tell me. The Grand Tutor is no more.

37
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,380
Who is as suitable to wield my military power?

38
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,580
Well... Actually in Your Majesty's heart,

39
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,750
you've already made a choice.

40
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,950
Then, tell me.

41
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,300
What do you think of Prince Ning?

42
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,870
I absolutely don't dare to speak carelessly.

43
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,030
Aren't you usually obsessed with guessing my thoughts?

44
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,290
This time, guess what I'm thinking.

45
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:36,530
Your Majesty, Prince Ning is already known far and wide for his military prowess.

46
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,860
Leading an army naturally won't be a problem for him.

47
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,220
But just as that Cha Luo said,

48
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,000
if the Jianghu realm and the Royal Court

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,610
are both under his control,

50
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,700
then...

51
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,270
Your Highness, this way, please.

52
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,730
Come and catch me!

53
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,990
I'm over here!

54
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,700
I'm here! Hurry and catch me!

55
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,770
You can't catch me!

56
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,720
Ying Yue, stop!

57
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,440
I pay my respects to Your Majesty.

58
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,670
Why stop it? You ruined the fun.

59
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,620
All right.

60
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,930
Everyone get up.

61
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,780
Royal Elder Brother.

62
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,420
Your subordinate ruined my play. When I'm performing,

63
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,340
I consider it just like reading royal memorials.

64
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,220
Your Majesty, Yue Ying just wanted to save you.

65
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,430
In a moment of loyalty and desperation, she was compelled to interfere.

66
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,800
I hope Your Majesty will forgive Yue Ying for not knowing.

67
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,440
Are you called Yue Ying?

68
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,820
I know you.

69
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,330
You are talented and you were just in time to help me.

70
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,180
I am ashamed. I ask Your Majesty to forgive me.

71
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,190
Royal Brother, can you break off your affection

72
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,290
and give this Yue Ying to me?

73
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,680
By my side, she can save me again.

74
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,350
Your Majesty, Ying Yue really isn't my subordinate.

75
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,140
Actually, my mother entrusted her to me, for me to care for her.

76
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,390
No matter.

77
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,100
I was just joking with you. Stand up.

78
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

79
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,330
Why has Your Majesty has called me here to the palace so urgently?

80
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,990
I've called you here today because I want to discuss with you

81
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,160
the affair of the Liang Army violating my Luzhou.

82
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,750
- Has Your Majesty made a decision?
- I have.

83
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,050
I've prepared to take the field myself.

84
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,790
- Your Majesty absolutely cannot.
- Why not?
- The dynasty's common people

85
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,990
finally have a sense of belonging. I believe the country can't go for one day without a ruler.

86
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,060
If I don't go and with the Grand Tutor gone,

87
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,660
who can handle this dangerous war?

88
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,980
- Your Majesty, there is still one person.
- Oh?

89
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,760
Which person?

90
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,000
Myself.

91
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,810
This was sent by His Majesty.

92
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,960
I haven't worn fighting armor in many years

93
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,860
and I haven't ridden a war horse.

94
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,870
I've waited too long for this day.

95
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,530
But His Majesty didn't send the army command seal.

96
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,180
He only sent 3,000 Imperial Guards to you, to save Luzhou.

97
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,530
That was my idea.

98
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,220
Great Liang sent out their troops suddenly. I just need to cut off their supply route

99
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,550
and they will have to turn back.

100
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,470
Three thousand men is a little dangerous,

101
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,110
but I have to do a few difficult moves

102
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,320
before I can make His Majesty understand my worth.

103
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,450
I believe you will certainly win this war.

104
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,340
You don't seem to be happy.

105
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,130
Getting closer and closer to my goal is a good thing.

106
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,010
But His Majesty

107
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,510
wants me to trade this battle armor for something else.

108
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,360
What is it?

109
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,440
Guihua City.

110
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,250
Gong Zi,

111
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,270
are you really going to give up Guihua City?

112
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,430
Guihua City or the army command seal.

113
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,180
If it were you, which would you choose?

114
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,320
The seal.

115
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,800
Go get ready. If I really can return triumphantly from Luzhou,

116
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,970
I will certainly return to Guihua City myself

117
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,010
to remove Tingzhu Courtyard.

118
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,690
Yes.

119
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,850
You may stand.

120
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,310
I've called everyone to come today

121
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,820
to decide the Supreme Assassin selection.

122
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,230
Wan Mei, Wan Xiang.

123
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,550
The two of you will have a competition

124
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,450
to fight over the Supreme Assassin position.

125
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,900
Is there any objection to the winner taking the position?

126
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,460
- No.
- No.

127
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,130
Good.

128
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,640
Torture Chamber Master, please read out the rules.

129
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,090
The two of you draw lots. According to the departed's name written on it, go to the Bi'an Chamber

130
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,100
and get their red demon umbrella. The competition time limit is the length of one stick of incense.

131
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,430
Whoever gets the corresponding umbrella

132
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,100
and lowers to the ground first will win.

133
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,620
During the competition, you cannot land half-way to the ground.

134
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,780
Otherwise, you will automatically lose.

135
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,130
This is Wan Xiang's?

136
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,250
Good, let me take a look.

137
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,460
The umbrella that Wan Xiang needs to retrieve...

138
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,910
Su Qiu.

139
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,810
And the umbrella that Wan Mei needs to retrieve...

140
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,140
[Yun Ci]

141
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,860
Liu Guang.

142
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,240
Light the incense stick.

143
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,520
Let's begin.

144
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,770
City Master, I have already obtained the Red Demon Umbrella belonging to Miss Liu Guang.

145
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,860
How could this be?

146
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,940
Let me take a look.

147
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,450
City Master, Wan Mei did not obey the rules. I am not convinced.

148
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,200
I beg City Master to add another round to the test.

149
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,250
Since I did not fall to the ground midway,

150
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,790
and also did not drop the umbrella to the ground, how did I not obey the rules?

151
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:48,300
On the contrary, you made accusations without proof and spoke without thinking.

152
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,590
You dared to entice the City Master not to keep her promise!

153
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,030
You should be found doubly guilty!

154
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,520
Miss Wan Xiang, even though you did not vie successfully for the position of Supreme Assassin,

155
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,400
you are still a Heavenly Assassin. You will have other chances in the future.

156
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,490
Very well!

157
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,420
The Supreme Assassin Competition

158
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,610
was won by Miss Wan Mei today.

159
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,350
Then, City Master, may I hang up Miss Liu Guang's

160
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,400
Red Demon Umbrella now?

161
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,690
You may.

162
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,940
In the autumn of the nineteenth year of Tianyou, Prince Ning, Li Siyuan,

163
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,890
led three thousand Imperial Guards on an expedition to Luzhou.

164
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,870
First, he cut off their supply of fodder and foodstuffs. Then, he led a stealth attack against them in the fog.

165
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:16,080
He defeated the Liang Army in half a day and broke through the siege of Luzhou.

166
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,650
Your Majesty, Prince Ning is here.

167
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,020
Greetings, Your Majesty.

168
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,060
You may rise.

169
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

170
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,630
Royal Brother, you have achieved a brilliant military service this time.

171
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,440
I want to reward you generously.

172
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,280
This is because of Your Majesty's great blessings. I would not dare to claim any credit for it.

173
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,550
You are too humble.

174
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,440
I will bestow upon you the title of Great General of the Military System of Beiya.

175
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,110
How is that?

176
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,300
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your immense grace. From today onward,

177
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,260
I will personally train the army day and night, in order to share the burden of the country with Your Majesty.

178
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,970
Do you still remember

179
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,180
that you made a promise together with me once?

180
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,240
I remember.

181
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,120
I will set out to Guihua City with Yue Ying now,

182
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,330
and pack my valuables.

183
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:26,000
City Master Cha Luo pledged her loyalty to me previously,

184
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,090
but I did not give her a clear answer.

185
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,520
Previously, I bestowed upon you the Lotus Badge.

186
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,590
May I trouble you to pass it on to her?

187
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,380
At the same time, also pass on my oral decree, stating that Guihua City will serve the court in the future,

188
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,910
and with the badge, it can mobilize troops and silver

189
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,940
from every state and county. Whosoever disobeys

190
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,080
will be considered to have resisted the decree and will be executed without pardon.

191
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,120
Yes.

192
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,340
Gong Zi. Gong Zi! You can't just barge in like that.

193
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,330
City Master has said that she will not meet any guest. Gong Zi!

194
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,540
Go and get busy with your own work.

195
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,600
Gong Zi, you came into my bedroom in such a hurry.

196
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,400
Is it because you have some urgent matter?

197
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,950
Did you go into the palace a few days ago?

198
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,820
You have also pledged your loyalty to His Majesty.

199
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,570
Yes. So what if I did?

200
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,470
You are indeed the City Master of my Guihua City.

201
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,330
You're courageous enough to admit to your actions.

202
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,250
Greetings, Gong Zi.

203
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,670
From today onward, I am no longer Tingzhu Gong Zi of Guihua City,

204
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,290
only Prince Ning of Jin.

205
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,970
What is the meaning of this?

206
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,280
City Master of Guihua City,

207
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,470
Cha Luo, receive the Imperial Decree.

208
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,390
According to His Majesty's oral decree, the person who is bestowed this badge

209
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,200
will lead Guihua City. From today onward,

210
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,250
Guihua City will serve only the Imperial Court.

211
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,990
Based on this badge of authority, it can mobilize silver and troops

212
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,000
from every state and county. Whosoever disobeys

213
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,530
will be considered to have resisted the decree and will be executed without pardon.

214
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,660
I accept the decree.

215
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,380
I have already brought to you the badge and oral decree.

216
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,600
Following this, I will return to Tingzhu Courtyard

217
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,420
and pack my valuables. In seven days' time,

218
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,130
I guarantee that I will leave Guihua City.

219
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,900
Congratulations, City Master.

220
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,400
She will come.

221
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,420
She is just a little too stubborn.

222
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,060
She can't make up her mind, that's all.

223
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,980
She still refuses to meet me after all.

224
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,020
Subtitles and Timing brought to you by the Bloody Romantics @viki.com

225
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,340
Gong Zi, are you waiting for me here to say farewell?

226
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,350
I hope that this is just a temporary farewell.

227
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,610
If you are able to assume the position of City Master, I can still return.

228
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,980
I am not confident

229
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,280
I can do it.

230
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,510
You can. I can still remember the first time

231
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,990
right here beside the Rebirth Pool, when I heard the tune you played.

232
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,510
In that moment, I knew that

233
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,840
you were not of mortal birth.

234
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,710
Being a human means of mortal birth.

235
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,830
I was coerced by fate

236
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,780
and got to where I am today.

237
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,750
Even though it is so,

238
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,090
you have an extraordinary ability.

239
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:53,350
In the most hopeless situation, you are always able to find a slim chance of survival.

240
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,470
If it is possible,

241
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,760
who would want to remain in a hopeless situation forever?

242
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,550
If you want to leave,

243
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,140
I can bring you away now.

244
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,730
If I say my answer,

245
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,020
I'm afraid you will be disappointed.

246
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,960
After all, I am more like a pawn in a chess game in your heart.

247
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,170
What about Chang An then?

248
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,060
How is he involved in this matter?

249
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,080
He has already established his mountain stronghold in Jiang City.

250
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,340
He even proclaimed himself King of Chu.

251
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,030
That is very good.

252
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,880
Even though he

253
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,760
may not necessarily be willing.

254
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,820
What he is doing now

255
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,000
is the same as what I am doing.

256
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,450
But why are these

257
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,120
different in your heart?

258
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,900
He does not look down on me in my presence

259
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,980
and wait for me to beg him for help.

260
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,340
He knows everything that is on my mind

261
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,960
and he will overcome all obstacles in my way.

262
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,920
Even if it means giving his life for it,

263
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,680
he will make a path for me.

264
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,150
So,

265
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,340
he has never been the same

266
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,990
as you.

267
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,380
Whatever it is,

268
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,210
I want to thank you for the care you have given me for so long.

269
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,970
I will walk

270
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,340
my future path alone.

271
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,550
Wan Mei.

272
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,760
Gong Zi,

273
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,580
it is time for you to let me go.

274
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,350
I have said previously that I want to be the City Master,

275
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,550
but now I have chosen to remain in Guihua City.

276
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,620
From the beginning to the end,

277
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,970
it has never been because of you, Gong Zi.

278
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,590
I just don't want all the sisters of Guihua City

279
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,540
to suffer hardship under Cha Luo again.

280
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,580
I also don't want anyone else to die an untimely death.

281
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,830
Please take care.

282
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,450
Please take care.

283
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,960
I have summoned all of you here today because there is something I want to ask you.

284
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,810
Do you still remember that three years ago, there was an assassin who barged into Chuixing Tower,

285
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,780
and wanted to assassinate me, the City Master?

286
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,900
We remember!

287
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:15,020
Heaven is not blind. It has finally revealed to me the identity of the assassin.

288
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,360
Wen Mei, come out here.

289
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,190
You have always been intelligent.

290
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,660
Why don't you tell us first?

291
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,410
I am stupid. I only know that for this person to expose his identity,

292
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,820
he is either already dead or he will die very soon.

293
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,520
Then you are wrong.

294
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,190
Not only is this person alive,

295
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,880
some time ago,

296
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,900
he escaped from Guihua City.

297
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,450
This person who defected was your shadow,

298
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,680
Chang An!

299
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,020
So it was Chang An.

300
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,000
You are still pretending to be calm.

301
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,250
He was still your shadow back then.

302
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,130
Therefore, he was the attempted assassin

303
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,810
and you were the mastermind.

304
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:31,610
I am innocent! Three years ago, I was only a newcomer.

305
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:37,030
Out of the kindness of your heart, you took me in. What motive would I have to kill the City Master?

306
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:42,430
Even if you were not the mastermind,

307
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,530
he was your shadow.

308
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,850
The two of you were inseparable the whole day long,

309
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,460
so you can't escape the responsibility for this matter.

310
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,670
No matter how inseparable Chang An and I had been,

311
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,990
we would be apart from each other at night when we were at rest.

312
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,540
If I did not remember it wrongly,

313
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,380
on the night of your attempted assassination, I was in Tingzhu Courtyard taking care of Gong Zi.

314
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:11,150
You also went to Tingzhu Courtyard that night. You saw me with Gong Zi yourself.

315
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:16,250
Then do you mean that I am wrong?

316
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,490
That I spoke without due consideration?

317
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,680
I am resigned to the fact that I am innocent. Please investigate clearly.

318
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,660
City Master! Sister Wan Mei is absolutely sincere towards Guihua City.

319
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,090
I ask City Master to reconsider.

320
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,000
I earnestly ask City Master to reconsider.

321
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:57,700
I earnestly ask City Master to reconsider.

322
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:14,800
What are all of you doing? Are all of you going to rebel against me?

323
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,740
I am still the City Master of Guihua City.

324
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,270
If all of you want to rebel, charge at me now!

325
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,300
Wan Mei,

326
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,590
whether you manipulated Chang An into trying to assassinate City Master or not,

327
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,650
has yet to reach its final verdict. It will be thoroughly investigated.

328
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,000
But after all, the assassination happened when Chang An was your shadow.

329
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,670
We must at least investigate your dereliction of duty. Are you willing to accept punishment?

330
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,780
I accept the punishment.

331
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,650
Good. I declare that Supreme Assassin Wan Mei

332
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,860
was ineffective in controlling her shadow. Although she escapes the penalty of death, she must still be punished.

333
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,300
Servants, bring Miss Wan Mei back to the torture chamber

334
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,000
to await her punishment.

335
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,590
Yes.

336
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,610
Miss Wan Mei, there is no evidence to prove whether you knew about

337
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,760
Chang An's attempted assassination of City Master,

338
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,700
but you were ineffective in controlling your shadow,

339
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,860
so we need to extract ten gu blood insects from within your body,

340
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,960
as a warning to others against following your bad example.

341
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,730
To extract the gu blood insects, the qi and the blood must be in a retrograde flow.

342
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,210
The process is exceedingly painful.

343
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,300
Are you ready?

344
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,800
Extract the gu blood insects from within her body?

345
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,150
The Torture Chamber Master is really diligent.

346
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,900
Firstly, it can resolve her threat against me.

347
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,500
Secondly, it can also let her suffer.

348
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,410
- Don't you think so?
- Yes.

349
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,590
- What do you know about it?
- Yes.
- Get out!
- Yes.

350
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,140
Xing Feng, oh, Xing Feng!

351
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,400
You are really thinking of all the ways you can

352
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,260
to preserve Wan Mei's life.

353
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,020
You live in Guihua City,

354
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,870
right beside me,

355
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,670
it is really not easy at all.

356
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,840
What are you going to do?

357
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,440
We are following City Master's order to retrieve some things.

358
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,830
We won't injure Wan Mei's life.

359
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,790
- What do you want?
- Miss Wan Mei's heart blood.

360
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,910
I wrote the words too large.

361
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,790
What is it?

362
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:55,580
This is a letter written by Wan Mei to Prince Ning asking for help.

363
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,450
How about it?

364
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,560
Do you think Gong Zi will believe it or will he even come?

365
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,780
He'll neither believe it nor will he come.

366
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,910
However, I have bullied his woman.

367
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,760
If I didn't use every possible means to let him know,

368
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,740
wouldn't that be too uninteresting?

369
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,940
Are you suspecting me of being too shallow?

370
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,820
As long as you're happy.

371
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,290
Tell me.

372
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,770
How is Wan Mei?

373
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,740
Ten gu blood insects have already been taken out. Her power has greatly decreased.

374
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,030
Moreover, she's been fundamentally injured.

375
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,700
From now on she won't be able to use the gu blood insects.

376
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,760
Are you trying to tell me that

377
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,380
her threat to me has already been eliminated,

378
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,640
so I have no need to keep making things difficult for her?

379
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:11,930
Perhaps it's because every time I see her,

380
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,400
I always think of you when you were young.

381
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,730
Previously you used this kind of talk

382
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,340
to deceive me into letting Chang An go.

383
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:41,770
This time I won't be taken in by it.

384
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,890
His Majesty still can't fully trust me.

385
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:14,620
Today in court, His Majesty issued a decree sending me

386
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,850
to suppress Jiang City's rebellion.

387
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,930
How many troops did he give you?

388
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,870
Five hundred.

389
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,040
Chang An was declared king and his followers have gathered.

390
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,420
Right now he has at least ten thousand soldiers.

391
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,930
More than that.

392
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,590
What's worse is that even these five hundred men

393
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:44,980
are all temporarily enlisted able-bodied men, recruited from nearby prefectures and counties.

394
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,040
I'm afraid there isn't a single one who can fight effectively on the battlefield.

395
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,330
His Majesty is clearly sending you to your death!

396
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,880
His Majesty also said in the Three Kingdoms period

397
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,270
Zhuge with two thousand troops defeated Cao Cao's army of one hundred thousand.

398
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,530
This time he gave me five hundred men

399
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,550
to see if I have the talent of Zhuge.

400
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,590
There's something I didn't originally want to distract you with.

401
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,670
But now, I think we should first focus on this.

402
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,180
This is definitely not Wan Mei's handwriting.

403
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,370
But this is certainly Wan Mei's blood.

404
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:36,440
How about we go back first and think of a way to help save her?

405
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,940
Since this is the case,

406
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,750
there is no need for us to go back.

407
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,960
Send someone

408
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,130
to deliver this letter written in blood to Jiang City.

409
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,030
This time

410
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,480
Cha Luo is actually helping me.

411
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,890
This blood letter was sent to the army camp. How can it be real?

412
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,780
It's just to lure you into a trap.

413
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,860
Even if it isn't Wan Mei's handwriting, it is definitely her blood!

414
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,710
Otherwise, why would my heart-devouring gu be reacting?

415
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,600
Even if it's true, what can you do? The lives of over ten thousand men,

416
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,050
the Imperial bloodline and the world's common people, and countless others have risked their lives keeping their hopes alive for over 100 years.

417
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:01,670
Aren't they worth more than this letter written in Wan Mei's blood?

418
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,430
You can't leave, Xie Huan.

419
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,280
Today, you definitely can not go.

420
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,140
Jiang City just gained its' momentum.

421
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:21,070
If you were to go, the hundred years' hope of our ancestors will be destroyed in one day.

422
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:28,150
So today you certainly can not go.

423
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,210
Young Master,

424
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:44,820
I'm begging you. Don't go.

425
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,060
All right

426
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,160
I've persevered for so long.

427
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,890
I've exhausted all the means I could use.

428
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,430
I'm tired.

429
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,020
The remaining difficult problems,

430
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,330
I'll turn over to you.

431
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,180
I've let you down.

432
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,890
I'll be waiting down below, waiting to see you

433
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:25,280
recover Empress Wu...

434
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,270
Recover...

435
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:36,160
Empress Wu's nation.

436
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:57,040
