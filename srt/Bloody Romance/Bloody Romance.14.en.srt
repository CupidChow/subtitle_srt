[Episode 14]

17
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,920
Let's go.

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,150
Where are the guards?

19
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,950
- You go report this. I'll go in and take a look.
- Yes, sir.

20
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,410
You don't have to save me.

21
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,690
I don't have time to deal with your depression. This is my mission.

22
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,580
You can fail your missions, but I can't.

23
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,130
Hey, beautiful, did you come to break out prisoners? Take us, too.

24
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,130
- Get lost.
- Be careful. Their doors aren't locked.

25
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,050
Grand Tutor Yue is very clever. He foresaw that someone would try to break in.

26
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,220
You with your skinny arms and legs, how can you defeat us?

27
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,140
How about surrendering, letting us capture and bring you two to exchange for the antidote?

28
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,240
In my eyes, dead people don't need antidotes.

29
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,790
Everyone stay alert!

30
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,820
Miss Yue Ying, listen to the sounds.

31
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,740
We're surrounded.

32
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,890
You won't be able to get me out of here.

33
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:46,920
Whether we can get out of here or not is my business. If you really are concerned about me, then say nothing more.

34
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,860
Stop! They are trying to trick us.

35
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,480
Save me! Save me! Help me!

36
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,490
Sir, should we put out the fire?

37
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,000
The prison breakers are still inside. Keep waiting.

38
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,700
The prison breakers have already escaped! Hurry and save us!

39
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,770
Sir, why don't we go in and look? If the prison breakers have already fled

40
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,250
the other prisoners will all be burned to death. Grand Tutor will definitely blame us.

41
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,800
- Take a squad of swordsmen inside. Archers!
- Here!

42
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,360
- Keep watch outside!
- You men, come in with me!
- Yes, sir!

43
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,050
- Let's put out the fire!
- Yes, sir!

44
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,280
- Save us!
- Get water!

45
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,380
Let's go. Hurry!

46
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,590
Hurry! Help me!

47
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,430
Get these bodies out of here!

48
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,500
A woman?

49
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,540
Take her!

50
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,960
Get the other one!

51
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,730
I told you to be even more on guard.

52
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,240
Now you're telling me

53
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,930
she's been taken away?

54
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,510
Sir, please punish me.

55
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,530
How many were there?

56
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,720
Only one, a girl.

57
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,090
And how many people did you send? How many died?

58
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,400
There were forty-eight Imperial Bodyguards and archers.

59
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,720
There were also jail guards and the jailers. There were only eight who escaped.

60
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,570
What about the two death row convicts that were arranged?

61
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,660
They're also dead.

62
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,140
You good-for-nothing!

63
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,640
Your Excellency, this was definitely Prince Ning's doing.

64
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,940
And the proof? Is it just because she's a woman?

65
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,110
Forgive me for being incapable!

66
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,310
The assassin originally

67
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,930
went to Zhaixing Tower. I'm worried

68
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,660
They will continue to target Ruan Niang.

69
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,710
Your Excellency is right. I'll send people to protect Ruan Niang.

70
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,880
It's no fun. I don't want to play anymore.

71
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,790
When you're losing, then it's no fun anymore?

72
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,290
Who let you touch my accessory box!?

73
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,390
Spare me!

74
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,780
Shouldn't you hurry and tell City Master what just happened?

75
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,930
Just now, I saw some dust on your accessory box. I just wanted to wipe it off.

76
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,040
I didn't intentionally move it. City Master, please spare my lowly life.

77
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,350
City Master is in a good mood today.

78
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,210
She'll spare you. Get lost now.

79
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,920
Yes, yes.

80
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,560
Who said I am in a good mood today?

81
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,570
If you were in a bad mood, he would have died right away.

82
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:10,610
I just didn't want his blood all over my accessory box.

83
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,900
It's getting late.

84
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,630
Let me comb your hair and you can go to bed soon.

85
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,140
Tell me the story,

86
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,020
the story about this accessory box.

87
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,160
You have to listen to it?

88
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,580
Yes.

89
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,800
Around ten years ago, there was a little girl

90
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,200
whose parents had both died. Ever since she was little

91
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,800
she had been betrothed to someone from a well-known family called Xie.

92
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Her aunt and uncle were both looking forward to her marrying into a rich family.

93
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,400
She was like a chicken ascending into a heavenly world. So they treated her really well.

94
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,700
One day, the uncle told her that he would take her to visit the Xie family.

95
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,800
The little girl was really happy. She spent a lot of time choosing a gift

96
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,700
and decided to bring a gold woven wooden accessory box.

97
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,400
The lotus flower on the box was hand carved by the little girl.

98
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,800
She followed her uncle to the Xie family home

99
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,600
and gave the dressing box to the main lady of the Xie family.

100
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,400
But who would have thought, that the young master, Xie Tingyun,

101
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,000
already had someone he liked in mind, so he was disrespectful to the little girl.

102
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,700
And both Master Xie and the main lady of the family told her that her eyebrows

103
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,400
were both sharp and pointed upwards, a sign that she was destined to kill people.

104
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,800
They requested to break the marriage arrangement. When she got back home,

105
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,200
her aunt and uncle said the little girl had lost her value.

106
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,000
They started to treat her badly, spoke badly of her, and used violence on her.

107
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,800
That day, I drank the water that my aunt gave me.

108
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,100
Then, I lost my senses.

109
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,000
When I woke up, I realized that I had been already put inside a coffin.

110
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And right next to me was a dead body.

111
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,900
They arranged a ghost marriage!

112
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,200
I was scared to death. I crazily tried and tried to move the cover of the coffin

113
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,700
until my whole hand was covered in blood.

114
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,700
It was getting more difficult for me to breath and my vision was getting blurry.

115
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,200
Suddenly the coffin was opened

116
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,300
and a really beautiful woman appeared in front of me.

117
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,800
That woman took out a vase

118
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,600
and said that her name was Lan He, the city master of Guihua City.

119
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,800
And inside the vase,

120
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,200
was a gu  insect that could help strengthen my internal power,

121
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,800
improve my martial arts, and then allow me to take revenge.

122
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,200
I trusted her and planted the gu insect inside of myself.

123
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,600
I entered Guihua City, and killed my uncle's entire family.

124
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,400
Then,

125
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,400
I used my mission as an excuse and then killed off the Xie family.

126
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,400
I took back my accessory box.

127
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,800
This accessory box isn't just my mother's relic.

128
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,600
It is also a remembrance of the shame the Xie family gave me.

129
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,700
I want to never forget it.

130
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,000
Never forget it!

131
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000

132
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,800
It's late. You should sleep.

133
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Kiss me. Just once.

134
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,400
I haven't been able to have sex for a long time.

135
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,000
If you're like this, it makes it more difficult for me.

136
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,670
My relatives betrayed me.

137
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,200
It was Lan He who saved me.

138
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,900
She pulled me back from the gates of hell.

139
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I thought I would be grateful to her for life.

140
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,600
But she was just using me.

141
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,300
She provoked me to fight with Cha Wu. Both sides suffered.

142
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,640
What "follow one's heart's desires?"

143
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,900
What "do whatever I please?"

144
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,020
They were all lies!

145
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,200
Enough. It's all in the past.

146
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
It's not over!

147
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
That blind son of Lan He

148
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,600
is still here! He's always bossing me around!

149
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,640
He's also placed that Wan Mei

150
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,800
right under my eyes. I get annoyed just seeing her!

151
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,400
Wan Mei will soon lose her life. She won't be able to bother you anymore.

152
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,000
Of course.

153
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,100
If Yue Qingya lets her off, I will chase her down and kill her in the end.

154
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,960
After Wan Mei was captured, we also lost news of Chang An.

155
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,800
Men really are not dependable.

156
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
What if he comes back?

157
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,300
He has served two consecutive failed masters. Of course, he must die.

158
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,600
But I should think about

159
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
how I should torment him

160
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,990
before he dies.

161
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,400
Where is that Wordless Decree now?

162
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Your Highness, do you remember?

163
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,200
Before my father died, he handed you the Soul Cleaving Sword,

164
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,800
told you to protect the sword with your life,

165
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,400
kill Cha Luo, and take back her accessory box?

166
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,500
I remember.

167
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,800
The Wordless Decree is in Cha Luo's accessory box.

168
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,200
- Who is it?
- It's me.

169
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,200
What is it?

170
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,800
Grand Tutor's subordinate, Mo Fei, is here.

171
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Did he say why he is here?

172
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,200
He said the assassin who tried to kill you was rescued from prison.

173
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Grand Tutor was afraid for your safety, so he sent some expert martial artists to protect you.

174
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,600
All right, I understand.

175
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,200
Go down and take care of them first, I will come down soon.

176
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,400
Yes.

177
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,800
Your Highness, you can stop worrying.

178
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
You and Yue Qingya...

179
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,300
Your Highness, please don't ask.

180
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,800
I can tell whether it is serious or not.

181
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,100
I was too nosy.

182
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,000
Your Highness, I'll go check on Grand Tutor's men.

183
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,200
Please, you must wait for me. Under no circumstance should you act on impulse.

184
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,400
All right.

185
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,600
Ruan Niang!

186
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,600
How is the Grand Tutor?

187
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Grand Tutor has been well. He was just worried about your safety.

188
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,810
I am safe here.

189
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,800
The assassin won't attack me again any time soon.

190
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,100
I appreciate Grand Tutor's good intentions.

191
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,400
The future is still long.

192
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,600
Even though that gang failed, others might want to make trouble.

193
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,800
Ruan Niang, don't worry. I personally trained these men.

194
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,600
They know how to behave properly.

195
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,980
Since this is the case, I must thank Grand Tutor.

196
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,800
This is my room. You all can stay out here to stand guard.

197
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,200
Yes, ma'am.

198
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
If Wan Mei returns to Guihua City, she might not survive. I'll go back first to check on her.

199
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,800
The wordless decree is probably hidden in Chuixing Tower.

200
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,800
I'll look for an opportunity to retrieve it. There's no need to worry.

201
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,900
I know you don't want to live. I didn't want to save you either.

202
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,700
But I have to follow Gong Zi's orders.

203
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,040
No matter what,

204
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,800
I still have to thank you.

205
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,100
But compared to going back to Guihua City,

206
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,450
I'd rather die.

207
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
This is...

208
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,400
This is suijin incense's antidote.

209
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,600
It can cure the poison in the cut on your face.

210
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,400
Gong Zi asked me to bring it to you.

211
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,800
Suijin incense is produced in Xifan.

212
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,600
When it encounters blood, it rots your flesh and bones.

213
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,700
You...

214
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,500
Gong Zi, I'm disobeying you.

215
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,500
I only saved Wan Mei, so I can bring back Nine-Lives.

216
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,000
Gong Zi ordered me to save you

217
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and bring you back to Guihua City alive. But since you don't want to return

218
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and you're willing to die, then I'll grant your wish.

219
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,600
This is a poison I made. You will die immediately upon consuming it. You will not feel any pain.

220
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,400
You kept saying you wanted to die.

221
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,100
And now that I've given you the chance, you won't take it.

222
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,900
You've failed in your mission. Even if you return to Guihua City, death may well be waiting for you.

223
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,800
If you die here, it may save you from being tortured when you get back.

224
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,400
I'll give you an hour. In an hour, I'll come and retrieve your corpse.

225
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,000
I promise you that you'll be buried with full honor.

226
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
With you around, I'm not afraid.

227
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,600
♫ The zither music evokes feelings of desolation and cheerlessness. ♫

228
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,000
♫ Of a lifetime, the moon is always high, the dew is always heavy. ♫

229
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I will not let you die. Whatever promises I've made,

230
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,700
I will keep them.

231
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,400
Whatever she's done, it'll be my concern. I want to bear these for her.

232
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,170
♫ Who worsens the ache in my heart? ♫

233
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:29,200
♫ My heart’s warmth will make these autumn leaves concentrated. ♫

234
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,400
♫ When will you grow drunk in the autumn wind with me, ♫

235
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:40,400
♫ so that I will be able to walk out of my dreams? ♫

236
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,400
♫ Who worsens the ache in my heart? ♫

237
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:51,400
♫ My heart’s warmth will make these autumn leaves concentrated. ♫

238
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,800
♫ When will you grow drunk in the autumn wind with me, ♫

239
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:01,600
♫ so that I will be able to walk out of my dreams? ♫

240
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,000
Whatever it is, I will never fail you.

241
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
No, I must keep this life.

242
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,800
I want those who failed me

243
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,100
to pay the price for it.

244
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,700
I've come to my senses.

245
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,070
I want to live.

246
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,500
Because I am not resigned to just dying like this.

247
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,880
Only if I live

248
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,180
will I have hope.

249
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,400
Fine, then I'll give you one more chance.

250
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,600
Gong Zi has just assigned a new mission to me. We're currently lacking a guiding herb.

251
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,900
In your current situation, you're ideal to give me a helping hand.

252
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:42,060
Subtitles and Timing brought to you

253
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,200
Go to sleep.

254
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,600
When you wake up, you'll know what you need to do.

255
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,800
Those behind, catch up.

256
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,600
- Catch up.
- Hurry up. Hurry and catch up.

257
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,400
Let me tell you this. We'll find a buyer for you when we reach Ling City.

258
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,200
Whether you will have a good life thereafter depends on your individual good luck.

259
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,400
Hurry.

260
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,300
Hurry it up.

261
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,500
- Are you okay?
- Get up.

262
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Get up!

263
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,000
From where did you find this one? Not only is she disfigured,

264
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,300
she's mute and lame, too. How will we be able to sell her?

265
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,700
Get up. Time to eat.

266
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,100
Pick it up if you still want to eat.

267
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,100
Hey, how are we going to sell off someone like her?

268
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,800
Don't tell me that you got her just for beating up along the way for fun.

269
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,600
Am I that idle? What are you talking about?

270
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Someone paid a king's ransom for her to be sold in Ling City.

271
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,200
Although her face is disfigured, her body looks quite good.

272
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,900
Perhaps someone, who is rich but blind, will buy her.

273
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,800
You're having wishful thoughts.

274
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,300
[Ling City]

275
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,400
Catch up. Don't be slack.

276
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,600
Hurry it up.

277
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,000
Hey, Young Sir Xiao, our new products are here.

278
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,900
All of you, keep up.

279
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,700
Let's go. Hurry up.

280
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,000
Here, have a look. Here.

281
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,700
Here, here. Have a look.

282
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,000
Young Sirs, here, here.

283
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,200
Come to the front.

284
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Come to the front. Here.

285
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,000
To the front. To the front.

286
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,200
If you wash and dress them up once you get home, they're definitely great beauties.

287
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,800
Good for companionship, good for doing hard work, whatever.

288
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,200
The highest bidder gets it, the highest bidder gets it.

289
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,800
Have a look. Have a look.

290
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,400
- I bid ten coins.
 - I bid five coins.

291
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,000
Everything is okay. Everything is okay.

292
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,400
Are you going to get up or not?

293
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,000
It's nothing.

294
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,400
She's fine. She's still breathing.

295
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,800
If she's still alive, don't bother about her. The business is more important.

296
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,600
Hey. Here. Here. Look.

297
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,300
She's a beauty.

298
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,900
Aiyo, Miss. Did I hit you?

299
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,400
- Is it done yet?
- Take a look.

300
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,600
The color of your rouge is really beautiful. You have good taste.

301
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Stop fidgeting. It'll be done soon.

302
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,600
You're Chang An?

303
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Yes, I am.

304
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
Chang An, Chang An.
(means "longlasting peace")

305
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,400
You're really blessed by this name. Both of your masters have met with bad ends,

306
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,400
yet you're safe and sound.

307
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,000
I am guilty. City Master, please punish me.

308
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,400
But I'm curious.

309
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,600
Since you had already escaped, why did you come back here again?

310
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,700
I have no family. Other than Guihua City, there's no place for me to go.

311
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,770
You're not afraid that I'll sentence you to death?

312
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,600
I returned here to wait for some news

313
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,600
of Master Mei being dead or alive.

314
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,400
Are you here to remind me that your master hasn't died yet,

315
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,800
so according to the rules, I can't put you to death?

316
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,000
I wouldn't dare.

317
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
He's loyal enough.

318
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,800
Based on this trait, not many Shadows in Guihua City

319
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,600
are like him.

320
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,900
You... are still thinking of him.

321
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,000
If you like him, I'll let him live

322
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,500
and give him to you.

323
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,550
Do not disfigure his looks.

324
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,900
Torture Chamber Master, did you hear that? Don't disfigure his looks.

325
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Here, try this.

326
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,980
Miss, you've awakened.

327
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,400
I made this for you.

328
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,710
What's your name?

329
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,700
Are you a mute?

330
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,900
Oh yes. The porridge on the stove is ready. Just wait a moment.

331
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,100
You must be starved.

332
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,400
The mushroom in this rice porridge is from the hills behind.

333
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,800
It's really nutritious.

334
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Here, have some. Don't be scared.

335
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,400
How are you?

336
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,100
Are you okay? Have some more.

337
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,800
I can see that you have so many wounds on your legs and body.

338
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,200
Rest a bit first. In two days,

339
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,000
Mister Lan will come to our village to nurse the sick.

340
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,900
I will bring you to him to be checked.

341
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,700
This is a good porridge.

342
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,900
What a pity for it to go to waste.

343
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,800
Master.

344
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,400
Put this healing balm on him after he's washed and cleaned.

345
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,000
Be sure to put the balm on every wound.

346
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,100
This... is the best of the healing balms.

347
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
Yes, Master, you don't have to worry.

348
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm going to rest now. Take care of him before you go off to bed.

349
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,700
I understand.

350
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,000
Quite stubborn still.

351
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
All right, you'll get more of it later.

352
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,100
I received a secret report, saying that someone broke into the Heavenly Prison

353
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,650
and rescued a prisoner.

354
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,200
Yes, I got her out.

355
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,300
Wan Mei failed in her mission. She's a cripple now,

356
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,000
so...

357
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,600
Gong Zi,

358
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,800
we've planned so long for this. Now, the gu  poison and Fenduo Map are both in our hands.

359
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,100
The only missing thing is the guiding herb.

360
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,770
I've injected the gu poison into her.

361
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,100
This errand

362
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,600
is well carried out.

363
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:33,160
I violated your orders, but I do not regret it.

364
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,270
Where is she now?

365
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,190
I've tasked someone with bringing her to Ling City.

366
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
I didn't do wrong!

367
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,100
Fine.

368
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,000
Go kneel outside and think hard about whether you were right or wrong!

369
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:18,100
