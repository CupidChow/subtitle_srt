A JEON Yun-su Film
Look at the control of contrast

7
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,190
Look at the control of contrast

8
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,790
His techniques parallel
that of a practiced artist

9
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,960
This boy is truly gifted

10
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,790
- Your name is SHIN Yun-bok?
- Yes, my lord

11
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,870
This painting is alive with energy

12
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,560
Surely a proud descendant of
royal portraitists

13
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,570
Train him well

14
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:04,440
It'll be a matter of time before
your family glory is restored

15
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,270
But it's KIM Hong-do
that the King loves

16
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,070
and his style that dictates trends

17
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,900
Reversing that will be

18
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,060
a great challenge

19
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,400
This is "Blossom and Sparrow"

20
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,200
Allow me the pleasure

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,460
of seeing your brushwork in action

22
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,900

CHOO Ja-hyun

26
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,060
Go on, child!

27
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,560
How dare you...

28
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,800
embarrass me in front of the guests!

29
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,790
Where are you hiding?

30
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:10,460
He wouldn't have died
if it wasn't for you

31
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,630
How dare you deceive me!
Bring shame to the family

32
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,200
and kill my only heir!

33
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,090
How dare a girl try painting?

34
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,130
You painted them?

35
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,890
Not your brother, but you did?

36
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:51,190
KIM Hong-do is known to treat
the lowly and noblemen equally

37
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,160
But you'll treat him
with utmost respect

38
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,260
Yes, father

39
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,530
All teachers are brought down
by their best pupils

40
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,160
Remember that

41
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,830
PORTRAIT OF A BEAUTY

42
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,370
10 years later

43
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,330
This is exactly same as the original

44
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,730
but you focused only on copying,
you failed to hear all the notes

45
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,090
I know of your exceptional skills

46
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,030
So I deliberately missed a note

47
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,800
This time, listen with whole heart
and convey the music onto the paper

48
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,200
Yes, sir

49
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,930
"Flawless conduct and high integrity"

50
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,460
Cardinal virtues laid out
in elegant calligraphy

51
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,930
Looking at them will cleanse
the mind of the beholder

52
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,670
Who's work is this?

53
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,030
Hyewon SHIN Yun-bok, Your Majesty

54
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,000
Come forward

55
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,100
Tell me...

56
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,260
What is civility?

57
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,470
Maintaining integrity and politeness

58
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,990
and knowing one's obligations

59
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,660
Is that all?

60
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,130
Kuan Zhong of Qi said civility is
one of four pillars constituting a nation

61
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,340
If one is missing,
nation will decline

62
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,240
With two missing,
it will be imperiled

63
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,170
With three missing,
turned upside down

64
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,190
When all four is gone,
the nation will fall

65
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,030
Indeed!

66
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,220
The reason I ordered for
reorganization of Dohwaseo

67
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,770
is because court painters are
more than mere craftmen

68
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,990
Artistic styles of the royal court dictates
that of the entire kingdom's

69
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,040
Study hard the literature and arts

70
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,700
Let your paintings reflect
the honor of the court

71
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,630
Yes, Your Majesty!

72
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,170
I haven't seen pictures of outside lately

73
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,100
Have new paintings made for me

74
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,100
Yes, Your Majesty

75
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,520
Here you go!

76
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,020
Help yourselves!

77
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,360
This one's better than that one

78
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,900
Get lost, you filth

79
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,700
Get your dirty hands off!

80
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,100
Do you know how much it is?

81
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,300
Away! Away!

82
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,860
- Wow, bronze mirrors!
- Have a look, ladies!

83
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,470
Did you see the real mirror?

84
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,140
- Real mirror?
- Yeah, the real thing

85
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,570
Let's go, see!

86
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,760
Ladies! Hey!

87
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,960
I haven't sold one yet!

88
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,890
Out of the way!

89
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,790
Get him!

90
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,170
Which one?

91
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,290
Over there!

92
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,370
- Stop him!
- 'scuse me!

93
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,630
Out of the way!

94
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,860
You, wretch!

95
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,270
Let's talk this over

96
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,930
No license, no selling here!

97
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,670
Sneaky monkeys like you
are doing us heading!

98
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,800
I'm only trying to
make a living

99
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,730
Shut your mouth!

100
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,860
Get him!!

101
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,890
Idiots!

102
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,090
Teacher!

103
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,100
Oh, my treasure!

104
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,090
What am I to do?!

105
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,230
You're getting younger, sir

106
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,940
The precious mirror is broken

107
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,590
and you are partly to blame

108
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,730
If you paint me a picture worth
ten thousand, I'll set him free

109
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,370
If not, I'll make him my slave
What do you think?

110
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,860
A slave?! You wish...

111
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,760
Try doing that,

112
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,800
and I'll smash your skulls

113
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,160
That clueless wretch!

114
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,530
It's not a problem for a painter
to paint a picture,

115
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,160
but as you see, my hand...

116
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,000
You can't paint then?

117
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,100
What if the painting isn't worth
the price of the mirror?

118
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,560
All depends on the tip of his brush

119
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,590
Paint!

120
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,790
Take a sit here

121
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,360
Looks like a vagabond monk

122
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,300
It's the Monk Shide of Tang

123
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:39,170
The saint that lived as a beggar
to look after the poor all his life?

124
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,370
If one can save a man with a painting,

125
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,890
then that makes him a living Shide

126
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,390
His wit and skills are worth a lot more
than the price of the mirror

127
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,830
Sirs, you owe him money

128
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,430
Owe him instead?

129
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,030
Shut up and bring out some wine!

130
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,790
Wait! Sirs!

131
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,700
Please take this puppy
It looked so cute and yummy

132
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,460
It'll be ready in few months

133
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,130
Consider it a token of my gratitude

134
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,360
You want to pay up with a pup

135
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,870
I'll pay back properly when I become rich

136
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,890
In a million years, perhaps?

137
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,690
Know a good spot for genre painting?

138
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,070
Genre painting?

139
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,670
Paintings of ordinary people and activities

140
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,200
Why would you want to paint such thing?

141
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,000
Not landscape or angels?

142
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,370
Can you tell us or not?

143
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,170
Of course!
I'll show you the best spot, sir!

144
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,800
Show this young gentleman

145
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,320
Vow!

146
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,960
Where are you going?

147
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,760
I said genre painting, not landscape!

148
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,960
Shh...

149
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,660
You haven't seen naked women before?

150
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:41,750
- It feels so good
- Lovely!

151
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,330
It's great to be out

152
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,860
Meek-looking ones are bigger perverts

153
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,750
Over there!

154
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,190
And there!

155
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,490
Pay, if you want to watch!

156
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,050
Out of the way!

157
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,100
Hurry, hurry!

158
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,220
Out of the way!

159
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,830
There was no corruption of morality
or betrayal in my father's days

160
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,390
What bothers Your Majesty?

161
00:21:54,530 --> 00:22:01,400
You seem to be the only
virtuous man in the court

162
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,460
It's in the strength of your brush

163
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,890
From those protesting for
abolition of class system

164
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,560
To those conspiring to
bring down the King

165
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,830
This country's in chaos

166
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,760
When the King practices frugality
by wearing hemp clothing

167
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,630
How is it that his subjects are
so corrupt and demoralized?

168
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,200
It's because the time is peaceful
under Your Majesty's ruling

169
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,650
Maybe my wisdom is short

170
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,630
That's not true, Your Majesty

171
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,190
This is the weaver's workshop

172
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,400
and the brass smith forge

173
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,060
This is my version of your "Cultivation"

174
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,960
It's natural for a pupil
to follow the style of his teacher

175
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,460
but a flower...

176
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,790
cannot come in full bloom
without revealing its inside

177
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,990
I'll remember that, sir

178
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,000
Find your own style and techniques

179
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,340
"Heavenly tiger"

180
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,800
No one can match you for details

181
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,070
It's a masterpiece

182
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,410
I heard your grandson saw your "Tiger"
and bursted out crying in fear

183
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,700
Now that there are two tigers
I fear they might fight each other

184
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,790
Nowadays watching my grandson
is more pleasing than painting

185
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,030
What pleases you, these days?

186
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,940
My pleasure is exchanging conversations
with the great master

187
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,090
How's your pupil coming along?

188
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,500
He's quite amazing

189
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,000
You realize he's a baby tiger that
your enemy planted under your wings?

190
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,640
Were you afraid of me
when I was your pupil?

191
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,610
You are not?

192
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,900
More excited than afraid

193
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,260
Look what they're up to

194
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,000
- Keep it down madam
- Ow, that hurts!

195
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,730
I'm just jealous!

196
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,240
- My dear sir!
- My precious!

197
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,630
She's not your woman!

198
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,370
You'll hurt yourselves!

199
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,770
Come back!

200
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,240
Come back inside

201
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,830
You're blocking my view!

202
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,960
Sexual Positions of Qing
No. 5!

203
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,440
Here, Here!

204
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,230
Position No. 6!

205
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,000
Position No. 7!

206
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,510
Look who's here!

207
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,090
What's a gentleman like you doing here?

208
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,300
I worked my arse off for 7 years
to be court painter

209
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,870
You get to stand in front of the King
after only 1 year?!

210
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,030
Leave me in peace!

211
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,670
Hey, what's this?

212
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,770
Give it back!

213
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,770
Crawl!

214
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,800
Trying to pierce me with a girlie stare?

215
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,770
On your fours now,
or the picture gets it!

216
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,400
No!

217
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,860
Crawl!

218
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,260
Now!

219
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,330
Now we're talking

220
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:40,030
Like father like son

221
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,500
After your father got thrown out
for lack of skills,

222
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,800
he crawled like a dog and
kissed KIM Hong-do's arse...

223
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,970
to get you into Dohwaseo, right?

224
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,100
You're as good as your father

225
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,830
Who the hell...?!

226
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,770
Stop it!

227
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,590
I can go by myself from here

228
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,960
There are drunkards and rough men out here

229
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,020
It's no place for a woman...

230
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,680
I mean...

231
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,810
Hey

232
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,180
Walk safely

233
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,810
Kang-mu wins!

234
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,310
Sir!

235
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,950
Did you see my twist throw?

236
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,320
It was totally my game!

237
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,680
I'll win the prize bull and
pay for what I owe you!

238
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,590
I'm touched at the thought

239
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,280
Little sir isn't here today?

240
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,660
I made this for you

241
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,990
Three more games to win!
Don't go anywhere!

242
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,240
Where is the weaver's workshop?

243
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,360
Yun-bok

244
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,940
Sir

245
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,830
"Wrestling"

246
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,390
Teacher,

247
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,890
Spectators look down into ring whereas

248
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,990
wrestlers' perspective is from down up

249
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,860
Why did you incorporate
both viewpoints into one picture?

250
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:14,280
A man's eyes see what
his heart desires to see

251
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,750
What's your heart looking these days?

252
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,440
Prize

253
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,920
Sir, I have to go somewhere

254
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,430
Curfew bell will toll soon
What if you run into patrol men?

255
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,540
I'll be back before then

256
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:58,020
"Lovers under the moon"
Late night, only the lovers
know their feelings

257
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,750
"Hero at the brothel"

258
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,660
She's not your woman!

259
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,210
You'll hurt yourselves!

260
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,450
Come see me again tomorrow

261
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:53,210
"A widow's lust in spring"
Look what they're up to

262
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,510
Keep it down, ma'am

263
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,150
Ow, it hurts!
I'm just jealous

264
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,120
"Nothing happened here"

265
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,620
You're back early

266
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,990
You think I don't know
what you've been up to?

267
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,920
"A boat party"

268
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,120
You, naughty minx

269
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,820
You're the one out playing
during mourning period

270
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,610
You're right about that!

271
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,280
"A secret meeting under the moon"

272
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,710
Hurry now or we'll miss the ship!

273
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,380
I'm leaving this in your hand
'coz you seem trust-worthy

274
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,280
Don't you worry about it!

275
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:19,490
Let's go!
No one here can count

276
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,320
A woman's bosoms

277
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,310
must always be covered
except for breastfeeding

278
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:36,250
A widow watching dog copulation?
Utterly outrageous!

279
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,720
You scold me for my wrong doings

280
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,190
How come you don't scold him
for prying and tattling?

281
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,850
How dare you talk back?

282
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,590
His Majesty the King!

283
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,190
I shall teach you a lesson

284
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:58,280
This will be your last day at Dohwaseo

285
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,120
"Village school"

286
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,080
I was so pleased with
Kim Hong-do's painting

287
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,850
I came to pay a visit

288
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,390
Have copies made of this painting

289
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,820
and distribute to all court officials

290
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,150
Yes, Your Majesty

291
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,620
Who painted these?

292
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,750
Hyewon SHIN Yun-bok, Your Majesty

293
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:52,710
Disciplinary action was being taken

294
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,950
Why did you make such paintings?

295
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,920
Speak up

296
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,420
Speak up, I said!

297
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:13,020
Hyewon has disgraced the court and
brought shame to Dohwaseo with vulgarity

298
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,520
I beg your Majesty to
punish him severely...

299
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,750
The paintings are not vulgar,
Your Majesty

300
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,260
What?

301
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,720
Interpretation is in the
eyes of the beholder

302
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:32,380
The paintings are satirical of
corrupt noblemen and courtesans

303
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:38,090
In the eyes of lewd-minded
the pictures may seem indecent...

304
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,860
That's not true, Your Majesty!

305
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:45,840
Obscenity is obvious to any eyes
Please see here!

306
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,290
A widow watching mating of dogs
and her servant pinching her thy

307
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,490
How can such behavior be described
anything other than obscene?

308
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,660
And the flowing creeks and rocks
in the background...

309
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,110
are clearly a lewd depiction of
female genital...

310
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,190
of... a graphic depiction of...

311
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:08,210
female anatomy

312
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:14,150
Whether meant as satire or joke,

313
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,320
Too much is never better than lacking

314
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,350
Exercise self-disciple and
cleanse your mind

315
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,660
Your father sent me a letter

316
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,990
It's full of worries for his son's progress

317
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:32,940
My paintings weren't meant to be satirical

318
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:39,020
I never meant to harm or make fun of anyone

319
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,940
If they weren't satirical then
they were lewd paintings

320
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,090
Why do you condemn my paintings?

321
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,890
Condemn?

322
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,790
What I painted were natural humans

323
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,720
The natural weakness of minds
easily seduced and swayed by love

324
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,250
I thought you would understand,
of all people!

325
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,780
What rubbish!?

326
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,690
You made vile paintings

327
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,880
Labelling them beautiful
won't make them beautiful

328
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,590
I can endure your insulting me but

329
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:14,290
I cannot allow you to insult my work

330
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:18,620
Enough! Do you want to get
expelled from the court?

331
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,610
I was asked to look after it
while he's away on business

332
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,080
Merchant KIM's warehouse

333
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,550
He only allows handful of men here
and changes the lock frequently

334
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:02,980
How do they make this?

335
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,750
You're free

336
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,160
You haven't visited in 3 years...

337
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,190
You said you'll never come back

338
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:44,210
Look how hot it is

339
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:20,620
I know who you would rather embrace

340
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,920
but it's me you're holding
in your arms tonight

341
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,580
Please, don't go!

342
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,680
Looky!

343
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,620
You filthy faggot!

344
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,320
How did it feel?

345
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,580
Let go!

346
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:51,330
Tell me, is that how you won
the heart of Master KIM?

347
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:56,490
You, vile two-faced faggot!

348
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:59,480
Let me have a piece of you, too!

349
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:16,180
Choose!

350
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,650
Die for contempt of the court
or leave for good!

351
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,460
Now that I'm leaving,

352
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,440
I'm remorseful
of the wrong I did you in envy

353
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,080
Please accept my apology

354
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,850
I cannot take your cup
but I'm happy to forget the past

355
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,020
Thank you

356
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,180
Bring in the girls

357
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:55,620
Sirs!

358
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,920
I almost died waiting!

359
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:03,350
You won't say no to women, surely?
This is how men make up

360
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:04,290
Sure is!

361
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:09,880
You're so fair

362
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:13,540
Let's see if your thing is
good-looking, too

363
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,620
I need the loo...

364
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:26,150
Don't bother with the trip
I'll take care of your waterworks

365
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,350
Let me accompany you, dear sir

366
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:42,020
Let's see! Let's see!

367
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,890
Wait for your turn!

368
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,420
He is a true player

369
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:13,710
How he teases her

370
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:59,250
What's there to see?

371
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:15,580
What's so great about painting?
Is it worth living a lie?

372
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:20,150
Thank you for helping me out

373
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:26,550
Maybe you can sacrifice even love?

374
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:32,180
How about this

375
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:38,280
Look at the color!

376
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,480
This one?

377
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:44,720
Man, you're picky!
We've been doing this all day

378
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:51,090
You have an eye for treasure!

379
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,120
This one here?

380
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,520
Good choice! It'll capture
any woman's heart...

381
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:09,460
It's too elegant for my taste
I've not worn it once

382
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:14,380
It'll take at least a month to get
a dress made. So, how about it?

383
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,160
You don't want it because
it belongs to a courtesan?

384
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:24,780
Why are you being so kind?

385
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:31,670
I can spot a good man
That's why

386
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,410
How much is the dress?
I don't have much on me...

387
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,820
I received this from the man
who I wanted to marry

388
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,790
I told him I wanted to be with him
during the day as well as nights

389
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,620
He gave me this beautiful dress

390
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,960
and never came back

391
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:54,850
I can see you'll never betray your woman

392
01:00:54,850 --> 01:01:00,720
Woman who wears this will be happy
and that'll make me happy

393
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,350
The lines are wrong
They're weak and shaky

394
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:35,920
Keep redrawing them until you get it right

395
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:45,580
I'm planning to go somewhere tomorrow

396
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:50,590
I've seen the hearts of men
while painting the commoners

397
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:58,060
My desire to see more is so strong
I can't sleep at night

398
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:01,360
You are a court painter who knows
the morals and laws of painting

399
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:05,480
You must always discipline yourself
when come in contact with the lowly

400
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,860
Too much is never better than lacking

401
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,130
But sir...

402
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:14,750
The exams are not far away
Refrain yourself from outings

403
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:17,350
Focus wholly on practice

404
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:57,950
I want to see how beautiful you are

405
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,340
Look

406
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,780
You're the fairest of all of Joseon

407
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,320
I hope to make a good sale on this trip

408
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:49,690
so I can buy you new equipments

409
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:51,880
Why are we going to the temple?

410
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,280
So I can pray

411
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:56,250
I'll pray that we live together happily,

412
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,590
painting pictures and making mirrors

413
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:12,780
For your view, ma'am

414
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,080
Let's have a look

415
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,380
Where are you going?

416
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:21,680
- What are all these?
- He brought everything!

417
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,410
It's the musk from silver deer

418
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,590
If only I can make any use of it

419
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:34,220
Wear it in front of your husband and
he'll be all over you like a mad dog

420
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:38,450
Like a dog?
I'll take all of it!

421
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,810
I don't see Madam YOON

422
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:44,120
Is she still praying?

423
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:47,190
She spends all her life praying

424
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:52,280
How many years has it been?
It'll be quicker to find a donor

425
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,460
Father!

426
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:25,790
If I fail to produce an heir again...

427
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:27,690
I'll be thrown out

428
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,410
This is the mirror that shows
one's sins from present life

429
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:28,620
When a man dies, the hell lord
places him in front of the mirror

430
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:32,710
Then it reveals all that
he has done in his life

431
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:37,420
Because of you...

432
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,390
Our family lost its only heir

433
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:44,010
How dare a girl try to paint!

434
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,680
Arrest all!
Monks and women regardless!

435
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:00,990
Arrest all!

436
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,020
Come here!

437
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,560
By the royal order of His Majesty the King!

438
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,960
Let go of me!

439
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,880
Do you know who I am?!

440
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:56,380
- Kang-mu!
- Go! Run!

441
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:17,310
I'll be right behind you

442
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,370
I promise!
I'll find you no matter what!

443
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:36,080
Yun-bok!

444
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:52,970
I can't lose you

445
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,810
Subject

446
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:44,420
Exquisite Beauty

447
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:58,880
Those who pass this exam will serve
the King in close vicinity

448
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,950
You shall all do your best

449
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:09,120
Madam!

450
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,280
Sod it!

451
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:13,010
How am I to live with this shame?

452
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:23,710
Looking at it gives me hard-on

453
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,860
I'll keep this by the bed

454
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:28,480
and do my wife everyday

455
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,590
With your wife, you'll need that

456
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:32,710
What?!

457
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:39,550
Life's unfair. You know that...

458
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,320
By King's order, we arrest all those

459
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:46,120
committing adultery in temples

460
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:49,060
and their rich families get them out

461
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,680
Be consoled that your life has saved many

462
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:57,690
After the execution tomorrow,

463
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:01,180
the temples and brothels will be
quiet for a while

464
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:04,980
Have a drink

465
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:17,790
What brings you here

466
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:20,520
so early in the day?

467
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:27,420
The dress that I gave you
I haven't seen you wear it

468
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:36,050
Something must have bothered you
You came to see me so early

469
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,250
What did you do with the dress?

470
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:43,490
I get more than ten rolls of silk
as gift every month

471
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:47,080
How can I remember a piece of cloth
that I received 3 years ago?

472
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:51,650
My servant sold it at the market
Perhaps she gave it to her niece

473
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:54,810
You're wrong to think you know men's mind

474
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:00,950
How dare I do that?

475
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:04,580
but I know a little about a man's body

476
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:09,760
Likewise, I cannot know your thoughts

477
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,410
but I know your body inside out

478
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,850
I'll give you my all

479
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:31,850
I'll stay with you and
do everything you ask of me

480
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:35,750
Please save Kang-mu

481
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:50,490
I have been greatly shocked and
saddened by the recent atrocities

482
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:52,420
committed by these criminals

483
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:57,790
the extent to which people abandon
values that constitute this country

484
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:03,650
has become truly unacceptable...

485
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:14,880
You take after your father

486
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:19,050
It puzzles me...

487
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:22,950
My arrows hit the target every time

488
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:26,820
Why do my orders fail to do that?

489
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:33,150
Mastering archery takes one man
but politics take many men

490
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:38,420
Why you asking me a tough favor?

491
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:43,850
Because I believe in the great
goodness of Your Majesty

492
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:09,460
No...

493
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,290
No! No!

494
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:15,350
No... No...

495
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:21,840
No!

496
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:44,250
Stop the execution!

497
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:49,060
It's the order of the King!

498
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,790
His Majesty the King has
reduced the penalty

499
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:52,150
Halt the execution!

500
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:54,350
The sinner is to be banished
to Isle of Geoje

501
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:41,350
Sir, please

502
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:46,920
tell her not to worry...
tell her that I'm okay

503
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:51,260
Be grateful that you're saved

504
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:53,890
and don't ever come back

505
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:57,290
Step aside!
We have a long way to go

506
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:12,480
I must be getting old
I seem to see spirits these days

507
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:17,790
I saw your brother in my dream

508
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:21,580
He was shedding blood tears

509
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:25,980
I kept wiping them but they wouldn't stop

510
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:30,820
How will I see his face after I die?

511
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:41,510
Listen carefully. The only way
to rectify the wrongs you did him

512
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:44,950
is to suck out KIM Hong-do dry

513
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:48,820
and become the greatest court painter

514
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:23,480
Prepare yourself for the court

515
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:21,260
I know you aren't being true to your heart

516
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,650
I only hope there is
be no more sadness because of me

517
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:38,150
I was the happiest when there was
nothing but painting between us

518
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:45,210
Such moment never existed

519
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:52,280
You know that from the beginning
my intentions weren't innocent

520
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:04,020
I had no choice but to love even that

521
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:14,740
Commutation, it sure is!
Half of them die on the way

522
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:19,590
Shall we head back now?
It looks like he's almost done up

523
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:21,980
We'll get in trouble if we're caught

524
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:23,980
Stop!

525
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:10,620
I prayed...

526
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:15,020
I would see you one more time before I die

527
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,350
All because of me...

528
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:32,410
Not your fault. Never!

529
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:03,680
is certainly a woman

530
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:20,890
So busy keeping the King company
maybe you'll be made his concubine

531
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,450
Kang-mu is back

532
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:28,920
He's with your beloved pupil

533
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:32,650
I think they're running away tonight

534
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:34,640
That cannot be!

535
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:47,550
You really don't know women, do you?

536
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:51,920
Or is it love that you don't know?

537
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:23,650
It's late
Why are you still up?

538
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,480
I was waiting for you

539
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:30,350
Something bothering you?

540
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:40,720
No. I thought that
I never gave you anything

541
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,320
I want to present you a painting

542
01:29:25,450 --> 01:29:26,850
Don't go...

543
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:33,610
Please!

544
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:50,780
Let's bring him into the house

545
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:54,140
He can live with us and help you paint

546
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:30,850
Are you certain about your accusations?

547
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,610
Tonight it is

548
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:38,190
It's your only chance to get rid of them

549
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,720
The poison will start spreading soon

550
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,090
I have the antidote

551
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:57,350
but if you make another step,
I can't give it to you

552
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:00,920
Give her up!

553
01:32:01,130 --> 01:32:03,680
You can't do anything for her

554
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:07,690
I can't let her throw her life away and
live as an exile for the rest of her life

555
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:09,520
Is that it?

556
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:12,190
Is that the reason?

557
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,680
We don't want much

558
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:23,720
We just want to be with each other
for the rest of our lives

559
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:29,350
How long do you think
that feeling will last?

560
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:33,980
You either live the moment and die
or live with the memories

561
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:36,920
You can't have it both ways

562
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:54,750
Erase her from your memories
Don't ever see her again

563
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:57,320
Her face, the eyes, the smile

564
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:59,950
Wipe it clean off your heart

565
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:06,020
I beg of you. Please...

566
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:29,090
I've never loved her half-heartedly

567
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:32,090
Never once been untruthful with my heart

568
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:38,420
You don't know what it has been for me!

569
01:37:32,190 --> 01:37:35,710
No... No!

570
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:58,120
Hyewon joined Dohwaseo
under false pretence of a man

571
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:01,590
and by doing so,
brought the court into contempt

572
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:06,090
I beg Your Majesty to record
her wrongdoings in the book

573
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:08,920
so the shame will pass down to
generations yonder

574
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:11,930
I beg you also to punish
her father and KIM Hong-do

575
01:38:11,930 --> 01:38:17,150
for conspiring the evil deed

576
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:20,990
Why did you deceive my trust?

577
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:28,380
You spoke of virtues in front of me

578
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:32,270
but you disdained the court
with lewd pictures

579
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:36,550
I have no shame for my paintings

580
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:41,760
They are what my hand painted

581
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:46,510
The frailty of human that is
in love is so beautiful,

582
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:51,160
so beautiful, I had to paint them.

583
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:09,020
Your Majesty!
That poor child painted

584
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:12,780
thousands of pictures for her dead brother

585
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:17,180
All she wanted was to paint

586
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:22,320
I used her passion to fulfill my greed

587
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:27,680
I am solely to blame for
the crime she committed

588
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:29,980
Please, kill me

589
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:31,820
Be quiet!

590
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:35,880
Remove that prisoner's tongue!

591
01:39:36,110 --> 01:39:38,580
Hyewon and KIM Hong-do shall be beheaded!

592
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:41,270
Your Majesty!

593
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:43,820
KIM Hong-do has served the court

594
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,610
with undeterred loyalty

595
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:49,780
It would be unjust to punish him

596
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:53,150
without determining the extent of
his involvement in the affair

597
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:56,440
Please have mercy!

598
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,710
Take them away

599
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:06,150
Interrogate them until cries of remorse
are heard from their proud mouths

600
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:34,080
Why didn't you say anything?

601
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:42,650
Set him free

602
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:44,280
His Majesty wishes to set him free

603
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:59,840
You refuse to speak?

604
01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:09,950
Then, let the picture
speak your mind

605
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:21,680
Teacher has always disapproved
of my paintings

606
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:28,810
He only found out last night
that I was a woman

607
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,240
Last night,

608
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:36,050
I had a row with the mirror-maker

609
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:42,290
and have accidentally killed him

610
01:41:44,190 --> 01:41:47,510
Teacher found out

611
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:53,580
and captured me before the troops arrived

612
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:59,970
If that is the truth,
you shall not avoid death penalty

613
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:06,780
It's the truth, Your Majesty!

614
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:41,510
I destroyed her innocence

615
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:46,340
Unprejudiced insight that saw beauty

616
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:51,520
in what others condemned as filth

617
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:55,320
I destroyed it with my lust

618
01:42:56,650 --> 01:43:00,020
One can only live so long

619
01:43:02,290 --> 01:43:05,150
I'm not afraid of death

620
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:13,620
My only remorse is that

621
01:43:16,050 --> 01:43:18,520
I couldn't defend her innocence

622
01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:37,040
Hyewon SHIN Yun-bok who brought
shame to Dowhaseo shall be banished

623
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:39,940
KIM Hong-do shall be pardoned

624
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:01,840
Why...

625
01:44:04,990 --> 01:44:11,910
Why did you go through with that to save me?

626
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,070
Under a thin coat

627
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:01,150
the love filling her tender bosom,

628
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:05,150
I convey through the tip of the brush
