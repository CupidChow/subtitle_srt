I'd like you to take him on a trip

4
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,440
to Davichmetha for a break.

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,920
Since we've already come
all the way from Davin,

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,240
we shall make the most of it.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,040
You're dying to know

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,480
if Khanin and Charan

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,920
are actually dating, right?

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,120
Charan...

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,920
Whenever it rains.

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,080
Mother!

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,400
It terrifies me.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,920
You've taken care of me so much.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,760
Now, it's my turn to take care of you.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,180
♫So my heart's solely made♫

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,120
♫Just for you, my one and only♫

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,690
Uh...

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,960
I...

20
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,040
Oh...

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,560
You're back, Young Prince?

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,080
Uh... I...

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,680
I nodded off.
I have no idea what happened.

24
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,960
So, where did you go?
Did you have fun?

25
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll see you tomorrow,
Your Royal Highness.

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,760
What perfect timing, Chakri.

27
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,100
Just go to bed now.

28
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,860
I'm sleepy.

29
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,280
Should I take you...

30
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,520
Leave.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,760
Oh...

32
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,840
Okay.

33
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,550
Jay...

34
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,960
You're up?

35
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,680
Any idea what you did last night?

36
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,240
Oh, hey.

37
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,840
Are you okay?

38
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
Jay?

39
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,520
- You don't know who I am, do you?
- I do.

40
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,120
So you know I'm a prince?

41
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,320
You're totally wasted, Calvin.

42
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,560
Jay, give me a ride.

43
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,080
What?

44
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,840
Hey, Calvin.

45
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,760
Calvin...

46
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,520
I'm sorry

47
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,280
for bothering you.

48
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,240
It's totally fine.

49
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,040
We're friends now.

50
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,720
You were so drunk last night.

51
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,440
You couldn't even talk straight,

52
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,420
so I didn't catch who you came with.

53
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,640
Anyway,

54
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,480
why did you come to this city?

55
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
To see my friend.

56
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Like, a friend?

57
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,440
I came to see a friend, too.

58
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,600
Right,

59
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,510
while you were still asleep,

60
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
I went out and bought some food.

61
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,960
Well...

62
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,630
This place you're staying at...

63
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,010
is pretty massive.

64
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,080
And it looks really nice.

65
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Seems like you are...

66
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,480
a super rich exchange student.

67
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,560
Or perhaps,

68
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,770
are you a prince in disguise?

69
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
You actually fell for it?

70
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,100
That would make a good series.

71
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,420
If you were a prince,

72
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,760
we wouldn't have been friends.

73
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
You must have...

74
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,520
been friends with the rich guys,

75
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,340
businessmen,

76
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,250
or those royal family members,

77
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,560
right?

78
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,960
Wow.

79
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,800
This is good.

80
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,240
You want this one?

81
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,800
This is just an appetizer.

82
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,240
Give it to me.

83
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,000
You can't even peel the paper off.

84
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,360
Here, have some.

85
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,850
After you lent me your handkerchief,

86
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,160
I started carrying my own around.

87
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,040
I haven't forgotten
to return yours, though.

88
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,820
I'll give it back once I get home.

89
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Thank you.

90
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,840
Anyway, where do you live?

91
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,880
I live in Meenanagarin.

92
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,050
If there's a long break sometime,

93
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,290
would you like to go there?

94
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
I'll show you around.

95
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
There are fish to see

96
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,930
and beaches to check out.

97
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
What do you think?

98
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
I want to go there.

99
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,480
I'll see you over the break, then.

100
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,400
Okay.

101
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,350
One sec.

102
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,040
Yeah, what's up?

103
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,620
The wildfire protest at five
has changed its location.

104
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,270
What? To where?

105
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,840
The city square.
You're still coming, right?

106
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,660
Uh...

107
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,680
Yeah, I'm coming.

108
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
I'll see you there.

109
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,620
Well,

110
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,710
I have to go see my friend.

111
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,120
There's a protest to raise awareness
about wildfires today.

112
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,780
Would you like to come along?

113
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,300
I might have to excuse myself.

114
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,140
I've got something to take care of.

115
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
I see.

116
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,600
Let's finish our meal
and head our separate ways.

117
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,520
Alright.

118
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,480
Oh...

119
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,520
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

120
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,400
You again, Chakri.

121
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,240
What do you mean, Your Royal Highness?

122
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
I see.

123
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,460
Whatever you command,
I am at your service, Young Prince.

124
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,820
I don't want anything.

125
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,880
There is no need to be hesitant.

126
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,520
Kindly command me, Young Prince.

127
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,860
Oh...

128
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,800
It seems you're in quite a hurry today.

129
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,040
Chakri!

130
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Only Charan is allowed to follow me.

131
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,600
Gosh...

132
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,840
Hey...

133
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,040
Why did you want me here?

134
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,040
What do you think?

135
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,000
I wanted to talk about
what happened in Davichmetha.

136
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,360
Okay.

137
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,680
You've saved me once again.

138
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,320
Who do you think did it?

139
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,640
Thank you very much,
Your Royal Highness.

140
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,000
Prince Chana?

141
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
I don't think so.

142
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,600
He wouldn't dare do that
in front of his daughter.

143
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,190
I can't be certain about this yet,

144
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,680
but I've had someone
watch the Bhuchongpisuts closely.

145
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,840
It's been revealed that
Prince Rachata is displeased

146
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,730
seeing you in the spotlight.

147
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
It felt more like a distraction

148
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,680
or a test.

149
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,120
If they really wanted to hurt me,

150
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,520
it wouldn't have been this sloppy.

151
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,320
I'm guessing they had another motive.

152
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,480
We must be extra cautious.

153
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,120
Who knows what could happen next?

154
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,440
It's okay.

155
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,600
I've got you by my side.

His Royal Highness is receiving
a great deal of attention.

It may seem inappropriate,

Shall I summon him
to see you now, Your Majesty?

Summon him.

170
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,800
I need to be clear.

171
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,740
Your Royal Highness,

172
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,400
a serious matter has arisen.

173
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,760
I know you're clever enough
to figure out why I summoned you.

174
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,640
I am well aware.

175
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,280
I beg your forgiveness
for the offense I have caused.

176
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,960

177
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,880
Your Royal Highness!

178
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,480
You need to wait, Your Royal Highness.

179
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,980
It is unacceptable
to take Khanin into such a location.

180
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,080
I hereby order your punishment

for neglecting your duty
to care for Khanin,

182
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,360
which exposed him to unnecessary danger.

183
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,840
You are dismissed
from your role as his coach

184
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,760

prohibited from seeing him.

185
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,840
I don't care.

186
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,360
Have you forgotten
the manners I taught you?

187
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,680
This is not the time!

188
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,320
Your Royal Highness...

189
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Chakri!

190
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,600
I have neglected my duty

191
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,000
and committed the offense
as you have decreed.

192
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,360
I am deserving of the punishment,
Your Majesty.

193
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,040
So you want me
to lose the Competition, Grandfather?

194
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,920
You are not allowed
to interfere in this matter.

195
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,560
You can't dismiss him.

196
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I do not consent to it.

197
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,240
You don't need to worry.

198
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
An excellent coach has been appointed.

199
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,680
The Assavadevathins
shall forever stand above all.

200
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,110
- I don't think...
- Khanin!

201
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,040
My commands are absolute.

202
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,280
This is none of your concern.

203
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,640
Your Royal Highness...

204
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,040
Please come here.

205
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,000
Khanin may not know,

206
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,360
but you should know the reason
behind my actions.

207
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,580
How could it not be my concern?

208
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,860
- Your Royal Highness!
- Stop it.

209
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,660
If I can't even vent in my own space,

210
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,940
why bother being a prince at all?

211
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,240
May you find calm, Your Royal Highness.

212
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,470
It's ill...

213
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,600
striving against the stream.

214
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,320
I'm already backing off!

215
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,480
You may be a prince,

216
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,100
but remember

217
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,340
that your grandfather is the King,
Your Royal Highness.

218
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,520
Our agent within Davin Palace reports

219
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,240
an abrupt replacement
of Prince Khanin's coach.

220
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,440
Mr. Charan is now confined

221
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,890
and barred from seeing
His Royal Highness.

222
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,120
That old man

223
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,080
can't stand the idea of his grandson
being with someone of a lower class.

224
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,880
You think you're so superior, huh?

225
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,800
I saw this as the perfect chance

226
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,560
to have our agent inserted
beside Prince Khanin.

227
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,800
Coincidentally, among the names
for the new coach

228
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,160
is a fencer who is one of ours.

229
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,120
Thus, I have taken
appropriate action accordingly.

230
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
How did it go?

231
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Did His Majesty choose him?

232
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,180
It's good news for us,
Your Royal Highness.

233
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Great.

234
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,120
Make sure he reports
on everything about Khanin.

235
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,840
I won't let him miss a single detail,
Your Royal Highness.

236
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
The Bhuchongpisuts

237
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,290
shall rise to the throne again.

238
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,750
His Majesty has assigned this coach

239
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,390
to be your personal trainer,
Your Royal Highness.

240
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,560
I am Joe, Your Royal Highness.

241
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,230
He used to be
on the national fencing team

242
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,040
and is proficient in several sports,

243
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,400
including archery, Your Royal Highness.

244
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,000
Please extend my thanks to His Majesty.

245
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,360
Training may start tomorrow.

246
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,760
Do you think...

247
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,640
I can text Charan that...

248
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
If you don't wish for him
to face a harsher punishment,

249
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,440
don't let anyone hear you mention him.

250
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,520
About getting in touch,

251
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,000
I think...

252
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
his phone must have been taken away.

253
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Can you check on him for me, then?

254
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,080
Find out where he is and how he's doing.

255
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,960
And if you happen to see him,

256
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,840
please convey my apologies.

257
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,840
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

258
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
No need to be formal, dear.

259
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,780
Alright, Father.

260
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,240
I've heard about your new coach.

261
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,840
Is everything okay with you?

262
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
It is, Father.

263
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,640
Did you come here today
on official business?

264
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,000
I was worried about you,

265
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,000
so I made up some business to come here.

266
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,080
Thank you, Father.

267
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,080
Khanin,

268
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,720
I want you to realize that

269
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,000
endangering a prince's life

270
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,320
is a grave offense.

271
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,240
Charan's confinement

272
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,160
is already an act of kindness
from His Majesty.

273
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,920
But it's not fair.

274
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,880
He was trying to protect me.

275
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,000
Without him,

276
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,600
I have no one else to trust.

277
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,320
Being a prince

278
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,800
with the duty to compete
in the Competition is not easy, dear.

279
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,610
Khanin,

280
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,530
from now on,
you must always be vigilant.

281
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:46,730
Yes, Father.

282
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,210
Your Royal Highness,

283
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,800
we have stayed here longer than planned

284
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,320
and have now passed the scheduled time
to return to Davin.

285
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,440
It can wait.

286
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,960
They won't be so hard on me.

287
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
Ava!

288
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,280
Yes, Father?

289
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,530
Are you seriously going to hide
what happened that night from me?

290
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,520
Do you even realize what you've done?

291
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Just because the princes
can do something

292
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,840
doesn't mean
you're allowed to do the same.

293
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,080
Here we go again.

294
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,760
It's always about my gender.

295
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,040
How many more times
must I hear those things?

296
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,800
You're a woman. You need to accept it.

297
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,880
I have. What about you?
Have you accepted it yet?

298
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,980
Or have you always been disappointed
that your heir is a woman?

299
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,960
I shall take my leave to Davin,

300
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,960
and from now on,
I shall prove myself to you, Father.

301
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,320
Ava!

302
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,640
He should've come already!

303
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,240
Mr. Wirun,

304
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,920
may I take a couple of minutes
of your time?

305
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,080
Could you kindly tell me
where Mr. Charan is being confined?

306
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,160
Why do you need to know?

307
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,680
His Majesty's command

308
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,120
prevents him
from seeing His Royal Highness.

309
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,360
But I am not His Royal Highness,

310
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
am I?

311
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,290
Come on, Mr. Wirun.

312
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
I truly wish to see him.

313
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,480
Is it not possible for me
to know where he is?

314
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,360
The couple of minutes are up.

315
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,920
Guess I can go now, right?

316
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,720
Uh...

317
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,200
Where are you going?

318
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,920
To see Mr. Charan?

319
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Should I come along?

320
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,840
Would you like me
to prepare a meal set for him?

321
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,560
Well, I happen to be free right now.

322
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,640
Mr. Wirun!

323
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,800
Mr. Wirun!

324
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,390
What a mean guy.

325
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,960
Oh...

326
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,120
Hold on.

327
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,280
Who are you serving that to?

328
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,720
Uh, this is for...

329
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,560
Mr. Wirun.

330
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,840
I see.

331
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,720
It's Mr. Wirun's?

332
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,040
Yes.

333
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,280
Wow, some Thai snacks!

334
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,950
I didn't know

335
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,190
he enjoyed Thai snacks, too.

336
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
Neigh!

337
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Neigh...

338
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Neigh!

339
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,880
Chakri.

340
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,800
Gosh,

341
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,320
Mr. Charan.

342
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,920
You scared me.

343
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,340
My heart dropped to my stomach!

344
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,480
How did you find me?

345
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,680
Were you following that royal attendant?

346
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,360
Well...

347
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
His Royal Highness

348
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,720
is very worried about you,

349
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,640
so he asked me to find you.

350
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
Also,

351
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
he asked me to apologize to you
on his behalf.

352
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,330
Please tell His Royal Highness

353
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,690
not to worry about me.

354
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,840
He should focus on his training

355
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,200
and be careful.

356
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,240
Pardon?

357
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
Be careful?

358
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,520
There are plenty of coaches
in this country,

359
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,200
yet somehow only this one
happened to be available.

360
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,920
I have a feeling this new coach

361
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,160
is somehow tied
to Prince Rachata's actions.

362
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,760
Okay. Understood.

363
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,880
I'll take care of His Royal Highness.

364
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,800
And I won't let him know

365
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,280
that you're here.

366
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Uh...

367
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,080
But...

368
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
just to be sure,

369
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,200
are you really okay being here?

370
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,400
I actually like it here.

371
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,880
Just can't go anywhere for now.

372
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,800
His Majesty didn't mean
to punish me too harshly.

373
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,280
The reason is just...

374
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,720
I'll go back inside.

375
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,880
Oh, okay.

376
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,840
Chakri,

377
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,560
please keep a close watch
over His Royal Highness.

378
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,000
Yes.

379
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,800
Well done, Your Royal Highness.

380
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
You've shown great endurance.

381
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,239
I believe someone once told you

382
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,360
that your greatest strength
is your speed.

383
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
I am aware.

384
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,139
But your weakness
lies in your endurance.

385
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,679
You run out of energy early
as your skills aren't strong enough.

386
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,090
We'll have to push harder in training
from now on.

387
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,280
You've trained hard today.

388
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,800
Yeah.

389
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,880
Thanks, Chakri.

390
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Since you were busy
with practice all day,

391
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,240
I...

392
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,600
haven't had the chance
to share the news yet.

393
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,800
What?

394
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,000
Have you found Charan?

395
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,320
Yes.

396
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,160
He is doing alright,

397
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,080
and he wanted me to tell you

398
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,120
not to worry about him.

399
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
He said you should focus
on your training

400
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,040
and be careful, Your Royal Highness.

401
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,720
I can't go to him, can I?

402
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,680
Should you insist

403
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,320
on sneaking out to meet him,

404
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,860
it will surely be discovered.

405
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
And now,

406
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,920
the punishment could be
even more severe.

407
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,560
Therefore, you can't see him.

408
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,160
I affirm with my honor as your butler

409
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,240
that he is indeed safe,
Your Royal Highness.

410
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
Again, Your Royal Highness.

411
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,960
Again.

412
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
Again.

413
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Again.

414
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,360
That was too weak.

415
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,040
Again.

416
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,160
Again.

417
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,240
Again.

418
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,320
Again.

419
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,160
Again, Your Royal Highness.

420
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
That's enough!

421
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,480
He might get injured.

422
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,480
Here,

423
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,160
let me help.

424
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,000
I was gonna stop after all.

425
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
But you haven't been
performing well yet.

426
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
You've only managed
to hit the bullseye a few times.

427
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
I can't keep going anymore.

428
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,820
Let's just do it later.

429
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,840
Oh, Your Royal Highness...

430
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,360
Who do you think you are?

431
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,560
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

432
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,320
No one has ever disregarded
my commands before.

433
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,360
No one ever ignores what I say, either.

434
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,520
I said I couldn't keep going.

435
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,560
Do you want me to end up injured?

436
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,100
It's odd.

437
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,100
Pardon me, Your Royal Highness?

438
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,200
Ever since I came here

439
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,280
and became a prince,

440
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,640
I've never had this feeling before.

441
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,680
Are you referring to...

442
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,240
Coach Joe, Your Royal Highness?

443
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,200
Yeah.

444
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,080
Do you feel the same way I do, Chakri?

445
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,880
Yes, I do.

446
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,160
His tone, expression, and demeanor

447
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,880
seem lacking in sincerity.

448
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,240
Be assured, however,

449
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,840
that I...

450
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,640
will not allow any harm to befall you.

451
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,560
You have my words.

452
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,720
So...

453
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,400
Shall we proceed

454
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,120
with our first lesson today?

455
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,840
Today's lesson focuses on
the geography of Emmaly.

456
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,760
Anything else I need to improve?

457
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,680
Your archery skills are truly impressive,
Your Royal Highness,

458
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,720
yet there's one thing
that needs improvement.

459
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,120
The most important point is that,

460
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,140
when it is time to rest,

461
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,580
you must indeed rest.

462
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,800
And now is the time.

463
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,000
- But if I don't...
- Your Royal Highness,

464
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,240
please don't put too much pressure
on yourself.

465
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,320
I can't

466
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,160
since I don't wish for Father
to reproach me again,

467
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,320
especially regarding the Competition.

468
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,080
Let us practice archery here instead.

469
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,160
New surroundings

470
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
may help lighten the mood.

471
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,160
Since the archery competition
will take place in a simulated field,

472
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,600
practicing here
would be quite effective.

473
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,000
I have also heard that Charan...

474
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,640
often comes here for workouts, right?

475
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,160
Mr. Charan?

476
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,480
I knew it.

477
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,480
Your Royal Highness,

478
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,640
I do not feel at ease with him.

479
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,760
The bow you'll be using today
differs slightly from the previous one.

480
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,880
I have made some adjustments
to better suit your needs.

481
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,600
I prefer the one I've been using.

482
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,040
Now.

483
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,880
Now.

484
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,120
Now.

485
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,440
Now.

486
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,320
Now.

487
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,640
Now.

488
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,520
Your Royal Highness,

489
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,880
are you okay?

490
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,320
Your Royal Highness...

491
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,840
Your Royal Highness!

492
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,960
Your Royal Highness...

493
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,840
Your Royal Highness!

494
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,760
Your Royal Highness!

495
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,000
Your Royal Highness,

496
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,320
can you hear me?

497
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,200
Get the doctors now!

498
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,050
Your Royal Highness!

499
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,480
- What happened to him?
- He collapsed

500
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,720
after an archery training session.

501
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,220
It may have been too intense.

502
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,160
Please have all of his food
and belongings thoroughly inspected.

503
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,580
This may involve poisoning.

504
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,420
Understood.

505
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,040
Head to the kitchen

506
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,140
and carry out an inspection.

507
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:44,980
Your Royal Highness...

508
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,000
Your Royal Highness!

509
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,480
You...

510
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,560
Go find Coach Joe at once.

511
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,600
Now!

512
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,400
Come on.

513
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,920
His Royal Highness is now safe,

514
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,960
but he has not yet awakened.

515
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,880
How did the poison reach him?

516
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,880
I have confirmed that

517
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,040
the poison came from the bow,
Your Royal Highness.

518
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,720
The amount was not large,

519
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,880
but His Royal Highness
had prolonged exposure.

520
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,440
Fortunately, Mr. Charan intervened

521
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,320
and raised concerns
about the poison in time.

522
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,960
Had it been discovered any later,

523
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,760
His Royal Highness

524
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,360
might have suffered paralysis

525
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,520
or...

526
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,560
The blame rests solely with me,
Your Majesty.

527
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,080
Please allow me
to accept any punishment.

528
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,680
Should you bear the blame,

529
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,800
I must bear greater still.

530
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,160
I'm most curious as to how that coach
managed to embed himself among us.

531
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,800
The fault lies with my own negligence.

532
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,320
Please allow me
to accept any punishment, Your Majesty.

533
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,900
You all want punishment,

534
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,820
but without Charan's intervention
to save my grandson,

535
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,960
such punishment
would serve no purpose.

536
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,280
Thank you, Charan.

537
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,760
Your confinement is lifted,

538
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,800
and you shall be reinstated
as Khanin's coach.

539
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,480
Your command is my will.

540
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,600
My gratitude to you, Your Majesty.

541
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,200
I also entrust you with his care.

542
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,440
With the Royal Competition approaching,

543
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,280
trust becomes increasingly scarce.

544
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

545
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Your kindness is beyond measure.

546
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,840
I want to entrust you with something.

547
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,200
If it concerns the infiltrator,

548
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,880
I shall closely monitor the situation,
Your Majesty.

549
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,320
I wish to know

550
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,880
who stands against me,

551
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,560
no matter what means it takes.

552
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,920
Thank you
for keeping a close watch on him.

553
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,840
It is a great honor
to have carried out your command.

554
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,680
Who sent you here?

555
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,560
It was all staged.

556
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,400
No need to explain

557
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,640
what happens to those
who fail in their duties.

558
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,480
No one is behind this.

559
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,080
Very well.

560
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,880
If an order is given to get rid of you,

561
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,160
there's nothing we can do to help.

562
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,720
If I told you...

563
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,000
Why?

564
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,520
I want to be unharmed.

565
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,040
Just keep a close watch on him.

566
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,160
Your hands, please.

567
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,580
Any news on Khanin?

568
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,320
Currently,

569
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,040
there's a thorough investigation
into Prince Khanin's coach,

570
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,000
but it's being kept confidential.

571
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,760
So, is Khanin dead?

572
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,080
Your Royal Highness!

573
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,440
You should not express such thought
at a time like this.

574
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,000
You are worrying too much.

575
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,440
I, too, am concerned.

576
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,960
His death would take away all the fun.

577
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,440
My apologies, Your Majesty.

578
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,880
He must've been beheaded by now.

579
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
This won't end here.

580
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,640
Uncover the truth.

581
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,400
I will bring the culprit to justice!

582
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Princess Ava...

583
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,000
How is Khanin doing?

584
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,800
I came to check on him.

585
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,200
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

586
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,720
His Majesty has forbidden any visitors
to see His Royal Highness.

587
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,360
I'm afraid...

588
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,720
you're also not allowed to...

589
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,440
I understand.

590
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,400
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

591
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,440
Why are you treated as an outsider?

592
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,400
I am indeed not from this family.

593
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,840
♫I need your love♫

594
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,800
♫The only love I've longed for,♫

595
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,440
♫Just the word "love" from you,
and that's all♫

596
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,960
♫Let me hear it, I won't ask for more♫

597
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,280
♫I need your love♫

598
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,640
♫The only one I adore,♫

599
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:58,720
♫My heart's been waiting
just for you, my all♫

600
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,360
Your Royal Highness,

601
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,920
- can you hear me?
- Your Royal Highness...

602
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,240
- Your Royal Highness...
- Get the doctors now!

603
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,760
You're awake, Your Royal Highness.

604
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,000
Are you able to sit up?

605
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:28,880
Please have some water first.

606
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,560
How are you feeling,
Your Royal Highness?

607
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,160
My head aches,

608
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,200
and my eyes hurt.

609
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,140
What happened to me?

610
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,080
You were poisoned.

611
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,800
You've been unconscious
for two full days and nights.

612
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,120
Poisoned?

613
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,680
The poison came from the bow you used.

614
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,360
Coach Joe attempted to harm you,
Your Royal Highness.

615
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,280
Shall I...

616
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,640
summon the royal physicians
to examine you, just to be safe?

617
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Okay.

618
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,240
What about...

619
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,920
Anything you wish, Your Royal Highness?

620
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,920
Oh...

621
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,240
Mr. Charan...

622
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,640
suspected the presence of poison,

623
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,920
allowing the royal physicians
to save you in time.

624
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,760
So,

625
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,320
shall I summon Mr. Charan
to see you now?

626
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,400
As you wish, Your Royal Highness.

627
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:06,840
Uh...

628
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,000
In fact, he's been keeping vigil

629
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,200
by your side throughout the nights.

630
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,040
Oops...

631
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,520
What did I just say?

632
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,440
Let's just forget it.

633
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,160
I'll go get him immediately.

634
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,560
Your Royal Highness,

635
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,640
are you hurt?

636
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,960
If you hadn't suspected the poison,

637
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,640
I might have followed my dad
to the grave.

638
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,520
I am...

639
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,080
I am worried about you.

640
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,320
Thanks.

641
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,000
It was my fault.

642
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,960
I caused you to face such danger.

643
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,040
How could it be your fault?

644
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,560
You were dismissed.

645
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,040
However,

646
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:59,760
Mr. Charan has been reinstated
as your coach, Your Royal Highness.

647
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Really?

648
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,840
That's perfect!

649
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:13,140
I shall proceed
to prepare your meal in advance.

650
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,560
Welcome back, my royal guard.

651
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,280
You actually know how to smile.

652
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,920
It looks good on you.

653
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,240
Chakri didn't lie;
you did stay by my side.

654
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,600
I know this touch.

655
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:34,560
♫I trust you♫

656
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,400
♫The only one I trust, that's you♫

657
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,920
♫I trust you♫

658
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,580
♫No matter what this life may do,♫

659
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:48,720
♫Just promise me you will stay, too♫

660
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:54,240
♫A new world lies ahead,
and I'll follow you♫

661
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,080
I vow...

662
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,680
to protect you with my life.

663
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,840
♫So my heart's solely made♫

664
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,400
♫Just for you, my one and only♫

665
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,960
♫I'll look the other way,♫

666
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,440
♫Ignoring what others say♫

667
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,440
♫I'll just turn a blind eye,♫

668
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,120
♫Letting other voices pass by♫

669
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,320
♫Just for a few seconds,♫

670
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,780
♫My love is for no one else,♫

671
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:13,720
♫But you♫

672
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,200
♫Even if my life meets its end,♫

673
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,960
♫My love for you will never bend♫

674
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,350
♫Heaven and earth bear witness♫

675
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:40,390
♫Across all lifetimes,♫

676
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,040
♫Our love is endless♫

677
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:48,520
♫Forever will my heart stay loyal♫

678
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,960
It's his favorite.

679
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,400
♫Through the end of time♫

680
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,240
Lolane Intense Care, Water Treatment...

681
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,960
♫Just for you, my one and only♫

682
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,760
It feels like I forced you to do this.

683
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,080
I'm willing to do it.

684
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,880
♫I'll turn a blind eye♫

685
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,080
♫And just let other voices pass by♫

686
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:23,920
What a nice smell.

687
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,200
I'll have Chakri order more of it.

688
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:29,439
But without you,

689
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,840
I'm not sure
it would've smelled this good.

690
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,399
I don't wanna sleep anymore.

691
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,120
I've done that all day long.

692
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,479
I have fully recovered.

693
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,520
Seriously.

694
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,399
That's good news,

695
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,600
but you must still rest.

696
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,939
Now that I'm better,

697
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,439
you won't stay anymore, will you?

698
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,880
You no longer need to stay as my guard,

699
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,480
but may we be together

700
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,800
as something else?

701
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,600
I want you to touch me here...

702
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,880
Here...

703
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,840
And here.

704
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,800
And...

705
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,600
Do I really have to tell you...

706
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,640
where I want your touch?

707
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,200
You are allowed to cross the line.

708
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,700
If I do...

709
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,140
It's just us here.

710
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,480
It's you, Charan,

711
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,120
and me.

712
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,200
I know.

713
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,440
Just me and you.

714
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,120
Do you still remember
the tale of the Emmalian kiss?

715
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,040
Always.

716
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,880
I humbly ask for your permission...

717
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,680
♫The world's a fairy tale,♫

718
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,970
♫In your arms tonight♫

719
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,880
♫I wish to stop this time,♫

720
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:41,440
♫And call you my endless light♫

♫You made my dream come true♫

♫Hold me so tight,♫

Breathe.

♫Hold me so tight,♫

735
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:02,600

Ran.

737
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,080
What?

738
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,280
Still find it strange?

739
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,360
It feels nice,
just being together like this.

740
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,520
Then, let's be together for eternity.

741
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,640
You don't need to worry
about anything now

742
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,240
because I'll be here for you.

743
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,160
Prince Calvin just told me

744
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,840
he's visiting Meenanagarin.

745
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,120
Would you like to join my trip?

746
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,800
This is June, my sister.

747
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,600
Now I understand
why you're part of the protesters.

748
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,120
♫The only love I've longed for,♫

749
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:14,720
♫Just the word "love" from you,
and that's all♫

750
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:17,200
♫Let me hear it, I won't ask for more♫

751
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:20,520
♫I need your love♫

752
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,600
♫The only one I adore,♫

753
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:32,500
♫My heart's been waiting
just for you, my all♫

754
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:43,080
♫Oh, I need your love♫
