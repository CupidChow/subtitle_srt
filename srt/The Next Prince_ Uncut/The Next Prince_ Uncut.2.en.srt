00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,310
Prince Khanin,

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,640
you carry the blood of royalty.

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,980
All these years,

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,000
was I never truly your son in your eyes?

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,090
It's never been like that.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,720
I'm not going to Emmaly.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,960
He doesn't have a choice.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,440
Why wouldn't I?

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,920
It's my life.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,000
Go.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,220
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,120
Dad!

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,480
Come on.

16
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,400
Khanin, go!

17
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,720
- Dad.
- I'll be right there!

18
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,479
Just go!

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,200
- Go!
- Come on.

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,360
Go with Charan!

21
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,280
Get them!

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,200
Dad...

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,840
Let's go.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,720
Hurry.

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,720
Watch out.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,400
Dad...

27
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,670
Watch out!

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,040
Dad!

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,120
- Dad...
- Come with me.

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
Let go of me.

31
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,880
Let go. My dad needs help.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,800
Khanin!

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,210
Let go of me.

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,240
Calm down.

35
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,460
Is this how you're gonna repay
your dad's efforts?

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,720
Come on.

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,480
Hurry.

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,980
I'm going back to my dad.

39
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,480
I cannot let you do that.

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,460
We need to go now.

41
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,079
Please...

42
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,680
Charan...

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,240
Let me go back to him.

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,160
You can't.

45
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,920
We need to leave this place.

46
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,590
Hey!

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,360
Drop the gun.

48
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,380
Let's go.

49
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,280
Hey,

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,160
now!

51
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
My apologies, sir.

52
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,960
Khanin made it.

53
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,440
All evidence has been dealt with.

54
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,440
I'll get the job done once I find him.

55
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,480
You need to stay here with me.

56
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,800
How can you know it's safe?

57
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,280
They might be after us.

58
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Trust me.

59
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
We're safe here.

60
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
It's the perfect size.

61
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,840
You really do know me well.

62
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,920
Hey,

63
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,720
is this necessary?

64
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,790
My dad might call me!

65
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,630
Hey,

66
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,370
he would never risk
exposing your location

67
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,110
by contacting you by phone.

68
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,720
He trusts me.

69
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,910
If you don't trust me,

70
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
at least trust your dad.

71
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,200
What can I say if my dad trusts you?

72
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,360
Let's just get some rest.

73
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,360
We've been through a lot today.

74
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,880
Are you hungry?

75
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,840
What are you craving? I'll order it.

76
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,600
We might need to stay here
for a few days.

77
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,600
Things are unpredictable.

78
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm worried about your safety.

79
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,760
Get some sleep, okay?

80
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,120
Mm.

81
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,040
Thanks.

82
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,880
Hey...

83
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,480
- It hurts!
- Hey,

84
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,320
you want to be in danger, huh?

85
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,560
I'm going back to my dad.

86
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,120
You're only going to get yourself caught.

87
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,000
Thatdanai is
an extremely skilled soldier.

88
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,560
He has always protected you.

89
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,760
What do you think you could possibly do
by going there?

90
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,800
This phone doesn't work anymore,

91
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,000
and you're not allowed to use it.

92
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,280
I hope you understand

93
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,480
that your status must remain a secret.

94
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,940
How did you unlock the handcuffs?

95
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,680
Only one of my hands was handcuffed.

96
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
Anyone could easily unlock them.

97
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Show me.

98
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Your arm.

99
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,920
You wanted me to show you, didn't you?

100
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,720
Why did you have to learn that?

101
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,840
I have my own duties,

102
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,000
- and you have your...
- You're gonna say my duty

103
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,800
is to go back to Emmaly with you?

104
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,760
It's now time.

105
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,400
You must return to secure
the power of the Assavadevathins.

106
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,360
Power?

107
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,150
And ensure that Prince Tharin,
your biological father,

108
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,250
ascends the throne
as the next King of Emmaly.

109
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,250
Today's agenda is to review

110
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,500
the economic progress
of all regions, correct?

111
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

112
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,440
Let's start with Tharin.

113
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,560
The gold mining operations
of Assavadevathin

114
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,920
continue to yield results as projected.

115
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,000
Major clients from neighboring countries

116
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,760
have expressed great satisfaction
with the quality of our gold.

117
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,320
As for Bhuchongpisut,

118
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,520
we're now encountering
serious difficulties in exporting diamonds

119
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,680
due to the illegal importation of diamonds
from prohibited countries.

120
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,360
Would Your Majesty be able
to expedite the legislation

121
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,880
preventing the import of diamonds
from such countries?

122
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,360
I have not been idle.

123
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,200
The legislation process
must follow proper procedures.

124
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,680
I hope you understand.

125
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

126
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
How are Prince Chana's territory
of Davichmetha

127
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,840
and Prince Wasin's territory
of Meenanagarin faring?

128
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,440
We are facing no difficulties.

129
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,000
These numbers are only approximate.

130
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,840
We've begun selling gemstones
using blockchain technology,

131
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,760
and the figures are quite promising.

132
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,840
As for Meenanagarin,

133
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,740
our sincere thanks

134
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,600
go to the Assavadevathins
for their research support,

135
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,880
which has enabled
our dark champagne pearls

136
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,610
to have such distinctive qualities.

137
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,240
You're too humble.

138
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,040
We all are not strangers.

139
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,960
We should always help one another.

140
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,920
Father...

141
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,600
Please summon
the royal physician, Your Majesty.

142
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,640
Thank you, but I'm fine.

143
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,040
Not being able to meet
with Your Majesty regularly,

144
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,800
we can't help but feel concerned.

145
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,200
It's due to The Rule

146
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,510
that prohibits four of us

147
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,870
from entering the palace
without permission.

148
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,360
The Rule exists
to ensure the safety of everyone,

149
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,920
avoiding a tragedy
similar to what happened 22 years ago.

150
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

151
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,720
Right now...

152
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,990
We've finished the meeting.

153
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,030
Thank you all for coming.

154
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,590
You called for me.
Is there something, Father?

155
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,750
I've been keeping a secret from you.

156
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,470
Khanin's still alive.

157
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,430
Father...

158
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,530
What did you just say?

159
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,470
Khanin is on his way back.

160
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,560
I'll take good care of our son.

161
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,119
Why so serious?

162
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,950
It's just a fun practice, Ava.

163
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,280
I know it is,

164
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,190
but I'm afraid
I can't go easy on you, Ramil.

165
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,359
Whoever reaches 15 points first wins.

166
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,630
Game on.

167
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
En garde.
(On guard)

168
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,240
Êtes-vous prêts?
(Are you ready?)

169
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,120
Allez.
(Go)

170
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,010
Halte.
(Halt)

171
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,680
Êtes-vous prêts?
(Are you ready?)

172
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,340
Allez.
(Go)

173
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,920
Halte.
(Halt)

174
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,440
Halte.
(Halt)

175
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
A Davichmetha and a Bhuchongpisut...

176
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,040
Halte.
(Halt)

177
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,960
It's nice that they're good friends.

178
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,180
Halte.
(Halt)

179
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,040
They've actually been friends
since they were kids.

180
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,480
Halte.
(Halt)

181
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,720
They're almost like siblings.

182
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,040
Halte.
(Halt)

183
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,720
Attaque.
(Attack)

184
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,680
Parade-riposte.
(Parry-riposte)

185
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,080
Ramil's skills remain as sharp as ever.

186
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,200
His talent is undeniable,

187
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,400
just as expected
from the son of Prince Rachata.

188
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,280
Your skills are impressive.

189
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,720
May we have a return match next week?

190
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,160
That can be in Bhuchongpisut.

191
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,530
I don't think I can claim

192
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,040
that I've defeated
the marvelous young lady

193
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,480
who has such a gift for fencing like you.

194
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,920
Perhaps my victory

195
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,880
was due to your injury.

196
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,760
Oh, my God.

197
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,720
You're praising me too much, Ramil.

198
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
It wasn't too much.

199
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
With the news spreading,

200
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,560
it's a pity that you're a woman;

201
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,120
if not, you'd surely be
a fearsome competitor

202
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,000
in the Royal Competition.

203
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
However,

204
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,560
do you know why when the heir wins,

205
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,920
the father takes the throne?

206
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,200
Because in Emmaly,

207
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,910
raising an heir
is seen as equally important

208
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,350
to ruling the kingdom.

209
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,760
Even if I'm a woman,

210
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,160
I've studied the royal traditions
and Emmaly's history thoroughly.

211
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,640
From the Westerners, right?

212
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,000
You're still not as fluent in Emmaly
as you were.

213
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,840
Well, speaking isn't part
of the competition.

214
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Is that right?

215
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,360
Despite that, tradition says

216
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,640
women aren't allowed to compete.

217
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,840
It's so unfair

218
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,080
that I'm the only male heir
from all four clans.

219
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,560
Your Royal Highnesses...

220
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,200
I just remembered
I've got somewhere to go.

221
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,880
I shall take my leave now, Ramil.

222
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,200
Where have you been?

223
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I was...

224
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,400
accompanying Prince Rachata,
Your Royal Highness.

225
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,080
Are you confused about your duty?

226
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,360
You should be with me,

227
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,510
not with someone else.

228
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,640
Please let go of me,
Your Royal Highness.

229
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,240
If anyone sees us, we'll be in trouble.

230
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Who would see us?

231
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,680
Soon, we, the Bhuchongpisuts,
will reclaim the throne of this palace.

232
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,000
If anyone plans to gossip about us,

233
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,120
they'd better have some serious guts.

234
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
We need to change the plan.

235
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,400
I'll reach out to you once we're there.

236
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,620
We should leave now,
Your Royal Highness.

237
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,240
Can you speak normally?

238
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,200
No need for formalities.

239
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,320
Please.

240
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
And...

241
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,560
I still want to be here.

242
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,800
- I need to find my dad.
- You can't do that.

243
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,600
This place's too dangerous for you.

244
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,400
If Thatdanai made it,

245
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,560
the first place he'd go to is Emmaly.

246
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,840
He'd know you'd be there.

247
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,520
I still have no idea who hurt us.

248
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,360
You want me to just leave?

249
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,520
If you want to find out
who hurt you and your dad,

250
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,400
the only way is to go to Emmaly.

251
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,960
Fine.

252
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,120
If he's going there,

253
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,760
I'll go, too.

254
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,440
Now that the secret about you
is no longer safe from the enemy,

255
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,600
our journey to Emmaly won't be easy.

256
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,660
A message
from Mister Charan just came in,

257
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,050
stating that, for their safety,

258
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,060
the arrival may be delayed,

259
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,320
as the enemy knows about the plan
and is currently pursuing both of them.

260
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
My apologies.

261
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,400
What?

262
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,520
I was actually
intending to book business seats,

263
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,440
but I was worried that with fewer people,
it would attract more attention.

264
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,400
Why would you apologize?

265
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
What's with you?

266
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,280
I'm fine.

267
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,120
I'm ordinary.

268
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,600
It's not a big deal.

269
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,720
I also prefer a window seat.

270
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,630
Ladies and gentlemen,

271
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,710
we're passing through
the area of turbulence.

272
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,200
Please remain seated,
fasten your seat belt,

273
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,800
and refrain from using lavatories
until the seat belt sign goes off.

274
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,800
Thank you.

275
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

276
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,330
we're passing through
the area of turbulence.

277
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,870
Please remain seated,
fasten your seat belt,

278
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,560
and refrain from using lavatories
until the seat belt sign goes off.

279
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,450
Did you have a nightmare?

280
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,120
Worried that the plane would crash?

281
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,800
Hey...

282
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Can I ask you something?

283
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,320
Be honest.

284
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,720
You should already know
that taking me with you is dangerous.

285
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,800
Why are you still doing this job,

286
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,910
risking your life

287
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,360
and coming alone?

288
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,310
It's my duty, Your Royal Highness.

289
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,480
Come on.

290
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
No formality.

291
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,080
I flew across the skies

292
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,280
mainly to escort Your Royal Highness
back to Emmaly safely.

293
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,760
A duty...

294
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,400
Is that why my dad took care of me?

295
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,280
He must've only been doing his duty.

296
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,520
Thatdanai is an exceptional person,

297
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,160
entrusted with the important task
of looking after you.

298
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,800
While I can't speak for him,

299
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,130
I believe that for him,
it was not just a duty,

300
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,800
but something much more.

301
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,640
How come...

302
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,520
people still hunt others down
in this day and age?

303
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,480
In every age,

304
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,160
power remains with those who win.

305
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,420
And you?

306
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,860
Do you desire it, too?

307
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,520
Power doesn't matter to me,

308
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,880
but you do, Your Royal Highness.

309
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,400
What's gonna happen
when we arrive in Emmaly?

310
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,400
Once we're there, Your Royal Highness...

311
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,280
I said no formality.

312
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:45,900
Okay.

313
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,640
Once you make it to Emmaly,

314
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,360
you'll meet your family.

315
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,680
The family that I don't know.

316
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,620
When the time comes,

317
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,250
are you still gonna be there with me?

318
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,960
It's a lot better out here.

319
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,270
I get it

320
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,910
that if we fly straight to Emmaly,
we'll run into those guys waiting for us,

321
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,380
but isn't going to Hanoi
a shorter route?

322
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,120
They would've thought the same way.

323
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,150
We're still not safe here.

324
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,730
How can we go to Emmaly from here?

325
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,040
I know a friend in Thailand.

326
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
He can help us.

327
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,000
Should we go on a trip to Thailand?

328
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,480
It's close to Emmaly.

329
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Their culture and language
are similar to ours.

330
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
Why don't we just go to Emmaly then?

331
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,160
You miss that place, don't you?

332
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,320
I'm not ready to go there.

333
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,210
So...

334
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,280
we can just go to Thailand.

335
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,040
I'm fluent in Emmaly.

336
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,240
That means
I can speak Thai fluently, too.

337
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,240
My Thai friend once said

338
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,680
that my accent is exactly like a Thai's.

339
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm even better at it
than other languages I know.

340
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,120
One of my friends
also mentioned how good Thai food is.

341
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,100
Have you tried some?

342
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,280
I think I just scrolled past it.

343
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,720
Here, have you tried this?

344
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,230
Som tam...

345
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,870
Right, som tam!

346
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
My friend said it was heavenly.

347
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,640
"Som" means orange, but why is it
in the name of papaya salad?

348
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,560
Here.

349
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,880
Let's go.

350
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,560
Hey...

351
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,640
Yes?

352
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
Is everything okay?

353
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,120
Yeah.

354
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,760
You must not leave my side.

355
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,640
Okay.

356
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,080
We've been followed.

357
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Sorry for cutting the line.

358
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,240
That's alright.

359
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,360
You may go now.

360
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,400
What's the hurry?

361
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Where are you going?

362
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
This place.

363
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,600
Oh, that condo.
I've been there before.

364
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,360
Where have you guys been?

365
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,780
- Japan.
- I've been there.

366
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,920
I was working there ten years ago.

367
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,160
The pay was great.

368
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,200
Right...

369
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,800
You guys look pretty gorgeous.

370
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,500
Are you two stars?

371
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,680
Are you?

372
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,120
Are we not gonna talk?

373
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,400
Still here with me?

374
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,240
Can't you just say something to me?

375
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,450
Gosh.

376
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,040
Wait,

377
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,440
why are they tailgating us?

378
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,720
Okay, so you want this?

379
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,200
Fine, let's do it.

380
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Can you go faster?

381
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,080
Sure, we'll see.

382
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,920
Any faster, sir?

383
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,840
Here we go.

384
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
Bangkok Drift!

385
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,040
This is getting worse.

386
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,480
They're after you, aren't they?

387
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,920
I'll pull over. You guys have to leave.

388
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,000
[Chatuchak Market]

389
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,520
Leave now.

390
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,360
What do we do now?

391
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,639
They're still after us.

392
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Let's go inside first.

393
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,120
This way.

394
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,239
You two go there.

395
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,600
You're coming with me.

396
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
That's them!

397
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,680
Stay behind me.

398
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,640
Hey!

399
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,520
Charan...

400
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,600
Hey!

401
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
Are you alright?

402
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,240
Come on.

403
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Change your clothes.

404
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,920
Are you not going to change?

405
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,360
Give me your arm.

406
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,800
I'm good.

407
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,160
Give it.

408
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
You'll get sick.

409
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,520
Just worry about yourself.

410
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,080
Thank you.

411
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,320
- Your wound...
- It's alright.

412
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,780
I think they're gone.

413
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
What's next?

414
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,360
I've sent my friend our location.

415
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,000
Isn't it gonna cause him trouble?

416
00:38:58,970 --> 00:38:59,970
You lost your phone?

417
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,480
Hey,

418
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,600
how did you get in here?

419
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,240
We're sorry.

420
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,720
We were just avoiding the rain.

421
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,900
You're in my space
without my permission.

422
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,020
I'll call the police.

423
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Sir,

424
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,280
do you really think
we broke into this place?

425
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Wait, you look...

426
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,920
familiar.

427
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,560
You're like...

428
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,000
Like who?

429
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,990
Like that one famous singer.

430
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,840
Really?

431
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,680
Thank you, sir.

432
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,520
We're so sorry for being in here
without your permission.

433
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,400
We were really just avoiding the rain.

434
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,760
It was raining cats and dogs, and...

435
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,600
my friend's injured.

436
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,040
How did you get that wound?

437
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,560
A mad guy.

438
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
He even took our phones.

439
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,960
Can we borrow that to call our friend?

440
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,480
Please...

441
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,000
Please.

442
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
Well...

443
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,960
Sure.

444
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Thank you.

445
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,040
Please forgive my friends.

446
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,040
We're sorry for bothering you.

447
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,560
Come on, that's fine.

448
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,180
- I'm willing to help.
- I know.

449
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,040
I was really shocked, though.

450
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,840
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

451
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,640
Let's go.

452
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,670
Yo, big bro.

453
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
It's been ages,

454
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,360
and the first thing you do
is bring me trouble.

455
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,560
Thanks, though.

456
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,320
Here.

457
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,760
And who's this?

458
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:19,960
My brother.

459
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,880
Your brother?

460
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,200
Like, a biological one or...

461
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,640
You're such a pain in the ass.

462
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,440
What? Why so rude now?

463
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,090
Thank you for helping me...

464
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,800
and Ran.

465
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,240
No problem, bro.

466
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,400
Come on.

467
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,760
Let's go.

468
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,000
Take your seat.

469
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,960
Right,

470
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,600
I'm Vedish,

471
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,560
Ran's friend.

472
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,680
We went to the same school.

473
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,360
Yeah.

474
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,580
- What?
- What?

475
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,080
He's not your brother, is he?

476
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,060
Gosh...

477
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,760
The cat's out of the bag.

478
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,920
I knew it.

479
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,960
We met in the UK

480
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,160
before we...

481
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,560
started dating.

482
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,440
I knew it.

483
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,080
You're so quiet now, huh?

484
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,320
He's not.

485
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,040
My Unc-unc...

486
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,000
is the cutest!

487
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,800
You're getting chubbier, aren't you?

488
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,520
Look at those chubby cheeks!

489
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,440
Wait...

490
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,640
Did you just call him "Unc-unc"?

491
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,640
Oh, that's a nickname for my boyfriend.

492
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,800
It's from...

493
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,810
"Uncle."

494
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,320
Because he nags
like some grumpy old man.

495
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,280
How about you, Ran?

496
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,690
What do you call him?

497
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,400
That one, Unc-unc.

498
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,520
You always call me that.

499
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,520
Cutie.

500
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,960
Cutie.

501
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,200
Cutie?

502
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,800
I'm always like that, so you call me it.

503
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,600
"Naughty."

504
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,280
That's cute.

505
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,360
But it's like...

506
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,320
kinda too simple.

507
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,280
Let's call him...

508
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,040
"Tue-tue."

509
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,440
That also fits Unc-unc.

510
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,080
Tue-tue and Unc-unc.

511
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,280
Tue-tue?

512
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,400
Unc-unc...

513
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,440
can you call me "Tue-tue"?

514
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,640
Come on.

515
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,800
Okay,

516
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,840
my Tue-tue.

517
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,040
Hey, Ran.

518
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,080
Who hurt you and your boyfriend?

519
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,270
What did you guys do?

520
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,120
Why does everything
have to be so serious?

521
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,110
Can we talk for a moment?

522
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,960
Sure.

523
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,000
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

524
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,040
I did not mean to joke around with you.

525
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,120
You don't need to call me that.

526
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,600
Who said my status must remain a secret?

527
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,840
We can trust this guy.

528
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,090
What? I was going all out for that.

529
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,120
How can I make him stop bowing?

530
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,400
That's enough.

531
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,120
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

532
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,360
Please talk to me normally.

533
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,560
What's the plan for tomorrow?

534
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,160
You sure it's safe on trains?

535
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:03,450
Come on.

536
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,160
No matter where you go,
they'll catch you either way.

537
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,840
Don't worry.

538
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,520
I've got a plan.

539
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,640
Hello.

540
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,010
How can I help you?

541
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,520
Have you seen this person?

542
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,200
I think he just asked me for directions.

543
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,990
Right there! It's him.

544
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,040
Is it him?

545
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,520
Ran.

546
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,160
Let's go.

547
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,360
How's my plan?

548
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,400
What a flawless plan.

549
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,160
How can you not laugh at yourself?

550
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,220
We have no choice.

551
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,720
They're at the platform.

552
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,240
I'll be there first.

553
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,640
Don't get exposed, okay?

554
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,120
I'll see you there.

555
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Would you like anything?

556
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,240
Would you like anything?

557
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,080
Can I have this?

558
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,240
Oh, yes.

559
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,610
Thank you.

560
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,360
Thank you.

561
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,760
Now, that's better.

562
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,400
Peppermint Field?

563
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,120
Thai inhalers are so good.

564
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,200
They give a refreshing feeling.

565
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,280
Wanna try it?

566
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:37,790
It's great.

567
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Unc-unc,

568
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,880
do you think I'm a good actor?

569
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,120
You're a fair one.

570
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,760
No chance of getting any praise, huh?

571
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,700
I did amazing acting
like your boyfriend.

572
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,520
Vedish even fell for it.

573
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,960
Give me some attention.

574
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,120
Hey,

575
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,800
you don't need to pretend now.

576
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,880
Fine, I'll stop.

577
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,680
Thanks for protecting me.

578
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,800
When can I take this off?

579
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,120
It's making me laugh.

580
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,000
That's already good.

581
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,080
It's for your safety.

582
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,560
Before we arrive,
let's change our clothes.

583
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,200
Father...

584
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,120
Tell me.

585
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:16,850
I must head back to Assavadevathin
this evening.

586
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,960
That can wait.

587
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,040
Khanin is almost here.

588
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,680
To ensure
Assavadevathin remains unshaken,

589
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,080
I shall hold
the Royal Fencing Competition.

590
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,600
When are you going to do that?

591
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,200
By this evening, I shall declare to
the people that a new King

592
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,720
is to be chosen.

593
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,260
But Khanin's about to come back.

594
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,800
I don't want him
to participate in it soon.

595
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,600
You do know

596
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,640
how dangerous it is
to be one of the competitors.

597
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,760
Tharin.

598
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,240
Yes, Your Majesty?

599
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,240
I am unwell.

600
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,400
Do I really need to stay here?

601
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,880
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

602
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,480
This is the outer section of the palace.

603
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,290
Your residence is located at the back.

604
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,400
Please proceed, Your Royal Highness.

605
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,000
Why was I never informed of this?

606
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,560
I commanded them to keep it a secret.

607
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,400
I'm willing to take the risk
to bring my grandson back

608
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,200
because deep down, I know...

609
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,240
there's no one I can trust
to protect the people of Emmaly

610
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,680
better than you, Tharin.

611
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,920
For Emmaly,

612
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,120
Khanin must be the next prince.

613
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,920
I am...

614
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,360
Khanin Assavadevathin.

615
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,320
I mean no disrespect in raising this
on a day of celebration,

616
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,590
but how do we know for sure
that this person

617
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,440
is truly of
the Assavadevathin bloodline?

618
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,360
His Majesty will likely host
the Royal Fencing Competition soon.

619
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,520
While one vanished

620
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,960
and returned miraculously,

621
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,760
the other is a woman.

622
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,960
I'd like to see Your Royal Highness
join the Competition.

623
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,600
Will you respect the choice I'll make?

624
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,800
This is my grandson,

625
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,240
Khanin Assavadevathin.
