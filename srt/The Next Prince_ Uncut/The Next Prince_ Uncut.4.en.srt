3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,760
I am taking part
in the Royal Competition.

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,940
The Assavadevathins
will also participate.

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,720
I will participate
in the Royal Competition.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,440
The rules don't state that
women are forbidden from competing.

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,580
With both of you joining the Competition,
it should be quite exciting.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,000
Make sure you train hard, Brother.

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,640
Nothing is beyond my control.

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,640
This is my grandson,

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,320
Khanin Assavadevathin.

12
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,450
♫Through the tears,
I stared out the window♫

13
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,730
♫I couldn't see anything even a shadow♫

14
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,490
♫Every second's moving too slow♫

15
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,770
♫All I could do is hold♫

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,210
♫Hanging here in the longest,
darkest night♫

17
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,370
♫At least the clock hand is moving wise♫

18
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,920
♫Sitting, taking longer deep sigh♫

19
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,509
♫Here comes another try♫

20
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,810
♫Light of a new dawn♫

21
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,370
♫It's time to move on♫

22
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,940
♫Waiting for a new day♫

23
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,050
♫Better days are on the way♫

24
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,090
♫Waiting for a new day♫

25
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,570
♫Waiting for a new day,♫

26
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,850
♫And the sun will rise again♫

27
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,210
♫Waiting for a new day♫

28
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,170
♫It's gonna be okay♫

29
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,450
Hi, Prince Khanin.

30
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,650
Nice to see you today.

31
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,170
I'm Lady Aon.

32
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,290
I'm from Thailand.

33
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,900
I like your look today.

34
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,050
So perfect, gorgeous,

35
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,070
and so fabulous!

36
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,050
Thank you for joining us today, Lady Aon.

37
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,250
Oh, my God. It's my pleasure.

38
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,650
Nice to see you.

39
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,670
Please excuse me.

40
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,750
Congratulations, Prince Khanin.

41
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,890
Bye.

42
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,650
- See you.
- Thank you.

43
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,570
Oh...

44
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,490
Thank you for joining us,
Emperor of Da Caihong.

45
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,650
Your presence
at this momentous celebration

46
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,490
is the greatest honor
I could ever receive.

47
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,650
To be part
of your magnificent celebration

48
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,730
is a tremendous honor for me as well.

49
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,690
The Emperor of Da Caihong,

50
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,450
who has long been
one of Emmaly's key trade partners.

51
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,370
It is an honor to meet you,
Your Majesty.

52
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,930
My name is Khanin.

53
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,279
Nice to meet you, too.

54
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,690
Your piano performance today

55
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,770
was truly enchanting and beautiful.

56
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,050
Thank you, Your Majesty.

57
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,210
I hope today's celebration
brings you joy.

58
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,370
Indeed, it does.

59
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,650
On behalf of our nation, Bhujar,

60
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,890
we humbly offer congratulations
to Your Majesty.

61
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,010
No need to be so formal.

62
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,210
We're close neighbors,
just like one big family.

63
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,650
Nice to meet you, Prince Khanin.

64
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,330
I'm Prince Calvin.

65
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,570
Nice to meet you, too, Prince Calvin.

66
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,210
Before long, I might need to ask a favor
from both of you

67
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,260
as my son, Calvin,

68
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,850
is truly interested in studying
at the University of the Arts here.

69
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,810
It is a great honor for our country.

70
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,170
Today,

71
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,690
I'm truly honored
to be part of this celebration.

72
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,690
You are...

73
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,810
exceptionally gifted in music,
Your Royal Highness.

74
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,610
Thank you for your kind words.

75
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,770
It's because

76
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,130
I've had a passion for music
since I was younger.

77
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:22,970
Hello.

78
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,090
Hello.

79
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,930
On behalf of Bon Dre Cher,

80
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,010
it is a great honor
to be part of this celebration.

81
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,170
I'd like to extend my congratulations
to you, Prince Khanin.

82
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,050
I am honored by your presence as well.

83
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,010
Apart from your musical talent,

84
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,650
your fencing abilities
are equally impressive.

85
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,690
We've heard of your achievements

86
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,010
while you were still in the UK.

87
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,730
Thank you.

88
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,680
Fencing has always
been a part of my life.

89
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,130
I grew up with it

90
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,290
since Emmaly is known

91
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,710
for having the finest fencers.

92
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:09,970
Your Royal Highness,

93
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,050
it's time to get ready
for tonight's dance.

94
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,170
Thank you.

95
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,210
The pleasure is mine.

96
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,460
Khanin, the celebration is magnificent.

97
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,250
Come, Ava. Will you dance with me?

98
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,730
Sure.

99
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,840
♫Where the time has gone,♫

100
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,490
♫I just know you're my world, my dawn♫

101
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,050
♫You've taken my heart,
my soul, my way,♫

102
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,170
♫In this night, it's us who'll stay♫

103
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,370
♫Moonlight shines so bright,♫

104
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:31,050
♫Thousands of stars join us tonight♫

105
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,770
♫Every step we take, stars align,♫

106
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,570
♫This moment feels like it's truly mine♫

107
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,450
♫The world's a fairy tale,♫

108
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,250
♫In your arms tonight♫

109
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,770
♫I wish to stop this time,♫

110
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,490
♫And call you my endless light♫

111
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,450
♫Ooh, dancing in the moonlight with you,♫

112
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,970

♫Hold me so tight,♫

120

♫All through the night♫

121
00:08:59,210 --> 00:08:59,850
Oh...

122
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,690
Thanks.

123
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,690
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

124
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,050
Let's take a break, Your Royal Highness.

125
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,330
Come on.

126
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,770
Please go ahead and have fun.

127
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,770
Enjoy!

128
00:12:59,130 --> 00:12:59,970
Your Royal Highness,

129
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,650
please listen carefully.

130
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,570
Stick to the script.

131
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,050
Any unexpected questions,

132
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,130
particularly those
concerning Mr. Charan...

133
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Must not be addressed.

134
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,170
I understand, Chakri.

135
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,490
Uh...

136
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,170
Mr. Charan, well...

137
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,400
I will wait here.

138
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,500
Then, please come this way,
Your Royal Highness.

139
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,340
I still find this odd.

140
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,060
On behalf of the people of Emmaly,
I would like to offer my congratulations

141
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,180
and welcome Your Royal Highness back.

142
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,500
May I respectfully ask
about what your life was

143
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,340
before coming back to Emmaly?

144
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,300
I grew up in London.

145
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,740
To be honest, I never imagined that

146
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,740
I would encounter something like this
ever in my life,

147
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,460
living in such a grand palace

148
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,040
and living a life so different
from what I was accustomed to.

149
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,220
Adapting to this new reality
is incredibly challenging for me.

150
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,980
I'm not quite used to it.

151
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,580
During the dance,

152
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,980
it seemed that Your Royal Highness
shared a close bond with Mr. Charan.

153
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,460
Would you be willing to share more
about that connection?

154
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,100
Please excuse us.

155
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,100
We've gone over the planned time,

156
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,140
and Prince Khanin needs to proceed
with his next appointment.

157
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,700
Are you tired, Your Royal Highness?

158
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,700
May I offer you some treats or snacks?

159
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,020
Sounds nice.

160
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,620
Thanks, Chakri.

161
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,500
You've been a big help to me today.

162
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,420
Are you tired?

163
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,540
It's my duty, Your Royal Highness.

164
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,580
Aren't you tired from standing?

165
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,420
Have a seat.

166
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,340
Right here.

167
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,460
What are your duties?

168
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,380
To protect Prince Khanin,

169
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,100
take care of Prince Khanin,

170
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,580
and protect and remain loyal
to the Assavadevathins.

171
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,460
Those are all my duties.

172
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,020
When there's just us,

173
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,240
you don't need to speak so formally.

174
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,420
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

175
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,140
Okay.

176
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,380
Why weren't you with me
in the interview room?

177
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
Answer me.

178
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,460
At the dance,

179
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,580
a lot of people
were keeping an eye on us.

180
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,570
And?

181
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,140
Nothing matters more
than your public image.

182
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,900
I care about you.

183
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,380
That's how you say it.

184
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,339
You don't know how to say it?

185
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,740
I care about you.

186
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,500
You do?

187
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,620
As a what?

188
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,020
Alright.

189
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,180
Yeah, I know.

190
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,340
I'll there now.

191
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,020
Gosh, this will blow the Internet up.

192
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,180
They're flirting!

193
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Your Royal Highness!

194
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,940
Your Royal Highness...

195
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,580
Chakri?

196
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,900
You...

197
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,940
Forgot to take off the wireless mic,

198
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,700
so we could hear
their intimate conversation.

199
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,860
Guys, this is like a drama.

200
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,100
That's how we got this news.

201
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,420
Prince Khanin and Mr. Charan
are a perfect match!

202
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,340
Gosh!

203
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,860
What are your thoughts on this?

204
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,340
I don't think it's possible
that they're a couple.

205
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,780
Charan is wise

206
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,420
and well aware of his status.

207
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,620
So you believe

208
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,700
it's only for drawing attention?

209
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,220
Dating rumors that spark curiosity

210
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,140
can really stir up attention,

211
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,140
but it's unclear if this one
was intentional or just an accident.

212
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,060
How can you still smile, Ava?

213
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,660
Do you think popularity
is just a trivial thing?

214
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,740
It may not directly affect the Competition
according to the old rules,

215
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,090
but I don't think
things will go that smoothly.

216
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,460
His Majesty...

217
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,300
will likely make some adjustments.

218
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,540
That's why

219
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,700
you should start looking for a coach
to train you from now on.

220
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,020
Mira is already the perfect fit.

221
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,420
I shall take my leave.

222
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,890
"I care about you." That's how you say it.

224
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,120
You don't know how to say it?

225
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,460
I care about you.

226
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,560
You do?

227
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,760
As a what?

228
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,740
Make sure Prince Ramil's bike
is in good condition.

229
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,100
Yes, sir.

230
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,140
Your Royal Highness...

231
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,020
How come they created all this buzz?

[All Eyes on the Relationship
Between Prince Khanin and His Royal Guard]

233
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,780
It could be that the Assavadevathins
intentionally stirred up this rumor.

234
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,220
Here you are.

235
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,180
Are you aware of the reason
I called for you?

236
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,540
Did you want to ask us about the rumors?

237
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,980
Though the world now

238
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,420
embraces marriage equality,

239
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,660
you're my grandson,

240
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,020
and I've adopted Charan.

241
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,300
Any relationship
that goes beyond family ties

242
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,500
may be inappropriate.

243
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,780
Grandfather,

244
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,180
Charan and I are simply close

245
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,940
because...

246
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,060
he was the one who brought me back.

247
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,500
We've been through
life-threatening situations together.

248
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,100
Well,

249
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,940
but the care that goes
beyond that closeness

250
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,820
doesn't reflect well, Charan.

251
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,620
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

252
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,020
I'm merely taking care
of His Royal Highness

253
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,260
in my role as his royal guard.

254
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,540
I have no other feelings or intentions.

255
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,660
He is right, Grandfather.

256
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,220
I don't have
any feelings for him, either.

257
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,100
As this is during Khanin's introduction,

258
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,660
you must exercise extra caution
from here on.

259
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

260
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

261
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,100
About the rumors,

262
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,620
what are you going to do with them?

263
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,260
I humbly request
your pardon, Your Majesty.

264
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,620
I have a suggestion to offer.

265
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,980
At this time,

266
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,420
His Royal Highness is receiving
overwhelming support from the public.

267
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,460
Would it not be wise
to shape his public image

268
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,540
as someone warm and accessible?

269
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,980
I believe such an approach
would earn him people's affection.

270
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,140
If the Royal Palace
attempts to correct the rumors now,

271
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,140
it may raise doubts among the public,

272
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,220
suggesting a cover-up or fabrication.

273
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,710
Might this not affect
His Royal Highness' reputation adversely?

274
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,460
Smile bigger.

275
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,690
Ready? This way, please.

276
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,120

279
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,460
how about taking a shower first?

280
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,100
Perhaps it can make you feel better.

281
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,060
Yeah.

282
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,860
Okay.

283
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,340
Let's go.

284
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,460
Oh...

285
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,020
Stop right there.

286
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,940
Stop.

287
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,260
I can do it myself.

288
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,340
It's been a long day. Go get some rest.

289
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,660
Were you talking to me, too?

290
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,380
Yeah.

291
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,900
Who said you could leave?

292
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,180
Your Royal Highness...

293
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,860
There's just us here.

294
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,100
Okay.

295
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,900
When you talked to Grandfather,

296
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
what did you mean

297
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,900
when you said
you were merely being my royal guard?

298
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,740
That's what I have to do.

299
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,340
But we're friends, too, aren't we?

300
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,940
If there's nothing else,

301
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,140
please rest.

302
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,500
You also have an early lesson
on Emmaly tomorrow.

303
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,500
In ancient times,

304
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,220
Emmaly was long ruled
by the Bhuchongpisut royal dynasty.

305
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,940
However, during the colonial era,

306
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,500
Emmaly fell in defeat.

307
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,940
Invading soldiers
oppressed the people for decades,

308
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,500
plunging them
into poverty and hardship.

309
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,140
Eventually, they rose up in unison,

310
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,140
and the heir of the Bhuchongpisuts
rose with them.

311
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,000
He challenged the enemy
to a fencing duel.

312
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,030
Whichever side prevailed
would lay rightful claim to Emmaly.

313
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,740
The Bhuchongpisut led the nation
to reclaim its independence.

314
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,020
Out of deep gratitude and reverence,

315
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,860
he named his father the King of Emmaly.

316
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,300
As the victory had been won
through the alliance of four clans,

317
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,580
Prince Thanes Bhuchongpisut

318
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,540
then declared the establishment
of the Royal Fencing Competition

319
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,870
to determine the rightful heir
to the throne.

320
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,740
What's on your mind,
Your Royal Highness?

321
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,620
Nothing.

322
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
Forget it.

323
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,060
You can continue. I'm listening.

324
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,340
What awaits Your Royal Highness

325
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,740
after the current king
abdicates the throne

326
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,220
is the Royal Fencing Competition,

327
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,340
held to determine the next king.

328
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,700
Should the heir of any clan
emerge victorious,

329
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,140
their father shall ascend
as the next King of Emmaly.

330
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
So, now that
I'm finally becoming useful,

331
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,940
the Assavadevathins decided
to bring me back, didn't they?

332
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,980
Your Royal Highness...

333
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,100
At the time,

334
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,780
they simply wanted to keep you safe.

335
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,730
So that I could compete.

336
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,940
I don't mind it, actually.

337
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,780
You both know

338
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,580
that I returned and agreed to compete

339
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,700
just to find out
what happened to my dad.

340
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,980
But up to this point,
I still don't know a thing.

341
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,180
May I ask you to promise

342
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,900
that if I tell you something,

343
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,580
you will not put yourself in danger?

344
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,300
What have you got?

345
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,260
Please promise me first.

346
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,780
Promise.

347
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
I promise.

348
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,860
I had Vedish look into the evidence
I got from one of the attackers in the UK.

349
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,580
As you can see,

350
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,820
he's really a police officer

351
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,860
in Bhuchongpisut.

352
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,060
Look at this.

353
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,060
That's the photo the Royal Palace
released to the press.

354
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,820
Prince Rachata...

355
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,180
Looking at his background,

356
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,380
he climbed the ranks way too fast.

357
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,820
The attempt on Prince Khanin's life
may have come from the Bhuchongpisuts.

358
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,560
Maybe you're right, or maybe you're not.

359
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,180
Have you told Grandfather about this?

360
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
You're the first to know this.

361
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,380
- And I'll tell...
- Don't tell him just yet.

362
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,540
I think...

363
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,620
we should look into this ourselves first.

364
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,460
Also,

365
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,500
I want to go to Bhuchongpisut.

366
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,940
His DNA matches Tharin's by 99 percent.

367
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,020
Prince Khanin has arrived.

368
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,420
Khanin,

369
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,140
did your journey go smoothly?

370
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,420
We are delighted

371
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,840
that you came to visit our city.

372
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,910
My journey did go smoothly,
Uncle and Ramil.

373
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,380
Khanin,

374
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,910
I'm very glad

375
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,420
that you came to visit Bhuchongpisut.

376
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,500
How about this?

377
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,110
I'll get Ramil to show you around.

378
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,740
Since you're about the same age,
you should get to know each other.

379
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,820
So you won't feel uneasy around me.

380
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,140
Thank you for your concern, Uncle.

381
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,860
Once you've finished touring around,

382
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,220
I'll have Ramil take you to our museum.

383
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,940
It's full of historical facts
about Emmaly,

384
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,620
so you'll have the chance to learn more.

385
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,940
Understood, Father.

386
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,460
If you wish to know anything,

387
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,740
I'm always here to answer.

388
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,540
After all, the Bhuchongpisut clan
remains the oldest royal family.

389
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,660
That sounds like a great idea.

390
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,020
I hope you don't mind, Ramil.

391
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,370
Follow me this way.

392
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,620
Khanin,

393
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,500
after showing you
around the entire palace,

394
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,660
there's still one more important place

395
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,100
I'd like to show you.

396
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,300
An important place?

397
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,980
Isn't that the Bhuchongpisut Palace?

398
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,620
There's another important place

399
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,490
outside the palace

400
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,660
that is closed to outsiders,

401
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,660
accessible only to the Bhuchongpisuts.

402
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,460
If you don't mind,

403
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,220
do you want to go there with me
this evening?

404
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,300
I think

405
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,180
Ramil might not have had anything to do
with Prince Rachata's plans.

406
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,540
Or perhaps...

407
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,020
it might not even be the doing
of the Bhuchongpisuts.

408
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,740
We can't be certain yet.

409
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,830
However,

410
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,140
please do not trust Prince Ramil.

411
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,180
I don't trust anyone but you.

412
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,380
Are you sure you don't need me
or the guards to go along?

413
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
I'll be fine.

414
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,800
He wouldn't act so brazenly.

415
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,300
Your Royal Highness, always remember

416
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,220
that Prince Ramil is your rival
in the Royal Competition.

417
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,300
Never underestimate him.

418
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,140
I won't.

419
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,940
If anything happens,
I'll call you right away.

420
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,580
This stunning place...

421
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,540
is closed to outsiders, Ramil?

422
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:50,739
Certain places

423
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,780
are not meant for all.

424
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,220
You may not know yet, but your mother,

425
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,020
Princess Khunita,

426
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,700
is of the Bhuchongpisut bloodline.

427
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,740
She was the cousin of my father.

428
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,220
We're actually family.

429
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,700
Anyway,

430
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,620
please let me give you a gift, Brother.

431
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,860
Thank you, Ramil.

432
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,380
When I was just a kid,

433
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,380
whenever I felt down,

434
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,620
I'd come here by myself.

435
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,060
The pressure from all the expectations

436
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,180
made me feel so small.

437
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,860
Being part of the royal family

438
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,940
must have weighed heavily on that kid.

439
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,980
It was to help you stand
with the grace you possess today.

440
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,260
This is the Serpent King statue.

441
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,580
a revered figure our family
has honored and worshiped for centuries.

442
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,460
You might find it familiar

443
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,010
as the emblem of the Bhuchongpisut clan

444
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,790
was inspired by this very statue.

445
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,630
You can compare it
with the bracelet I just gave you.

446
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,100
Wait...

447
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,700
Khanin...

448
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,100
The bracelet...

449
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,420
Did you drop it around here?

450
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,820
You may not know,

451
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,740
but in our Bhuchongpisut clan,

452
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,300
we value every gift we receive

453
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,180
and protect it with our lives.

454
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,300
But don't worry.

455
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,900
I'll go find it out there

456
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
where we came from.

457
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,860
Keep looking around here, okay?

458
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,300
Okay.

459
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,240
Oh...

460
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,340
Argh.

461
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,380
Ouch!

462
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,460
Please prepare a meal
for His Royal Highness.

463
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,580
- You may do it now.
- Understood.

464
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,900
Professor Charan...

465
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,420
Oh?

466
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,980
Why are you just by yourself?

467
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,820
What about Prince Ramil
and Prince Khanin?

468
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,780
They went in the forest
behind the palace.

469
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,340
When did they go?

470
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,420
Four hours ago.

471
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,220
I believe they're on their way back.

472
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,580
Khanin!

473
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,480
He's gone missing,
and I can't reach him by phone.

474
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,840
Hang on, Mr. Charan.

475
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,460
Why are you back already?

476
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,600
Weren't you supposed
to return tomorrow?

477
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,980
This is not the time.

478
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,020
We need to find Prince Khanin.

479
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,860
- Prince Khanin!
- Khanin.

480
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,020
- Khanin!
- Prince Khanin.

481
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Prince Khanin.

482
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,060
Prince Khanin.

483
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,580
Prince Khanin!

484
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,900
Prince Khanin...

485
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,770
We went this way.

486
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,650
If you'll excuse me, I'll go this way.

487
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,410
Prince Khanin!

488
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,100
Prince Khanin.

489
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,100
Three of you, go that way.

490
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,500
The rest of you, come with me.

491
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,900
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

492
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,940
Prince Khanin!

493
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,100
Prince Khanin...

494
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,180
Charan!

495
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,980
Is that you?

496
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,020
I'm right here.

497
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,100
Are you alright, Your Royal Highness?

498
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,300
Yeah.

499
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,500
I fell off my bike.

500
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,660
The tires are flat.

501
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,540
All I could do was wait.

502
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,820
Are you wounded?

503
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,380
Got it when I fell off.

504
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,900
I'm sorry to make you worry.

505
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,420
Please don't be.

506
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,060
It is my fault.

507
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,420
How is it your fault?

508
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,580
It was just an accident.

509
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,980
No, it wasn't.

510
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,940
It's my fault.

511
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,960
If I fail to act

512
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,950
while you're in danger,

513
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,700
then my oath to protect you with my life

514
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,820
means nothing at all.

515
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,620
But...

516
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,980
Your Royal Highness,

517
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,140
you mean more to me

518
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,980
than you could ever imagine.

519
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,860
Please slowly get up.

520
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,230
Well...

521
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,220
You could've just helped me walk.

522
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,740
You've found Khanin?

523
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:56,890
Hey.

524
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,450
Khanin.

525
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,660
I'm really sorry.

526
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,700
I actually went back to the cave,

527
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,590
but I didn't see you.

528
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,820
We must have missed each other.

529
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,740
Right, the bracelet.

530
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,980
I found it.

531
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,900
I'd like to give it back to you.

532
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,460
This may hurt, Young Prince.

533
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,620
Hang in there.

534
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,460
Khanin.

535
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,300
Are you alright?

536
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,460
I'm sorry.

537
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,440
Please don't be, Uncle.

538
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,370
It's your fault, letting Ramil

539
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:09,080
take Khanin
into the forest unaccompanied.

540
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,300
Ramil,

541
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,260
have you apologized to him?

542
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:21,990
I asked

543
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,020
if you've apologized to him.

544
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,500
Please don't do that, Uncle.

545
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,380
I'm neither mad
nor am I blaming it on him.

546
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,980
I just...

547
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,880
It may not be appropriate
for me to stay here tonight.

548
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,940
I'd like to take my leave, Uncle.

549
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,540
That was a stupid thing to do.

550
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,820
You are clearly dumb.

551
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,420
You think I don't know?

552
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,210
You chose to go into that forest

553
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,060
because there's no signal in there.

554
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,680
And as for the missing bracelet,

555
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,340
that was you, wasn't it?

556
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,780
No...

557
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,140
No, Father.

558
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,460
No?

559
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,980
No?

560
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,340
Listen to me.

561
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,360
As long as the Assavadevathins
are still in power,

562
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,620
don't you dare pull more stupid stunts
with Khanin again.

563
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,740
And let it be clear

564
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,260
that it was your stupidity
that made Paytai end up like this!

565
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,020
I shall take my leave,
Your Royal Highness.

566
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,420
Hold on.

567
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,620
Well...

568
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,500
Oh..

569
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,490
I shall take my leave.

570
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,700
It wasn't your fault.

571
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,340
I was a fool.

572
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,710
You were just outmatched
by the royal families' little games.

573
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,580
I'm glad, though,

574
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,500
that you were the one who found me.

575
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,340
I'm also glad to have found you.

576
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,860
Thanks.

577
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,680
I believe...

578
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,660
the Bhuchongpisuts do not mean well
for the Assavadevathins.

579
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:21,980
Something feels wrong.

580
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,610
Anyway, don't let Grandfather know
about this just yet,

581
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,820
both today's incident
and the attacker being a police officer.

582
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,860
Make sure every guard

583
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,940
never speak of
what happened today again.

584
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,260
But no secrets

585
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,300
can be hidden from His Majesty.

586
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,460
Have a seat.

587
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:00,870
What brought you back ahead of time?

588
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,740
His Royal Highness has journeyed
as he pleased, Your Majesty.

589
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,110
I'm sure you know
there is no place safer than here.

590
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

591
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,200
What are your thoughts on that photo?

592
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,780
The constellation of the twins

593
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,940
glowing brilliantly in the sky.

594
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,220
It appears quite romantic, Your Majesty.

595
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,140
The two stars stand side by side,

596
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,980
yet it is no easy feat.

597
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,050
Legend tells that

598
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:48,820
Pollux is akin to a god,
one who possesses immortality,

599
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,000
while Castor

600
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,780
is like a mortal with a fleeting life.

601
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,810
The two cannot remain together

602
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,820
unless Pollux sacrifices his immortality.

603
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,780
And should this tale end in death,

604
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:15,020
do you still find romance in it, dear?

605
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,500
My apologies, Your Majesty.

606
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,940
In my humble opinion,

607
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,060
even though they stand together
as stars in the sky,

608
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,780
their tale endures as one of love
that leaves a lasting impression.

609
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,180
You are truly suited to be an artist.

610
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

611
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,690
Right, I almost forgot this.

612
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,740
Prince Calvin of Bhujar

613
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:02,440
is to come and further his studies
in the arts at your university.

614
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:04,710
For a guest of such importance,

615
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,260
I see no one more fitting to entrust
with this responsibility than you.

616
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,660
I fear that

617
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,580
I will have no time to dedicate
to training Prince Khanin.

618
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,700
Forget that.

619
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,590
Go on and do what you truly love.

620
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:26,980
As for Khanin,

621
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,400
you can leave him to me

622
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,340
so that he finds greater focus.

623
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,940
I hope you understand.

624
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

625
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,100
It is my belief that Prince Khanin
may have ordered Mr. Charan

626
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:56,260
not to speak of what happened
in Bhuchongpisut.

627
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,260
Forget it.

628
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,740
Nothing bad happened; that's enough.

629
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

630
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,150
Some distance
between Khanin and Charan

631
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,100
might be for the better.

632
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,210
This is Calvin,

633
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,530
an exchange student from Bhujar.

634
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,830
Please keep an eye on him for me.

635
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,800
Sure.

636
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:53,550
Why are you here, Your Royal Highness?

637
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:55,470
Why aren't you at the palace with me?

638
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,020
- I was merely doing my duty.
- What about your duty to protect me,

639
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:02,510
take care of me,

640
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,050
and protect and remain loyal
to the Assavadevathins?

641
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,000
Charan,

642
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,540
come sit with me.

643
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,940
I'm afraid that...

644
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,480
That was a command.

645
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,560
Check out the buzz we're getting.

646
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,270
This is a good sign, right?

647
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,560
How soft.

648
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,200
Something's even softer.
