1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,540
I've given everything I have.

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,210
I know everyone has been waiting
for this series.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,200
I'm surprised by how much they put into it.

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,410
It's an experience that truly amazes me.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,200
Mandee Work is on another level.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,960
It's a heavily invested Thai project.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,580
And it's so grand,

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,540
nothing I've worked on was like this.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,210
The most magnificent one I've done.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,170
With a budget nearing nine figures.

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,500
In my 30 years,

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,750
I've never seen such a big scale like this before.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,420
It's truly happening today.

14
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,840
Aof's actually mentioned this.
[Khanin: Chawarin Perdpiriyawong]

15
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,840
Before this series,

16
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,500
he asked Zee and me
what kind of series we'd like to be in.

17
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,920
One of the topics was a vampire world.

18
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,950
However, we finally
chose this prince concept.

19
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,760
This project actually started
when I told Aof that I wanted to be a royal guard.

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,550
In one of my favorite shows,
[Charan: Pruk Panich]

21
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,990
a royal guard has to protect a prince.

22
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,170
There's also a conflict
between different clans.

23
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,170
This series has started from Zee and NuNew.

24
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,210
I wanted to make a series just for them.

25
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,290
Then we discussed it with our actors.
[Kittipat Champa]

26
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,920
Zee also mentioned that
he wanted to play a royal guard.

27
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,340
It sparked an idea for an intriguing story.

28
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,290
If NuNew is a prince and Zee is his guard,
it's gonna be adorable.

29
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,750
We were trying to figure out
something different.

30
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,960
Zee and NuNew have played countless roles.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,910
Despite appearing in only a few series,

32
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,330
they've taken on a range of roles; in TVCs and else.

33
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,880
Those are so various.

34
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,160
The setting is Emmaly, a fictional country.

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,370
The way people communicate also varies
depending on their social class.

36
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,870
The story centers on the struggle
between honoring duties

37
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,250
and traditions
[Panuwat Inthawat]

38
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,990
versus pursuing a personal path
that causes no harm.

39
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,610
We also wanted it
[Aummaraporn Phandintong]

40
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,360
to relate to current social issues.

41
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,950
We've done more research,

42
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,310
working on those issues,

43
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,500
which I'd prefer keeping it confidential for now.

44
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:39,710
In each region, they have
their unique businesses and industries.

45
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,740
Emmaly is a fictional country,
[Wanna Kortunyavat]

46
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,660
and its capital is Davin.

47
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,660
It has four main regions:
North, South, East, and West,

48
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,290
each with different rulers.

49
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,410
The North is ruled
by the Assavadevathin clan.

50
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,790
The Phuchongphisut clan governs the East.

51
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,830
The West is under the rule
of the Thawichmetha clan,

52
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,960
and the South is governed
by the Meenanakarin clan.

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,410
We're also promoting soft power as well.

54
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,580
Though Emmaly is a fictional country,

55
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,460
it has connections to Thailand as well.

56
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,660
First, it's the language.

57
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,530
Your Royal Highness, always remember

58
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,410
that Prince Ramil is your rival
in the Royal Competition.

59
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,200
Never underestimate him.

60
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,540
We've also filmed in Thailand.

61
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,700
You're going to see which locations there are,

62
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,450
and they're famous destinations in Thailand.

63
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,040
After knowing the plot from Aof,

64
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,080
I could feel that
it'd be magical and magnificent.

65
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,710
You know, a new country,
a new city, and a new world.

66
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,970
I felt like I'd definitely have to use
a lot of imagination.

67
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,820
It would be quite a challenge as well.

68
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,750
The series is based on the well-known novel,

69
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,570
so the setting has already been established
to some extent by the writer.

70
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,410
However, the original story is too short
to make into a 14-episode series,

71
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,640
so a lot of additional content
needed to be added,

72
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,580
while still keeping it entertaining
and engaging for the viewers.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,210
You're not a very strict mom,

74
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,630
but your first priority is your duties.

75
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,040
You truly honor your clan's duty,
you can die for the Assavadevathin.

76
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,210
Okay.

77
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,460
- That should be it.
- Thank you.

78
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,880
It looks blurry, doesn't it?

79
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,000
This one's better.

80
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
- This one?
- Yes.

81
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
That's your duty.

82
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,540
You won't feel it at first,

83
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,040
but this line will make you turn to him.

84
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,000
In terms of your character...

85
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,250
Yes, he's very nice and kind.

86
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,710
He adores NuNew, the King's grandson.

87
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,250
Yeah.

88
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,670
Yes, it'll be weird if you do it together.

89
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,830
If Khanin doesn't go first, he should go after.

90
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,830
I think he should be the first to do it.

91
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,960
You mean your role and his?

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,250
I should respect him.

93
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,550
Animals, children, effects,
and rope slings should be avoided,

94
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,380
but we've used everything.

95
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,380
This one is easy to handle.

96
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,500
The light is perfect now, I guess.

97
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,960
That day, the horse
just wouldn't cooperate at all.

98
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,000
It was so nice and cooperative
during practice,

99
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,330
but very stubborn during the actual filming.

100
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,170
That gave us only a little time left.

101
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,170
The sun was setting. If we didn't do it,

102
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,460
we wouldn't have made it in time.

103
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,700
The amazing thing was that
everyone was running

104
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,080
as if we were in the Infinity War.

105
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,720
They were all running.

106
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,330
The art crew was running,

107
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,500
as well as the gaffers and the cameramen.

108
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,130
NuNew and Zee rushed onto the horse.

109
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,670
I ran to them.

110
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,930
I could only say five sentences to them,

111
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,680
and they had to do the rest.

112
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,790
The results were amazing.

113
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,750
Personally, other things were under our control,

114
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,040
and everything went as we expected
or even beyond that.

115
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,290
However, this was out of control
and almost impossible.

116
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,330
But we did it.

117
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,160
As mentioned, the setting is huge,

118
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,250
and so is the struggle.

119
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,830
Finding a perfect location isn't easy.

120
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:08,750
To be honest, locations in Thailand
have already been filmed often.

121
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,620
We tried to find different locations,

122
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,910
which caused the budget to balloon

123
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,660
because we had to transform them
to look different.

124
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,330
We wanted to make everyone believe
these places exist.

125
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,170
In my entire work life,

126
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,930
this project is the biggest one yet
[Polrapat Nongnim]

127
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,800
in terms of series.

128
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,870
The production budget
is probably even larger than that of a movie.

129
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,200
It feels like starting from scratch.

130
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,950
The country doesn't exist.

131
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,210
We needed to create the props ourselves.

132
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,720
The setting was made with Jay's help.

133
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,830
Each region has its own details.

134
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,740
In those five cities,

135
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,780
one is known for pearls, one is known for gold,

136
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,080
and another is known for its art.

137
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,490
Those had to be created from scratch.

138
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,080
The statues were quite challenging.

139
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,370
You couldn't just
finish them immediately, you know.

140
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,370
Everything was painted.

141
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,040
Nothing was generated by AI.

142
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,660
All of them have meanings behind them.

143
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,080
The briefing emphasized outfit uniqueness.
[Viriya Pongkajorn]

144
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,250
We ensured all outfits are unique.

145
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,550
They're already worth seeing.

146
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,170
We've worked with designers

147
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,330
from Unkuniya to design costumes for NuNew.

148
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,210
With this team, I won't have to worry.

149
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,590
I'm at ease.

150
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,250
We had consulted our team in England directly

151
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,750
and had helped with important footage.

152
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,080
We didn't buy stock footage.

153
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,710
We used the same camera and lens
for shooting in specific countries,

154
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,370
for the best pictures.

155
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,380
In this series project,
we've worked with so many talents

156
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,500
in various roles.

157
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,290
And it's our first time collaborating as a team.

158
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,820
The production quality
has been taken to a whole new level.

159
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,860
Starting with the camera,

160
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,620
we're using,

161
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,410
basically, Hollywood-level equipment.

162
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,790
We used this camera and these lenses.

163
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,450
On the music side,

164
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,660
we brought in a full orchestra.

165
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,450
Normally, a series like this
might use pre-recorded tracks

166
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,330
or a smaller group,

167
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,160
but we were already going all out.

168
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:33,700
So, we brought in an experienced team

169
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,780
that has worked
on both Thai and international series.

170
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,660
The music is absolutely stunning

171
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,200
and beautiful.
I really want you guys to hear it.

172
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,450
Just hearing it
will be an experience on its own.

173
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,460
It's an honor to be part of this series.

174
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,500
And I'm so glad this series got the money

175
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,500
for the real orchestra band.

176
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,500
Normally, for series or movies,

177
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,250
having the orchestra recorded is quite rare

178
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,290
as it costs an arm and a leg to do so.

179
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,290
I feel delighted for that.

180
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:13,080
So I got a chance to experiment with it.

181
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,750
Normally, I do everything on my computer,

182
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,000
for this, I had to do more research on the scores

183
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,250
that the composer "Few" had written...

184
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,170
I had to consult with him on what to add,

185
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,210
what to adjust, or what we could try it on with.

186
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,670
I had given my opinions

187
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,960
for the perfect masterpiece.

188
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,420
It was difficult...because...

189
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,830
Normally, when I write musics on my computer,

190
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,670
it's not that difficult,
compared to making ones for musicians.

191
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,580
So to compose it for the musicians,
it's required...

192
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,040
more knowledge and skills.

193
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,460
The most difficult scene to film...

194
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,290
Almost all of them.

195
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,340
I don't know which one was

196
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,880
cause every one of them was a huge one.

197
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,630
If we thought that one was huge,
the next one would be even bigger.

198
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,130
We thought it'd stop, but it didn't.

199
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,090
We also had to do quite a lot of reshoots

200
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,920
to get the perfect results.

201
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,210
The challenging scenes for me
were those fencing ones.

202
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,630
The setting was always big.

203
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,250
Aof really went all out.

204
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,880
The location was an actual sports stadium,
and the strip was created.

205
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,250
Everyone involved in fencing scenes
had to learn how to fence.

206
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,630
All of them,

207
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,130
including NuNew, Zee, and Jimmy.

208
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,460
I think that's one of the challenges.
I knew it'd be hard

209
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,460
cause I had to actually watch fencing matches
while working on the screenplay.

210
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,250
The actual scenes were even more difficult.

211
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,590
I liked it when we fenced together.

212
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,920
You did? Really?

213
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,000
It's not that I liked...

214
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,880
- It was exhausting.
- I didn't like the fencing part.

215
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,540
- I just liked that we were exhausted...
- The uniforms?

216
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,320
No, I liked that we all were exhausted.

217
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,350
That was my favorite part.

218
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,880
I wasn't alone, you know.

219
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,960
All fencers were exhausted.

220
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,290
We really were.

221
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,120
Yes, because each scene
required different angles.

222
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,990
We had to do it repeatedly
with the same blocking and stuff.

223
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,330
- It was fun, though.
- We had to go through it together.

224
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,250
En garde.
(On guard)

225
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,130
Êtes-vous prêts?
(Are you ready?)

226
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,340
Allez!
(Go)

227
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,500
Halte.
(Halt)

228
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,380
Halte.
(Halt)

229
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,990
There were many aspects
we weren't directly familiar with,

230
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,580
and we realized we had to consult experts,

231
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,080
like those specialized in fencing.

232
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,210
We're starting now.

233
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,620
Halte.
(Halt)

234
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,560
That's right.

235
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,360
Next, you're gonna attack him.

236
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,630
Do what you just did.

237
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:24,920
En garde.
(On guard)

238
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,420
Prêts?
(Ready?)

239
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,740
Allez.
(Go)

240
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,280
Jimmy, step back.

241
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,120
Okay, now make sure you miss the shot.

242
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,160
Jimmy, step back and get back at her.

243
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,210
Lunge.

244
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,460
Right.

245
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,170
Beat. En garde. (On guard)
Prêts? (Ready?)

246
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,250
A beat?

247
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,580
She's gonna attack. You'll defend yourself.

248
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,040
- Okay. Like this.
- En garde. (On guard)

249
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,040
Prêts?
(Ready?)

250
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,880
- Now. Go faster.
- Allez. (Go)

251
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,370
That's correct.

252
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,630
Mind your left arm, Jimmy.

253
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,790
Alright...

254
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,240
Action.

255
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,000
En garde.
(On guard)

256
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,840
Êtes-vous prêts?
(Are you ready?)

257
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,090
Allez.
(Go)

258
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,420
Halte.
(Halt)

259
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:22,880
Attaque...
(Attack)

260
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
Parade-riposte.
(Parry-riposte)

261
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,710
Three, two, one, go.

262
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,090
The first time I read the screenplay...

263
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,540
I loved it.

264
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,420
I felt...

265
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,500
So many things were going on in my mind.

266
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,500
"What kind of series is this?

267
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,660
Why does it seem like a fantasy?

268
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,200
The plot seems fun, though."

269
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,710
I read all the episodes available back then.

270
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,170
When I finished everything,

271
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,080
I had to ask Aof and Den for more episodes.

272
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,120
"Where can I read the rest?
I wanna read it.

273
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,490
Is it not finished yet?"

274
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,660
I was invested. Loved it.

275
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,830
I found it quite enjoyable.

276
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,240
As I read it, I wondered how I'd be the guy.

277
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,080
I tried to picture the scenes,

278
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,670
but the visuals were blurry
since it is entirely fictional.

279
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,120
I was like, "What is he like?
How's the country? What is it gonna be like?

280
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,280
Will I be able to do the action scenes?

281
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,450
But I'd love to ride a horse."

282
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,420
I knew it'd be fun, definitely.

283
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,460
Now, we're working with Zee and NuNew,

284
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,170
the top on-screen partners of the country.

285
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,170
The scale and splendor of this series
are remarkable.

286
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,920
I'm glad to be in the same series
with him again.

287
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,170
It's truly been pushing the limits
of our skills.

288
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,170
For this series, I feel that...

289
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,790
I have confidence in his talent.

290
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,800
The difficulty of this role
lies in capturing Charan's demeanor.

291
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,090
As a royal guard, they need to look sharp,

292
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,830
proper and precise posture is the key.
He walks like a guard.

293
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:56,090
Also, he doesn't show much emotion

294
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,090
but expresses a lot through his eyes.

295
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,490
It's not easy to be a royal guard.

296
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,540
It's more than just standing around
and talking in a monotone.

297
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,130
He has a real talent for conveying emotion
through his eyes,

298
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,290
which is perfect.

299
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,040
This character just made it even clearer.

300
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,790
As royal guard can't be expressive, you know.

301
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,420
The moment we have the results,

302
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,880
I'll report to you immediately.

303
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,290
NuNew's amazing.

304
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,840
As I said, he's a naturally gifted actor

305
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,250
with a keen eye for detail.

306
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,040
Even though we've never talked
about his technique,

307
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:42,250
it's obvious that he reads
and reflects on the script deeply.

308
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:48,040
The way he speaks and moves
feels so genuine and natural.

309
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,980
That's what makes his performance stand out.

310
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,660
It's a totally different role for me.

311
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,130
Completely new.

312
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,910
He's not just an ordinary guy, you know.

313
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,170
At first, he'd be just a London boy.

314
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,330
Who would get to be a prince, you know?

315
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,290
So I had to work on the way I move and speak

316
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:17,170
and other skills, including fencing,
playing the piano,

317
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,440
dancing, and archery.

318
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,790
I'd taken fencing training courses.

319
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,210
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to do anything.

320
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:32,380
To fence beautifully and correctly,
you need to learn how to do it.

321
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,630
I did.

322
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,790
It was exhausting.

323
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,250
But it was fun, too.

324
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,840
For this series, I had to dye my hair this color.

325
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,380
Don't know what it's called.

326
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,250
He's grown up and become prettier.

327
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,130
I believe it's because of
the costumes and everything.

328
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,860
The costumes are pretty.

329
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,170
Well, so am I.

330
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:04,580
While reading the screenplay, Aof told me that
[Ramil: Karn Kritsanaphan]

331
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,380
my role was a villain.

332
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,220
Work hard, my brother.

333
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,790
Appreciated you sacrificing your time
caring for me.

334
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,250
Jimmy's the perfect cast for this role.

335
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:24,370
He really needs to deeply understand Ramil.

336
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,380
As an actor, I can say with full confidence

337
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,420
that I'm happy with my performance

338
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,540
and it feels like I've improved in every way.

339
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,420
You'll definitely find him annoying.

340
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,380
And he actually nailed it.

341
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,960
Say, "Work hard, my brother."

342
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,920
Work hard, my brother.

343
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,750
Work hard, my brother.

344
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,830
I know how it feels now.

345
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,330
It's really irritating.

346
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,130
Work hard, my brother.

347
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,380
You can't punch me, though.

348
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,960
I can't, but I understand how it feels.

349
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,670
Ohm, our new member, plays Paytai.

350
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,090
His role is filled with so much sorrow.

351
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,670
You should really see him.

352
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,170
This is my first series
[Paytai: Thanakrit Chiamchunya]

353
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,000
as a DOMUNDI member.

354
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,380
As for Paytai...

355
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,130
For this character,
he seems to be ordinary at first,

356
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,880
but the more I read, the more I was struck

357
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,170
by how heartbreaking his story is.

358
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,630
Be ready to open the door.

359
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,380
Heard that.

360
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,130
Try to...avoid those areas.

361
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,000
Just keep right.

362
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,540
And Jimmy...

363
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,830
is very well-known for his acting skills.

364
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,790
I was worried
if I wouldn't be able to match his level.

365
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,290
I was nervous.

366
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:28,020
I feel like the roles two actors take on

367
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,880
in their first series together

368
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,000
really define the dynamic between them.

369
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,190
Along our journey together,

370
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,520
there are reflections of

371
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,500
our similarities and differences.

372
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,880
have taught us how to adapt to each other.

373
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:04,500
A prince from a different country, Calvin.

374
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,840
[Calvin: Siraphop Manithikhun]

375
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,590
It was really hard because...

376
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,840
Prince Calvin and I are completely different.

377
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,710
He's calm and always serious.

378
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,840
Meanwhile, I'm talkative and extroverted.

379
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,040
I'm also quite playful.

380
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,380
Prince Calvin, on the other hand, is not.

381
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,710
Maybe it's because
he hasn't spent much time outside.

382
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,090
However, I love going out.

383
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,880
That was really a challenge for me.

384
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,550
I believe you must come from a rich family.

385
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,120
I think Jay's character...
[Jay: Radchapon Phornpinit]

386
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,290
carries a lot of depth within him.

387
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,130
He's from a city ruled by the Meenanakarins.

388
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,370
One of the few commoners.

389
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,520
This character dislikes the royal family

390
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,270
due to his past.

391
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,670
Then he has hatred towards the royal.

392
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:18,040
Wherever he turns up,
a pivotal event usually follows.

393
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,170
Having JJ as my partner...

394
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,580
He's talkative,

395
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,080
and so is his role.

396
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,830
So he'd end up being the star
of every scene he's in.

397
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,420
When we're in the same scene,
Jay tends to talk more compared to Calvin.

398
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,330
Like, with drowsy vibes.

399
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,360
You were too fast,

400
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,980
too determined.

401
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,580
I had to work a lot on it.

402
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,870
During our workshop,

403
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,240
Den was in charge of everything
and told us every detail.

404
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,870
That helped me
understand the whole point so fast.

405
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,120
All DOMUNDI actors know my working process.

406
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:04,570
If you have no idea what you're doing,
you're not allowed in my workshop.

407
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,540
It was like I became a student once again.

408
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,830
They needed to study their roles,

409
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,670
and I'd help them craft their understanding.

410
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:23,200
Again, fortunately,
we have Zee, NuNew, Jimmy, Ohm, Net, and JJ.

411
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,200
They're all serious about their roles.

412
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,000
If their effort could earn them degrees,

413
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,290
they'd each have ten by now.

414
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,620
It's my first series.
[Ava: Charintip Rungthanakiat]

415
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,950
It's very difficult

416
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,990
because the royal speech is used,
and I'm not fluent in Thai.

417
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,660
So, everything felt completely new.

418
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,790
However, I loved all the challenges
I've experienced.

419
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,490
I've never spoken in royal speech before.

420
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,880
This was my first time.

421
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,950
So I realized I needed to work harder

422
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,540
and practice a lot more

423
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,460
because the production is huge.

424
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,290
I want to do my best.

425
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,290
Kris from ALALA is also working with us.

426
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,240
She's a newcomer.

427
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,120
It's a challenge for her and us all.

428
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,740
However, she's very determined.

429
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,830
She's also very adorable,
just like a Disney princess.

430
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,960
That's why I think she's a perfect fit.

431
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,460
I shall participate in the Royal Competition.

432
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,240
The rules never state that...

433
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,330
We also have Plaifah,

434
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:40,910
the partner of Ava, or Kris.

435
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,120
My role, Mira, is Princess Ava's coach

436
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:48,330
for fencing and archery.

437
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,160
When I first read the script,
I knew it would require deep emotion.

438
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,410
Okay, and...

439
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,040
action!

440
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:56,950
- Ouch!
- Your Royal Highness...

441
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,410
For me, it's hard
when you don't have many lines

442
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,060
because you need to add more...
[Mira: Plaifah Siraacha]

443
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,080
emotional details

444
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:09,960
to flawlessly convey the key message
of that scene.

445
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,790
Whoa, the language is the hardest.

446
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,120
There'd be those royal speeches, and I...

447
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,580
I'd often mistakenly use the wrong term,

448
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,460
and I'd need to redo the scene.

449
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,790
Action!

450
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,290
That's the flag of the Meenanakarins.

451
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,790
A blue shark over waves,

452
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,460
adorned with pearls, on a blue background.

453
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,340
Their city is in the South of Emmaly,

454
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,590
lying along the shores.

455
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,790
Chakri is quite different.
[Chakri: Tanawat Cheawaram]

456
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,080
With this appearance of mine,

457
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,630
I'd often get a role

458
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,210
as an IT geek,

459
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,380
a game addict,

460
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,450
or a loser.

461
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,490
However, Chakri is neat
and tends to keep things in order.

462
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:09,500
He's completely different
from every role I've played.

463
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,410
The actual difficulty is the manner.

464
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,380
The way he moves and talks is different
from the way we do.

465
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,990
Royal speech is used.

466
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,960
When you're in the palace,
you must carry yourself with grace.

467
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,990
Eating and walking with grace.

468
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,870
I've worked a lot on it,

469
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,790
and I had to do that by watching series.

470
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,200
We assigned the roles based on our cast.

471
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,490
Definitely, a series thrives
when it has a varied cast

472
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,790
that adds more depth and layers to the story.

473
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,910
Our first choice for the king is Arning.
It can't be someone else.

474
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,240
He's very powerful.

475
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,500
I mean,

476
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,880
no one else has his commanding presence.

477
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,370
I'm Nirut Sirichanya.

478
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
I starred as the King of Emmaly.
[King of Emmaly: Nirut Sirichanya]

479
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,620
I'm in this clan. I'm sure you know the name.

480
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:36,540
It's Assavadevathin.

481
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:49,000
His duty is to watch over the princes and rulers
across the realm.

482
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,950
We actually chose the cast
based on their characters

483
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,620
and other details.

484
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,580
For example, if they have to
play someone's parent,

485
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,620
they need to have a believable resemblance.

486
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,200
We tried to cover everything.

487
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,100
I accepted the offer 'cause...
[Thatdanai: Saksit Tangthong]

488
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,460
I was once an award host,

489
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,250
and I met Zee and NuNew there.

490
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,370
They were really sweet. I liked them.

491
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,340
Once they told me Zee and NuNew are the cast,

492
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,340
I thought it'd be a good chance
to work with them.

493
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,950
I once told them
we were going to work together one day.

494
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,120
Fortunately, they gave me the offer,
and I wanted to work with them.

495
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:32,790
The world of series has definitely evolved.
[Tharin: Phollawat Manuprasert]

496
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,120
BL series, for instance,
weren't really on my radar,

497
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,450
but now they've noticeably improved
in both production and storytelling.

498
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,160
After almost 30 years in the acting industry,
[Wasin: Phutharit Prombandal]

499
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,500
I can say that the scale of this series is...

500
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,840
truly massive.

501
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:55,490
I imagined there'd be wonderful castles
[Rachata: Teerapong Leowrakwong]

502
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,190
and magical costumes that seemed unreal.

503
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,370
Honestly, I rarely get this kind of role.

504
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,630
It's impressive.
[Chita: Sueangsuda Lawanprasert]

505
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,320
I'm overjoyed
to take on the role of a royal guard

506
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,580
I've mostly been cast in motherly roles,

507
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,830
where you can be expressive and caring.

508
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,620
But as a royal guard
needs to be more reserved.

509
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,900
I need to stay sharp

510
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,600
and keep my skills and instincts

511
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,490
under wraps.

512
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,870
I'm genuinely excited about it.

513
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,580
I liked all the huge scenes.
[Chana: Maethanee Buranasiri]

514
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,170
All the locations.

515
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:41,630
It's not often you come across
a project that's willing to go all in, like this.

516
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,490
They really went all out.

517
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,500
And it's magnificent.

518
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,290
It genuinely makes me happy.

519
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,200
I'm excited to see it.
[Khunita: Chutima Teepanat]

520
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,790
I've never played this kind of role before

521
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,040
for this kind of series, you know.

522
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,420
It's my first time.

523
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:05,420
Let's find out
what's gonna happen to my role.

524
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,420
I've been working with Zee and NuNew
from the very start, since the Cutie Pie Series.

525
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,960
I'm aware of their strength,

526
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,800
and I'm trying to utilize it.

527
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,590
I've seen their growth
from the very beginning,

528
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:33,840
and now I can pinpoint areas

529
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:39,000
to refine, offering everyone
a fresh perspective on them.

530
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:43,230
I want to tell Aof that NuNew is a true gem.

531
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,050
He's incredibly talented

532
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,960
and determined.

533
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,250
When I got to work with him,

534
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,800
I could tell that he worked really hard.

535
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,130
Sometimes, it seemed like
he'd been working continuously for days,

536
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,380
and he still had to film
and say his very long lines.

537
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,710
Some scenes were dramatic, and he had to cry.

538
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,090
I could tell that he was really tired.

539
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,380
However, I never heard anything like,
"I'm giving up," from him.

540
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,710
He'd be like, "Okay, let's keep going.
We're almost done."

541
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,630
That made me think he's truly incredible,

542
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,710
both as an actor and as a person.

543
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:26,160
When I accepted the offer,
it was because I'd get to play as his father.

544
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,380
The first day I arrived at the set,
I was so impressed.

545
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,380
He called me, "Dad!"

546
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,710
I found that really adorable.

547
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,960
This label is his home,

548
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,380
but I'm a guest.

549
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,130
He's super welcoming, so...

550
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,130
There were no boundaries between us.

551
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,790
I just felt like he was my son.

552
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,540
Everyone was always there to help us.

553
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,790
They were so sweet and kind.

554
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,920
When I acted with the seniors,
it allowed me to improve my skills

555
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,540
as I observed them.

556
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:14,130
I was observing them as they acted.

557
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,960
I tried to observe how they did it.

558
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,590
I did that all the time,

559
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,210
and I learned from it, too.

560
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,920
I was always nervous
when I got to act with the seniors.

561
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,880
It felt like...

562
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,710
I tensed up, you know.

563
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,790
But it got more comfortable and fun later.

564
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,960
Working with Zee has been a great experience.
[Vatis: Witsarut Himmarat]

565
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,460
I didn't know him before,

566
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:43,130
and he's made me feel comfortable
working with him,

567
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,170
making my role as his friend easy to play.

568
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,210
I've been with this series for years,

569
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,290
and I'm fully confident in my cast and crew.

570
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,460
I'm sure you'll also know

571
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,340
that we're trying to
make this project memorable.

572
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,880
There's certainly a lot of pressure

573
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,500
since it needs a long development time,

574
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:05,920
and we're well aware of the high expectations

575
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,210
of both the actors' fans and DOMUNDI's.

576
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,540
Well...

577
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:18,960
We're trying to turn this pressure
into motivation

578
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,920
so that it allows us to make the best results.

579
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,300
I'm checking every process of the production

580
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,500
because I've been developing
everything and everyone since day one,

581
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,420
including our actors,
like Zee, NuNew, Jimmy, Ohm, Net, and JJ.

582
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,290
Every actor and actress in this series.

583
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,300
The parts that we've adapted from the novel

584
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,130
hopefully they're able to impress you

585
00:38:53,170 --> 00:39:01,420
as we're trying to convey some messages
through the series as well.

586
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,710
This might be one of the biggest investments
in a series yet,

587
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:16,080
I'm hoping it reaches as far as it can,
like globally,

588
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:22,460
because we aim to create something
with true value and quality.

589
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,410
Try to pick something
from your source of entertainment,

590
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,710
whether it's this series or others.

591
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:37,830
Every series has its own value.

592
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,540
So does The Next Prince Series.

593
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,120
There are messages hidden in it,

594
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,080
and you have to find them.

595
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,330
You'll see the consequences
of those bad behaviors in the end,

596
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,870
or even in the beginning or the middle.

597
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,250
It's going to give you lessons as you watch it.

598
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:01,500
After everything I said,
there are still surprises awaiting you.

599
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,910
Please give support to The Next Prince Series.

600
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,910
It'll be available on one31 and iQIYI.

601
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,490
It's a massive project for DOMUNDI,

602
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,750
me and NuNew.

603
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:55,290
I really hope that you're gonna enjoy it.

604
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,830
It's for sure gonna be fun,
amusing, and enjoyable.

605
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,620
This series is truly for them.

606
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,690
Everyone has put effort into it

607
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:10,450
and given their all to this series.

608
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,250
I also want you guys to appreciate...

609
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,410
those working hard,

610
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:23,390
including the director, the crew, the actors,

611
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,500
the location providers,
the costume designers, and the welfare staff.

612
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,540
Everyone worked really hard.

613
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,700
Please give them
the appreciation they deserve.

614
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,040
We've been through a lot with this series.

615
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,830
Like...

616
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,080
people's expectations and anticipation.

617
00:41:51,130 --> 00:42:00,580
We worked every day
knowing how many people have been waiting.

618
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:04,670
We tried to fix every flaw

619
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:09,080
and make every scene come out as it should.

620
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,580
I could feel that everyone loved their job.

621
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,790
The costume designers
wouldn't allow the outfits to be loose.

622
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,000
If it was, they'd fix it right there.

623
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,830
The art team wouldn't accept
even a tiny misplacement of the props.

624
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,250
They'd fix it right there.

625
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,330
We were constantly dealing

626
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:31,330
with this country's unpredictable weather.

627
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,560
Therefore, I'm not confident
that this will be the best series,

628
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,540
or the greatest one,

629
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,420
but I'm confident
that I've done my best with it.

630
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,960
It's something we're all proud of and love.

631
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
So...

632
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,540
I hope...

633
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:54,830
it proves worthy of the wait,

634
00:42:54,870 --> 00:43:00,920
the bond we share with the team,

635
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,670
and the heart and effort we've put in.

636
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,920
Once it's complete,

637
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,080
it no longer belongs to us.

638
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,580
We have to let it go.

639
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:17,540
So, when The Next Prince Series airs,

640
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,790
it belongs to the world, not us.

641
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,000
It's time for the viewers

642
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,950
to enjoy it,

643
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:32,380
to be proud of it like we are,

644
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,620
and to know that we've done something
worthy of their wait.

645
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,300
I've given everything I have.

646
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,420
There's nothing left I could've done.

647
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:48,170
I just hope what we've all put our hearts into

648
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:52,880
reaches the fans, those waiting for it,

649
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,130
and even new faces who don't know us yet,

650
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,880
so they can open their hearts
and discover us.

651
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,630
I hope this introduces something fresh
and raises the bar for future productions.

652
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,550
There are no Thai series like this one.

653
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,210
You need to check it out.

654
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:31,040
Join us as we explore the Palace of Emmaly
on May 3rd.

655
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,590
- With...
- The first episode of The Next Prince Series.

656
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Please check it out.
