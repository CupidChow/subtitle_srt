1
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,480
My friend has invited me
to visit his hometown in Meenanagarin.

2
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,120
I am truly honored
by your visit to Meenanagarin.

3
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,920
Wanna go see him for a bit?

4
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,150
Are you okay?

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,200
If we don't fight for change,

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,880
how many more

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,600
will end up like my dad and my sister?

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,680
But I also want to stand
with the people.

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,760
Let us sing with all our voices,

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,640
so those in power hear us
loud and strong.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,920
The Assavadevathins

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,760
- are knowingly taking innocent lives.
- You're hurting us!

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,480
You're harming your people!

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,600
Don't hurt them!

15
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,560
The Assavadevathins
are knowingly taking innocent lives.

16
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,960
That mine has blood on its hands.

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,640
- The King is killing more people!
- Stop!

18
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,960
Don't hurt them.

19
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,430
Don't hurt them!

20
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,440
- Hey, don't be violent!
- You're harming us!

21
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,720
- Come on.
- Let go of me!

22
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,670
Khanin...

23
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,040
Khanin!

24
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,000
Are you alright?

25
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,480
I'm truly sorry for what happened today.

26
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,440
It must have been quite a shock for you.

27
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,210
But I've already sent someone

28
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,130
to deal with the one
who caused the disturbance.

29
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,960
Deal with?

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,640
Yes.

31
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,490
Have him imprisoned for life

32
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,050
for harming Prince Khanin.

33
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,000
He didn't harm me, Uncle.

34
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,480
We were the ones who went too far.

35
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,000
He nearly lost his life
from suffocation.

36
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,200
All I wish to know is...

37
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,280
whether the people are telling the truth.

38
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,520
Are the Assavadevathins
really knowingly taking innocent lives?

39
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,880
I don't think so.

40
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,440
It was my own negligence.

41
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,360
You and the Assavadevathins
bear no blame.

42
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,400
Let's not speak of this any further.

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,720
Here,

44
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,640
I've prepared a gift for you.

45
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,120
I hope you'll like it.

46
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Go on, open it.

47
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
A black pearl,

48
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,870
known to shield its owner

49
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,110
and grant them great strength.

50
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,440
This is a sweet from our region.

51
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,670
I had it prepared just for you.

52
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,909
Please, have a taste.

53
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,410
It tastes wonderful, Uncle.

54
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
But...

55
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,800
I'm feeling a little weary.

56
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,080
I'd like to excuse myself
and get some rest.

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I understand.

58
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,280
Go ahead and get some rest.

59
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,030
This incident

60
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,070
has significantly impacted
the Assavadevathins, Wasin.

61
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,480
I understand, Your Majesty.

62
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,190
The perpetrator has now been dealt with,

63
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,600
and we've suppressed the news
everywhere we could,

64
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,440
except on social media,
which remains outside our control.

65
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,320
How is my grandson doing?

66
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,200
He seemed a little shaken.

67
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,460
He has gone to rest now, Your Majesty.

68
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,580
Take good care of him.

69
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,159
Make sure nothing else happens.

70
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Otherwise, I may have to revisit
the funding for your research.

71
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,640
I expect you to honor your word.

72
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,440
I accept your order
with utmost respect, Your Majesty.

73
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
How?

74
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,200
Am I supposed to just sit in the palace,

75
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,950
dressing up,

76
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,830
fencing, and shooting arrows,

77
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,150
while people out there
are in pain, even dying?

78
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,760
That's not how it is, Nin.

79
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,760
Prince Wasin

80
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,710
is already doing what he can.

81
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,400
The ruler's duty

82
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,070
is to ensure peace in the land.

83
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,040
Your duty

84
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,280
is to compete in the Royal Competition.

85
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,560
As for everything else,

86
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,960
you must be more cautious from now on.

87
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,760
Even Prince Wasin seems suspicious.

88
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,159
I should've believed you.

89
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,720
You were right about everything.

90
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,919
Everyone's out for themselves.

91
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,400
It's safest not to trust anyone.

92
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,760
In the battle for power,

93
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,540
you can't really tell

94
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,900
who's on which side.

95
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,840
Trust no one

96
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,320
but yourself, Nin.

97
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,360
Not even me.

98
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,920
Why would you say that?

99
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,550
If I can't even trust you,

100
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,120
then who do I have left?

101
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,900
I said it wrong.

102
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,520
- I meant to say...
- I see now.

103
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,160
If it ever comes down to choosing
between me and your duty,

104
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,600
you won't choose me, will you?

105
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,720
That's not what I meant.

106
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,790
If I failed today

107
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,830
and you ended up getting hurt,

108
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,880
how am I supposed to go on?

109
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,400
How can you trust

110
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,940
that I'll always keep you safe

111
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,080
when I can't even promise that
to myself?

112
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
You cared.

113
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,140
Just admit it. You cared about me.

114
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,840
It's not that hard.

115
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,480
I care about you a lot, Nin.

116
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,120
So please,

117
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,360
don't put yourself in danger again,

118
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
okay?

119
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
Yeah.

120
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,080
I got it.

121
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,680
I get the whole duty thing, too.

Let me see it.

I can't even trust

who tried to harm Prince Khanin, too.

Alright, Mr. Royal Guard.

171
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,760
That's not funny.

172
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
One more thing...

173
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,720
Have you read the letter I sent you?

174
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,080
My guess is that

175
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
it's just a prank letter
to distract you.

176
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,240
That could be true,

177
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,880
but it's still better to look into it.

178
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,000
See if you can find out who did it.

179
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,130
Got it. I'll reach out
if anything comes up.

180
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,200
Right, I forgot to mention...

181
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
I gotta go now.

182
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,640
I'm very worried.

183
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,400
It's okay.

184
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,560
Everything's gonna be fine.

185
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,520
Thank you, Doctor.

186
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,060
I shall take my leave, Your Majesty.

187
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,080
How are you doing, Grandfather?

188
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,340
I feel so much better now.

189
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,540
Don't worry about me.

190
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,360
What about you?

191
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,470
Are you hurt anywhere?

192
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,040
I'm not harmed, Grandfather.

193
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,480
Thank you for your concern.

194
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,320
It's something
no one ever wanted to happen.

195
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,760
There was no need for you
to take such risks.

196
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,840
It was dangerous.

197
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
I hope you won't do anything
like that again.

198
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,460
There's something
I want to ask you, Grandfather.

199
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,240
It's about what the people were saying
during the protest,

200
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,520
about the Assavadevathins.

201
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,240
Slandering us...

202
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,160
without a shred of evidence?

203
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,160
Why should it be...

204
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,160
of any interest, Khanin?

205
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,079
If there is no evidence,

206
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,599
why would they accuse us, Your Majesty?

207
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,440
This is all political.

208
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,200
Politics is full of twists and turns.

209
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,359
You shouldn't concern yourself with it.

210
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,599
Take care of your own duties first.

211
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,880
If that is your will,

212
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,720
I shall accept it, Grandfather.

213
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,880
Please take your rest.

214
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,280
I shall not disturb you any longer.

215
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,360
Charan, you stay.

216
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,320
Sit down.

217
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,880
This tea is wonderfully fragrant.

218
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,120
It brings back
the fondest memories of the past.

219
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,120
The flavor of Earl Grey
is so rich and strong.

220
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,760
It was the right choice
to have you bring it from the UK.

221
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,760
But even so, there are times
when trivial matters trouble me,

222
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,520
and they seem to...

223
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,240
take away so much of its taste.

224
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,240
I'd like you to look into the source
of these distractions

225
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,840
so that...

226
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,160
we may stop the trouble
before it begins.

227
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,160
And as always,

228
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,720
keep this matter confidential.

229
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
No one must know.

230
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,880
Your command is my will, Your Majesty.

231
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Your Royal Highness,

232
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,760
Prince Calvin is now at the palace,
awaiting an audience with you.

233
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,670
He's here?

234
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,230
Please proceed this way.

235
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,430
Okay.

236
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,200
I saw what happened
at the square in Meenanagarin,

237
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,160
and I couldn't help but feel concerned.

238
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,080
Are you alright?

239
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,750
Thank you for your concern,

240
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,950
but I'm unharmed.

241
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,160
It's the people
I'm most concerned about.

242
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,230
Still, I feel bad

243
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,030
that I couldn't be of any help to you.

244
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,360
It wasn't your fault.

245
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,030
You and Jay are friends, right?

246
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,770
He's a Morpheus student, too.

247
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,080
Are you close?

248
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,820
I'm not sure if I could say that.

249
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,140
What's wrong with him?

250
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,540
Nothing.

251
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,940
It's just that...

252
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,500
I wanted to understand more
about the protests.

253
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,600
I thought you might be close to him,

254
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,640
so perhaps he might've shared something.

255
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,720
Is there something
I'm not meant to find out?

256
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,520
Not exactly.

257
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,150
It's just that I feel guilty about him.

258
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,220
Guilty?

259
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,920
I've kept it from him that I'm a prince.

260
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,320
Now, I don't even know
how to bring it up.

261
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,160
There's never been a right moment.

262
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,900
If there's no right moment,

263
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,590
then make one.

264
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,080
You're Prince Calvin;

265
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,560
you've got this.

266
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,640
It wouldn't be right

267
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,440
for someone special
to hear the truth from someone else.

268
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Someone special?

269
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah.

270
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,880
If he wasn't,

271
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,560
you wouldn't be this caught up in it,

272
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,320
would you?

273
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
Jay!

274
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,880
Can we talk?

275
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
I'm really sorry I didn't show up

276
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,920
and that I wasn't in touch.

277
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,800
I was...

278
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,140
What?

279
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
You were what?

280
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,600
Something urgent came up.

281
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
It was so urgent...

282
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,120
that you didn't even have a moment
to tell me?

283
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,200
[Mother: You should've been
more careful]

284
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,280
[Guys, it's Prince Calvin from Bhujar!]

285
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,920
[Prince Calvin in the flesh]

286
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,240
[It's really him! He's so gorgeous!]

287
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,960
[Mother: If you don't want things
to escalate,]

288
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,560
[Mother: don't do anything
reckless again]

289
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,920
[Mother: Your father won't take it well
if he hears about this]

290
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,680
Are you home yet?

291
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,280
I am.

292
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,240
I'm really happy

293
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,000
that I got to spend the day with you.

294
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,400
Right, Jay.

295
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,800
About tomorrow...

296
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,720
Oh, right.

297
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,440
I forgot to send you the location.

298
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,170
Give me one sec.

299
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,000
I mean...

300
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,800
Is something wrong?

301
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
No.

302
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,000
I know I was wrong,

303
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,960
and I'm sorry.

304
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,400
But my feelings for you are really deep.

305
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,000
If I want to clear things up between us,

306
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,840
would you mind?

307
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,120
Do you realize

308
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,840
why I'm this mad?

309
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,280
I didn't keep my word.

310
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,160
You just disappeared.

311
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,160
I was clueless.

312
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,280
How did you expect me to react?

313
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,120
I had no clue what was happening.

314
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Don't you think...

315
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
I'd be concerned about you?

316
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm sorry that I disappeared

317
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,840
and didn't tell you what happened.

318
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,080
I won't make you feel that way again.

319
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,600
I promise.

320
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,740
Keep your word.

321
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,600
If you win against me,

322
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,840
I've got a prize for you tonight.

323
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,080
You must not challenge me like that,
Your Royal Highness.

324
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,120
For I am confident

325
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,640
that I will be the one to win.

326
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Your Royal Highness!

327
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,060
Your Royal Highness!

328
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,100
This way.

329
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,600
Are you harmed, Your Royal Highness?

330
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,360
I'm fine.

331
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,360
Let's leave right now.

332
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,120
Hurry!

333
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,360
Please rise.

334
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,140
Please forgive us

335
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,020
for arriving late, Your Royal Highness.

336
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,480
Are you hurt?

337
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,560
Go find him.

338
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,800
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

339
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
I'm sorry.

340
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,000
You had to go through pain
because of me again.

341
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,240
I'm alright, Your Royal Highness.

342
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,800
It's better that it was me.

343
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,320
If something happened to you,

344
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,320
I would never forgive myself.

345
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,080
It's not your fault.

346
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,040
I won't let this slide.

347
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,720
Whoever dares to harm me and my people

348
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,600
must face consequences.

349
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,460
Let go!

350
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,520
Let go of me!

351
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Now!

352
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,620
Your Royal Highness,

353
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,660
please spare me.

354
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,200
Who put you up to this?

355
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,880
I was...

356
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,120
acting under orders
from His Majesty the King

357
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,560
to observe you from a distance.

358
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,480
How could I ever trust you?

359
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,420
Are you hurt anywhere?

360
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,930
I was fortunate

361
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,970
to come out unharmed,

362
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,720
but my companion,

363
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,600
Paytai, was injured.

364
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,040
It's good that you're safe.

365
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,920
Who was bold enough to try to hurt you?

366
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,120
I suspect there are only two clans

367
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,280
that would take delight
in my misfortune,

368
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,190
either the Davichmethas...

369
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,440
or the Assavadevathins.

370
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,680
My guards managed to capture a man,

371
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,440
and he claimed he was sent by the King.

372
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,360
That old man
just so happens to be sick right now.

373
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,320
Guess I'll have to pay him a visit.

374
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Talk to you later.

375
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Siwakorn,

376
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,200
have the convoy ready
within ten minutes.

377
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,330
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

378
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,160
Father,

379
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,480
may I seek your counsel?

380
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,400
Um...

381
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,280
Yes!

382
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,700
I believe it would be wise

383
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,090
to start clear negotiations
with the miners

384
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,570
and the protesters.

385
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,640
Your move. Do you wish to go on?

386
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,040
Father...

387
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
Tharin,

388
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,840
you're planning to do something
that's not needed.

389
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,960
If we refuse to listen,

390
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,370
how will we ever know

391
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,930
what they truly want?

392
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,360
Emmaly still needs a lot of income
from the mine.

393
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,200
If you don't want to see
it face an economic crisis,

394
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,280
do as I say.

395
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,040
Will you keep playing or not?

396
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,680
If not,

397
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,660
why bother staying around?

398
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,640
You shouldn't have gone
to the trouble of coming here.

399
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,320
I've already recovered.

400
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,000
It was no trouble at all.

401
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,680
But are you sure
you've truly recovered, Your Majesty?

402
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,120
It's only natural for someone my age.

403
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,840
Nothing to be concerned about.

404
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,250
Now, what about you?

405
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,370
I heard you were hurt. Is that true?

406
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
I'm only lightly injured, Your Majesty.

407
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,900
I've met the person you sent
to watch over me.

408
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,080
Thank you kindly, Your Majesty.

409
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,800
Well then,

410
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,320
that puts my mind at ease.

411
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,450
Sadly, I haven't managed
to catch the culprit yet.

412
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
Leave that matter to me.

413
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,920
I'll have someone look into it.

414
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

415
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,750
But do you have any idea

416
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,500
who might be behind this?

417
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Do you intend any deeper meaning
in your question?

418
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
There was nothing implied, Your Majesty.

419
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,320
I only asked out of curiosity.

420
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,400
Come in.

421
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,320
We have not identified the criminal yet,
Your Royal Highness.

422
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,440
I'm afraid...

423
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,390
it may take a little longer.

424
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,240
By that time,
he must've been silenced for good.

425
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Father,

426
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,140
we are fully aware

427
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,580
that it's the doing of...

428
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,160
the Assavadevathins.

429
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,920
Why can't we do anything?

430
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,480
Do we have to just wait and do nothing?

431
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
You think you can take them down

432
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,000
without any proof?

433
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,160
Don't forget who's behind them.

434
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,640
And from what we've talked
to that old man,

435
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,680
he neither admitted nor denied.

436
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,320
He probably thinks
he's got all the power

437
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,240
to do whatever he wants.

438
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120

I have something
to request, Grandfather.

486
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,280
I wish to study

487
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,560
Well...

488
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,760

Based on the recent protest,

491

I think we need to improve
the operations at the mine.

492
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,760
Those accusations are just rumors.

493
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,680
I've observed the mine for years,

494
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,240
and it has been properly run throughout.

00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,280

as he ought to.

497

May I ask why, Your Royal Highness?

522
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,120
I can't stay silent and do nothing.

you can just fix right away.

what the truth is.

00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,760
If you want to find out,

529
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,450
I'll make sure to get the answer.

530
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,280
Yeah.

531
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,020

Stop.

542
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800

with Grandfather.

543

He hasn't been well for long.

544
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
Avoid any disagreement with him, dear.

545
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,190
Okay?

546
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,040
Yes, Father.

547
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,280
I'm here to let you know

548
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
that I'm returning to Assavadevathin

549
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,960
with a significant event coming up soon.

550
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,080
Event?

551
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,120
What event, Father?

552
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,880
Charan,

553
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,580
you haven't told him yet?

554
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,880
Forgive me.

555
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,680
Maybe my teaching was insufficient,

556
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,680
so His Royal Highness cannot recall.

557
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,880
It's the lantern procession
of our homeland,

558
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,240
which is a long-standing tradition.

559
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,360
Would you be interested
in going to see it?

560
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,540
I would, Father.

561
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,400
But...

562
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,560
Can I go?

563
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,740
Your shoulder motion has improved.

564
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,720
Yeah,

565
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,760
but I have to get used to it, too.

566
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
Great.

567
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,640
With frequent practice,
your body will get used to it.

568
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,000
Ran,

569
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,560
have you been to
a lantern procession before?

570
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,720
I have

571
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,880
when I was young.

572
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,760
After my mother passed,

573
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,920
I haven't returned
to Assavadevathin at all.

574
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,520
In that case,

575
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,160
let's make new memories there together.

576
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,960
I promise

577
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
to practice hard while we're there.

578
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,280
Actually, no.

579
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,680
I swear.

580
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,840
Do you really think you can escape
the power of His Majesty the King,

581
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
Mr. Thatdanai?

582
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,920
Follow us.

583
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,400
Where are you going, buddies?

584
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,840
Better think twice
before going that way.

585
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,400
Give me that.

586
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,920
Look into that camera.

587
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,640
Wanna go viral?

588
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,720
Alright,

589
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,280
I'll take him from here.

590
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,520
Let's go.

591
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,360
Right here.

592
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,040
Alright, you're safe.

593
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,120
Who are you?

594
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,120
Why did you save me?

595
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,400
I'm Vedish,

596
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,440
a friend of Charan.

597
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,120
What did you mean

598
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,400
by saying Charan sent you

599
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,880
to find me?

600
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,840
Is there a problem?

601
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,400
Nothing, just...

602
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,080
He asked me to take care of you.

603
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,840
I'm good.

604
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,560
I can take care of myself,

605
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,200
and I've got things to do.

606
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,560
You were about to die.

607
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,800
If I didn't step in,

608
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,840
those soldiers would've taken you away.

609
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,560
They are no threat to me.

610
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,920
Don't be too confident.

611
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,260
If you get caught,

612
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,900
you're as good as gone.

613
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,730
So please come with me.

614
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,040
If nothing else,

615
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,920
do it for Prince Khanin.

616
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,520
Is something wrong?

617
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,400
Stop the cover-ups.
Face the air pollution crisis!

618
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,040
Yeah!

619
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,320
You have all that power
but still can't fix this. Just leave!

620
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,160
You think it'll be over
just by doing what they ask?

621
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,800
Real change takes time.

622
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,360
It takes courage and determination.

623
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,040
Is it true that the mine's pollution
is making miners ill?

624
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,320
I'm tired.

625
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,520
It's very late now.

626
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,680
Why are you here?

627
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I would like you
to paint a portrait of me.

628
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,160
♫The only love I've longed for,♫

629
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,760
♫Just the word "love" from you,
and that's all♫

630
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,240
♫Let me hear it, I won't ask for more♫

631
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,560
♫I need your love♫

632
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,640
♫The only one I adore,♫

633
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:10,540
♫My heart's been loving
only you, my all♫

634
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:21,120
♫Oh, I need your love♫
