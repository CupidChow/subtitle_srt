1
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,320
Is what people are saying
about the mine true?

2
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,960
Don't hurt them.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,840
Did someone really die
because of the Assavadevathins?

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,480
I was...

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,080
acting under orders
from His Majesty the King

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,160
He probably thinks
he's got all the power

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,240
to do whatever he wants.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,000
I wish to study
the mining operations in Assavadevathin.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,160
Leave.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,960
I don't want you in my sight.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,880
I'm returning to Assavadevathin

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,480
with a significant event coming up soon.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,520
In that case,

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,160
let's make new memories there together.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
Who are you?

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,160
Why did you save me?

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,040
I'm Vedish,

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,120
a friend of Charan.

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,520
I'm glad you're here, dear.

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,460
Welcome to the Palace of Assavadevathin.

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,720
I'm glad to be here as well.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,640
You must be weary
and hungry from the journey.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,320
Let's go to the dining hall.

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Yes, Father.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,960
Have a seat, Charan.

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,320
Eat up, dear.

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,320
If there's anything you want, tell me.

28
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,039
Yes, Father.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
Alright, let's dig in.

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,840
Why does this spaghetti taste like...

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,520
I learned it from Thatdanai.

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,120
You cooked this yourself, Father?

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,040
I figured you'd feel more comfortable

34
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,880
if the taste was something
you remembered.

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,240
I appreciate that, Father.

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,040
This is your first visit
to Assavadevathin.

37
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
One day,
you will be the one to govern it.

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,400
Would you mind

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,240
if I asked you something, Father?

40
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
Not at all. Go ahead.

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,160
Recently, there was a news report
about a young girl

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
who stole gold from the mine to sell

43
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,840
just so she could pay
for her mother's medical treatment.

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,760
Have you heard about it, Father?

45
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,480
Indeed, I have.

46
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,240
Is it true that the mine's pollution
is making miners ill?

47
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,760
As for that matter,

48
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm still looking into it.

49
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,640
But don't worry, dear.

50
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,760
I'll take care of everything.

51
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,120
For now,

52
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,340
go and enjoy the lantern procession.

53
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,440
Charan will show you around.

54
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,880
We are here, Your Royal Highness.

55
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,440
Please proceed this way.

56
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,480
When will the procession start?

57
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,920
In half an hour, I believe.

58
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,040
Why do they have this procession, Ran?

59
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,480
Back in the day,
most people worked as miners.

60
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,360
They often worked until night

61
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
or even dawn.

62
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,560
The way home was dark and empty,

63
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,360
making some villagers

64
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,280
fear what they couldn't see.

65
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,320
Thankfully, the starlight
served as their guide.

66
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,320
So the villagers
used lanterns as a symbol

67
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,000
to show gratitude to the starlight

68
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,200
and to ask for blessings
for a successful mining season.

69
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,080
And it has been passed down
ever since, right?

70
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,080
How come you know the answers
to all of my questions?

71
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,120
I don't know everything.

72
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,320
That's not true.

73
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,600
Whatever I ask, you've got an answer.

74
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,320
When it comes to things
I'm not familiar with,

75
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,520
I might not have the answers for you.

76
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,320
That will never happen

77
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,400
cause you're familiar with everything.

78
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
Well...

79
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,780
Should we get one of those?

80
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,190
Okay.

81
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
Chakri,

82
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,159
let's go get a lantern.

83
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

84
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
Let's go.

85
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,200
Let's make a comeback, Unc-unc.

86
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,640
Fine, no holding hands.

87
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Unc-unc?

88
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,760
Oh, are you Prince Khanin?

89
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,200
I'll take one, please.

90
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,000
- Oh, sure.
- The lantern.

91
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,240
Here you are.

92
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,560
- Thanks, young man.
- No problem.

93
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,720
Sales haven't been so great this year.
Fewer tourists are showing up.

94
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,080
- Oh, I see.
- They say...

95
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,160
it's because of the dust in the news.

96
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,360
People are afraid of getting sick,

97
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
so they're not coming anymore.

98
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,520
And to be fair, the dust really is bad.

99
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,840
The air's not great
around here, young man.

100
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Sorry.

101
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,340
It's okay.

102
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,840
Just an old lady talking too much.

103
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,240
Have fun while you're here.

104
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,800
Enjoy your visit, Your Royal Highness.

105
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,040
Is something wrong?

106
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,360
He saw me.

107
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,280
Got it.

108
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,800
Dad?

109
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,000
That's my dad!

110
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,860
Let's leave now.

111
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,920
Nin.

112
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Let go of me.

113
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,160
- I wanna know if it's him.
- Nin.

114
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,960
It's very crowded here.

115
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
You might be wrong.

116
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,760
Yeah, I wanna know if I'm wrong or not.

117
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Let me go.

118
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,880
Nin!

119
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,160
Nin...

120
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,960
Excuse me.

121
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,280
- Nin!
- Oh...

122
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,240
I'm sorry.

123
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,950
Are you okay?

124
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,080
We're sorry.

125
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,120
We're really sorry.

126
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,320
Stop the cover-ups. Face the air crisis!

127
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,800
- Yeah!
- Right!

128
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,400
Stop the cover-ups. Face the air crisis!

129
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,280
- Yeah!
- Exactly!

130
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,120
Stop the cover-ups. Face the air crisis!

131
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,000
- Yeah!
- Right!

132
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,360
Clean up our air!

133
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,840
- Clean up our air!
- Clean up our air!

134
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,010
Clean up our air!

135
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,840
- Clean up our air!
- Clean up our air!

136
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,500
Clean up our air!

137
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,680
Clean up our air!
[Those in power must remedy the situation]

138
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,320
Clean up our air!

139
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,120
- Clean up our air!
- Deal with the dust!

140
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
No dust!
[The city of dust]

141
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,790
- No dust!
- Clean up our air!

142
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,240
Clean up our air!
[We want clean air, not dust]

143
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,660
- Clean up our air!
- Clean up our air!

144
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,000
Clean up our air!

145
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,520
- Clean up our air!
- Clean up our air!

146
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,920
[The power is ours;
this land belongs to the people!]

147
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,800
Those in power must solve
the mine's problems.

148
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,400
If we go on strike,

149
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
will Emmaly make it?

150
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,360
- Exactly!
- Right!

151
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Everyone,

152
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,240
today,

153
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,280
let's make our voices heard
by those at the top!

154
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,480
- Right!
- Yeah!

155
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,880
[Help! Lung cancer is here!]

156
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,960
[We want our air back!]

157
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,640
I'm here to listen to all concerns

158
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,800
and calls for change.

159
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,880
We've been speaking out for ages.

160
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,000
And yet, you claim you didn't know
that lives have been lost?

161
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,360
- Yeah!
- Exactly.

162
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,200
- Right.
- Clean up our air now!

163
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,520
Deal with the dust!

164
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,440
Do it now!

165
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,840

but there hasn't been any progress.

172
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,440
- You don't even care we're suffering!
- Yeah!

173
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,240

The procession is on its way.

184
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,880
Can't you see what the real issue is?

185
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,480
You're only here to cause a scene.

186
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,440
Get lost!

187
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,120
Bring it!

188
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,880
Hey, everyone.

189
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
Come on.

190
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,240
Get them out of here.

191
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,960
Let them know
how much we value our tradition.

192
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,520
Get out!

193
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,160
Get out.

194
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Get out!

195
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,720
Everyone, don't use force.

196
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,160
Let's not resort to violence.

197
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,920
You are oppressing the citizens.

198
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,080
- Please calm down.
- Go away!

199
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,560
Hey!

200
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,200
- Gosh.
- Why did you do that?

201
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,480
I need to know if he's still alive.

202
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,920
But now, I'm going to help them.

203
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,760
The situation may worsen.

204
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,000
Please leave, Your Royal Highness.

205
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
Please.

206
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,880
- Nin...
- It's gonna be alright.

207
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,800
Trust me.

208
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Hey!

209
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,190
What kind of upbringing did you have

210
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,790
to behave like this?

211
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,760
Oh...

212
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,750
Your Royal Highness.

213
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,160
Your voices are heard.

214
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,040
Given the urgency,

215
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,160
the issue should be
handled temporarily first.

216
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,880
N95 masks and air purifiers
shall be provided to the miners.

217
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,160
Following that,
I'll keep a close watch on the situation

218
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,080
and tackle the pollution problem.

219
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,880
I will figure out

220
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,720
how to reduce dust pollution.

221
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
I kindly ask you

222
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,210
to let the lantern procession pass.

223
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,440
I'm genuinely going to help you.

224
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
I give you my word.

225
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,000
How are we supposed to trust you?

226
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,920
That's right.

227
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,960
How can we be sure

228
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,760
that what you're doing
isn't just for show?

229
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,320
- Fake!
- Fake.

230
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,800
How could you do that?

231
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Trust me.

232
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,320
I'm helping everyone.

233
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,840
Your concerns matter,

234
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,600
and I promise to address them.

235
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,160
However, the procession
doesn't cause pollution,

236
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,040
and these people are merely keeping
their tradition alive.

237
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,840
So please,

238
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,240
kindly make way for them.

239
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,120

240
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,760

251
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,490
Last night, an unrest incident broke out

252
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,920
in the square of Assavadevathin.
[Clash Breaks Out in Assavadevathin]

253
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,640
A group of protesters
advocating for environmental issues

254
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,760
blocked the lantern procession,

255
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,600
resulting in clashes.

256
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
There have been no reported fatalities,

257
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,240
but over 20 individuals
sustained minor injuries.

258
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,640
The situation was brought under control
by Prince Khanin,

259
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,440
the heir to the Assavadevathin clan.

260
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,010
His Royal Highness
has since been widely regarded

261
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,960
as a symbol of change

262
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
and a new hope for the people.

263
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
How are you doing?

264
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,160
You ended up coming back with me anyway.

265
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,520
Your safety comes first, dear.

266
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,160
I know you're concerned
about the mining matter.

267
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,040
I've been trying to deal with it myself.

268
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,430
But in the end,

269
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,270
I realized I don't hold
as much power as I thought.

270
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,000
I wish to talk to His Majesty
about the mining matter.

271
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

272
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,680
It'd be better to wait
until His Majesty is fully recovered.

273
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,720
I've been kept
in the dark my entire life...

274
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,600
I could use some rest, too.

275
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,720
believing everything
your grandfather told me

276
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,520
without ever questioning it.

277
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,000
If you don't want to see
it face an economic crisis,

278
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,800
do as I say.

279
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,920
I never acted on my own,

280
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,600
and that's why
things have gotten this far.

281
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,160
You have all that power

282
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,640
but still can't fix this. Just leave!

283
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,040
Get out!

284
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,320
Even though I wish
I could change things now,

285
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,440
the truth is,

286
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,160
the power still rests with him.

287
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Not everything

288
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,160
may turn out the way we expected.

289
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,200
So, had you held greater power,

290
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,920
everything would have gone
more smoothly and swiftly, right?

291
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,070
If you wish to change Emmaly,

292
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
one way to do it

293
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,040
is to win the Competition.

294
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,720
I'll do my best to win.

295
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,880
You shouldn't have done that.

296
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,440
My intention was merely to assist you.

297
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,280
Why is that wrong?

298
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,800
I don't need your assistance.

299
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,720
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

300
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,360
All you need to do is
practice for the Competition.

301
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I know, Grandfather.

302
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,240
And I am going to win

303
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,800
so that I can gain the power
to make real change.

304
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,920
If you are going to do nothing,

305
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,560
I will step up and do it myself one day.

306
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,880
Anyone can say that,

307
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,120
but do you really have a solution?

308
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,600
You think it'll be over
just by doing what they ask?

309
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,680
Real change takes time.

310
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,320
It takes courage and determination.

311
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,240
Waiting to know everything
means no action will be taken.

312
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,240
If there's nothing else,

313
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,480
I shall take my leave.

314
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,120
The soldiers have begun
to track you down.

315
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,440
I need to be more cautious.

316
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,580
Do you think...

317
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,680
Prince Khanin saw you?

318
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,560
He did.

319
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,120
So, what's your plan?

320
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,040
I'll keep a low profile for a while.

321
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,880
He should focus on the Competition.

322
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't want to be a distraction.

323
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,360
You are...

324
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,320
genuinely a good soul.

325
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,080
You saved the heir's life,

326
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,880
yet you're forced into hiding

327
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,680
and acting like you're dead.

328
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,480
They're trying to take you out for real.

329
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,720
I understand
the King's reasoning, though.

330
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,120
Khanin has to settle into Emmaly

331
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,180
and participate in the Competition.

332
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
I'd rather not be the reason
he loses focus.

333
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,800
Your generation...

334
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,320
is impressive, you know.

335
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,940
You understand everything.

336
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,980
But...

337
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,960
if I were you,

338
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,160
I'd have exposed them by now.

339
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,880
Have you ever gone fishing?

340
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,800
If the fish is stronger than your line,

341
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,280
can you reel it in?

342
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Or will it drag you into the water?

343
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,560
I'm not someone who gives up easily.

344
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,080
If it comes to that,

345
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,400
I'll pull it up

346
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,440
even if it kills me.

347
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,840
What if it's the biggest fish
in the sea?

348
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,740
Big enough to swallow any smaller fish

349
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,360
whenever it pleases.

350
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,440
How could you possibly beat that?

351
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,880
If the smaller fish all stand together

352
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,920
and refuse to be prey,

353
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,240
then no matter how huge it is,

354
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,000
that fish won't last forever.

355
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
Sit down.

356
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,080
You know Thatdanai is in Emmaly,
don't you?

357
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,360
I sent my people
to keep him under control,

358
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,680
but he got away.

359
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,480
Must I command you

360
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,800
to stay away
from anything involving him?

361
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,760
I'm afraid...

362
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,680
I can no longer hide the truth
about Mr. Thatdanai from Prince Khanin.

363
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,360
But I assure you,

364
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,040
they will meet
when the time is right, Your Majesty.

365
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,720
I've shown you nothing but leniency,

366
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,200
never once holding a grudge,
because you are my grandson.

367
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,840
But now, as the King of Emmaly,

368
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,920
I hereby command you
to cease all involvement with Thatdanai.

369
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

370
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Your Royal Highness?

371
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,520
Why didn't you tell me
you'd already found my dad?

372
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,160
Was that a command?

373
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,480
From Grandfather?

374
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,920
I understand that seeing him now

375
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,440
might put him in danger.

376
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,060
But please, just tell me he's okay.

377
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,700
That's all I want to hear.

378
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,280
He is in Vedish's care.

379
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,080
You don't need to worry.

380
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,080
Thank you.

381
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,400
I trust you, Ran.

382
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,450
The first round

383
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,440
of the Competition

384
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,520
shall be a test of wit.

385
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,080
The committee under His Majesty
will prepare the challenge

386
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,760
and deliver it to the competitors
one day in advance.

387
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,000
The second round

388
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,720
will be an archery competition.

389
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,200
With your permission, Your Majesty,

390
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:04,360
I propose we follow
the traditional format

391
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,320
and hold the Competition in the forest.

392
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,120
Using technology from Davichmetha,

393
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,720
we can design targets
that transmit scores

394
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:18,560
directly to the judges in real time.

395
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,840
I agree, Your Majesty.

396
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,160
It would make the Competition
more exciting.

397
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,120
Given that Wasin has no heir,

398
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,380
I believe it would be fair

399
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,720
to let him oversee
the competition grounds

400
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,560
in Meenanagarin.

401
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,840
If it's acceptable to all,
I have no objections.

402
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,520
The final round of the Competition

403
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,800
will be a fencing competition.

404
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,800
The winning heir

405
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,560
will secure their father's position
as the next King.

406
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,880
Shall we take a short break,
Your Royal Highness?

407
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,680
I'm totally fine.

408
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,100
Let's keep going.

409
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,780
Your next training session is archery.

410
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,020
This way, please.

411
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,440
Is something the matter, Father?

412
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,640
I've been fully briefed
on the details of the Competition.

413
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,240
Anyway,

414
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,440
I've already found
the right coach for you.

415
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,520
You'll start training
with your new coach tomorrow.

416
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,800
What happened exactly?

417
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,600
Stop asking so many questions.

418
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,320
Just do as I say.

419
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,960
Why do I need a new coach, though?

420
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,880
Mira might be helpful,

421
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,880
but she doesn't know everything.

422
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,480
A great coach

423
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,840
will give us the upper hand.

424
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,240
I've chosen what's best for you.

425
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,680
You're lying.
It's because she's a woman, isn't it?

426
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,440
Yeah.

427
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,240
If word gets out

428
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,760
that a woman is training you,

429
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,920
don't you think
those two clans will laugh at us?

430
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,400
I have two options for you, Father.

431
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,370
First,

432
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,840
let Mira be my coach.

433
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,000
Or second,

434
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,040
I withdraw
from the Competition entirely.

435
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,800
Why can't you just listen
to your father for once?

436
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,180
If that's all,

437
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,220
I may return to my training now.

438
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,120
I mean...

439
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,040
Follow me.

440
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,680
It looks like
something is bothering you.

441
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,360
Is it about Ava?

442
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,360
I'm totally at a loss.

443
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,160
If you don't mind me asking,

444
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,680
may I ask what happened?

445
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Having a daughter as my heir
is already a challenge.

446
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,320
And now her coach is a woman, too.

447
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,280
I fear that if anyone finds out,

448
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,360
they might look down on us.

449
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,420
Well...

450
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,640
Don't be so concerned, Chana.

451
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,760
There's nothing wrong
with having a female coach

452
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,760
as long as she helps her improve
and gets along with her.

453
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,500
Besides,

454
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:19,820
Coach Mira has remarkable skills.

455
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,800
Finding a perfect coach like her

456
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,200
isn't easy at all.

457
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
Your Royal Highness,

458
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,040
I don't want you
to face any problems with Prince Chana.

459
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,040
You belong to me.

460
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,700
Ignore what others say.

461
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,120
Just listen to me.

462
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,360
But his command...

463
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,280
He still wants me to compete,

464
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,880
so I need my coach.

465
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,400
Let's keep going.

466
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,199
Let's call it a day.

467
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,719
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

468
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,440
Gosh.

469
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:56,409
Do you really have to be this strict?

470
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,800
We have less than two weeks.

471
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,200
But my brain
can't handle any more of this.

472
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,280
Fine.

473
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,320
Then...

474
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,880
Shall I go find Mr. Charan for you?

475
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,680
Well,

476
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,720
then there might be
some space left in my brain.

477
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,640
Gosh.

478
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,920
There's something with that name, huh?

479
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,560
Alright, then.

480
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,440
I shall go find him

481
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,400
if you...

482
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,600
continue reading a couple more pages.

483
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,880
Don't try to mess with me, Chakri.

484
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,480
Oh...

485
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,840
Fine.

486
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,960
I'm glad

487
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,000
Ramil is putting more effort
into practicing than he used to.

488
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,840
It's probably because you are there
to cheer him on.

489
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,880
Since you know
what you're supposed to do,

490
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,120
you won't face any punishment.

491
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Let me help you.

492
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,040
The Competition is around the corner.

493
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,680
I want you to concentrate better, Nin.

494
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,200
I'm tired.

495
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
So tired that...

496
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,080
I can fall asleep
the moment I lay my head on a pillow.

497
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,520
In the Competition,

498
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,440
every clan has its heir at stake.

499
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,520
To claim the throne,

500
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,120
something must be sacrificed.

501
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,560
What if I want something else first?

502
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,960
That needs to wait, too.

503
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,080
- Argh!
- Your Royal Highness!

504
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,880
Does it hurt a lot?

505
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,680
You can give your all physically,

506
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,160
but without proper rest,
you're only harming yourself.

507
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,360
I have never seen you this way,
Your Royal Highness.

508
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,920
Please do take some rest.

509
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,280
If you drink too much, you'll struggle
to keep up with the training.

510
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,840
You told me to rest, didn't you?

511
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,280
But you've gone too far,
Your Royal Highness.

512
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,320
You don't understand me.

513
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,560
Isn't gender irrelevant in this matter?

514
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,560
I thought he stood up for me

515
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,280
because he understood me,

516
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,680
but actually,

517
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
he was protecting his own dignity.

518
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,600
Why was I born a woman?

519
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,960
No one can truly understand another,
Your Royal Highness.

520
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,000
Only you know yourself best.

521
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,920
You may not have chosen your gender,

522
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,840
yet you can become the best version
of yourself, Your Royal Highness.

523
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,880
Your skills have gotten better.

524
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,340
♫You've always been my only one, still♫

525
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,700
♫Since fate first brought us together♫

526
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:48,320
♫I've never forgotten
any of that, like never♫

527
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,660
♫Like fire in the rain,♫

528
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,280
♫We aren't meant for each other♫

529
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:01,080
♫I'm begging heaven and fate♫

530
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I had this book when I was in London.

531
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,900
It was on the shelf,

532
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,140
so I took it.

533
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,000
I get that we regained independence
thanks to the alliance

534
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,550
between the four clans.

535
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,320
But now that I'm actually here,

536
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,040
now that I've actually met
the royal family,

537
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,920
it's even harder to believe that...

538
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,740
the prince from the Bhuchongpisuts

539
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,680
would willingly give up his power

540
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,100
and hold the Royal Competition
for the crown.

541
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,680
It's understandable

542
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,360
that you feel this puzzle piece

543
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,920
doesn't quite fit.

544
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,040
After all, history depends
on who writes it.

545
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,200
Yeah,

546
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,000
you're right.

547
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Even if it's based on evidence,

548
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,800
in the end, it's a written narrative.

549
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,000
What you know is the official narrative.

550
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,720
But some versions say that the prince...

551
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,920
never intended to share his power
with anyone.

552
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,640
Obviously, with all that power.

553
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,640
When he was about to lose the war,

554
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,640
he reached out to the other clans
to strike a deal.

555
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,760
They agreed to join forces.

556
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,360
After that,

557
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,080
the Royal Fencing Competition
was established as a tradition.

558
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,320
My brain's drained.

559
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,520
Your hug makes me feel so much better.

560
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,080
[Has that prince done something?
He said he'd help us!]

561
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,640
[If the prince won't take a stand,
we'll all struggle]

562
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,200
[If the mine shuts down,
my dad will lose his job]

563
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,720
[We are suffering;
how can you even sleep?]

564
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,610
[Justice for the miners!]

565
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,040
[#JusticeForMiners]

566
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,440
Your voices are heard.

567
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,440
Given the urgency,

568
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,560
the issue should be handled
temporarily first.

569
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,080
I will figure out

570
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,840
how to reduce dust pollution.

571
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,720
[Just get out if you can't fix it]

572
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,560
[What happens to the miners
if the prince says no to the mine?]

573
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,390
[The mine feeds us]

574
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,240
[I think he's working on it;
let's be patient]

575
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,040
[Prince Khanin, stand with the miners!]

576
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,000
You were just a child,
so you probably don't remember,

577
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,880
but I have never
once forgotten that moment.

578
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,080
Are you okay?

579
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,720
Yeah.

580
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,680
The truth remains the truth.

581
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,160
I hope you understand
that what happened in the past

582
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,360
has nothing to do with him.

583
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,240
I know.

584
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,440
I appreciate you telling me the truth.

585
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,960
We'll talk later.

586
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,700
Don't worry too much, Ran.

587
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,400
Talk to you later.

588
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,020
Yeah.

589
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,160
Nin?

590
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,360
Is everything alright?

591
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,280
Is that Dyrane?

592
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,400
It's very late now.

593
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,160
Why are you here?

594
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,000
I missed you; that's why.

595
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,960
Actually,

596
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,200
I would like you
to paint a portrait of me.

597
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,320
You'd better go to bed now, Nin.

598
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,000
I could do that,

599
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,200
but I'd do it here.

600
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,040
I'm feeling stressed,

601
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,280
and I need something to help me unwind.

602
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:53,390
Well...

603
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,400
Nin...

604
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,440
Has anyone told you...

605
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,880
that when you're relaxed,

606
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,640
you're cuter
than when you're all serious?

607
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,600
Alright, I'll stop.

608
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,320
But I really meant it when I said...

609
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,840
I wanted you to paint my portrait.

610
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,000
♫Amidst the stars so bright,♫

611
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,600
Sit here. Let me sketch you.

612
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,000
♫It's you and I,♫

613
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:36,800
♫Our hearts no longer
drift alone tonight♫

614
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,740
How about this?
♫Seeing you're here,♫

615
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,520
♫Hearing your heartbeat near,♫

616
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,560
♫That's what I want to hold so dear♫

617
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,920
♫Forever, year after year♫

618
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:10,200
♫From now on, I'll let my heart decide♫

619
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,640
♫If the world won't take our side,♫

620
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,960
♫I'll leave their voices far behind♫

621
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:31,240
♫From now on, it's you and I♫

622
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,040
What kind of expression should I go for?

623
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,640
The expression...

624
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,080
of someone gazing at their beloved.

625
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,360
Ran...

626
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,120
Do you like me?

627
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,480
Do you like me as much as I like you?

628
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,680
You haven't painted it yet.

629
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,080
How about doing it on me?

630
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,160
Right here.

631
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,720
And here, too.

632
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:37,960
Nin...

633
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,880
Are you nervous?

634
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,320
Good boy.

635
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,720
Finally, it's time for the first round
of the Royal Competition.

636
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,360
I have faith that
once the Royal Competition concludes,

637
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,880
Khanin will bring the throne to Tharin.

638
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,440
Don't get too worked up.

639
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,080
Just stick to what you've learned.

640
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:17,240
You must do whatever it takes
to win this Competition.

641
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,550
It could be quite risky,
Your Royal Highness.

642
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:19,830
I don't care, okay?

643
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:23,760
I hereby declare
the Royal Competition of Emmaly

644
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:24,880
officially open.

645
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,560
The competitor with the most votes is...

646
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,840
♫The only love I've longed for,♫

647
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,440
♫Just the word "love" from you,
and that's all♫

648
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,920
♫Let me hear it, I won't ask for more♫

649
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,240
♫I need your love♫

650
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,320
♫The only one I adore,♫

651
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:03,220
♫My heart's been loving
only you, my all♫

652
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:13,800
♫Oh, I need your love♫
