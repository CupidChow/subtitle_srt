1
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,440
The winning heir

2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,960
will secure their father's position
as the next King.

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,080
If you wish to change Emmaly,

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,760
one way to do it

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,600
is to win the Competition.

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,360
I'm glad

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,200
Ramil is putting more effort
into practicing than he used to.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,920
Let Mira be my coach.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,920
Or I'll withdraw
from the Competition entirely.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,360
I would like you
to paint a portrait of me.

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,280
Do you like me?

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,480
Do you like me as much as I like you?

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
Ran,

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,320
do you think it's even possible

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,920
for a royal to renounce their title?

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Of course,

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,600
but only if they've come of age

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,039
and are capable
of making their own judgments.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,440
I don't want
the theoretical kind of answer.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,280
Just say it like how you would
as an ordinary art teacher.

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,759
In that case,

22
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,400
maybe it would've been better
not to be royal at all.

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,060
No royal rules,

24
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,460
obligations,

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,400
or heavy responsibilities.

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
That's true.

27
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,600
When you're not royal,

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,320
you'll be just an ordinary person

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,240
living peacefully.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,640
Then power won't matter.

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
But if you must have it,

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,600
you should use it with justice

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,120
for the benefit of everyone.

34
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,700
You're right.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,760
If I ever have more power than I do now,

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,760
I'd want to use it as fairly as I can
for everyone as well.

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,880
Whatever you choose to do

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,640
and whoever you become,

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,280
I'll be by your side.

40
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,240
The Royal Competition
is less than a week away.

41
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
The first round is a test of wit.

42
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,000
There's a good chance
the questions will ask for opinions

43
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,640
rather than factual knowledge.

44
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
So I've prepared some questions for you.

45
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,960
[The Royal Competition: Test of Wit]

46
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,840
The breeze today
stirs more than the leaves.

47
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,280
It brings with it
wishes of good fortune to this land.

48
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,600
Seeing Your Majesty so joyful,

49
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,440
I believe your health
is improving day by day.

50
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,360
I have faith that
once the Royal Competition concludes,

51
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,880
Khanin will bring the throne to Tharin.

52
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,580
It's been a long time.

53
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,340
I've been waiting all this time
for this day to come.

54
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,940
You have borne much hardship
for your own clan, Your Majesty.

55
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,120
I humbly offer
my heartfelt congratulations beforehand.

56
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,000
Great.

57
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,159
That's great.

58
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,600
That's the best wish.

59
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,000
I shall accept your congratulations
ahead of time.

60
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,240
The first round,
which allows public voting,

61
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,280
should not pose any difficulty
for Prince Khanin.

62
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,320
His Royal Highness has been cherished
by the people.

63
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,760
He is sure to win.

64
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Indeed.

65
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Introducing this additional round

66
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,560
is meant to benefit him.

67
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,680
But as for the archery round ahead,

68
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,730
why would you consent
to Prince Chana's demands, Your Majesty?

69
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,040
What do you think?

70
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Well...

71
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,720
From my humble consideration,

72
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,240
might this be...

73
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,360
to prevent favoritism
toward the Assavadevathins?

74
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,120
At times, power is needed
to subdue people,

75
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,600
yet kindness toward them

76
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,160
also helps keep their hearts at peace.

77
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,200
By letting Ava, a woman, participate

78
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,480
and adding a competition
that suits her strengths,

79
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,800
it shall keep Ramil in check.

80
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,880
However,

81
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,240
wouldn't this put Prince Khanin
at a disadvantage, Your Majesty?

82
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Wirun,

83
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,600
you are intelligent.

84
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,710
Still,

85
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,200
you've never held power before.

86
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,200
Giving hope to people

87
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,760
is such an irresistible temptation.

88
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,520
Ava's talent lies in archery,

89
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,320
but she'll never beat
the male heirs in fencing.

90
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,280
So that's how it is.

91
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,760
I am merely of lowly status

92
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,490
and could never hope
to have such wisdom, Your Majesty.

93
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,480
What a truly wonderful day this is.

94
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,440
Let's head to the hall, shall we?

95
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

96
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Your Royal Highness,

97
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,480
are you feeling stressed?

98
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,630
I gave you a complete makeover!

99
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,950
That hair is so cute, neat, and elegant.

100
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,520
Let's have some tea.

101
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560

102

Tea...

103
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,080
Don't get too worked up.

104
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,920
Just stick to what you've learned.

105
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,040
I've checked around.

106
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
Everything's alright.

107
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
It's really happening now.

108
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,920
I'm afraid...

109
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,400
that I might mess up.

110
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
You've got this, Nin.

111
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,880
We've prepared so much together.

112
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,280
Don't worry, okay?

113
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,560
What if...

114
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,800
Whatever the result may be,

115
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,710
I'll always be right here.

116

117
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,720
try not to worry too much.

118
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Have some tea to help calm your mind.

119
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Seems like
you're more worked up than me.

120
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,120
Oh...

121
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,080
Gosh...

122
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
There's no tea left.

123
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,960
Oh, well...

124
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,040
I'll get you another cup.

125
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,800
Gosh,

126
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,520
this isn't better.

Don't worry, my dear.

128
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
Just do your best.

though our time together has been short,

131

please never doubt my love for you.

132
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,080
I have loved you since 22 years ago,
and I still do.

Before,

134
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,920
I kept it quiet,

135
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,840
not wanting to make you feel uneasy.

136
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,320
But now,

137
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,700
you're very strong and dignified.

that you understand mine, too.

I mean the rules this time
differ from previous Competitions.

155

answer questions,

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,840
Jay...

186
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,880
Jay!

187
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,440
So you took a prince to the protest?

188
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,120
That's freaking dope.

189
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Whoa.

190
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,090
I think...

191
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,200
Jay probably just found out
about it, too.

192
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,160
[Arm: That Calvin who joined the protest
is a prince?]

193
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,160
As His Majesty
values the voice of the people,

194
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,200
he's decreed that this round
be decided by the Emmalians

195
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,920
through public voting.

196
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,740
Voting?

197
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,220
That's never been part of it.

198
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,880
It's just voting.

199
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,640
Who knows what goes on
behind the scenes?

200
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,030
The time is now upon us.

201
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,060
I hereby declare
the Royal Competition of Emmaly

202
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,320
officially open.

203
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,100
And the first to answer the question is

204
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,840
Prince Ramil Bhuchongpisut.

205
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,920
Please stand on the designated podium,
Your Royal Highness.

206
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,720
The question for Prince Ramil
is as follows:

207
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,140
Could you identify
some long-standing issues in our nation

208
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,170
that have been overlooked

209
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,200
and failed to address?

210
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,120
Please share your answer
with the people, Your Royal Highness.

211
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
That's not the question
from the committee, is it?

212
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
It is not, Your Majesty.

213
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,200
I shall look into it immediately.

214
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
It is too late now.

215
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,990
From here on,

216
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,030
just make sure nothing else goes wrong.

217
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

218
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,750
In my view,

219
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,080
every issue in Emmaly matters

220
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,240
and deserves to be addressed.

221
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,120
But if I were to choose one
that remains in the shadows,

222
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,680
it would be...

223
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,720
a family-related issue.

224
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,200
The numbers from last year
may seem small,

225
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,040
only four to five thousand
reported cases,

226
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,800
but this is not about statistics.

227
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,600
It's about people.

228
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,480
Domestic violence,

229
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,680
often aimed at women and children,

230
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,840
leaves lasting wounds
on both body and mind.

231
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,800
That was a stupid thing to do.

232
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,760
But it's a misguided notion,

233
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,720
ingrained over time

234
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,040
and passed down through generations.

235
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,840
They were taught

236
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
it encourages discipline...

237
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,880
You'll remain silent?

238
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,480
And obedience.

239
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,040
In truth, it has caused
generations of pain.

240
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,440
It damages confidence,

241
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
creates all kinds of trauma,

242
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,440
and isolates them from society.

243
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,630
When a person is denied the chance
to grow into their best self,

244
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,480
the nation loses a part of its future.

245
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,400
I truly believe

246
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,800
children are the future of our nation

247
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,440
and of this world.

248
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,520
And that is why...

249
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,880
this issue must be addressed.

250
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,400
Thank you for your answer,
Your Royal Highness.

251
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,180
Next,

252
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,220
Princess Ava Davichmetha,
please stand on the podium.

253
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,400
If you could change one law in Emmaly,

254
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,640
which law would you choose to amend,
Your Royal Highness?

255
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,360
For generations, the laws of our nation
have been written by men,

256
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,860
which led to some being unjust
toward women

257
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
and gender-diverse people.

258
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,720
While we have achieved
marriage equality,

259
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,560
deeper understanding
is still lacking in other areas.

260
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,920
Stop asking so many questions.

261
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,360
A woman is training you.

262
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
Don't you think
those two clans will laugh at us?

263
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,680
I would propose laws
to ensure equal pay,

264
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,540
increase political representation
for women...

265
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,180
We have adhered to this tradition
for generations.

266
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,720
You must understand that women
do not have the same rights as men.

267
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,340
And promote
greater participation of women

268
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,400
in government
and international organizations.

269
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,880
Our education policies
should also be reformed

270
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,080
to eliminate gender bias.

271
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,840
Why are there only male vendors?

272
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,160
None of them are female.

273
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,620
In Meenanagarin,

274
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,800
it's believed that the husband
should provide for the family

275
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,400
while the wife is responsible
for the housework.

276
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,180
With these reforms,

277
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,960
Emmaly will move
toward a fairer legal system,

278
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,400
one that protects women's rights
in the long term.

279
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,960
Thank you for your answer, Princess Ava.

280
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,040
Next,

281
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,280
it will be the question
for Prince Khanin Assavadevathin.

282
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Please come to the podium.

283
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,150
If given the opportunity,

284
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,030
what strategies would you recommend

285
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,560
to stimulate the economy of Emmaly?

286
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,530
Our nation, Emmaly, has so much to offer

287
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,930
from its fascinating culture

288
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,490
to its exquisite cuisine.

289
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,250
Personally,

290
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,090
I've always had a fondness
for Davin spaghetti sauce.

291
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,640
With its food, culture, and traditions,
Emmaly has great potential

292
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,040
to grow its soft power
on the global stage.

293
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,720
Nin...

294
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,720
You've raised him well.

295
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
Thanks.

296
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
I think...

297
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,800
he surely misses you a lot.

298
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,920
Emmaly is also home to four regions,

299
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,240
each with its own unique charm.

300
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,800
I personally love Bhuchongpisut,
an ancient city,

301
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,800
for its deep historical roots.

302
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,120
I also love the nightlife
in Davichmetha,

303
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,760
when joy fills the city.

304
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,880
I love how welcoming our nation is.

305
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,480
The people are friendly

306
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,120
even to someone like me, a prince.

307
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,400
And the sea of Meenanagarin

308
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,640
is so breathtakingly beautiful.

309
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,040
Most of all,

310
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,680
what touches me the most is
the lantern procession in Assavadevathin,

311
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,880
a tradition that honors the beliefs
and the way of life of our miners,

312
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,000
the backbone of our economy.

313
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,880
By connecting with the people
throughout Emmaly,

314
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,160
I've learned that

315
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,240
our nation's greatest treasure

316
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,200
is its kind,

317
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
welcoming people,

318
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,240
who embrace visitors
from around the world.

319
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,960
If we promote local culture
through thoughtful campaigns

320
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,700
and ensure the revenue goes back
to local communities,

321
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,880
empowering them to support themselves,

322
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,800
we can truly strengthen
our tourism economy.

323
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,760
But before implementing
any economic strategies,

324
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,760
we must first
address a pressing concern.

325
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,040
The dust pollution
caused by mining in Assavadevathin

326
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,880
has harmed Emmaly's air quality
for years.

327
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
By solving this issue immediately

328
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
in tandem with enhancing the economy,

329
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,720
we can enhance both economic growth

330
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,310
and the nation's quality of life.

331
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,920
Thank you.

332
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,400
Thank you for your answer,
Prince Khanin.

333
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,920
[First Round of Royal Competition:
Test of Wit]

334
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,200
And with that, all the competitors

335
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,800
have completed their answers
to the three questions.

336
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,640
We are now entering the voting.

337
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,560
All Emmalians,
you may now cast your votes

338
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,680
for the royal candidate of your choice.

339
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,360
Prince Khanin's answer

340
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
was lit.

341
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,040
Someone in power finally said
what needed to be said.

342
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
I'm glad.

343
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,520
Jay...

344
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,680
Jay!

345
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,440
Jay!

346
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,840
What's wrong?

347
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,180
Uh...

348
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
I'm glad, too.

349
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,280
The princess truly showed empathy
toward women.

350
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,680
I'm voting for her.

351
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,040
Yeah, she nailed it.

352
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,560
I liked the education policy reforms.

353
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,560
I prefer Prince Ramil, though.

354
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,400
He seemed to
really understand family issues.

355
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,260
Still, it looked like

356
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,480
Prince Khanin understood
Emmaly's problems on a bigger scale.

357
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,580
Exactly.

358
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,970
I think we should vote for him.

359
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,760
Right.

360
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,600
[Wow, Prince Khanin
even mentioned the pollution issue]

361
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,480
[He spoke about the dust problem
we've been calling out]

362
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,400
[I'm sure he's getting many votes;
that was a great answer]

363
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Three,

364
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,920
two,

365
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,840
one,

366
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,360
the voting has officially ended.

367
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,480
The votes from everyone
all across Emmaly

368
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,200
have been counted and recorded.

369
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,520
It's now time to announce

370
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,680
the competitor who has received
the highest number of votes.

371
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,040
The competitor with the most votes is...

372
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,600
Prince Ramil of Bhuchongpisut!

373
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,520
I offer my sincere congratulations
to His Royal Highness.

374
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,440
However, the Royal Competition
is not yet over.

375
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,960
Two more rounds still lie ahead.

376
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,090
The next round

377
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,560
will be an archery competition,
taking place in Meenanagarin

378
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,120
in just three days' time.

379
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,560
Seems like the people really adore him.

380
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,040
Congratulations, Rachata.

381
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,120
I humbly offer my congratulations,
Your Royal Highness.

382
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,920
No need to feel down, Brother.

383
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,120
I know you've always had
strong public support.

384
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,880
It's just that...

385
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,400
perhaps they connected more
with my answer.

386
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,960
Your words...

387
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,880
sound almost like you're insulting us.

388
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
Come on, Ava.

389
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,159
Don't be so harsh on me.

390
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,659
What's it called again?

391
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,239
Consolation!

392
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,360
I'm only consoling you.

393
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,880
The Competition is still ongoing.

394
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,400
I don't think
this is the right moment to do so.

395
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,440
In fact, if our answers

396
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,960
truly bring about solutions
to the nation's issues,

397
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,679
it serves the people's best interests.

398
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,880
There's nothing that needs consolation.

399
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,040
Khanin's right.

400
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,600
I agree with him.

401
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,040
Why am I getting ganged up on?

402
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,120
That couldn't be.

403
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,480
The three of us have been rivals
for a long while.

404
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,520
That's right.

405
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,510
I'll see you in the next round.

406
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,480
May I have a word with you?

407
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,280
I truly admire your courage

408
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,120
in answering the question
the way you did.

409
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,600
The way I did?

410
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,280
You spoke out
about the issues in Assavadevathin.

411
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,280
It had to be said by someone.

412
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,920
The more powerful our voice is,

413
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,240
the more we must use it.

414
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,320
You've also done a wonderful job
speaking up for equal rights.

415
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,920
It was my own experience
that gave me the courage to speak up.

416
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,560
And now that I have said it,
I feel like a weight has been lifted.

417
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,880
I may have lost this round,

418
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,560
but I may not the next time.

419
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,320
I'm not planning to lose, either.

420
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Did I handle Ramil's words well?

421
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Father,

422
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,120
I did it.

423
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,600
That's enough to make you happy?

424
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,620
I believe...

425
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
it feels like
a promising beginning for us.

426
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Obviously.

427
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,600
I did it with my own hands.

428
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,600
You?

429
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,120
Can't imagine you winning anything.

430
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,200
Who do you work for?

431
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,440
His Majesty the King!

432
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,800
He was sent by the King,
Your Royal Highness.

433
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,440
That old man

434
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,360
is always up to lowly deeds.

435
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,120
The only way for us to survive

436
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,920
is to win

437
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,640
and reclaim our glory.

438
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
It could be risky.

439
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,040
I don't care, okay?

440
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,140
Get the vote rigging done discreetly.

441
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,640
No matter what,

442
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Ramil's votes
have to secure first place.

443
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,880
I've set a ladder up for you.

444
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,570
Father, you mean...

445
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,120
All you have to do

446
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,920
is to get to the top.

447
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,040
No mistakes allowed.

448
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,560
Do you understand, Ramil?

449
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
Yes, Father.

450
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,080
I appreciate you walking with me.

451
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
I have to.

452
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,000
My friends were pretty loud, though.

453
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,360
They were annoying you, right?

454
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
I'm sorry.

455
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,240
I didn't say that.

456
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Being around people is actually fun,

457
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,840
and our home's usually pretty quiet.

458
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Come on, cut the drama.

459
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,840
I'm totally fine.

460
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,300
You're the one feeling down.

461
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,560
I brought you out for a walk

462
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,400
to get some fresh air

463
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,440
and hopefully feel better.

464
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,080
[Calvin: Can we talk?]

465
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,360
Was that from Calvin?

466
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,720
Wait, no.

467
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,280
It's Prince Calvin, right?

468
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,160
Yeah.

469
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,360
Why?

470
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,520
Now that he's a prince,

471
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,240
you don't want to talk to him anymore?

472
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
I don't know.

473
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,400
I don't even know
how I'm supposed to feel.

474
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,440
Just go clear things up with him.

475
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,080
It's just impossible, no matter what.

476
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,160
Jay,

477
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,420
if you guys don't talk,

478
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,340
nothing's gonna get better.

479
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,240
If you don't want to talk to him,

480
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,480
just tell him straight up.

481
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,000
It's that simple.

482
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,200
Seriously?

483
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,360
Someone like me,

484
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,040
telling him to leave me alone?

485
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Jay,

486
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,400
life is unpredictable.

487
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,800
We never know when we'll meet again,

488
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
or if it will be the last time.

489
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,100
Either way, go sort things out with him.

490
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,520
Let's take a look at this news.

491
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,040
It began with a video

492
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
that recently surfaced online.

493
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,800
The video shows
a pollution protest taking place.

494
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,320
What stands out is
the presence of Prince Calvin of Bhujar

495
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,160
walking among the protesters.

496
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Jay!

497
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Jay!

498
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,360
Can I come in?

499
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Is June not home?

500
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,880
She's in her room.

501
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,280
Can I sit with you?

502
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,560
There's something I need to explain.

503
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,640
What's there to explain?

504
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,280
It's just that...

505
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,720
you...

506
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
Actually, no.

507
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,560
I can't even talk to you
like this anymore.

508
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,920
Can we just talk like before?

509
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,680
I'm afraid I cannot,
Your Royal Highness.

510
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,880
That would be improper.

511
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,240
Are you saying...

512
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,160
you're just gonna walk away from me?

513
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,640
We were never meant to meet this way...

514
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,680
Your Royal Highness.

515
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,320
Don't do that, Jay.

516
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,640
I didn't even deserve...

517
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,000
to hear the truth from you,
Your Royal Highness.

518
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,680
Honestly,

519
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,160
I really meant to tell you.

520
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,600
After the protest,

521
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,680
I'd like to talk to you.

522
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,640
At the protest?

523
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,920
Yes.

524
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,360
But with everything coming up...

525
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,320
I'm here today to apologize.

526
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,440
And to bid farewell.

527
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,400
I've been commanded to return to Bhujar.

528
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,160
I'm sorry.

529
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,160
I'm truly sorry.

530
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,800
It is beyond my place to accept
your apology, Your Royal Highness.

531
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,760
We should not meet ever again.

532
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,560
Please take your leave.

533
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,670
I said,

534
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,560
Please take your leave.

535
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,280

[A day before the archery competition]

537
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,680
I am certain now,

538
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,480
so I rushed here to tell you.

539
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,840
What is it about, Father?

540
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,120
According to my sources,

541
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,920
Rachata rigged the voting last time,

542
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,280
so Ramil won that round.

Welcome to the second round
of the Royal Competition.

00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,040
is to get to the top.

550
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:38,430
It is not fair anymore, Ava.

551
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,400
You must do whatever it takes
to win this Competition.

552
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,000
If you wish to change Emmaly,

553
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,840
one way to do it

554
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,080
is to win the Competition.

555
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,600
If all competitors are ready,

556
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,320
I shall now declare
the archery competition

557
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,160
officially underway.

558
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,040
Three,

559
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
two,

560
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,480
one,

561
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,560
begin.

562
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,600
Do you not trust

563
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,280
His Majesty, Your Royal Highness?
[Meet me in Assavadevathin]

564
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,680
Join me in this.

565
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,040
Do it for Khanin.

566
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,720
I lost him once,

567
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,400
and I cannot bear to lose him again.

568
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,960
Please send me Coach Joe's profile.

569
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,320
The GPS...

570
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,880
In this freaking country,

571
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,360
everyone's just hungry for power.

572
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,160
[Prince Khanin is in danger]
