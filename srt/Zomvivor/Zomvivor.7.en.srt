1
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,760
The weather is hot.

2
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,280
Hello, Aunty.

3
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,400
Hi.

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,360
Hi.

5
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,000
Hey! Toom, what's wrong? Are you okay?

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,720
Hey!

7
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,720
- Hey, give me a second.
- Wait.

8
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,720
Sir? Sir.

9
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,480
Professor?
There's something wrong with Tisha.

10
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,840
Tisha!

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,760
Tisha, are you okay?

12
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,480
Tisha!

13
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,640
Mom!

14
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,400
Mom. Oh!

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,160
Aunty Jit?

16
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,480
Aunty Jit?
I brought you some snacks.

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,199
Aunty Jit?

18
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,639
Tisha!

19
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,840
Tisha!

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,800
Tisha! Why is there blood on you?

21
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,800
Toom!

22
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,000
Wake up!

23
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,920
What now?

24
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,360
Help me!

25
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,160
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, this is so scary</i>

26
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,399
<i>Do I need to be scared?</i>

27
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,840
<i>That you're thinking of leaving me</i>
<i>and about to go</i>

28
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,480
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, this is real scary</i>

29
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,080
You asshole.

30
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,560
You remember? You once asked me
to scratch your ex's car with you,

31
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
but he was in the car.

32
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,520
By the time I realized,
you'd already run away.

33
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,720
I was like, "What do I do?"

34
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,160
I was so damn confused.

35
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,520
Was that when we were freshmen?

36
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,560
That time Lily was so into Prao.

37
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,280
You told me that you want to be
as strong as Prao.

38
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
You were so stupid.

39
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,600
One slap from her,
and you were done with her.

40
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,160
That day I was so drunk

41
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,440
and lashed out at Prao,

42
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,720
so she splashed her drink on me.

43
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,200
But you came out of nowhere
and slapped her in the face.

44
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,400
Why did you do that?

45
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,480
That's how you always are.

46
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,880
You help everyone.

47
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,000
You never leave anyone behind.

48
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,800
Tell me.

49
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
If you say that you want to leave…

50
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,520
I'll be the one to take you.

51
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Shit!

52
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,000
Kawin!

53
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,560
Someone is coming.

54
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,920
- Did you lock the door?
- I locked it!

55
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,240
Come here!

56
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,840
PLEASE OPEN AND CLOSE
THE DOORS GENTLY. ONE AT A TIME.

57
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,520
Lily…

58
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,040
Why did she…

59
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,040
She helped us.

60
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,920
We can't stay here anymore. Let's go.

61
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,960
Damn! Sun.

62
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
Phu will come this way.

63
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,960
- Hey.
- Damn.

64
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,320
Hurry! Just leave it!

65
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,920
We can go now.

66
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Hey!

67
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,560
Faster!

68
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,120
- Hey.
- Go quickly.

69
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,240
There's more of them coming.
We don't have much time.

70
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,360
Once we catch it,
we need to take it to the tenth-floor lab.

71
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,880
They're coming. Get ready.

72
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,040
Aunty Jit.

73
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,560
Aunty!

74
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,920
Why is your face so pale?

75
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,480
- Mook, why aren't they here yet?
- Wait.

76
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Be quiet.

77
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,200
Aunty Jit.

78
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,880
Can you remember me?

79
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,720
Is that Ning?

80
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,520
Can you remember me?

81
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,920
When you graduate, don't forget me.

82
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,839
Don't worry about it. I still owe
most of the Patron's scholarship.

83
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,400
It's me, Ning.

84
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,280
Hey. What happened?

85
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,520
Are you okay?

86
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,440
What should we do, Phu?

87
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,720
Call it off. We need to help her.

88
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,080
How? We have no way to escape.

89
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,480
If the other zombies hear their mother,
they will definitely come for us.

90
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,800
No.

91
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,720
We'll keep doing this.

92
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,800
Aunty!

93
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Hey!

94
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,440
That's Nonn.

95
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Come here!

96
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,480
Damn it. Aunty!

97
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,280
Hey!

98
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Aunty!

99
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,800
- Ning!
- Ning!

100
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,280
Get out! Ning! Get out!

101
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,160
Ning!

102
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,400
Y'all, be prepared!

103
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,920
Ning!

104
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,600
- Ning!
- No!

105
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,920
- Stop!
- Ning!

106
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,680
Hurry!

107
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,240
What are you guys doing?

108
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,880
Take it inside!

109
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,640
Go! Get inside!

110
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,560
- Lock it.
- Nonn, careful.

111
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,720
- Hurry!
- Hey! Fuck!

112
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,200
Damn.

113
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,280
Damn.

114
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,560
Damn.

115
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,840
- Fuck you!
- San.

116
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,160
- Hey! San!
- Stop it!

117
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,480
Hey! Why are you hitting him?

118
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,680
We're too late.

119
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,000
PLEASE EXCHANGE YOUR CARD

120
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,040
We're all going to die.

121
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,040
Where are we going now?

122
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,720
Pao must be feeling sad too, Mook.

123
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,880
Why? Why did he kill Pao?

124
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Why did he have to kill Pao?

125
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,800
Hurry.

126
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,400
Why did he have to kill Pao?

127
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,880
I'm done watching.

128
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,600
You saw it, right?

129
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,440
What were you thinking?

130
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,520
Take Aunty Jit and then what?

131
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,960
What will you do
after taking her to the lab?

132
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,920
Ning, listen.

133
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,680
Aunty Jit is definitely important
to all of them.

134
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,000
They won't come after us for sure
as long as we've got the mother.

135
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,120
The mother?

136
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
You guys are fucking crazy!

137
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,280
What makes you're so sure, Phu?

138
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,760
What's wrong with you?

139
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,920
My little brother is with you, Phu.

140
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,600
Son of a bitch!
Putting my little brother at risk.

141
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,040
Are you crazy?

142
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,240
Are we supposed to do nothing?

143
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,720
Do we just stay put?

144
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,240
Wait for your orders, do this, do that.
Like that?

145
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,280
Now's not the time to argue!

146
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,880
We need to figure out
how we're getting out of this room.

147
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,160
Ning.

148
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,160
What's that?

149
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,680
- I'll tell you later.
- Say it now.

150
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,280
What's in there?

151
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,120
What is it?

152
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,280
- Give it to me.
- No.

153
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,960
Give it to me!

154
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,880
It's evidence.

155
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,720
What evidence?

156
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,640
It's a serum.

157
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,400
What serum?

158
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,920
Chaiwut Kiatpipat.

159
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,560
Joe's serum.

160
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,280
Hmm?

161
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,640
That means the Patron asked you
and Wiroj to make the serum for his son?

162
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,440
You already know
about the Anisong project, right?

163
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,000
How did you find out, San?

164
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,440
<i>And then what?</i>

165
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,080
That's it.

166
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,320
My dad doesn't trust me.

167
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,000
So he came up with this damn serum.

168
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,320
San, bring me more.

169
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,520
Is it really possible?

170
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,720
Right?

171
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,560
Dead but not a trace of decay.
How's that possible?

172
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,800
Ever seen my dad fail at something?

173
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,680
Well, isn't telling us
gonna get you in trouble?

174
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,440
Yeah.

175
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,640
Of course.

176
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,720
Here you go.

177
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,520
All of my life…

178
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
Since I was born until now…

179
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,760
I've only been forced to be friends
with you guys.

180
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,000
Soon, my kids and grandkids
will only be with yours.

181
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,240
Is that fair?

182
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,120
The Anisong project,
it's the biggest secret of my family.

183
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,560
If it leaks, everything will be ruined.

184
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,760
What if I told my dad
that you guys knew about this?

185
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,880
What he's going to do?

186
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,480
We not going to say anything. Don't worry.

187
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,000
- Swear to God.
- Hey. No, no.

188
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,680
Look, I know that none of you
will bring this up.

189
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,520
If my family is ruined,
yours will be, too.

190
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,960
I'm just curious.

191
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,120
What if I tell my dad,
what do you think he will do?

192
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,120
Let's say I find out

193
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,320
that some of you here
haven't been loyal to me…

194
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,520
even after I trusted you.

195
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,400
Hey! No need to be serious.

196
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,400
It's just hypothetical, you fool!

197
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,000
See? San doesn't look stressed.
Let me see your smile.

198
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,440
I said smile!

199
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,960
Yeah.

200
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,080
See?

201
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,400
What I ask of you is simple.

202
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,880
If I call any of you…

203
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,400
you need to be available.

204
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,560
If I tell you to be somewhere,
you need to be there.

205
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,200
You can't say no.

206
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,280
For anything.

207
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,600
Got it?

208
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,920
Do you understand?

209
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,400
- Yeah.
- Got it.

210
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,320
Fuck yeah! That's it.

211
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,680
Right? Okay?

212
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,280
- Joe told us his dad's plan.
- Us? Us who?

213
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,560
You were in the lab that night,
weren't you?

214
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,960
Am I right?

215
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,840
You were there with Joe.

216
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,040
Wait. What are you talking about?

217
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
Answer me!

218
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,200
So you really knew about this all along.

219
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,400
How the hell could you do this?
How could you do something like that?

220
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,760
Ning, don't speak loudly.

221
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,360
You're the reason Mom ended up like this.

222
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,560
Like what?

223
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,760
Say it! Say it so your brother
can hear you.

224
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,280
Go on, tell him about your mother.

225
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,040
Your mother is not just
a helpless messenger.

226
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,600
She is a slave who works underground
for the Patron.

227
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,960
Say it out loud!

228
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,040
Ning.

229
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,360
What is San talking about?

230
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,560
Mom and Joe have the same disease.

231
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,360
The Patron ordered Wiroj and me
to develop the cure.

232
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,320
But everything went wrong.

233
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,760
All the chaos that's happened,
it's all because of me.

234
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,680
- No! Ning, it has nothing to do with you.
- You, shut up!

235
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,600
Wait.

236
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,720
Does the stuff in this test tube
actually infect people?

237
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,640
This version is fully developed.

238
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,000
But there was a previous version…

239
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,200
that had already been given to volunteers.

240
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,160
Volunteers?

241
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,080
Who are they?

242
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,280
You knew everything from the beginning.

243
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,960
- You wouldn't let us do anything.
- It's not like that.

244
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,920
- Then what is it?
- She just found out, too!

245
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,320
Can't you just stop defending her?
We've never mattered to her at all!

246
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't understand. Why does everything
have to depend on you?

247
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,120
Why do you have to be
the center of everything?

248
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,920
I was wondering,
is it because you have a tough life

249
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,480
or is it because
you people are fucking liars?

250
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,040
- Mook!
- What? Are you going to kill me?

251
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,080
Fight back like you did for him.

252
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,880
But how can you people even live
with yourselves? I'm so curious.

253
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,960
Your mom's a liar. You're a liar!

254
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,200
And so is your brother.

255
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,280
I'm serious, you really didn't know?

256
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,520
That they're having an affair
behind your back?

257
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,920
You really believe that?

258
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,480
Are you serious right now?
Like, right now?

259
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,800
Let them talk right now.
There's no need to wait any longer.

260
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,440
I let someone die.

261
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,720
She's a scientist
in the Patron's laboratory.

262
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,440
Joe was ordered to keep quiet,
and so were we.

263
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,640
I can't tell anyone.

264
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,120
Can't say to anyone that…

265
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,040
That…

266
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,880
I need help.

267
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,200
Please help me.

268
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,760
I have something to show you guys.

269
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,880
Here.

270
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,159
I hacked the cameras in my dad's lab.

271
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,080
Damn! Who's that? She looks good.

272
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,440
Serum maker.

273
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,320
- Do you want to know her?
- Hell, yeah.

274
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,760
Hey, everyone.
I booked a table at the club.

275
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,080
- They confirmed it.
- We'll go somewhere else.

276
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,199
- But, Joe--
- We'll go somewhere else.

277
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,719
San.

278
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,199
What you need to say is "yes".

279
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,239
Let's go. Right now.

280
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,080
Yeah! Let's go!

281
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,360
San, you're the driver.

282
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,400
- Go.
- Let's go!

283
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,280
It's like…

284
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,280
<i>Like a woman's corpse is inside me.</i>

285
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,040
I can't get her out of my head.

286
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
San!

287
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,360
<i>I can't do anything.</i>

288
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,320
Only Nonn…

289
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,120
could smell the corpse.

290
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,000
He actually didn't know what it was.

291
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,240
<i>But he knew something rotten</i>
<i>was inside me.</i>

292
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,960
But he's still there.

293
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,040
Nothing happened between Nonn and me.

294
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,320
He was the one who noticed
something was wrong with me.

295
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,040
I would never do something like that.

296
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The way you and your mom did.

297
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,720
Tell us everything.
What the hell have you done?

298
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Gus…

299
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,440
Could you please forgive me?

300
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,840
Let go of me!

301
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,080
I'm so sorry!

302
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,960
Earth!

303
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,360
I'm sorry!

304
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,960
I said I'm sorry!

305
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,960
- Gus! Gus!
- What are you going to do, Game?

306
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,640
- No, Patra!
- No!

307
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,080
- No, Patra!
- Back off!

308
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,600
Let go of me! That's my brother!

309
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,000
Enough, Game.
That's not your brother anymore.

310
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,840
Gus…

311
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,600
Who did this to my brother?

312
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,840
Earth…

313
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,680
Did you meet any science kids?

314
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,640
You met them, right?

315
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,960
Was it Ning, Jean and Pao?

316
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,520
Myxozoa.

317
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,200
Yeah.

318
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,520
It mutated from nuclear waste,
attached to jellyfish,

319
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,040
and is causing this behavior.

320
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,200
They form groups to hunt
and even eat their own kind.

321
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,720
They're like those zombies.

322
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,400
But there's more than that.

323
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,600
Last night, Aek and I saw them fight.

324
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,280
Huh? Why did they fight?

325
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,480
I have no idea.

326
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,440
<i>But at that time,</i>
<i>I was surrounded by a group of zombies.</i>

327
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,920
<i>Then another group</i>
<i>came rushing from behind.</i>

328
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,040
<i>If I had to guess,</i>

329
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,640
they're fighting over food or territory.

330
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,120
You are right.

331
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,080
What is it, Mook?

332
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,400
Aunty Jit received the serum first.

333
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,360
And so?

334
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,840
So we were right.

335
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,400
Aunty Jit is their pack leader.

336
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,040
She was the first
to spread the infection to others.

337
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:40,240
Every single zombie obeys Aunty Jit
because they see her as their mother.

338
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,960
Did you all see?

339
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,440
Aunty Jit is no different from the others.

340
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,280
She doesn't have the strength to fight us.

341
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,600
So the reason she became a pack leader
is because she is the oldest?

342
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,280
Damn it. Isn't that sort of funny?

343
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,600
It's not funny. This is the realest thing.

344
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,200
Dr. Kanchana's condition
is still stable, sir.

345
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,560
And as for the metabolic rate
of her cells,

346
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,840
it's starting to go up, almost matching
the experimental group now.

347
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,120
What about the cellular respiration rate
and the CPC?

348
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,000
Everything's normal now.

349
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,040
Great job, Professor.

350
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,760
This is not it.

351
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,520
What's wrong?

352
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,080
What happened at the university
was caused by that serum.

353
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,360
<i>Wait, what?</i>

354
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,920
There must be something else.

355
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,120
So, basically,
everything you've been saying

356
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,360
means that what's infecting people
is the parasite that live in jellyfish,

357
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,920
and not the jellyfish?

358
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,960
Yeah.

359
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,640
But Wiroj went ahead and used
the parasite-infected jellyfish

360
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,800
to make the serum.

361
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,000
I tested it on people.
I injected it into Dr. Kanchana.

362
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,880
I've already injected this serum
into Dr. Kanchana, sir.

363
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,320
Calm down.

364
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,760
Take it easy.

365
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,080
Does anyone know about this?

366
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,000
No.

367
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,840
That's it.

368
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,640
Then you're safe now.

369
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,680
Get some rest.

370
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,840
Can you start making the serum for Joe?

371
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,040
Ning and Nonn are trapped in there.

372
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,480
Wiroj.

373
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,600
- No one is going to make it.
- No! Send them in now.

374
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,200
- You have to accept it.
- Send them in now!

375
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,000
What do you hope to gain by doing that?

376
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,960
Joe's serum is this in the lab.

377
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,960
If you want it, then go get it.

378
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,160
I'm done working for you!
If you're going to kill me, then do it!

379
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,840
These documents are the information.

380
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,720
If it reaches someone trying to fix this,

381
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,680
it might help clean up this whole mess.

382
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,960
If I'm gonna be honest,

383
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,520
that thing could be worth
more than all our lives.

384
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,280
Wiroj.

385
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,400
Only the two of them.

386
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,480
No one else.

387
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,240
- Hey!
- Stay silent. Quiet.

388
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,160
Quiet.

389
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,720
The janitor, she is about
to get in this room.

390
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,080
She shouldn't know that we're in here.

391
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,840
What if it keeps pushing?
The door can't hold for long.

392
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,280
Should we just let her in?

393
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,520
- Stick to the original plan?
- No, Thorn.

394
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,320
- There are other zombies. Forget it.
- What should we do?

395
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,720
What do we do?

396
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,160
Think! You have to figure it out.
We chose you as a leader.

397
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,480
I'm thinking.

398
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,400
What if it comes across
its mother's corpse?

399
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,680
<i>Myxozoa.</i>

400
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,080
<i>It's a parasite that live in jellyfish.</i>

401
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,400
<i>Temperature matters.</i>

402
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,920
<i>Why are they staying</i>
<i>at the spot that's lit?</i>

403
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,800
<i>- Aunty Jit is the pack leader.</i>
<i>- They also have feelings.</i>

404
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,480
<i>Is it because she's the oldest?</i>

405
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,120
<i>They were the first</i>
<i>to spread the infection.</i>

406
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,720
No. No. No.

407
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,440
- What is it? Say it.
- No way.

408
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,360
- Say it
- We can't do that.

409
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,960
- No way.
- What is it? Say!

410
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,000
Tell me!

411
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,560
We don't have their leader as a hostage.

412
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,200
But if we have a zombie
infected directly by the leader…

413
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,000
What?

414
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,920
We stuck in here.
How will we find that zombie?

415
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
That's why I said we can't do it!

416
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,200
No.

417
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,680
You know it's possible.

418
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,960
If anyone here gets infected
with her blood.

419
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,720
Damn.

420
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,200
Hey.

421
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,520
The temperature is higher.
They will go crazy soon.

422
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,480
I hope you're right, Mook.

423
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,920
Stop it!

424
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,200
What are you doing?

425
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,920
- Leave her.
- No.

426
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,200
Aren't these documents important?

427
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,400
Can't they help people?

428
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,440
If nobody agrees to do it,
we'll all fucking die.

429
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,720
How do you know it will work?
This is clearly a witch hunt.

430
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,080
Jean.

431
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,040
No one is forcing me.

432
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,320
This is my choice.

433
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,440
Ning, no.

434
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,080
Don't do this.

435
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,320
Nonn, no matter what happens, don't die.

436
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,360
You're doing this to me again.

437
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,560
You and Mom always shield me from trouble.

438
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,800
Am I stupid? Can I do nothing to help?

439
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,880
There are other ways to do this.

440
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,280
From now on, everything's on you.

441
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,800
Everything you need to know is in here.

442
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,800
Everything.

443
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,040
Ning!

444
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,640
Please tell Mom that everything she's done

445
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,480
hasn't made anyone's life better.

446
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,440
Ning!

447
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,480
Please take care of Nonn.

448
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,360
Jean.

449
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,560
Put the gun away from my brother.

450
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,800
If you decide to die…

451
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,560
then let's die together, all of us.

452
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,800
- Jean…
- You want to die.

453
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,840
You want to run away
from problems just like your mom.

454
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,920
You don't even care if it'll work.

455
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,520
What are you guys doing?

456
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,440
Are you guys aware?

457
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,920
We're just prey for that bastard.

458
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,800
We're just worthless beings,
trapped in the trash that they created!

459
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,480
And now…

460
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,600
we're sending our friend to die.

461
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,800
All just to clean up this mess.

462
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,560
Why?

463
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,200
Why do we have to fix the problems
that we didn't even create?

464
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,040
I won't let it end like this.

465
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,280
No.

466
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,760
I know you won't do it.

467
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,760
Ning!

468
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,480
Shit!

469
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,560
Run! Hurry!

470
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,200
- Hurry up!
- Damn it! This way!

471
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,880
Run!

472
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,960
- Thorn!
- Go!

473
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,920
Go, now!

474
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,640
Quick!

475
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,320
Shit!

476
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,440
Hey!

477
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,720
Get in! Go!

478
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,400
Faster! Faster!

479
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,120
We're almost there.

480
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,280
Copy that.

481
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,960
Push!

482
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,240
Shit! Helicopter!

483
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,920
<i>Enemy on the rooftop.</i>

484
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,040
<i>- Request to abort mission.</i>
<i>- Wait!</i>

485
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,840
No!

486
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,720
Push!

487
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,560
- Push it!
- Keep pushing!

488
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:08,080
Hey! We're here! Hey! We're here!

489
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,000
The serum is with her. Get closer to her.

490
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,520
- Help!
- Help!

491
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,520
Help!

492
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,360
- Help!
- Over here!

493
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,960
Guys, come on!

494
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,520
Hey! Bring all my friends!

495
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,200
- Ning, No!
- Why?

496
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,120
No, Ning!

497
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,560
Thorn!

498
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,560
Thorn!

499
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,880
Son of a bitch!

500
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,920
Thorn! Let me go!

501
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,240
Let go of me! Thorn!

502
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,440
Push their hands back!

503
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,240
Hurry!

504
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,200
Let me go!

505
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,960
Thi! Thi!

506
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,040
You bastard! Son of a bitch!
I wish all of you go to hell!

507
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,640
- I wish your helicopter crashes! Damn!
- Nonn!

508
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,040
Nonn! Get in the helicopter.

509
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,000
Go!

510
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,720
I'm not leaving!

511
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,040
I said go!

512
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,160
Go!

513
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,840
Go now!

514
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,000
What are you doing? Get in here now!

515
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,400
We can't wait any longer.

516
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,400
Nonn, come on!

517
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,440
- Come now!
- Nonn!

518
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,280
Go!

519
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,200
We can't hold on!

520
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,920
Nonn!

521
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,440
Nonn! Get in here!

522
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,560
Go!

523
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,440
Nonn! Hurry!

524
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,560
Nonn!

525
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,480
Nonn!

526
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,640
I love you.

527
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,680
I'm sorry for being a terrible sister.

528
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,320
The one who never believed in you.

529
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,160
No!

530
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,480
But I want you to believe
in yourself more.

531
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,760
Don't let anyone tell you
what you can't do.

532
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,720
Nonn!

533
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,800
Nonn!

534
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,720
Nonn!

535
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,240
Nonn! Nonn!

536
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,280
Nonn!

537
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,640
- Nonn!
- Go!

538
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,280
Nonn! Nonn!

539
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,240
Nonn! Nonn!

540
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,280
Nonn!

541
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,120
<i>Nonn!</i>

542
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,000
- Leave now!
- Copy that!

543
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,560
Fall back, fall back.

544
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,160
- Let's move.
- Nonn! Nonn! Nonn!

545
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,600
- Move! Move! Move!
- Nonn!

546
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,160
Nonn!

547
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,320
Nonn! Nonn!

548
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,880
Nonn! Nonn!

549
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,960
Nonn! Nonn!

550
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,760
Nonn!

551
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,880
Nonn!

552
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,480
Nonn!

553
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,560
Hey! Damn!

554
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,080
Damn it!

555
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,960
ONE MONTH LATER

556
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,400
Joe's body is getting better, sir.

557
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,520
No complications observed.
The blood test is normal.

558
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:48,240
I expect that his body
should return to normal within a week.

559
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,680
Good.

560
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,840
As for Dr. Kanchana,

561
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,920
her body's back to normal now.

562
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,680
All that's left is to wake her up.

563
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,840
Do you want us to wake her up now?

564
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,400
Not yet. Let her sleep.

565
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,920
Wait for the Venerable to arrive,
so they can stay together as family.

566
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,360
What happened?

567
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,240
Ning and Wiroj are gone.

568
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,920
Let's go!
