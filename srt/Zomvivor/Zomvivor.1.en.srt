Quickly! Quickly!

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,240
Hurry!

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,160
Hurry!

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,160
Everyone, move!

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,080
Go, go, go!

Jane.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,320
Please go.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,440
No. I'm not leaving, Jane.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,120
Get away. Hurry.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,280
No, I'm taking you to the hospital.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,600
Don't.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,960
Jane! Jane!

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
Stay with me, Jane.

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,000
Why? Don't make me say it.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,240
Stay with me.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,800
How?

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,120
Jane.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,120
It's okay, Jane.

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,040
Jane! Jane!

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,520
Easy, Jane.

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,960
You're going to make it.

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,960
<i>- Jane!</i>
<i>- Let's just break up then.</i>

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,720
Feeling better now, Jane?

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,920
Jane.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,840
Jane.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,760
Jane! Jane!

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,760

Quickly! Come on!

Go! Go!

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,600
Thorn!

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,600
Go. Quickly.

Go! Now!

San!

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,040
Stop!

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,400
Don't come any closer.

51
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,320
That's enough, Thorn.
We have to leave now!

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,960
San, come on.

53
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,000
San, go!

54
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,280
- San.
- Run, Thorn!

55
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,320
Come on. Move it.

56
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,720

- Come on!

Hurry!

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,520
Hey!

60
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,720
Get in this room!

61
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,320
Go, go!

62
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Get in!

63
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,920
- Move it!
- Lock the doors.

64
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,680
This way.

65
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,480
That doesn't look good.

66
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Are you all right?

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,640
<i>Hello, Ning. Where are you?</i>

70
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,360
Stuck in the faculty building.

71
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
<i>What about Non? Is he with you?</i>

72
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,520
I can't reach him.

73
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,200
Are you outside, Professor?

74
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,960
Please help my mom.

75
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,160
<i>Sure. I'll take care of her.</i>

76
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,000
<i>Find a place to hide and contact Non.</i>
<i>Understood?</i>

77
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
<i>Ning!</i>

78
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

79
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
<i>Ning?</i>

80
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,760
I'll call you back.

81
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,680
<i>Ning!</i>

82
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Ning.

83
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,400
<i>The Prime Minister is set to announce</i>
<i>a state of emergency in Bangkok,</i>

84
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,040
<i>following reports that the outbreak</i>

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,560
<i>may have originated</i>
<i>at Kiatpipat University.</i>

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,080
Kawin.

87
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,000
This isn't a safe place to hide.
They'll eventually find us.

88
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,200
To the balcony.

89
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,600
Guys, this way! Come on!

90
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,240
- Hurry.
- I can't.

91
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,760
No, I'm too scared!

92
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,040
Want to get eaten?

93
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,240
Get moving already!

94
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,480
Quickly.

95
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,000
Hey!

96
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Over there!

97
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Is that Ning?

98
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Non.

99
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,920
Where are you, Non?

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,320
<i>Right across from you.</i>
<i>Just look straight ahead.</i>

101
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,080
<i>This way!</i>

102
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,920
Hey! Non!

103
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Guys!

104
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,080
- Hey!
- Shit!

105
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,240
<i>In light of the current situation,</i>

106
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,840
<i>we urge everyone to remain calm</i>

107
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,120
<i>and continue monitoring</i>
<i>the situation closely.</i>

108
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,400
What's the plan?

109
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,480
<i>We can't stay here forever.</i>

110
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,559
Can I?

111
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,200
Ning.

112
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,320
<i>Are you okay?</i>

113
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,360
Just a second.

114
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,280
What, Phu?

115
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,160
Tell them to meet us at the library.
Let me talk to them.

116
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,840
Hello.

117
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,960
<i>Can you hear me? Listen closely.</i>

118
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,120
Find your way to the library.

119
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,160
<i>It's under maintenance,</i>
<i>so nobody should be there.</i>

120
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,920
<i>Let's meet there.</i>

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,320
Are you insane? How do we get there?

122
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,120
Shit. Shush. They're coming.

123
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,240
<i>I have no clue.</i>

124
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,680
Just don't die.

125
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
<i>Help me!</i>

126
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,680
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

127
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,560
We need to find a way to the library…

128
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,480
or else we will not make it.

129
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Cut!

130
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Are we good now?

131
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,400
That was fantastic.

132
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,600
SIX MONTHS EARLIER

133
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,080
Thi,

134
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,240
what do you think?

135
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,160
- Lily.
- Yes?

136
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,720
Would it look weird if tears
were rolling down in the final shot?

137
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,720
Yes, it would look very weird.

138
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,920
My character is a zombie.
She shouldn't cry.

139
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,240
Well…

140
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,640
It sounds interesting.

141
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,840
Stop.

142
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,640
Stop saying it's interesting.

143
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,960
What does it mean?

144
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,440
Aren't you the director?

145
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,240
Stop throwing out random ideas.

146
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,960
You need to know what you want.

147
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,360
I understand.

148
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,560
It's not that I can't deliver,

149
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,960
but I don't think
this character should cry.

150
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,800
It's not that. It's…

151
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Why do directors always want tears?

152
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,360
Well, it's…

153
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,720
Crying doesn't make
a scene better, does it?

154
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,760
No, I mean,
you're about to transform, right?

155
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,640
However, you're stuck
between being a human and a zombie.

156
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,920
I want the audience to question

157
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,480
whether the tears are coming
from Virginia as a human or as a zombie.

158
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Firstly, Thi,
you should rename my character.

159
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,960
Virginia?

160
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,400
- It sounds ridiculous.
- No, it doesn't.

161
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,160
That's the core of this film.

162
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,880
Patriarchy, is it?

163
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,800
It's too obvious, Thi.

164
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,600
Didn't Naruemon teach you,

165
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,640
"Show, don't tell"?

166
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Excuse me. We're running out of light.

167
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,720
Yeah, Thi. I think this works.

168
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,720
This short film is just an assignment.
Do it and submit it.

169
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,200
Fine. Okay.

170
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,480
Go stand behind the monitor.

171
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,120
Where?

172
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,280
Behind the monitor. Come here, Non.

173
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,760
Chop-chop. Hurry, we're losing light.

174
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Let's go.

175
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,800
Nice.

176
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,440
It really does look weird.

177
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,000
Right?

178
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,520
Told you.

179
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,960
Yeah.

180
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,880
Scratch that.

181
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,240
That's a wrap!

182
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,200
Yay!

183
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,120
Good job.

184
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,800
Let's have dinner.

185
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,000
What's up with him?

186
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,280
ZAN: PICKING UP NING TODAY.

187
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,560
<i>The heat wave expected</i>
<i>to encompass Southeast Asia</i>

188
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,560

189
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,280
<i>severely affecting</i>
<i>residents in the region.</i>

190
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,520
Shit. This is fucking scary.

191
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,760
What is it?

192
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,200
The heat wave. Haven't you seen the news?

193
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,080
So what?

194
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,880
What? This can be fatal!

195
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,040
People dropped like flies in Spain.

196
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,440
People die every day.
It's got nothing to do with that.

197
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,400
Should I fly to the U.S.
and stay there for a few months?

198
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,960
It's your call.

199
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,920
Join me, then.

200
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,640
I'd rather not.

201
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Hey, come with me.

202
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,800
You can take Ning, too. Stay at my place.

203
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,800
Motherfucker.

204
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,400
Her mom is bedridden, unresponsive.

205
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
You're right.

206
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,080
Have Non look after her.

207
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,520
Listen. Your brother should stop
acting like a bigshot director.

208
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,840
It's a film assignment.

209
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,600
But he's treating it
like it's an award-winning project.

210
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,520
Yeah, he's fucking insane.

211
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,480
If Thi stays this ambitious,

212
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,720
Non won't be able to take care of his mom.

213
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,320
I can't really reason with him either.

214
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,480
That's because you're dumber than he is.

215
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,040
Am I wrong?

216
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,040
If you think you're smarter…

217
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,520
why are you in a freshman class?

218
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
What the fuck?

219
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,680
Catch you later.

220
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,440
I'm driving Ning home.

221
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,400
Right. See you.

222
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,680
You don't know about the heat wave,
and you call me dumb.

223
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Dumbass.

224
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,040
You've only got a year left.
Are you really giving up the scholarship?

225
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,080
Yes.

226
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,120
I've thought this through.

227
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,480
With my mom in this condition,
I can't focus on anything.

228
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
I understand.

229
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,080
I'll withdraw after this semester.

230
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,880
Ning, wait. Hold that thought.

231
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,760
What's the matter?

232
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,200
I've sent your mother's
lab results to the higher-up.

233
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,600
The higher-up? Who?

234
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
The Patron.

235
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
The Patron?

236
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,960
His son has the same illness.

237
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,280
Joe?

238
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,200
I still saw him on TV.

239
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,560
Don't tell anybody.

240
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,160
This is top secret.

241
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,560
We'd be screwed if this got leaked.

242
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,720
Why are you telling me this?

243
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,920
The Patron funded
the research for the cure.

244
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,880
Everything must stay a secret.

245
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,640
Do you follow?

246
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
We just went through COVID.

247
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,400
No one wants to face another outbreak now.

248
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,320
And?

249
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,960
I'll propose including
your mother in the research.

250
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,240
So you don't need to withdraw,
and she'll be treated with extreme care.

251
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,800
And be a lab rat in exchange?

252
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,160
She might have to go through that
if the head of the research wasn't me

253
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,680
and if the assistant wasn't you, Ning.

254
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,320
Can you elaborate?

255
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,480
You're the finest student of the batch,
and you know that.

256
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,320
You're better than some of the professors.

257
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,800
Even without this illness…

258
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,440
I'd still pitch this project to you.

259
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,720
Who's in the research?

260
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,360
It's just the two of us.

261
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,080
If you need anything, just ask.

262
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,120
The higher-up will handle it.

263
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,760
What's your call, Ning?

264
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,240
Will you stay
and help me save your mother?

265
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
Just say yes. It's a no-brainer.

266
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,200
Hold up.

267
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,480
What if the research fails?

268
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,040
How will Ning endure the pain?

269
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,320
Pain?

270
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,000
What pain?

271
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,680
Well…

272
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,480
The pain of knowing
I killed my own mother.

273
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,040
And you're just going to wait

274
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,840
for Professor Wiroj
to give your mother the medicine?

275
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,120
You wouldn't do that.

276
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,600
Keep it down, Jean.

277
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,000
In the end, if you walk away now,

278
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,640
won't you regret it later?

279
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,440
How many people have the opportunity
to invent a cure for their own mother?

280
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,880
You and your macho thoughts.

281
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,800
It's coming from someone
who's never had parents.

282
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,680
Besides, you don't have to
give up your future.

283
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,440
The Patron will care for your mom.
What are you afraid of?

284
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,640
I'm scared…

285
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,560
that I won't be good enough.

286
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,320
Ning…

287
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,840
I know you can't take a compliment,

288
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,000
but don't think about that for a second.

289
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,720
Just focus on doing
whatever it takes to cure your mom.

290
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,440
Can you focus on that?

291
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,600
Yeah.

292
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Moreover…

293
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,600
you must not forget that…

294
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,440
you're…

295
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,680
someone who is…

296
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,960
gorgeous.

297
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,160
- That's only natural, isn't it?
- Not as much as me, though.

298
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm the Faculty Queen.

299
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,400
That doesn't count.
My face wasn't fully healed.

300
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,720
Is it healed now, though?

301
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,480
Do I look flawless now?

302
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,800
- Gosh!
- I don't think so.

303
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
What's with you guys?

304
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,480
You stressed me out again.

305
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,520
I owe you guys, you know?

306
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,080
I'll think about the offer.

307
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,560
I feel better now.

308
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,800
I have to go now.

309
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
See you.

310
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Huh?

311
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,960
What?

312
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,280
Why aren't we going?

313
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,160
What were you saying?

314
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,080
What?

315
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,360
What's with holding hands with those two?

316
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,920
We just held hands. It's nothing serious.

317
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Really?

318
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
I don't like it.

319
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,880
Ning, I don't like it.

320
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,640
Can we not argue about this?

321
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
I'm exhausted.

322
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,840
I've paid Non's tuition.

323
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Thank you.

324
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,200
I'll repay you
once I get paid for the research.

325
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,080
Sure thing.

326
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,080
There's no rush.

327
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,760
I know that you need the money.

328
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,880
No. I don't want to prolong the debt.

329
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,320
Let's get going. I want to see my mother.

330
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,520
I love sorting the trash.

331
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,840
Oh, handsome!

332
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,200
Perfect timing.

333
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,360
Hi, auntie.

334
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,360
Good to see you.

335
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,600
How are things? Feeling better now?

336
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,200
I'm doing a lot better.

337
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,080
Trash doesn't stink once it's sorted.

338
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,320
It's different now.

339
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,440
When all sorts of junk
were dumped into one bin,

340
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,360
it was too much.

341
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Yeah.

342
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,360
I think the problem
is the liquid and the ice.

343
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,760
If there were food-waste bins,
it'd be simpler.

344
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,520
Fortunately, for your floor,
Professor Wiroj had it sorted out for us.

345
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,480
For other floors, it's unbearable.

346
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,320
The staff refuses to separate the bins.

347
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,960
Why is that, auntie?

348
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,960
They say bins would make it worse

349
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,720
and make students
bring more food upstairs.

350
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
What the heck?

351
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,840
If I complain too much,

352
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,240
they'll hire dedicated janitors for sure.

353
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
Mom.

354
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,240
Just stay there. Don't come any closer.

355
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,960
I'll be back, dear.

356
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Right.

357
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,880
He comes here a lot lately.

358
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,400
It seems like something's up.

359
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,760
Has she shared anything with you?

360
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,720
Of course.

361
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,040
I've heard that
he owes money to a boxing gym,

362
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,000
like six figures.

363
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
Six figures?

364
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,880
Her bank account got seized.

365
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Her bank account?

366
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,000
Why did they do that?

367
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,400
When she gets paid here,

368
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,160
it goes straight into her account.

369
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,200
When it's her payday,

370
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,360
her creditor withdraws her salary.

371
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,160
And how is she able to pay
for her expenses?

372
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,560
She also cleans other places,

373
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,520
like houses…

374
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,360
and condos.

375
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,360
I don't know, man.

376
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,840
Pao.

377
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,280
Yeah?

378
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,840
You didn't give
your money to Auntie Jit, did?

379
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,240
You haven't paid
for photocopies in months.

380
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,520
Ning asked me to remind you.

381
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,280
Don't worry. I'll pay soon.

382
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,640
I've taken care of that.

383
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,760
Your allowance…

384
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,360
You have to manage it well.

385
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,400
If you really want to help her…

386
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,600
there are other ways to do it.

387
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,880
Mmm.

388
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,880
Don't just say "Mmm", do it.

389
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,960
What the fuck are you looking at?

390
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,160
Want a piece of me?

391
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,400
Right, right. Please go.

392
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,360
Jean.

393
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,120
Right, I know.

394
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,960
Tell me about the bags.

395
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,560
This one is for glass bottles.

396
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,360
FIRST PLACE, SCIENCE OLYMPIAD

397
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,360
Thank you, Auntie Na,
for looking after my mother.

398
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,080
- I might need your help again next week.
- No problem.

399
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,440
Thank you.

400
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,400
Make yourself at home, babe.

401
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I need to help my mom
get cleaned up first.

402
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,160
Let's eat when Non gets back.

403
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,560
Hold on, Ning. Can I ask you something?

404
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,600
When did your mom first show symptoms?

405
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,640
I mean…

406
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,680
before she went into a coma.

407
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,360
About six months ago.

408
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,640
Why did you ask?

409
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,920
I just talked to my family.

410
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,000
They're ready to help you.

411
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,760
Let experienced doctors take care of her.

412
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,880
It's okay. I've talked to a higher-up.

413
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,600
Which higher-up?

414
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,960
The owner of the college.

415
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,480
When? Why didn't you tell me?

416
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,360
You spoke to him directly?

417
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,560
No, Professor Wiroj spoke to him for me.

418
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,440
And why do you look so surprised?

419
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,480
Nothing.

420
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,600
That's great.

421
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,120
That's all.

422
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,360
Mmm.

423
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,120
I'm off.

424
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,040
Mmm.

425
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
San!

426
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,840
Where's Ning?

427
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,240
She's cleaning Mom up.

428
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,400
Mmm.

429
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,880
Finished filming?

430
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,200
Yes.

431
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,200
Did it go well?

432
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,920
I guess.

433
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,800
Good.

434
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,160
And the camera I gave you? Is it good?

435
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,960
Mmm.

436
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,680
Oh.

437
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,720
You're home.

438
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,680
You said you'd be home late.

439
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
San wants to have dinner with us.

440
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,280
After I'm done cleaning Mom up,
let's go out for dinner.

441
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,280
Okay.

442
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,640
Hey. Were you in the middle
of a conversation?

443
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,680
No.

444
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,920
It's done, sir.

445
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,880
But we need to give her time…

446
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,840
so that she feels like the one
making the decision.

447
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,160
PRESENT TIME

448
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,800
They're everywhere.
How can we leave this place?

449
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,680
Hello, Dad. Where are you?

450
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,240
Fah, what are you doing?

451
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,160
Hey.

452
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,320
- Quiet!
- Put it away!

453
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,320
Calm down.

454
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,000
Guys…

455
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,440
I think…

456
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,080
we have to lure them away.

457
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,120
How about breaking a window?

458
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,840
Thorn. No, it's too risky.

459
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,480
What the fuck are they doing here?
Don't they have other places to go?

460
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,000
Looks like they have nowhere else to go.

461
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,680
Maybe no food left.

462
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,120
There's this fucker left.
She's gonna get us all eaten alive.

463
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,880
Prao, stop insulting her.
Do you think it helps?

464
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,600
We have to lure them all away
so we can move, right?

465
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,160
Yeah.

466
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Of course.

467
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,400
Place this speaker in the building.

468
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,200
Then play the audio to attract them.

469
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,240
Yeah, let's do that.

470
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,240
Good idea.

471
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,440
This speaker has great range.

472
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,720
We can set it up
deeper inside the building.

473
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,200
It will also buy us time.

474
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,240
If we crank the volume to the max,

475
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,920
they'll probably rush in there
all at once.

476
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,720
Once the path is clear…

477
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,360
we have to sprint our way across, okay?

478
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,960
We need to make a run for it.
Don't look back.

479
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,000
It's such a long way, Thi.

480
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,720
We have no choice.

481
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,520
Stop being dramatic.

482
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,800
Who is going to place the speaker?

483
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,960
Guys, listen.

484
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,080
We are going to split into three groups.

485
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
Phu…

486
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,920
you're going with Mook.

487
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,200
I…

488
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,600
will go with Ning.

489
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,800
Pao and Night, you're going with Nan.

490
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,120
Okay?

491
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,720
Nan, you can still walk, right?

492
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,640
I'll do my best, Phu.

493
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,400
I have no choice now.

494
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,240
- Go. Just go.
- You're the oldest here, so you go.

495
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,640
I'll go.

496
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,000
Are you up for this?

497
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,320
Why wouldn't I be?

498
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,120
- I'll come with you.
- No need.

499
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,880
- I know the spot.
- Hold up.

500
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,920
Hey, Prao!

501
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,840
Move.

502
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,960
Why bother?

503
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,680
Guys, the news says
it's spreading everywhere.

504
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,640
Even the military can't control it.

505
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,400
Power, water, and communications
in the red zone have been cut off.

506
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,480
Why the fuck are they doing that?

507
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,239
- It was for security purposes.
- Security purposes, my ass.

508
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,639
This is weird.

509
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,840
They seem to be swarming
around the lit areas.

510
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,520
Wouldn't you agree?

511
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,639
Take a look at the park. There are none.

512
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,840
Yeah.

513
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,679
- He's right.
- Guys, we have to move.

514
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,040
Wait for my signal.

515
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,960
Shit, the speaker's ready.

516
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,080
I'm going to bring her back.

517
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,600
Hey, where are you going?

518
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,040
- Picking her up.
- Thorn!

519
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,320
- And if you're not back?
- It won't be long.

520
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,800
Watch your step.

521
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,320
Hurry. Just a little further.

522
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,440
Hey.

523
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,240
Stop!

524
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,720
Hey, stop!

525
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,400
Ow.

526
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,520
Fucking, damn it.

527
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,040
Thorn, come here, you bastard.

528
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
Go!

529
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,080
Vin, do it.

530
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,400
- Play the audio.
- Okay.

531
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,880

- Yeah.

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,480
<i>However, for today's setup…</i>

557
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,240
<i>Oh, our audience can't see it.</i>

558
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,800
<i>- They can't.</i>
<i>- They can't, right?</i>

559
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
<i>I've taken photos. Feel free to use them.</i>

560
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,200
<i>We're sitting far apart,</i>
<i>facing each other.</i>

561
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,840
<i>It's like we're in an interrogation room.</i>

562
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,840
Hey.

563
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,440
I don't think I can go further.

564
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
Hop on my back.

565
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Come on!

566
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,880
Pao…

567
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,840
Huh?

568
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,920
Why is there blood on your back?

569
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,240
Are you bleeding?

570
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,120
Huh? No, I'm not.

571
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,280
Pao!

572
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,200
Hop on! Hurry!

573
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,400
Come on! Hop on!

574
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
Quick!

575
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,320
Pao, hurry!

576
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,440
Come on!

577
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,040
They're coming!

578
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,320
- Night!
- They're coming!

579
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
They're coming!

580
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,320
Pao! Nan!

581
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,240
This way!

582
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,160
UNDER MAINTENANCE

583
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,040
Just run!

584
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,920
Nan!

585
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,360
Run! Go!

586
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,560
Pao!

587
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,720
Pao…

588
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,680
Come on!

589
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,680
Nan, come here!

590
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Hurry.

591
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,760
No, don't do it!

592
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,880
Don't!

593
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,360
No!

594
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,800
Fuck!

595
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,920
- Pao!
- Pao, stop!

596
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,320
Pao, stop it!

597
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,760
We need to go! Hurry!

598
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,840
Hurry! Go!

599
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,760
We need to leave!

600
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,720
Hurry!

601
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
- Move!
- Sorry.

602
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,840
- Run!
- They're here!

603
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,840
I'm so sorry!

604
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,800
Quick!

605
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,600
I'm sorry!

606
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,600
Run!

607
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,880
Oh, fuck!

608
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,040
Shit…

609
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,280
Run! Keep going!

610
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,240
Hurry! Don't stop!

611
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,240
Go!

612
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,680
Pao.

613
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
Pao.

614
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
Ning!

615
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,840
Non.

616
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,360
Pao, don't cry.

617
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,360
It should've been me.

618
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,560
It's okay, Pao.

619
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
Hey.

620
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,480
Did you talk to me this evening?

621
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,280
How can you be so sure
that none of them are here?

622
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,160
If they were here, they would've come out.

623
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,520
Hey, he was asking nicely.

624
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,920
This hall only has one way in.

625
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,480
There's a staircase at the back…

626
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,760
for going upstairs.

627
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,280
If something happens…

628
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,400
we run to the meeting room,
then to the balcony.

629
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,400
Trust us.

630
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,680
We've thought this through.

631
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,640
This is the safest place.

632
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,840
Guys, check your phone.

633
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,840
There's no phone signal here.

634
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,880
What about yours, Non?

635
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,440
The service might've been shut off.

636
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,440
By who?

637
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,240
The government.

638
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,480
They're claiming it was terrorism.

639
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,320
Huh?

640
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,760
The latest report says power and water
will be cut off, but we don't know when.

641
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,760
They said that this could be bioterrorism.

642
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,240
How will we contact people outside?

643
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,360
Just pray.

644
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,920
We have to find a way out of here.

645
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,960
To where?

646
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,320
Haven't you seen what it's like outside?
It's a mess.

647
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,680
We'll be dead if we leave.

648
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,760
At least we know routes here.

649
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,560
How long can we last
with the power and water gone.

650
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,480
There are other people.

651
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
Who?

652
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,360
Survivors.

653
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,960
So what?

654
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,520
We need to gather people
and risk everything on one call for help.

655
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,440
The line of communication is dead.

656
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,200
How are we going to ask for help?

657
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,400
<i>A warning to the medical personnel…</i>

658
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,560
<i>The wounded…</i>

659
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,640
<i>…since they</i>
<i>might be carrying the infection.</i>

660
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,080
I stumbled upon this.

661
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,760
It likely belongs to a worker.

662
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,640
<i>Number three.</i>

663
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,560
<i>To contain the spread of the infection</i>

664
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,760
<i>and prevent major damage</i>

665
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,560
<i>to the city's infrastructure,</i>

666
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,520
<i>CAOUV will shut off power and water</i>

667
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,040
<i>in the red zone,</i>

668
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,960
<i>with Ground Zero</i>

669
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,680
<i>at Kiatpipat University of Innovation,</i>

670
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,840
<i>located in Khlong Kum.</i>

671
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,640
<i>The order will take immediate effect</i>

672
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,560
<i>at 8:30 p.m. tonight.</i>

673
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,640
- Ground Zero?
<i>- The public is prohibited</i>

674
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,120
<i>- from entering…</i>
- Quiet.

675
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,360
<i>without permission.</i>

676
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,760
<i>Violators will face criminal penalties</i>

677
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,000
<i>and will be subject to arrest</i>

678
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,200
<i>and forceful interception by authorities.</i>

679
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,280
<i>Number five.</i>

680
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,880
<i>Residents in the red zone</i>

681
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,040
<i>are urged to seek higher ground</i>

682
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,560
<i>or move to the rooftop of any building</i>

683
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,720
<i>or structure.</i>

684
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,760
<i>Military helicopters</i>
<i>will conduct daily patrols</i>

685
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,000
<i>to search for and rescue survivors,</i>

686
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,720
<i>starting from 8:00 a.m.</i>

687
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,520
<i>- Issued on…</i>
- We're safe now, Fah.

688
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,520
<i>May 15, 2024.</i>

689
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,560
They say our university is Ground Zero.

690
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,920
What does that mean?

691
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,920
And nobody's questioning that?

692
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,880
That's not important anymore, Kawin.

693
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,200
Okay.

694
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,240
We'll go to the parking garage rooftop.

695
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,480
That's big enough
for a helicopter to land.

696
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,760
We're going there now?

697
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,640
Wait, let's not.

698
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,360
We need to let everyone know.

699
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,680
The PR room is upstairs.
Who's coming with me? We're out of time.

700
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,600
Wait.

701
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,880
What are you thinking, Ning?

702
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,440
Why cause more trouble?

703
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,760
Causing trouble, my ass.

704
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,080
Everyone should know
about the announcement.

705
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,720
Was I talking to you?

706
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,480
What's wrong with you?

707
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,440
- Fuck you.
- Hey, San!

708
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,720
San, calm down!

709
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,720
Chill.

710
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,720
Welcome to the male shitshow.

711
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,120
Hey, San! Calm down!

712
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,880
Hold on, Ning. I'm with you.

713
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,840
Hey…

714
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,920
Non!

715
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,720
You guys wait here.

716
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,840
Ning.

717
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,040
Prepare to die.

718
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,400
What are you saying, Prao?

719
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,960
In zombie films,
when someone does something stupid,

720
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,120
it's the extras who pay the price.

721
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,240
Prao.

722
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,360
What is wrong with you? Huh?

723
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,240
You always say fucked up shit.

724
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,200
Am I wrong, Thi?

725
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,280
People here probably made it.

726
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,160
They're trapped in the university.

727
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,600
Okay.

728
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,520
Everything's set. You can speak now.

729
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,600
<i>Everyone…</i>

730
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,720
How's that?

731
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,080
My name is Ning Karnpitcha,

732
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,920
a senior from the faculty of science.

733
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,520
<i>Thirteen of my friends and I</i>

734
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,320
<i>are taking refuge in the library.</i>

735
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,160
<i>We heard the announcement on the radio</i>

736
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,160
<i>saying that the power and water</i>
<i>will be cut off at 8:30 p.m.</i>

737
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,960
<i>You might've noticed</i>
<i>that your phone signal is gone.</i>

738
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,040
<i>We cannot contact people outside.</i>

739
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,120
However, tomorrow at 8 a.m.,

740
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,440
military helicopters
will conduct daily patrols

741
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,200
to search for survivors.

742
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,000
<i>To those hearing this,</i>

743
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,800
<i>let me repeat myself.</i>

744
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,160
<i>Tomorrow at 8 a.m., military helicopters</i>
<i>will conduct daily patrols</i>

745
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,920
<i>to search for survivors.</i>

746
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,600
<i>Survivors must seek higher ground.</i>

747
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,120
<i>It could be the rooftop of a building</i>
<i>or any spot visible from above.</i>

748
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,880
We, the survivors at the library,
are heading for--

749
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,000
Ning, stop.

750
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,040
We can only take so much responsibility.

751
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,480
We, the survivors at the library,

752
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,680
are heading to the parking garage rooftop.

753
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,280
If you can join us…

754
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,640
<i>please do so before sunrise.</i>

755
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,360
<i>I repeat,</i>

756
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,160
<i>the survivors at the library</i>

757
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,320
<i>are heading to the parking garage rooftop.</i>

758
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,080
The library is safe.
We're here to take you in.

759
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,960
The lights outside are out.

760
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,120
You know what you just said?

761
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,120
What if they bring zombies with them?

762
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,800
Stop it, San.

763
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,360
Your words don't fucking help at all.

764
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,960
Ning, why did you say that?

765
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,120
Calm down, okay?

766
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,400
Hey!

767
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,880
There it is!

768
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,920
- Over there!
- Hey!

769
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Right there.

770
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,200
- Whoa!
- Hey…

771
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,800
Let's go, guys.

772
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,160
- Oh?
- Whoa!

773
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,320
- What the fuck?
- Hey!

774
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,480
What?

775
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,520
- Munin!
- Whoa!

776
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,240
Whoa!

777
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,160
We should leave, Sun!

778
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,600
We can just leave it behind.

779
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,120
We can't.

780
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,320
Kiatpipat Cheerleading Handbook
is in there!

781
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,680
Munin!

782
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,680
Back off!

783
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,240
I'm a graduate.

784
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,720
You were so scared of me as a freshman!

785
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,520
We're screwed!

786
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,320
Duck! Take cover!

787
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,400
Duck.

788
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,800
What is it, Aek?

789
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,320
Where are they going?

790
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,400
I don't know.

791
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,520
But it's not a good sign.

792
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,320
And what's next?

793
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,800
Wait.

794
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,880
That's all we can do.
