1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,200
<i>The systolic blood pressure</i>
<i>is 82 millimeters of mercury.</i>

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,080
<i>The diastolic blood pressure</i>
<i>is 55 millimeters of mercury.</i>

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,200
<i>Heart rate is 75 beats per minute.</i>

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,560
This isn't good.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,680
You need to stay in the hospital.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,440
I already talked to them.
They told me I can just stay home.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,160
Which doctor?

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,960
I've never seen
a doctor's name on your pill bag.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,600
You never let me or Non
accompany you to the hospital.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,320
Do I have to ask your doctor
what's wrong myself?

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,880
Mom!

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,320
I'll talk to him again.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,800
Him who? Give me his name.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,640
There's many of them, I can't remember.

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,280
They take good care of me.

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,000
If a public hospital is such a hassle,
then don't go.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,280
I'll go ask San for help.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,160
No!

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,840
He can and he wants to help!
His family owns the hospital.

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,000
There's no need.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,720
No, Mom!

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,240
You need to get checked properly
so you can get treatment on time.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,560
Am I not being clear?

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,640
Leave him alone.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,160
Don't bother him.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,560
Everyone faces their own consequences.

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,320
I'll take care of myself.

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,400
Do you realize you've been
talking about karma a lot lately?

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,160
Be honest, did you know what it was?

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,760
Can you tell me?

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,080
- I'm not that sick.
- Is it cancer?

32
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,440
- What stage is it?
- It's not cancer.

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,200
Then what the hell is it?

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,639
I can't take it anymore!

35
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,440
You don't give me any choice!

36
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,280
You don't make any decisions!

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,640
What exactly do you want?

38
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,400
Let me ask you.

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,800
Do you actually want to be cured?

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,760
Here's your porridge.

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,080
Want to eat it now?

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,200
She will eat now and take her medicines.

43
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,120
Put it in a bowl for me.

44
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,640
Ning.

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,080
I gotta go to the lab for work.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,360
Here's your porridge.

47
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,440
Thank you.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Mom…

49
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,280
When I was little,
I never ate by myself, did I?

50
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,560
Mmm.

51
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,480
That's right.

52
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,560
You were around five or six
before you could eat by yourself.

53
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,560
Before that, I had to feed you.

54
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,600
You let no one else feed you.

55
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,800
Why was that?

56
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,120
Exactly.

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,880
Why was that, hmm?

58
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,960
Let's have one big spoon.

59
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,080
<i>To anyone who gets this video,</i>

60
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,640
<i>be careful using my confession as proof.</i>

61
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,800
<i>It could end up hurting you</i>

62
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,440
<i>or someone you care about.</i>

63
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,400
Everything I'm going to say
from now on is true.

64
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,320
All of this began with a project
called Anisong.

65
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,600
YEAR 2002

66
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,040
I can't take it!

67
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,720
Everyone is ready to share responsibility.
Why should you bear this alone?

68
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,240
I don't know.

69
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,000
Hamilton's rules.

70
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll leave it to you now.

71
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,000
This is not funny.

72
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,720
Can we have a moment, please?

73
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,360
Yes.

74
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,559
We've talked about this.

75
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,640
Everyone thinks you got fired!
Not that you're going to jail!

76
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,679
- They won't be okay if they find out.
- Not okay and then what?

77
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,520
Does anyone go to jail to look cool?

78
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,520
Should we ruin our future just like that?

79
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,800
Not everyone is lucky
to have a house or land.

80
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,120
This job might be
the only thing they have.

81
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,400
And what about your life?

82
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Your kids?

83
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,600
These people aren't your family
or relatives, not even close.

84
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,480
Who said that?

85
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,160
Don't act like you know more than me.

86
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,400
I know what I'm doing.

87
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,720
Everyone else needs to know this.

88
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,520
- Let's see what they say.
- Wiroj!

89
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,320
Dang had a picture.

90
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,960
A picture?

91
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
What picture?

92
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,280
Us in the car.

93
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,520
How is that possible?

94
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,240
They all know about our relationship.

95
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,640
People in this place?

96
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,280
Forget it.

97
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,080
Yeah, forget it! We are two grown adults.

98
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
So they brought up corruption.

99
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,480
And we really did that.
We really forged the receipt.

100
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,960
If we fight this,
they'll use our picture against us.

101
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,200
What will you do next?

102
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,080
What about your wife? Your parents?

103
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,520
I will say this one last time.

104
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,600
These people can decide
whether we live or die.

105
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,760
And your future matters to me.

106
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,240
Because I know people like you

107
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,520
will be able to change a lot of things.

108
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
But not people like me.

109
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,680
You know what to do.

110
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,480
I'll go now.

111
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,520
Good luck.

112
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,400
<i>She was accused of corruption</i>
<i>by the new management,</i>

113
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,480
<i>wanting to take over the research</i>
<i>department's budget.</i>

114
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,480
<i>Because of that decision,</i>
<i>our relationship came to an end.</i>

115
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,480
<i>But things weren't as simple</i>
<i>as she thought.</i>

116
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,680
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>she couldn't let herself go to jail…</i>

117
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,080
<i>because she had just found out</i>
<i>she was pregnant with her second child.</i>

118
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,280
<i>So she chose to flee the country,</i>

119
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,600
<i>wait until everything is over</i>
<i>to come back…</i>

120
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,760
<i>and it was the right call.</i>

121
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,440
<i>Three years later,</i>

122
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,120
<i>no one bothered to track her down</i>
<i>and punish her,</i>

123
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,360
<i>not even those who accused her.</i>

124
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,520
<i>They'd done well for themselves.</i>

125
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,640
Ning.

126
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,760
I missed you so much.

127
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,200
Where is my little brother?

128
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,720
Non!

129
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,840
Come on. Non.

130
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,960
Come see your sister.

131
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,560
Non, this is Ning.

132
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,720
You two are siblings.

133
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,840
<i>After that, she started her new life.</i>

134
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,120
<i>She did labor work</i>

135
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,600
<i>just to look after her kids.</i>

136
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,400
Here you go.

137
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,640
<i>Because there was no way</i>
<i>she could work as a scientist.</i>

138
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,120
<i>She had to hide her past.</i>

139
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,240
Salmon steak, fried squid and for drinks?

140
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,560
<i>Especially with her kids.</i>

141
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,400
There are four types of jellyfish.
Freshwater jellyfish is hydrozoa class.

142
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,400
The next one is in the class of Scyphozoa.

143
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,680
<i>But she knows that she is the reason</i>

144
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,120
<i>why her kids can't have a perfect life</i>
<i>even though it was supposed to be better.</i>

145
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Four jellyfish.

146
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,080
Mom.

147
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,080
Mmm-hmm.

148
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,920
What's wrong?

149
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,360
No, nothing.

150
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,200
My head's spinning
from the things you said.

151
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,680
All of these are scientific names.

152
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,120
How can you remember all of it?

153
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,720
- I can't actually.
- Huh?

154
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,280
Just kidding.

155
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,480
I don't know.

156
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,080
Maybe I read it often,
so I memorized it naturally.

157
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,480
I think you can remember it
because you like it.

158
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,360
Hmm, that's actually true.

159
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,480
But lately,
it's like I need to memorize it.

160
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,360
Otherwise, I can't do well on my exam.

161
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,560
I have to speak it out loud,
making it stick in my brain.

162
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,720
Try to memorize as much as you can now.

163
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,920
One day, you'll only remember…

164
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,360
what you want to remember…

165
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,520
without anyone forcing you to.

166
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,000
Huh. What a quote.

167
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,040
Non.

168
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,320
Go open the door.

169
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,120
Go open the door.

170
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,600
Why don't you just ask Ning?

171
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,560
I'm busy.

172
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,360
I'm busy, too.

173
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,720
I'm preparing for my exam.

174
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,360
Make me do every damn thing.

175
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,400
Mom, Non used swear words.

176
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,880
He also hasn't gotten a haircut,
and that breaks school rules.

177
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,880
Ning! The Patron's scholarship!

178
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,880
Let's see.

179
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,440
What is it?

180
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,720
Nothing, I can study at another place.

181
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,960
Let's me see.

182
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,880
The submitted documents are incomplete?

183
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,120
We already sent them everything.
What more do they want?

184
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,120
Never mind, Mom. We don't have to pretend
to be poorer to get their money.

185
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,080
Someone else might need it more than I do.

186
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,560
No. I don't think this is normal.

187
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,640
You know what's normal?

188
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,280
Hello, what can I get you?

189
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,920
Hey! Phao!

190
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,359
How have you been, Professor?

191
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,640
Oh, my God!

192
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,520
I live around here, and I'm still alive.

193
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,880
When was the last time we saw each other?

194
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,360
Oh! I think it's been almost 15 years.

195
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,000
You are still as gorgeous.

196
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,320
Let's get drinks! But I can't drink here,
I'll get yelled at.

197
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,720
Give me your number.

198
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,320
Kanchana…

199
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,400
my boss wants to meet you.

200
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,000
He's got a job offer for you.

201
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,800
What kind of job?

202
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,000
Are you available after work?

203
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,200
He's here in the van at the back.

204
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,640
He said he can wait.

205
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,720
He?

206
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,800
Be honest with me. Who is your boss?

207
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,280
<i>Dr. Kanchana,</i>
<i>I am glad to talk to you again.</i>

208
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,360
Hello, sir.

209
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,360
<i>I am about to start a project.</i>

210
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,840
<i>It means a lot to my family.</i>
<i>I'd like you to be the one in charge.</i>

211
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
Yes, sir.

212
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,040
<i>This project is called Anisong.</i>

213
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,080
<i>It's a scientific research project</i>
<i>that has never been done before.</i>

214
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,240
Wait, sir.

215
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,600
I have a question.

216
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,440
<i>About the compensation?</i>
<i>Just name your price.</i>

217
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,000
No, it's not about that.

218
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,240
<i>But Ning and Non are supposed</i>
<i>to have a better life.</i>

219
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,160
<i>Especially, Ning.</i>

220
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,920
Was Ning's scholarship turned down
because of this offer?

221
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,440
<i>Kanchana, everything is related.</i>

222
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,840
<i>Both intentionally and unintentionally.</i>

223
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,800
<i>If you're interested, take the phone.</i>

224
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,640
<i>But if not, then leave it here.</i>

225
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,320
<i>The researcher he is looking for</i>
<i>is not only the best</i>

226
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,600
<i>but also willing to protect this secret</i>
<i>unconditionally for life.</i>

227
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,840
<i>Moreover, you won't get any recognition</i>
<i>or status from this project…</i>

228
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,200
<i>but the reward is massive.</i>

229
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,880
<i>Enough for your children</i>
<i>and grandchildren for life.</i>

230
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,920
Who suits this position best
if not Dr. Kanchana?

231
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,560
Ning.

232
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
Jean.

233
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,800
I can't take this anymore.

234
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,440
- I don't want to watch it anymore.
- Calm down.

235
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,440
I have no idea who my mom is.

236
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,520
I thought that she is my mom…

237
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,920
but how could she lie to me
this entire time?

238
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,960
Ning, take it easy.

239
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,200
You need to calm down first, Ning.

240
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,240
Listen…

241
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,200
we have to figure out
what the Anisong project is.

242
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,520
Check this out.

243
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,440
Is this your mom's hand writing?

244
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,120
Yeah. What is this?

245
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,120
This is the preservation
of human cells after death.

246
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,480
Preservation?

247
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,560
Why?

248
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,880
I have no idea.

249
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,200
But I think this is
way beyond what we imagined.

250
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,680
I understand you.

251
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,640
But I think we need
to keep watching Wiroj's video.

252
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,560
<i>In the end, we will die, including him.</i>

253
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,440
<i>He believes that.</i>

254
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,680
He doesn't believe in immortality
or elixirs of life…

255
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,200
because it will make him an outcast

256
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,840
in a society that believes
in reincarnation.

257
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,040
But what if his body doesn't decay
even though he's already dead?

258
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,400
It will backfire terribly.

259
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,640
You mean like a holy monk?

260
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,800
No, not like a holy monk.

261
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,760
But what I'm talking about is…

262
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,440
the cells of a dead person that don't
decompose, according to real science.

263
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,920
What is that for?

264
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,360
Just imagine, out of 75,000 villages,

265
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,480
how many of them worship him as a god?

266
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,440
That's the reward for his good deeds.

267
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,800
If he hadn't done so much CSR,

268
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,760
Kiatpipat would fall apart
in his father's days.

269
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,520
A body that does not decay,

270
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,880
combined with the faith
the entire nation has in him…

271
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,600
Just think.
What kind of result would that produce?

272
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,800
And what if the Anisong serum
were injected into the heirs

273
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,200
of Kiatpipat every generation from now,

274
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,680
and if science could also prove

275
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,640
that the process occurs
only in their family cells…

276
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,560
What do you think
other people will think of them?

277
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,600
Are you insane? Huh?

278
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,440
How could you be crazier than him?

279
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,000
That's true.

280
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,920
But if you think about the concept,
it doesn't hurt anyone, does it?

281
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,080
And it could really happen.

282
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,080
What is not real is…

283
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,120
Who says faith can't be inherited
through blood?

284
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,920
<i>That's the goal of the Anisong project</i>
<i>created by the Patron.</i>

285
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,720
<i>As we all know,</i>
<i>he's like a saint to all of us.</i>

286
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,480
<i>The faith and authority</i>
<i>he has cultivated for over 50 years</i>

287
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,000
<i>have driven Kiatpipat's</i>
<i>business empire to grow beyond control.</i>

288
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,600
Good job.
Let's work together once you've graduated.

289
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,360
<i>The Official Ranking of Thailand's</i>
<i>50 Wealthiest Individuals in 2023.</i>

290
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,440
<i>The combined wealth of all 50 individuals</i>
<i>has increased by nearly 15%,</i>

291
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,880
which amounts to approximately
170 billion US dollars.

292
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,960
<i>And number one is Mr. Phumtham Kiatpipat.</i>

293
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,640
<i>But the Patron knows</i>
<i>that faith and authority</i>

294
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,120
<i>are not legacy that can be passed down.</i>

295
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,680
Cheers!.

296
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,120
<i>Soon, he'll have to pass it on to Joe,</i>
<i>his only son.</i>

297
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,520
You're drunk now.

298
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,920
Bottle up!

299
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Give them whatever amount they ask for.

300
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,160
- But this must stay a secret.
- Yes, sir.

301
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,800
<i>He has no desire to overcome death.</i>

302
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,760
<i>But he thought of developing a drug</i>
<i>that can preserve his body after death.</i>

303
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,000
<i>If he can make it happen,</i>

304
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,760
<i>every generation of his descendants</i>
<i>must go through the same process.</i>

305
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,880
<i>Scientific proof will serve as evidence</i>
<i>that this is not mere superstition.</i>

306
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,760
<i>They'll become extraordinary.</i>

307
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,560
<i>All thanks to the good deeds</i>
<i>his family has done.</i>

308
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,120
<i>When time passes,</i>

309
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,920
<i>this story will elevate them</i>
<i>to a sacred status</i>

310
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,440
<i>inherited through their bloodline.</i>

311
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,000
<i>They won't rely on fading faith or power</i>
<i>when the Patron leaves this world.</i>

312
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,920
<i>And the most important thing is</i>

313
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,920
<i>he needn't worry</i>
<i>that his heir will lack ability,</i>

314
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,160
<i>endangering a century-old family legacy.</i>

315
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,640
<i>Dr. Kanchana's Anisong serum</i>
<i>would have been fully developed</i>

316
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,280
<i>if that incident hadn't happened</i>
<i>that night.</i>

317
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,080
<i>That was the night Dr. Aom,</i>
<i>a member of the research team,</i>

318
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,280
<i>chose to spend the night</i>
<i>in the laboratory.</i>

319
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,560
Whoa!

320
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,440
Whoa!

321
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,760
I'll be the first one to do it.

322
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,400
Joe.

323
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,200
You can't be here.

324
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,960
Where are you going?

325
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,080
Back off.

326
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,840
Joe. Joe!

327
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,160
Joe!

328
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,440
What did you inject me with?

329
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,080
I said, what did you inject me with?

330
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,440
Bitch!

331
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,120
Say it!

332
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,320
Say it!

333
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,120
What's in that injection?

334
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,760
Damn it! Damn it!

335
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,960
Damn it!

336
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,240
<i>At that time no one knew</i>
<i>what Dr. Aom injected Joe with…</i>

337
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,720
- San!
- Mom.

338
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,240
<i>By the time Dr. Kanchana</i>
<i>learned the entire story,</i>

339
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,280
<i>she realized that the Anisong serum</i>
<i>was still incomplete.</i>

340
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,360
What are you doing?

341
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,680
Joe.

342
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,240
<i>Later on,</i>

343
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,720
<i>Joe still wasn't showing</i>
<i>any unusual symptoms.</i>

344
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,520
Let go of me!

345
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,480
Let me go!

346
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,880
<i>He is being quarantined</i>
<i>in an isolation room</i>

347
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,240
<i>with a team of doctors</i>
<i>monitoring him around the clock.</i>

348
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,600
<i>Joe's friends were silenced…</i>

349
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,240
<i>because they were also accomplices</i>
<i>in the murder.</i>

350
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,480
<i>As for Dr. Aom…</i>

351
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,000
<i>just a brilliant orphan</i>
<i>who disappeared without a trace.</i>

352
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,640
<i>He asked Dr. Kanchana</i>
<i>to suspend the Anisong Project,</i>

353
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,680
<i>and ordered her to create a cure.</i>

354
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,040
<i>Because she knows this serum best.</i>

355
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,960
<i>But Dr. Kanchana couldn't accept</i>
<i>what happened to Dr. Aom,</i>

356
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,840
<i>and she couldn't withdraw</i>
<i>from the project either.</i>

357
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,680
<i>So she negotiated with the Patron.</i>

358
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,480
<i>She injected the same Anisong serum</i>
<i>that Joe had into her own body.</i>

359
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,000
<i>She did that to make sure</i>
<i>that he would never harm her children.</i>

360
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,640
<i>Over the following months,</i>

361
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,160
<i>Dr. Kanchana devoted all her time</i>
<i>to developing the cure…</i>

362
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
<i>with her own life at stake.</i>

363
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,520
<i>But her body, along with Joe's,</i>
<i>was steadily falling apart.</i>

364
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,760
<i>Due to the imperfections of the</i>
<i>Anisong serum circulating in her body…</i>

365
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,600
<i>Dr. Kanchana was certain</i>
<i>she might not have enough time.</i>

366
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,680
<i>She asked the Patron to entrust</i>
<i>the development of the cure to me</i>

367
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,400
<i>because she believed</i>

368
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,840
<i>I was the only one who could</i>
<i>continue her work.</i>

369
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,640
Wiroj?

370
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,520
Why does it have to be him?

371
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,560
NONNTAKAN JULY 8, 2003

372
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,960
If you were me,
you probably wouldn't say it either.

373
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Well…

374
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
It's like…

375
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,400
there's nothing to say.

376
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,360
How could anyone talk about this?

377
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,080
You are so damn selfish.

378
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,080
That's right.

379
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,200
How could you do this to me?

380
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,400
Not only me…

381
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,680
How could you do that to you kids?
Are you out of your mind?

382
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,880
All right, then.

383
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,240
I hope that this will be the one thing
that I do it right.

384
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,520
This here…

385
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,280
is the information
that I can bring outside.

386
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,080
But not the whole thing.

387
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,360
But I think this is enough
for you to take it further.

388
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,920
You're using Non to force me into this.

389
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Yeah.

390
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,920
It's not that I want to
leave this task to you…

391
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,320
but I'm leaving my kids.

392
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,400
Please take care of my babies.

393
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,720
Listen to me, Wiroj.

394
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,720
You don't have to make this task succeed.

395
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,200
Just don't make him feel
that you're no longer useful.

396
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,400
That's all I ask.

397
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,560
But if it ever reaches a dead end…

398
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,960
I want you to let it go.

399
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,679
Let this whole damn thing
die with me and with his son.

400
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,159
You know exactly what to do.

401
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,080
<i>I brought Dr. Kanchana's eldest daughter</i>
<i>to assist with the research,</i>

402
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,480
<i>only letting her know</i>
<i>a fraction of the truth.</i>

403
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,679
<i>It's about her mother</i>
<i>and the Patron's incurable son.</i>

404
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,600
<i>All this was to keep Dr. Kanchana's body</i>
<i>out of the public health system…</i>

405
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,719
<i>and to keep this secret</i>
<i>under Kiatpipat's control</i>

406
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,080
<i>by making Ning the Patron's</i>
<i>sponsored protégé.</i>

407
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,880
Three months ago,

408
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,120
I was forced to remove Ning
from the research.

409
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,600
And I discovered that the properties
of the immortal jellyfish

410
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,960
were the key to perfecting this cure.

411
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,560
<i>It will reprogram</i>
<i>the abnormal metabolic functions</i>

412
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,480
<i>in the bodies of Dr. Kanchana and Joe.</i>

413
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,360
<i>But because of the animal rights groups</i>

414
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,200
<i>and the new regulations regarding</i>
<i>experimental substances,</i>

415
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,680
<i>my entire research process was delayed.</i>

416
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,960
<i>I have no time left.</i>

417
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,480
<i>I need to recruit a vulnerable group</i>
<i>at the university to test this serum.</i>

418
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,040
<i>Before knowing about the report</i>
<i>on the parasite infection</i>

419
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,640
<i>in the immortal jellyfish,</i>

420
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,480
<i>which was known in a small circle…</i>

421
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,760
<i>And I also discovered…</i>

422
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,360
<i>that the parasite…</i>

423
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,920
<i>had already been transmitted</i>

424
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,480
<i>to the bodies of all the subjects</i>
<i>I had recruited.</i>

425
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,840
<i>And I don't know the worst-case scenario,</i>

426
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,280
<i>but from everything that has happened,</i>
<i>all the mistakes that occurred,</i>

427
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,360
<i>I alone am responsible.</i>

428
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,640
<i>Ning has nothing to do with it.</i>

429
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,520
What I can confirm is that
the cells of the immortal jellyfish

430
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,200
is the key to make this serum perfect.

431
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,800
And right now,

432
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,320
I have already screened the uninfected
jellyfish and separated them.

433
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Everything I've said is true.

434
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,120
Whoever gets this thumb drive,

435
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,520
I'm praying you've got enough power
to get to the root of it.

436
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,240
Because the main character in this story…

437
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,560
<i>He's definitely more influential than you.</i>

438
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,000
<i>And the last thing…</i>

439
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,400
<i>I'll say it again.</i>

440
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,080
<i>Ning knows nothing about this.</i>

441
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,040
<i>I alone take full responsibility.</i>

442
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,800
Pao was right.

443
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,280
We should all just become zombies
and end everything.

444
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,680
No.

445
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,800
I won't let Thi do it.

446
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,520
Send him instead.
And let Thi stay with us.

447
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm ready, though. I can do it.

448
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,720
No, I don't trust you.

449
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
Then send Non instead.

450
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Thorn.

451
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,760
You shut up.

452
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,120
- You're not going anywhere.
- Thorn.

453
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,560
The decoy hardly needs to do anything.

454
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,440
If we fail, we're in big trouble.

455
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,280
He's an athlete.

456
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,040
He should be with us.

457
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,280
What's next?

458
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,040
That's not true.

459
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,920
Bullshit.

460
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,360
What did you say?

461
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,080
Nothing.

462
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,200
No, nothing.

463
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,480
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey!

464
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,120
Say it again!

465
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,280
- Hey, San!
- Say it!

466
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,360
- Say it!
- You want me to say it?

467
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,240
You want me to say
why you didn't let Nonn go?

468
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,440
Enough!

469
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
If it's hard to choose, draw a name.

470
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Let's do that!

471
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,280
Why would we do that?
This is life or death.

472
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,680
Yeah.

473
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,360
You're right.

474
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,080
But no one gave you the right
to decide life or death for us, San.

475
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,920
I've been confused for a while.

476
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,880
What made you our team leader?

477
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,520
Aren't you guys confused?

478
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,200
Do you have something we don't?

479
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,880
A gun?

480
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,120
A brain?

481
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,920
Look at you.

482
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,840
Ready to make decisions for others.

483
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,920
Just in case… Just in case…

484
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,440
What if we frisk you right now?

485
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,680
Would we find any medicines?

486
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,560
Prao.

487
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,040
If you say one more word, I'll kill you.

488
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,440
So, shall we choose the real leader?

489
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,240
The one that we all agreed on.

490
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,840
The one we won't be cursing later
even if they gets us killed.

491
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,520
For me, it's the two of you.
I think they know zombies the best.

492
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,160
Does anyone disagree?

493
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,320
Then, it's settled.

494
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,240
Welcome, boss.
Do what you want to do.

495
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,600
I think the plan we came up
with is already solid.

496
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,560
But it needs to be tighter

497
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,600
to ensure that each of us
faces the least risk of death.

498
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,760
Thi,

499
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,760
I want you to stay in the decoy
position as before.

500
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,320
But you stay inside the room.

501
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,720
And you don't have to come outside.

502
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,600
We're not luring it into the room.

503
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,040
We just want to get its attention.

504
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,240
Sound good?

505
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,920
Yeah, I'm okay.

506
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,600
Me too.

507
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,720
The golden rule is that we start
and end in the maid's room.

508
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,520
Remember, if it doesn't come in,
we can't do anything.

509
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,240
And we will have to call it off.

510
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,920
If Aunty Jit keeps her routine as usual,

511
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,400
she will be the first to arrive
at the building.

512
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,840
This means that…

513
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,400
we have to get to the spot before her.

514
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,400
We have no time left.
Let's get our stuff and move.

515
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,000
Wait.

516
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,160
Now we have hood, multi colored fabric,

517
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,680
boxing gloves, a long staff,
cable, a tie, and rope. Anything else?

518
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,080
- No.
- Okay. Let's go.

519
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,480
I'll lead the way.

520
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,640
<i>What else can we believe?</i>

521
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,360
Everything started with bullshit.

522
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,680
And things about my mom,

523
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,920
and that fucking serum
which turns a human into a god.

524
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,800
However, right now the government's
surely seeking a solution.

525
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,480
We have all the information.

526
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,080
- We need to bring all of this to--
- To whom?

527
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,920
He will kill us.

528
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,440
The last time we went on the roof,
they open fired.

529
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,560
Ning, take it easy.

530
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,120
Before this, we knew nothing about it.

531
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,160
Running away was only our choice.

532
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,080
But right now,
we have all the information.

533
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,360
If we do nothing about this,

534
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,160
then we will be just like those people
who started it.

535
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,920
You're so totally yourself, you know that?

536
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,280
You're so totally yourself.

537
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,400
Why don't you get it?

538
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,200
I am the cause of it all.

539
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,800
My mom's excuse is me and Non.

540
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,600
The two of us are the reason
that all those people died.

541
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,000
I killed your brother.

542
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,600
I am the reason he died.

543
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,920
Why?

544
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,200
The truth is right in front of you.

545
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,600
You still don't think about
what is possible.

546
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,320
Like when you encouraged me
to do the job with Wiroj.

547
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,720
What is wrong with you, Jean?

548
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Have you ever thought about
how guilty I would feel?

549
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,960
Ning.

550
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,320
Ning.

551
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,280
Remember what Wiroj said
in the video?

552
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,080
He said he can now detect
infected immortal jellyfish.

553
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,320
Chaiwut?

554
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,960
Chaiwut Kiatpipat.

555
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,160
It's Joe's.

556
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,200
Ning.

557
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,680
When you asked him to pick up your mom…

558
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,600
did Wiroj tell you where he was?

559
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,920
Are you outside right now?

560
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,760
Please pick my mom up.

561
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,360
<i>Okay, Ning. I will take care of her.</i>

562
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,120
Date of manufacture. It was on the 15th.

563
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,080
The same day everything happened.

564
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,800
It means that this serum
is the latest one.

565
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,880
If Joe's serum is here…

566
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,320
then where is your mom's?

567
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,360
What Wiroj did is bad, and that's true.

568
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,960
But it's also true…

569
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,720
that he really loves your mom.

570
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,120
And I believe that he will never give up

571
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,600
until he finds a way to cure your mom.

572
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,720
It will be possible.

573
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,480
Because if it ends like this,

574
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,960
Pao and I will be his only CSR activity.

575
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,200
I actually have no idea what to do.

576
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,640
But the information we've got,
and this serum…

577
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,240
It might help someone from outside
put an end to all of this.

578
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,480
There are a lot of them on the outside.
We'll walk to the back of the building.

579
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,360
We have to be on standby before 6 p.m.

580
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,920
Earth will lead us
because he knows best about the way.

581
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,400
What are you doing?
Why are you standing there?

582
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,360
Come here!

583
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,600
I wish you guys rot in hell.

584
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,760
Hey, don't!

585
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,800
What the hell?

586
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,280
Everyone! Quiet!

587
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,320
We need to stick to the plan.

588
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,440
What if we need to back off?
Where can we go?

589
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,040
There's no other way.

590
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,440
I will do it instead of Earth.

591
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,600
But what if I fail?

592
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,680
You're going to be the one
to do it for me.

593
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,160
Aek once brought us
to the main auditorium.

594
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,200
I still can remember the way.

595
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,160
Then you lead us.

596
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,520
Ning.

597
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,320
What are you going to do?
You can leave it here.

598
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,360
No.

599
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,720
I think everyone should know.

600
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,360
Can I have a moment?

601
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,040
Hmm.

602
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,280
Everything will get better.

603
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,080
It's really will get better, Pao.

604
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,720
I never told you…

605
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,480
how proud I am of you.

606
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,560
Rest well, my brother.

607
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,960
Thank you.

608
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,040
Thank you for staying by my side.

609
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,040
I think it's clear.

610
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,240
Let's go.

611
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,040
Be careful.

612
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,960
It's like what you all said.

613
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,320
All the zombies go back to their routine.

614
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,880
This is our only chance

615
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,720
before all the zombies come back.

616
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,960
Everyone, if things go wrong,

617
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,960
send each other a signal right away
to call it off.

618
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,840
Let's do it.

619
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
They're all gone.

620
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,600
Where are they going?

621
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,080
The other side is in position.

622
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,600
Wait for the team above.

623
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,000
Hurry up.

624
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,880
Is this really going to work?

625
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,360
It has to.

626
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,520
Pull.

627
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,680
Take it off.

628
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,680
Push. Swing.

629
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,920
Repeat after me.

630
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,720
Pull.

631
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,680
Push.

632
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,240
Push.

633
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,960
Swing.

634
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,800
Well done.

635
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,040
Before pulling…

636
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,720
we will drop this substance
inside it first.

637
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,240
But be careful. You must not open the lid.

638
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,600
Only open when you will use it.

639
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,920
Do you understand?

640
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,520
Each of you should carry two pieces.

641
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,560
Is this really going to work?

642
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,600
Why don't we try?

643
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,680
No!

644
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,880
These substances are highly toxic.

645
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,720
Spray them as close
to their faces as possible.

646
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,800
Night, are you sure?

647
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,760
Around 80%.

648
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,680
Oh.

649
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,880
What about the other 20%?

650
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,000
Nothing can be 100% sure.

651
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,120
Are we going to leave Lily here?

652
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,440
Wait.

653
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,440
When did she become this quiet?

654
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,120
Have any of you noticed?

655
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,000
When it rained heavily…

656
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,960
After…

657
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,920
Sun…

658
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,880
I'll be there with her.

659
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,040
You know,
Lily wouldn't want you to do this.

660
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,360
I know.

661
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,000
But as you all can see,
my friend is still in there.

662
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,360
I won't leave my friend alone.

663
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,320
I got you.

664
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,080
I only have Pao left.

665
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,560
I'll find him.

666
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,040
This is ricin.

667
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,200
You might need it later.
Carry it with you.

668
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,640
Promise me this, Win.

669
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,880
Please don't die.

670
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,240
I passed the audition
to join your thesis project.

671
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,480
Got it!

672
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,440
I'll survive this to do my thesis project.

673
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,040
Is everything okay? Are you all ready?

674
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,800
Game.

675
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,560
Stop crying. Be strong for our brothers.

676
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,600
I'm sorry, it's just…

677
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,800
I can't stop!

678
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,720
Don't worry.

679
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,000
From now on, we will take care of you.

680
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,640
And what's wrong with you?

681
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,800
- So touching.
- Did I say something wrong?

682
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,640
No, nothing.

683
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,840
Thank you so much.

684
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,960
Let's go!

685
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,200
Let's go to Gus.
