1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,920
Hey!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Over here!

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,000
Over here!

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
We are here!

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,520
Hey!

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,760
Where is Non?

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,000
Non! Non!

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,240
We are here!

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
Non?

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
Non?

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,240
Did it catch up to us?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,960
I don't know.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,200
How would I know?

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,680
I ran here with you.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,920
I think we're safe now.

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,560
Can you swim?

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Yeah. Why do you ask?

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,680
Jump into the water.
Dive as deep as you can.

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,720
What?

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Hurry!

21
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,760
Damn!

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,360
Get in that pool!

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,120
Jump now!

24
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
Pao.

25
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,600
It's going to be okay.

26
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,720
I'll be here. I'm not leaving you.

27
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,440
- Pao.
- Jean.

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,640
Jean!

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,040
Phu, you go up first.

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,960
Tell them not to wait for me.

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,800
No!

32
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,640
You guys get out of here!

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,120
Leave me alone!

34
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,080
What are you talking about, Pao?

35
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,040
I'm your big brother.

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,720
How can I leave you?

37
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,160
But I'm dying.

38
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,680
I'm not gonna survive this.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,640
You will survive with me.

40
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,240
- Pao! Pao!
- Hey!

41
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,200
Go away!

42
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,600
Let go of me!

43
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,440
Stop it!

44
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,280
Leave me! Let go of me!

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,920
Pao, stop! I said stop!

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,880
Pao!

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,240
This isn't a bite mark, Pao.

48
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,240
Kawin!

49
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,400
Come on!

50
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Win!

51
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,960
Who were you running from?

52
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,280
Who?

53
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,560
Answer me, who is that?

54
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,640
Lily.

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,720
- Lily!
- Sun! Wait!

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,080
Hey, Sun!

57
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
We made it!

58
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,240
We will survive!

59
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,400
Help us!

60
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,040
Wait.

61
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,280
Where's Ning?

62
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,080
Hey! Where's Ning?

63
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
Non?

64
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,320
Run! Get out of here!

65
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,120
They're coming this way! Get out!

66
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,920
- Go!
- Hurry!

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,720
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

68
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,080
- What are you running from?
- Back off!

69
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,920
Look! This is a misunderstanding.

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,280
Pao wasn't bitten.

71
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,040
You bastard! I don't buy it.

72
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,880
Damn you! They're scratches!
You can check if you want!

73
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,760
Hey, Thi!

74
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,000
It's true!

75
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,720
Damn it!

76
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,080
They heard gunshots.

77
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,200
What gunshots?

78
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's go! Move! Hurry!

79
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,440
Hurry up! Hurry!

80
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,560
Go!

81
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,720
- Hurry!
- Go!

82
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,880
Hurry!

83
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,080
Pao.

84
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,000
Pao!

85
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,320
- Pao, stay away!
- Pao!

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,040
No, Pao.

87
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,640
Fah.

88
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,360
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Fah.

90
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,320
I'm really sorry.

91
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Pao.

92
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,400
Hey! Hurry up! This way!

93
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,960
Hurry up!

94
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,720
I said hurry up! Damn it!

95
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,840
Hurry!

96
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,280
What are you waiting for?

97
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,320
- Pao!
- This way!

98
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,760
Pao! Come on! This way!

99
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,240
- Pao.
- Let's move!

100
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,520
Pao!

101
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,920
Hurry up!

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Let her go.

103
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,040
You go there.

104
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,520
I'm sorry.

105
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,360
4 MONTHS AGO

106
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,920
PROFESSOR, THE RESULT
TURNED OUT VERY WELL.

107
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,960
GOOD JOB, NING. GET SOME REST.
WE'LL CATCH UP AFTER NEW YEAR.

108
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,920
It was an accident.
No one wanted it to happen.

109
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,440
An accident?

110
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,320
How many times do my mom and I
have to go though this?

111
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,160
- They should just die so this can stop.
- Ning.

112
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,760
- Why are you talking like that?
- Why shouldn't I?

113
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,560
Jean and I warned you about this
since junior year.

114
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,880
We said our backup
power supply is very old.

115
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,600
And you waited until everything
went to hell? Huh?

116
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,320
And that's when we get a new one?

117
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,200
And I can't tell anyone

118
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,440
since it's a top-secret mission.

119
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,560
Brilliant!

120
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,920
Let it just crash and burn!

121
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,800
Are you done?

122
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,840
You feel better now?

123
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,640
Can we fix this problem now?

124
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,520
Sure! Let's fix it now.

125
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,000
But first, answer my question.

126
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,960
Given how little time we have,
where can we find the Cryptobenticfit?

127
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,240
Did you see the news
about the oil spill a week ago?

128
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,200
Now the issue has gone quiet.

129
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,480
Any guesses on who did it?

130
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,000
Was that an accident, too?

131
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,040
It was, wasn't it?

132
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,360
I'm sorry.

133
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,680
You don't need to apologize.

134
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,080
I have no idea how to answer you.

135
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,720
The corals are all dead.

136
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,720
The red tide, too.

137
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,920
I don't know how
we can find Cryptobenticfit.

138
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,120
We need to find something else
with a metabolic rate just as high.

139
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,320
I will find a way.

140
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,560
Can I be honest with you?

141
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,560
Even if our backup
power supply doesn't fail,

142
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,920
I'm not sure we can finish it on time.

143
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,680
We have to test on mice and monkeys,
not on humans yet.

144
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,640
Ning.

145
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,560
That is not our job.

146
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,240
Our job is just to make sure
that we finish it on time.

147
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,520
Let the higher-ups handle the rest.

148
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,440
Are we not being forced
to turn a blind eye?

149
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,720
Anything else I should know?

150
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,000
No, Ning.

151
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,400
You're overthinking.

152
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,120
You should get some rest.

153
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,040
I've isolated my mother's and Joe's cells
and kept them in the petri dish.

154
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,960
And what's next?

155
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,080
I think something's off.

156
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,760
The cell's energy consumption
shouldn't be this low.

157
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,040
There is something
that makes the cell's metabolic rate--

158
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,000
Ning.

159
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,320
This is a new disease.
There is nothing normal.

160
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,720
And as humans,
we don't need to know every single thing.

161
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,320
Focus on what's in front of you.

162
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,840
Focus on what we're doing.

163
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,000
Just let them in.

164
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,920
We'll go with this.

165
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,880
Just think, you and Non
can take a graduation photo with Mom.

166
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,600
Focus on that.

167
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,960
And that's it.

168
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,320
You got it?

169
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Yeah.

170
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,319
The Patron has acknowledged it.

171
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,960
And what did he say?

172
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,000
Let's be real for a second.

173
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,680
What are the chances?

174
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,160
Joe's condition
is getting worse by the day.

175
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,000
- Have you checked the latest lab result?
- We're trying.

176
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,560
What does Ning know so far?

177
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,680
She's just curious.
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

178
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,560
No. It's clear that you can't.

179
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,080
- Let me talk to the Patron.
- No.

180
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,600
He let me make the decision.

181
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,280
Phao,

182
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,080
I can confirm.

183
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,720
We are working on it.

184
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,960
I've been doing my best on this project
from the start.

185
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,600
Dr. Kanchana would never give me
a project that was going to fail.

186
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,240
I think her expectations of you
were too high.

187
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Give me one week.

188
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,840
If I can't fix it, do whatever you want.

189
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,800
- Three days.
- Phao!

190
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,240
If you can't fix it,
the Patron will end this project.

191
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,000
That's the end of it.

192
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,520
I don't believe he will let his son die.

193
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,680
He couldn't care less
whether you believe it or not.

194
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,480
He believes that…

195
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,600
you would never let Dr. Kanchana die.

196
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,920
Isn't he right?

197
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,600
Three days.

198
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,120
And get rid of Ning.

199
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,040
From now on, it's just you and yourself.

200
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,040
Hell yeah!

201
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,800
PRESENT DAY

202
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,360
Dang.

203
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,960
I never thought that one day
I would do something like this.

204
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,720
Go ahead. Take whatever you want.

205
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,720
Why do they only have Ichitan?

206
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,280
Because they are the sponsor.

207
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,360
Sponsor what?

208
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,840
They sponsor this gym.

209
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,920
Go for it. What are you waiting for?

210
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,640
Be careful.

211
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,400
Hell yeah! We will not die of hunger.

212
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,880
Hey. Are you okay?

213
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,480
Eat this if you're hungry.

214
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Here.

215
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,760
Do you need anything else?

216
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,160
This is enough. Thank you.

217
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,000
Can Earth and I sit here to accompany you?

218
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,120
So you won't be lonely.

219
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,960
Hey!

220
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,720
Dig in. Do you want to starve to death?

221
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,400
Do you know how to use it?

222
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,600
Yeah, a little bit.

223
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,080
Don't doubt it.

224
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,160
I am a sport shooter.

225
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,640
This is all we have left.

226
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,000
And two guns. One is with me
and the other is with my friend, Korn.

227
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,560
If you think this gun
will do you any good, you're wrong.

228
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,720
A single gunshot
could draw hundreds of them to you.

229
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,480
How do you know?

230
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,360
Have you done it before?

231
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,720
Do you wanna try?

232
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,760
Didn't you hear
the announcement yesterday?

233
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,080
Of course, I did.

234
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,440
Why didn't you join us?

235
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,880
Why the hell should I? Huh? Why should I?

236
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,720
Did you even count
how many people you've lost?

237
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,880
That was my idea.

238
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,520
I announced it and called
the other survivors to the library.

239
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,440
What now? Won't the government
come and rescue us?

240
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,360
Why did they tell us
to wait on the roof deck?

241
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,240
Ever seen the series <i>The Last of Us?</i>

242
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,720
Everyone in the risk zone
could be a carrier.

243
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Once the virus spreads to a certain point,
you can't tell who's infected.

244
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,640
Wiping out the entire high-risk group
is the safer move.

245
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,120
Otherwise it's hopeless.

246
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,600
If we return and the virus spreads again,
it'll be a nightmare.

247
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,080
They never wanted
to save us in the first place.

248
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,840
They tricked you all
into going up there to be killed.

249
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,240
Correct.

250
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,760
But do you know the worst part?

251
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,160
We did exactly the same thing to Pao
that they did to us.

252
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,200
I don't think so.

253
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,040
If it wasn't for that smart-ass,

254
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,760
I might have more time, don't you think?

255
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,840
What is it, Prao?

256
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,920
Your sister brought those fucking zombies.

257
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,040
Hey! They open fired on us
before the zombies came out.

258
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,800
Will you stop taking your sister's side?

259
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,320
Just admit it.

260
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,360
If she wasn't trying to be
all righteous last night,

261
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,160
we would be on the helipad.

262
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,560
Didn't you all see?
The zombies ran to another place!

263
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,920
Hey! They are going to kill all of us.

264
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,680
Screw everything.

265
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,320
I was talking about Lily, stupid!

266
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,160
Have you already forgotten?
She's a general's daughter.

267
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,120
If she was still alive,

268
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,720
do you really think
they would dare to shoot us?

269
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,080
Think carefully, Non.

270
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,640
Your sister's smart-ass attitude…

271
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,040
got so many of us killed.

272
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,760
Lily, Kawin, Fah.

273
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,880
Shut the fuck up already.

274
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,920
Say one more word…

275
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,000
and I'll kill you.

276
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,440
Will you kill each other?

277
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,000
I've got a gun.

278
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,000
Let me ask you a question.

279
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,360
Didn't you just say
that the zombies went to another place?

280
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,760
I filmed it.

281
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,040
Let me see.

282
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,720
What's the furthest your camera can zoom?

283
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,120
Why?

284
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,920
KANCHANA - PRINT AND CUT

285
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,320
September?

286
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,320
What picture?

287
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,240
Jellyfish?

288
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,000
Jellyfish? Why?

289
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,880
Jellyfish? Why?

290
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,680
Why?

291
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Damn it.

292
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,280
Phao, I need something right now.

293
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,280
Find it for me as soon as possible.

294
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,080
- A pack leader?
- Yeah.

295
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Last night we followed them.

296
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,120
They went to the main auditorium.

297
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,880
Huh? What for?

298
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,880
Oh.

299
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,440
How many of them were there?

300
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,840
A lot.

301
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,400
Maybe 100.

302
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
More than that.

303
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,480
When we got out, I saw more coming.

304
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,040
Did you go in there?

305
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,400
You idiot, who would go in there?

306
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,000
We went to the second floor
and peeked through the window.

307
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,160
I saw them huddled up.

308
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,600
It's like they were planning something.

309
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,960
But what I'm certain about
is that one of them

310
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,440
popped up in the middle.

311
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,560
Why would the one popped up
in the middle be the pack leader?

312
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,040
Like I said,
one of them popped up in the middle

313
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,120
while the rest

314
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,560
were just wandering around.

315
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,520
What if it wasn't a pack leader?

316
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,960
That's why we need to go back
to double-check.

317
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,880
What the fuck? Are you for real?

318
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,760
That's not going to happen.

319
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,840
It's too dangerous.

320
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,440
Do we have any other choice?

321
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,520
We need to survive in this place.

322
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,680
If we don't do anything…

323
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
the only thing waiting for us is death.

324
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,720
If you ask me, we should fight back.

325
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,880
You're right.

326
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,000
If that thing is the pack leader,

327
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,760
we have to find a way to kill it!

328
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,880
For fuck's sake! From idiots to crazies.

329
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,000
Aek, that's impossible.

330
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,080
This is not a game.
We kill the boss, and everything is over.

331
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,400
What will happen
if someone messes with the pack leader?

332
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,920
But we don't know for sure

333
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,680
if that's really their pack leader.

334
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,520
Just to make sure, it should be fine.

335
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,640
If they think that it's safe.

336
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
I totally agree.

337
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,720
What if a zombie unlocks the door
and enters the room?

338
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,720
Huh?

339
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,920
While I was in the library, I saw them…

340
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,920
working like they did
when they were humans.

341
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,320
- Remember the person who--
- Wait, wait!

342
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,600
Stop right there.

343
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,440
Why didn't you mention this earlier?

344
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,520
'Cause you said you'd already secured
all the doors!

345
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,720
You stupid idiot!

346
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,880
You're giving me a headache.

347
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,720
Gus, Earth…

348
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,200
- Go check all doors and windows.
- Sure thing!

349
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,600
If anything's unlocked, lock it.

350
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,560
For anything already locked,
lock them once more!

351
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,200
The temperature matters.

352
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,720
Guess what temperature I got.

353
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,680
Forty-five degrees.

354
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,600
- Does it have to do with the heat wave?
- It's related.

355
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,960
We're experiencing a heat wave now

356
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,880
which makes
the usual temperature really high.

357
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,840
I think this is the heat island effect.

358
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,720
What's that?

359
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,520
It's like you're trapped
inside a giant shell.

360
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,000
And someone's setting fire all around it.

361
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,920
I checked the temperature last night
when it was raining. 25 °C.

362
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,120
But for now,
just be quiet and listen closely.

363
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,160
- What's up with this?
- Right?

364
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,960
There's no one left out there
for them to hunt.

365
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,520
What is wrong with them?

366
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,640
That's why temperature matters.

367
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,800
Yesterday, while we were
running to the library before it rained,

368
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,160
did you see them

369
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,480
walking like they were giddy?

370
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,159
<i>Like they have no direction.</i>

371
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:15,199
<i>And then, they go stand in the lit area.</i>

372
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,280
And when we saw them
moving inside the library?

373
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,800
You remember, Thi?

374
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,520
At that time,
it was still raining outside.

375
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,480
<i>How do I explain this to all of you?</i>

376
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,360
They were more like giddy people,
not zombies.

377
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,040
It was like
they were sleepwalking or something…

378
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,000
compared to now.

379
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,159
But I don't know.

380
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,239
Science kids, what do you think?

381
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,440
From the information we have now,
it is possible…

382
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,840
that hot weather makes them go crazier
than cold weather.

383
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,080
Let's keep an eye on them
once again this evening.

384
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,720
What if it's exactly like you said?

385
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,360
The weather will tell us when to move.

386
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,560
Damn, bro! You're all super cool.

387
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,960
What the hell?

388
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,720
What are you so excited for?
Is now the time for that?

389
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,120
Yep, sorry.

390
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Wait!

391
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,080
Where is Pao?

392
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,600
Pao.

393
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,680
What?

394
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Fuck!

395
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,920
Hey, everyone, stay here!

396
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,400
I'll go after them! Stay here!

397
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,240
Leave me!

398
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,720
Pao, let go of me!

399
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,160
- Die!
- Leave me!

400
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,240
You son of a bitch!
I will kill you! I'll kill you!

401
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,120
I will kill you!

402
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,600
Let me go! I will kill you!

403
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,120
Pao! Quiet!

404
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,760
- They will come for us!
- Come then! Let them come!

405
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,000
Fuck!

406
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,920
- Calm down
- Come and eat us!

407
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,920
Fuck you!

408
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,920
Gus!

409
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,360
I will fucking kill you!

410
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,920
- I will kill you!
- Zombies will come for us!

411
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,280
Let them fucking come!

412
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,160
You son of a bitch! You fucking--

413
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,600
Does it have to go this far?

414
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Yes, it does! Can't you see
that he will get us all killed?

415
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,840
This is not only because
of what he did to Gus,

416
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,600
but also because
he also tried to call all the zombies.

417
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,240
- He didn't mean to.
- He did it on purpose!

418
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,160
Fuck it!

419
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,280
Non, bring me more of that!

420
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,400
Leave them all here.

421
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,520
Ning.

422
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,920
The wound is too big.

423
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
We need to stitch it.

424
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,840
Do you have any medical kits?

425
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,280
- Bring more.
- Help me with that.

426
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,920
I can't take this.

427
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,760
I know he's not in his right mind.

428
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,160
But what's the point
of keeping him tied up like that?

429
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,640
The point is to keep us safe.

430
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,880
Letting him go outside
will be more dangerous.

431
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,160
Do you ever think before speaking?
What if it was your brother?

432
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,160
How would you feel?

433
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,280
And, you, he is your brother.

434
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Is this really the only way?

435
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,040
Pao just stopped taking his medications.

436
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,440
Did he go off his meds by himself?

437
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,400
He was actually getting better…

438
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,880
until this whole thing happened.

439
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,000
But don't worry.

440
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,400
I'm not gonna leave him like that.

441
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,000
He just needs some time alone.

442
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,720
If he loses it again…

443
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,520
I swear I won't let him live.

444
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,200
You've been warned.

445
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,120
What are you doing?

446
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,080
Nothing.

447
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,680
Are you all right?

448
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,600
What kind of a question is that?
Are you stupid?

449
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,520
Yeah. Super stupid.

450
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,400
Go away then. Don't be a pain in the ass.

451
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,920
Give me your hand.

452
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,280
What?

453
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,600
I already saw it.

454
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,400
Let me see.

455
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,040
Cover the wound
if you don't want anyone to see it.

456
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,960
But be careful. It could get infected.

457
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,800
Fucking nosy.

458
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,160
They're already here!

459
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,960
Hey! Guys, come here.
Come see this. Hurry!

460
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,880
Hey!

461
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,480
You come with me to prepare the camera!

462
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,560
Sure.

463
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,400
Where are you going?

464
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,240
To the main auditorium.

465
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,760
Seriously? After what just happened?
We have a wounded person.

466
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,120
We need one more person to go
instead of Gus.

467
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,920
Jean, come with me.

468
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,840
- No!
- No!

469
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,720
I'll go with you.

470
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,520
I'm not going. I'll be here with Gus.

471
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,120
I can't trust these bastards.

472
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,280
Stop it, all of you!

473
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,160
My brother's not going anywhere!

474
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,320
Just take the camera.

475
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,560
Ning! Don't be like this.

476
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,680
Listen carefully.

477
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,280
If we don't go now…

478
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,000
we have to wait all day tomorrow.

479
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,120
Then wait. Why the hell
are you risking my brother's life?

480
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,880
I have been there before.

481
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,720
We might not have this chance tomorrow.

482
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,680
Then take the camera.

483
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,960
Leave my brother here.

484
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
Ning!

485
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,760
We need four people.
We planned it already.

486
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,560
This is to cover each other's backs.

487
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,280
If one's holding the camera,
the other three can keep watch.

488
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,800
Count me in!

489
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,080
Stop right there!

490
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
Why?

491
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,320
We're not filming a zombie movie!
Get the hell away.

492
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,640
You never believed in me.

493
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,720
Why did you say that?

494
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,920
This isn't about what I believe.

495
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,920
- It's about safety.
- It's my safety.

496
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,000
This is about my safety.

497
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,400
My decision.

498
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,960
Stay out of it, will you?

499
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,080
I'll go with him.

500
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,200
Don't worry.

501
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,680
Thorn, you come with me.

502
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,520
- What?
- Jean, Phu.

503
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,840
Stay and take care of the girls.

504
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,920
Okay.

505
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,160
We need to leave now.

506
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,680
Go get your weapon.

507
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,120
Take this. Just in case.

508
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,960
But you need it more than I do.

509
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,080
- I'm just here--
- Come on.

510
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,240
Trust me.

511
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,920
Take it.

512
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,200
TWO MONTHS AGO

513
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,760
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

514
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,800
Here's the thing.

515
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,920
Our innovation department
is developing a serum.

516
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,120
It's kind of like an anti-aging serum,

517
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,960
but it will be used exclusively
for medical use,

518
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,560
only for patients with certain conditions.

519
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,560
Oh.

520
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,400
But here's the thing.

521
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,600
This needs to be confidential.

522
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,640
This can't be disclosed to anyone.

523
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,080
That's why I need volunteers
who can maintain confidentiality.

524
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,600
- Yeah.
- Do you understand that?

525
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
Yes.

526
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,280
Wait, Jit, are you going to sign now?

527
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,800
Of course, why not?

528
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,480
Maybe you need time to think it over.

529
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,920
Isn't it similar to COVID?

530
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,200
That's true…

531
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,920
but this time you can't tell anyone.

532
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,920
And if something happens to you,
you can't see a doctor.

533
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,320
You have to get
treatment from our department.

534
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,440
Yeah, let's do it, Professor.

535
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,600
You trusted me.

536
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,760
That's even better! I can help others.

537
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,360
Our bodies aren't really ours anyway.

538
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,480
At this age,

539
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,080
there's nothing to be afraid anymore.

540
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,600
Great!

541
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,720
If I can help others, I will.

542
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,000
I forgot to tell you
that the program provides compensation.

543
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,160
I noticed that you've got some financial
problems, so I thought this might help.

544
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,800
Is that so?

545
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,120
Is it a lot of money? Up to 1,000 baht?

546
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,120
Ten thousand.

547
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,440
Wow.

548
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,200
That's a lot.

549
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,200
Thank you, Professor.

550
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,880
Can you fill in the form
with rough details?

551
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,240
What was it?

552
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,000
Ah! Okay. I'll go check it out.

553
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,920
Is this the right one?

554
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,480
Yep, found it.

555
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,040
Jean?

556
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,240
The building is closed. Why are you here?

557
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,200
I left my stuff here.

558
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,760
- I left my card with Nui--
- Leave now.

559
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,120
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

560
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,000
<i>Jean!</i>

561
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,920
Jean!

562
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,880
Jean!

563
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,040
Huh?

564
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,880
Why don't you answer me?

565
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,800
I'm thinking about Pao.

566
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,080
Pao?

567
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,800
Pao.

568
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,520
Let me hold your bag.

569
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,240
No, I can hold it myself.

570
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,240
Give it! We might need to run.

571
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,360
Can you stop treating me
like I'm not capable?

572
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,840
I said give it to me!

573
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,960
Fuck!

574
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,280
If he wants to hold it, let him!
This is not the time to argue!

575
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,440
They're all inside now.

576
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,400
Listen to me carefully.

577
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,000
This is not a tough mission.

578
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,880
But if you miss it, we're all screwed.

579
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,760
So from now on,
you have to follow my orders.

580
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,480
Mine alone.

581
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,840
Got it?

582
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,520
Yeah.

583
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,960
We'll wait for them to get inside.

584
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,320
Follow me. Quietly.

585
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,320
My phone battery won't last much longer.

586
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,760
It's about to die.

587
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,920
You don't need to say anything.

588
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,160
I'll stay here and keep you company
if you don't mind.

589
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,600
Did you sneak over to see me?

590
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,400
I…

591
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,640
wouldn't say so.

592
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,560
No one's telling me not to.

593
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,080
Then why are you the first one to see me?

594
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,640
Others are following
the zombies into the main auditorium.

595
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,360
Jean, too?

596
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,960
Yeah.

597
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,800
Jean told me to come see you first.

598
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,240
He'll be here later.

599
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,280
You're lying.

600
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,160
How do you think this will end?

601
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,640
I have no idea.

602
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,560
What I know is,

603
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,400
I need to survive this
and get out to see my parents.

604
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,480
None of us understand, Mook.

605
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,160
We don't need to survive this.

606
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,360
Nobody died, not a single person.

607
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,600
What do you mean?

608
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,560
I don't get it.

609
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,440
Did you see Fah?

610
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,000
Didn't you see that she walked toward me?

611
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,080
Pao, but Fah's already dead,
and the way she walked--

612
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,600
Mook, no one died.

613
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,880
They've just become someone we don't know.

614
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,520
Think about it.

615
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,360
They're still together.

616
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,720
They still hunt together.

617
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,280
They still help
each other unconditionally.

618
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,720
Pao…

619
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,320
We're the cruel ones.

620
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,040
We've watched too many movies.

621
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,600
And we're so stupid.

622
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,880
Too stupid to realize
that this is our inevitable destiny.

623
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,880
We killed them.

624
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,920
We are the one who killed them.

625
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,880
All they wanted was for us
to become just like them.

626
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,200
Come with me, Mook.

627
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,080
Where to?

628
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,880
To the new life.

629
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,000
We'll go to them…

630
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,720
and let things take their course.

631
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,640
- Pao…
- I will hold your hand like this,

632
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,800
and when you wake up, you'll still see me.

633
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,960
- Let's go, come with me.
- No, Pao. Stop.

634
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,640
Pao, stop. Claim down, Pao.

635
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,800
Pao, listen to me. Get a grip first.

636
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,800
Nothing about this is normal.

637
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,240
Pao, we shouldn't be going through this.

638
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,520
We should be living
the life we're meant to live.

639
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,280
We should go back to school,

640
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,640
go to malls, eat delicious food.

641
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,320
We should see our parents again.

642
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,560
We should have children,
to repay the love we received…

643
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,800
and then wait for them
to repay us in turn.

644
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,200
I don't want to argue about this.

645
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,360
But you can choose the kind of life
you want to live.

646
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,040
But not like this, Pao.

647
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,200
Not like this.

648
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,600
This is suicide!

649
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,360
No one died! I said no one died!

650
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,120
Stop talking about death!

651
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,360
No one died. Don't you get it?

652
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,960
Pao.

653
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,880
Pao.

654
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,920
Pao, stay with me.

655
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,480
I really thought that you'd understand.

656
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,600
Pao.

657
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,200
Pao, Jean is on his way.

658
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,160
Stay with me, please.

659
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,320
Listen to me, Pao.

660
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,840
Sun is out of his fucking mind.

661
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,360
Hey, calm down.

662
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,080
- At least we have a refuge.
- What refuge?

663
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,880
- What if she wakes up and eats us?
- Keep your voice down.

664
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,120
Game…

665
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,200
your brother's in there.

666
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,080
If we stay with them, we'll survive.

667
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,280
- It's impossible for all of us to go.
- No.

668
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,880
Just the two of us.

669
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,360
Just you and me.

670
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,960
But our kids are here.
We can't leave them.

671
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,440
And on the way to Jean,
the zombies would get us first.

672
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,440
What about the one in there with us?

673
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,440
Isn't that a zombie?
Is that a squid to you?

674
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,360
I don't know.

675
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,640
What are you doing here?

676
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,120
I guess she really got infected.

677
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,120
Is there anything you can do, doc?

678
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,200
I'm a first-year med student,
I'm still a kid.

679
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,240
What do you want from me?

680
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,800
I'm the one who killed her.

681
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,000
You knew she couldn't swim?

682
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,800
I didn't know what to do at that time,
and the pool was in front of me.

683
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,160
Look at the bright side.

684
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,360
You're lucky that you're friends.

685
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,720
If it weren't for you,
they might have had no idea how to escape.

686
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,880
Thank you for growing so well.

687
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,680
I'm so sorry.

688
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,600
I really need to use your leaves.

689
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,280
Dumb cane,

690
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,640
nettles,

691
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,240
castor bean,

692
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,000
psilocybe mushroom.

693
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,600
Psilocybe mushroom!

694
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,640
What will you do with mushrooms and herbs?

695
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,560
Magic mushrooms contain psilocybin…

696
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,160
which can cause strong hallucinations.

697
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,560
And then there's LSD, too.

698
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,560
Oh! Magic mushroom.

699
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,680
That's correct!

700
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,440
There's actually a study

701
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,680
where they used
this substance from mushrooms

702
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,480
on people with depression.

703
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,480
When they scanned their brains,

704
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,120
it helped heal the brains
of those with severe depression.

705
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,240
Back then, before these mushrooms
were made illegal,

706
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,000
people actually used them for cooking.

707
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,120
In small amounts,
they worked like medicine.

708
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,640
But if you took more than 19.6 milligrams…

709
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,120
it could send you
into shock or even kill you.

710
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,440
So, how many mushrooms
would it take to deal with the zombies?

711
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,160
We need to try.

712
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,240
Okay.

713
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,120
I said okay.

714
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,240
Qi! Why did you touch it?
You'll catch the infection!

715
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,520
Lily is still here.

716
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,360
She is still inside the body.

717
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,360
What did you just say?

718
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,760
She told me
that she wants us to leave her.

719
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,920
What are you talking about?

720
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,320
You might not believe
in this kind of thing…

721
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,160
- but Lily really talked to me.
- Wait a second.

722
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,080
This is impossible.

723
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,000
- Why would I lie to you, Nokia?
- No, it wasn't about that!

724
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,440
They've got…

725
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,560
mesentery!

726
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,000
- What's that?
- What does it mean?

727
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,160
It heals itself.

728
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,800
<i>Lily is already dead.</i>
<i>Why would you bring her body back?</i>

729
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,160
My little sister.

730
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,680
- And she is also your sister!
- Just someone older!

731
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,920
Not my real sister or even Game's sister.

732
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,560
His real brother is out there,
the real one from the same bloodline.

733
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,280
Toto, calm down.

734
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,520
I was right not to choose you two.

735
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,920
- Choose what?
- Choose to become a mentor.

736
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,120
Screw it!

737
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,240
We're dying! Can't you see?
And you're thinking about that?

738
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,320
If we all die, the cheerleading
dance routine that you know,

739
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,880
I know, and Lily knows…

740
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,360
will disappear forever!

741
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,200
I'm asking you,
is your entire life about this?

742
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,120
Cheerleading?
Is that all you fucking care about?

743
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,840
- Go see a doctor!
- So what?

744
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,800
My life is cheerleaders and you guys!

745
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,640
That's it!

746
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,480
That's why I couldn't let anyone go.

747
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,840
Sun…

748
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,680
But the one that's with us in there
is a zombie.

749
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,840
We can do nothing about it.

750
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,480
There's nothing more to say.

751
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,560
If being on the same cheerleading team…

752
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,080
didn't mean anything to you…

753
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,040
then go ahead.

754
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,640
It's my fault.
I should have taught you better.

755
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,000
Stop manipulating me
and then making me feel bad about it!

756
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,080
No! I really mean it.

757
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,840
- Leave me!
- Liar.

758
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,080
- I'm not!
- Ugly bitch!

759
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,760
- I'm not!
- But your heart is ugly!

760
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,000
You're ugly, too!

761
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,280
You never listen to me!

762
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,560
- Since freshman year, I tried to--
- Damn it!

763
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,520
What the hell?

764
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,880
I don't want you to fight!

765
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,480
You can run from anything,

766
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,800
but you can't run
from being a cheerleader of Kiat!

767
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,920
You've been manipulating me
since my first year!

768
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,800
Come on, stop it, please!

769
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,640
What is that?

770
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,440
That's a gunshot.

771
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,880
Damn it!

772
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,960
Damn!

773
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,000
Shit!
