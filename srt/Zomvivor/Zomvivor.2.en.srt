1
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Damn it.

2
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
Fuck!

3
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
What happened?

4
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,360
Damn it.

5
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,200
If we tell Aek and Kawin

6
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,400
and just drive off, I think it'll be fine.

7
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,000
It can still run, but for how long?

8
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,080
It's a big truck and not very agile.

9
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,440
None of the cars here have keyless entry.

10
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,560
They all use push-button ignition.

11
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,720
Why did you turn off the engine?

12
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,600
We have to wait until nighttime.

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,880
Save the fuel.

14
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,080
Once we're back here…

15
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,920
we can just hop on and go.

16
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,840
Game…

17
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
Is he going to make it?

18
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,640
Game is your brother.

19
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,200
He's going to make it.

20
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,920
Hey!

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Earth! The helicopter is here.

22
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,120
- Let's go!
- Wait.

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,560
What?

24
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,160
That's not a passenger helicopter.

25
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,680
Fuck! What do we do now?

26
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,480
Shit.

27
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,080
Damn it!

28
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,840
Shit!

29
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,000
Damn.

30
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,720
Hey…

31
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,280
Fuck.

32
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,680
Oh, fuck.

33
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,320
Hey!

34
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,400
Come on.

35
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Run!

36
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Hurry.

37
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Now.

38
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,120
<i>Non, help!</i>

39
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,040
<i>It's too much!</i>

40
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
<i>Get out!</i>

41
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,160
<i>Shit!</i>

42
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,040
Why didn't you follow me?

43
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,040
ONE YEAR EARLIER

44
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,040
My phone froze.

45
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,920
No excuses. I saw you run off.

46
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,800
I said I couldn't fight.
Riktor was camping in the bush.

47
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,400
If I'd gone in, I'd have died.

48
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Don't blame each other.

49
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,480
He left me to die, Mom.

50
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,880
Here.

51
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,560
Eat up before you go dying again.

52
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,440
What? Mom!

53
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,320
Mom, my phone froze.

54
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,039
So I got flamed by her.

55
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Don't you dare.

56
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,280
Ning!

57
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,240
Be nice to him. No swearing.

58
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,960
He asked you for a new phone.

59
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,240
- My phone's on its last legs.
- Save up and get it yourself.

60
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,280
Stop it.

61
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,640
You got yours from San.

62
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,160
Who did you take it from?

63
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,040
I didn't take it from him.

64
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,080
I bought it off him with my own savings.

65
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,600
- Do you have your own savings?
- Stop.

66
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,600
Let me have a look.

67
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,760
When did you buy this?
Where's your old phone?

68
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,720
Dropped it in a tank at the Marine Lab.

69
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,280
Why didn't you tell me?

70
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,360
A phone costs a fortune, Mom.

71
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,040
San has a ton of phones,
so I got one from him for a good price.

72
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,040
I just pretended to be upset at her.

73
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,520
She really needed a new phone.

74
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,520
I've got no problem with that.

75
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,800
I was just wondering
why you didn't tell me.

76
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,480
All right.

77
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,280
Finish your food
and go to your class, okay?

78
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,400
I'm off to work.

79
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,040
Be nice, all right?
Don't be rude to each other.

80
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,120
By the way, Ning,

81
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,360
don't forget to hang your clothes.

82
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,160
- Is your class at noon?
- Yes. Bye!

83
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,120
I'm sorry.

84
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah.

85
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,880
Hang your laundry out to dry, too.

86
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,360
Morning.

87
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,080
Please take care of this.

88
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,400
I'll be back a bit late.

89
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,360
No problem.

90
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,400
Here.

91
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,120
Excuse me, Professor.

92
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,720
All clear.

93
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,200
Phao, I need your help. Are you available?

94
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,200
What is it?

95
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,360
I need two good new phones
with the exact same model.

96
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,960
Have you come up with the speech?

97
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,440
Yes, I have.

98
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,320
I'll handle it.

99
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Make sure nothing goes wrong afterward.

100
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,640
San.

101
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,240
Mom?

102
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,000
Joe.

103
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Joe!

104
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Joe.

105
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,320
- Joe!
- What's with him?

106
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,440
Joe!

107
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,640
Joe.

108
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Joe!

109
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,240
Joe!

110
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,600
What have you done?

111
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,120
Joe!

112
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,240
Joe's condition has stabilized, sir.

113
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,080
He passed out due to panic
and the addictive substances in his body.

114
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,920
We're still waiting for the lab results.

115
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,440
We're not sure about the Anisong vaccine
Dr. Aom gave Joe

116
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,400
or how it's affecting his body.

117
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,880
<i>How long until it's certain?</i>

118
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,400
Less than two hours, sir.

119
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Impossible.

120
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
It's too soon.

121
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,200
<i>What does that mean?</i>

122
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,400
Your son's not going to die anytime soon,
so don't worry.

123
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,560
Keep tabs on his metabolism

124
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,280
and cellular respiration.

125
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
That's where the symptom will show up.

126
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,960
Understood.

127
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,560
Once Joe has recovered,
what will be the next step?

128
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,920
Do we discharge him
or keep him in isolation?

129
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,640
<i>Lock him up. He can't roam around freely.</i>

130
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,280
"Lock him up," sir?

131
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,120
Or let him be arrested like everyone else.

132
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,640
<i>Doctor, please leave.</i>

133
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Yes, sir.

134
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,480
How long do you need?

135
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,760
What are you referring to?

136
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,320
We understand your anger.

137
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,120
We will give you time.

138
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,000
So, how long are you asking for?

139
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
<i>A month?</i>

140
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,240
Someone died in this incident.

141
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,880
What are you going to do?

142
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,760
I cannot continue.
Please find a replacement.

143
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,280
You cannot let it go, Kanchana?

144
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,400
I really can't.

145
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,880
So what's your solution?

146
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,560
I will inject myself with Anisong,

147
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,600
the same vaccine
your son was injected with.

148
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,000
You're going to let
this project die alongside you?

149
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,560
<i>You gave me no other choice.</i>

150
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,360
<i>This is my last resort.</i>

151
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,680
First…

152
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,040
I can't simply pull out of this project.

153
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,040
<i>Everybody is aware of the condition.</i>

154
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,160
If I violate it,

155
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,400
it will force you

156
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,560
to take Ning and Non as hostages.

157
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
<i>Second.</i>

158
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,839
Whether I agree or not,

159
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,280
you will halt the Anisong project

160
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,319
and get the research team
to work on the cure

161
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,359
in case complications arise in Joe's case.

162
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,760
I cannot keep working on this project
as if nothing happened

163
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,640
or disobey and put my kids at risk.

164
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,760
So this is my only option.

165
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Yeah.

166
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,080
We have really reached a dead end.

167
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Yes.

168
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,440
<i>Starting tomorrow,</i>
<i>I'll begin developing the cure.</i>

169
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,920
If Joe develops any complications,
the same will happen to me.

170
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,680
If I fail to develop the cure

171
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,200
or am too late to do so,

172
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,320
you'll have no reason to touch my kids.

173
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,680
What if it works?

174
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,600
My kids and I will go live overseas
and pass this project back to you.

175
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,000
Answer this, Kanchana.

176
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,120
If I look like a villain…

177
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,160
<i>why don't I just silence you and your kids</i>

178
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,000
<i>and find a replacement?</i>

179
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,640
Because you won't find anyone
as skilled or easy to control as me.

180
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,280
Or else you wouldn't have taken me in.

181
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,440
I would like confirmation
of our agreement.

182
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
It's settled.

183
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,440
If Joe is safe…

184
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,320
this will be where we part ways.

185
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Understood.

186
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
Mom.

187
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,920
Why are you home so late?

188
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,400
You didn't even answer my phone calls.

189
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,160
The delivery workers got together
to protest against the company,

190
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,680
so I joined them.

191
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,960
How was the protest? Did you win?

192
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,920
Only for now.

193
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,560
We don't know what tomorrow brings.

194
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
What's this, Mom?

195
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,040
PRESENT TIME

196
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,360
AUNTY IANG: GRANDMA'S WAITING FOR YOU.

197
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
WHERE ARE YOU?

198
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,000
LEFT THE UNIVERSITY? ANSWER ME.

199
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,120
What are you sketching?

200
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,760
I don't really know.

201
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,160
I notice that some zombies
have this part growing out of them.

202
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,400
Have you seen one?

203
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Yeah.

204
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,000
Shit, Non.

205
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,600
This is actually happening.

206
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,720
You're not actually excited?

207
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,600
Fah, enough.

208
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,920
The signal's gone.
Calling him won't do anything.

209
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,040
How can you sit here and do nothing?

210
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,800
Don't you guys have parents?

211
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,240
Why are you just sitting here?
Why aren't you trying to do something?

212
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,120
- Hey.
- My heart's about to burst.

213
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,960
My dad is still out there, Lily.

214
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,800
- Listen!
- What can I do?

215
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,240
Fah, listen to me.

216
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,440
Listen to me.

217
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,280
It's much safer out there.

218
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,480
He's going to be fine.

219
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,400
My dad has bad legs.

220
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,560
He can't stay there. I must save him.

221
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,000
He can look after himself.

222
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,480
- Your dad knows his stuff.
- How exactly?

223
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,120
That's easy for you to say…

224
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,920
because your dad works for the military.

225
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,240
My dad is just a vendor.

226
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,840
Who's going to help him?

227
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
Huh?

228
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,600
Can you save him? Can you come with me?

229
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,440
- Come with me?
- Go.

230
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,400
Fah, we'll go.

231
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,880
- I'll take you.
- Let her go.

232
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,040
- Prao, easy.
- Go!

233
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,000
Prao.

234
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,120
- Save him.
- Easy.

235
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,080
- Easy.
- Let me go!

236
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,000
- Come on!
- Prao!

237
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
- Find your dad.
- Prao!

238
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,000
Prao!

239
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,000
Stop it, Prao.

240
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,160
- Let's go.
- Don't go.

241
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,080
Come on!

242
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,000
Hey, Prao!

243
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,560
- Prao, stop!
- Calm down!

244
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,000
What the fuck is with you?

245
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,720
Why do you have to be
so fucking mean, huh?

246
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
- I'm taking her to her dad!
- Calm down.

247
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,680
She can't stop pacing.
It's giving me a headache!

248
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,280
I thought you acted like a bitch
to hide your insecurity.

249
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
But you really are just a bitch.

250
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,240
Lily, calm down.

251
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,640
You just figured that out now?

252
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,160
Took you long enough. Just like your dad.

253
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,560
- Hey…
- Hey, Prao.

254
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,560
Whoa. You bitch.

255
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,240
Enough! Enough!

256
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,160
Come and get it! Come on!

257
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,680
- That's enough!
- Bring it on!

258
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,160
What is with you two?

259
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,800
- Enough!
- Did it hurt? It did, didn't it?

260
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,080
- Prao, stop.
- If that hurt, stay away from me.

261
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,560
What's the point of fighting?

262
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,680
Do you want to die?

263
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,200
Both of you, stay away. Go and sit there.

264
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,360
Enough, Prao.

265
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,800
Calm down.

266
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,120
Come at me if you want.

267
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,600
Sit down.

268
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Easy.

269
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
See that guy?

270
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,680
When he was three years old,

271
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,880
a tsunami claimed his entire family.

272
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,680
So he has to live with me…

273
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,680
at the Patron's foundation.

274
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,920
The Patron's foundation?

275
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Yeah.

276
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,640
It's an orphanage.

277
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,200
What have I done?

278
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,160
People here…

279
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,320
They want to leave this place.

280
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,080
I'm so sorry.

281
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,520
It's okay.

282
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
Thank you.

283
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,520
When the morning comes…

284
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,240
let's head out quickly, okay?

285
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
Thorn!

286
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,840
Thorn!

287
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,160
What the hell?

288
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,600
Come look at this.

289
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,840
Hey! Don't go. Stay.

290
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Whoa.

291
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,560
Non, what's happening?

292
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,840
What the fuck?

293
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,000
Where are they heading?

294
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
This is weird.

295
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,480
What?

296
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,800
They move with purpose.

297
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,320
- Look.
- What purpose?

298
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,040
Humans?

299
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,400
I don't think so.

300
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,680
They're moving…

301
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,920
as if they know where to go.

302
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,840
This is very strange.

303
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,880
What?

304
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,760
What is it?

305
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,680
I'm not sure.

306
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,160
It might not be related to this.

307
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,040
What is it, Non?

308
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,400
That's enough.

309
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,040
Let's get back inside.

310
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,480
- Let's go.
- Hurry.

311
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Hey, science kid.

312
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,280
Come with me.

313
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,720
Guys, I have a question.

314
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,640
Do you think
those bastards are real zombies?

315
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Huh?

316
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,520
Why are you asking that?

317
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,680
It's obvious.
What else should we call them?

318
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
They're like…

319
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Thorn…

320
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,320
are you referring to Mick and Jane?

321
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,080
Who are Mick and Jane?

322
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,040
It's like they share emotions.

323
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,200
Emotions?

324
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,200
After they've become zombies?

325
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,320
Yeah.

326
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,600
San, you saw them, didn't you?

327
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,240
They don't look like
the zombies we imagined.

328
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,960
Everything is so strange.

329
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
They eat us.

330
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,040
They turn us into one of them. That's it.

331
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,480
What's the fucking point
of bringing this up?

332
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,160
Just go and catch some sleep.

333
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,200
You need energy for tomorrow.

334
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,000
Wait, San.

335
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,440
They say our university is Ground Zero.
Aren't we discussing it?

336
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,720
Yeah, he's right.

337
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Let's get some rest.

338
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
Talking about it changes nothing.

339
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,840
We must guard the entrance in shifts
in case other survivors show up.

340
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,440
Phu and I will take care of that.

341
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,120
You guys go and sleep.

342
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
San…

343
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,840
about what happened back there…

344
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,360
I'm sorry.

345
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,360
Yeah.

346
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,840
It's okay.

347
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,320
Get some sleep.

348
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,400
Nobody could take care of her
better than you.

349
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,520
You know that, don't you?

350
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,320
If I didn't fall over…

351
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,120
You carried her
while being chased by a zombie.

352
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,880
How could you not fall over?

353
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,240
Can you come with me?

354
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,200
Where?

355
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,360
Once we get out of here tomorrow…

356
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,680
can you come with me to see her parents?

357
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,880
I'll go.

358
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
Night.

359
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,040
Would Nan be mad at me?

360
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,480
WHERE ARE YOU? ANSWER THE PHONE.

361
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,760
I'LL SEND SOMEONE TO YOU.

362
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,080
I'M SAFE. DON'T WORRY, DAD.

363
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,920
Lily…

364
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Still awake?

365
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,680
I can't sleep.

366
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,960
You can talk to me, you know?

367
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,880
Can you give me your hand?

368
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,760
That's enough.

369
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,840
No one's coming.

370
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,880
We're the only survivors.

371
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,840
Can you guys accept that?

372
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,360
Huh?

373
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,760
You can't say that.

374
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,040
There might be others
who are somewhere safer.

375
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,600
Wherever that might be,

376
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,800
at least they haven't lured
the horde to us.

377
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,320
Split up and find some weapons.
Then come back here.

378
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
We're leaving for the garage at 7 a.m.

379
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,360
Get going already. Now.

380
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,720
- Let's go.
- Wait for me, Thorn.

381
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,120
Jean, come with me.

382
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,760
What's the matter?

383
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,000
I know you've got beef with me…

384
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,440
but is this the right time?

385
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,440
What do you know about
Ning's research with Professor Wiroj?

386
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,920
What research?

387
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,640
She works on dozens of them.

388
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,240
The one about her mom.

389
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,200
Did she tell you anything?

390
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
No.

391
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,200
Why are you asking me?

392
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,160
What do you know?

393
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,200
What do you think
her mom is suffering from?

394
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,920
Oh, shit!

395
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,960
Shit! Shit!

396
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,360
Oops.

397
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,760
I apologize, sir.

398
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,160
Non…

399
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,480
our house is far away from the district.

400
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,440
Mom's going to be fine.

401
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,840
We'll find a way back to her.

402
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,040
We need something long
to keep our distance from them.

403
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,720
Don't you agree?

404
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,920
Pao.

405
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,120
Yes, Mook?

406
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,520
Did you hear what I just said?

407
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,680
You need to snap out of it.

408
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,680
I know that you feel bad…

409
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,120
but if you continue being like this,

410
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,240
you won't be able to save anybody.

411
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,240
Not even yourself.

412
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,800
Right now, it's just the 14 of us.

413
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,440
Along the way to the parking garage,
no one knows what will happen.

414
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,040
Someone in the group may need your help.

415
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,800
It might be your friend Night…

416
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,360
your dear brother Jean…

417
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,840
or even me.

418
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
You understand why I have to be serious?

419
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,200
Yes, I do, Mook.

420
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,000
You're so tall. Bend down.

421
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,520
- Yes?
- Come here.

422
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,880
Good job.

423
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,080
Let's get back to the search.

424
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,440
Anything here we can use?

425
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,560
A pair of scissors feels useless.

426
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,560
Win.

427
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,440
Whoa. Where did you get this?

428
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,680
No way!

429
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,960
Well done.

430
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Hey, Ice!

431
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,480
His name's Night.

432
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,520
Come here and check this out.

433
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,440
No, you guys need to check this out.

434
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,160
What the hell?

435
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,320
What?

436
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,640
The horde has returned.

437
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,320
Guys…

438
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,160
Did you hear that?

439
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,680
It could be the survivors.

440
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,920
How are they getting in?

441
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,120
What?

442
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
They…

443
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,960
They're coming here to work.

444
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,120
Huh?

445
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,120
They're here. Hide. We have to hide.

446
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,160
We have to tell others.

447
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,440
If someone bumps into them,
they'll be screwed.

448
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,160
How? Can we all go together?

449
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
No, we have to split up.

450
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,480
Thi and I are going together.

451
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,440
Fah and Lily, you will go together.
Look for Prao's group.

452
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,880
We need to leave now.

453
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,560
If you can't make it back to the hall,

454
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,040
head to the parking garage.

455
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,200
Okay?

456
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,720
What if we can't find anybody?

457
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,400
Just leave.

458
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,600
What the fuck?

459
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,080
Non!

460
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,320
Hey. It's almost 7 a.m.

461
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,760
It's time. Let's go.

462
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,120
Thorn!

463
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,680
What the hell? You scared me.

464
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,440
- Keep it down.
- Why?

465
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,880
We can't return to the hall.

466
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,560
Why not?

467
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,800
They're in the building!

468
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,720
- Huh?
- The zombies?

469
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,280
Yeah.

470
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,840
They opened the doors
and walked in. I saw them.

471
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,400
How many of them? Why are they here?

472
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,160
It doesn't matter. Get to the garage.

473
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,880
No, what about the others?

474
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,720
Jean…

475
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,080
Phu is looking for Ning.
Lily and Fah are after Win's group.

476
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,000
We have to leave.

477
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,480
We'll regroup at the back.

478
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,680
- Let's go.
- Hurry!

479
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,920
What?

480
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
A zombie.

481
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,960
Where?

482
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,080
At the counter.

483
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,960
Come here. Come on! This way!

484
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,840
Shit.

485
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,440
Night, why is she mopping the floor?

486
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,760
What do we do, Lily?

487
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,480
We have to leave.

488
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,920
- Huh?
- We need to go.

489
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,360
- Are you sure?
- Go!

490
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,200
I'll climb down first.
You go after me, okay?

491
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,320
Okay.

492
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,360
Be careful.

493
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,200
Fah, it's your turn.

494
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,400
Go!

495
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,800
What's happening?

496
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,440
They're all gone. Come on.

497
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,560
Lily!

498
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,120
Fah!

499
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,200
Fah, run away!

500
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,320
Go!

501
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,200
Lily!

502
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,120
Hurry!

503
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,920
Hey!

504
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,400
Jean's group is over there!

505
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,480
- Hey!
- Huh?

506
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,360
Hey!

507
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,320
Huh?

508
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,600
Fah!

509
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,840
Fah! Come on!

510
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,120
- Fah!
- Hurry!

511
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,600
Fah, this way!

512
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,240
- Hurry, Fah!
- Fah!

513
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,200
Come on!

514
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,160
Go, go!

515
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,120
Take her.

516
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,280
Go! I'll join soon!

517
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,440
Move it!

518
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Lily.

519
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,200
Lily!

520
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,840
Lily!

521
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,440
Get up!

522
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,000
Lily!

523
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,680
Lily.

524
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,160
Can you hear me?

525
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,680
Get up, Lily!

526
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,960
- Win.
- Come on!

527
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,200
Win, enough!

528
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,760
She's gone.

529
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,960
- We need to go.
- No!

530
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,160
Lily.

531
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,640
Wake up.

532
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,160
Don't fucking leave me!

533
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,440
Wake up, Lily!

534
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,960
Lily!

535
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,040
Please, Lily!

536
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,400
Don't leave me.

537
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,640
Lily.

538
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,120
Lily…

539
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,520
Get up and talk to me.

540
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,160
Lily. Lily!

541
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,720
Win. No, Win.

542
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,560
- No!
- Let go of me!

543
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,160
We can't, Win! She's infected.

544
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,280
She's gone. Look.

545
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,200
Look at her neck. Step back.

546
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,840
Go!

547
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,760
Quick!

548
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,760
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

549
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,840
Come on!

550
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,320
This way!

551
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,520
- Hurry!
- Faster!

552
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,560
Oh, fuck!

553
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,000
Prao?

554
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,440
Hurry! Hurry!

555
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,920
Come on! Faster!

556
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,840
- Quick!
- Hurry!

557
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,960
- Upstairs!
- Hurry!

558
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:00,920
Hurry!

559
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Go!

560
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,400
Be careful!

561
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,640
We just have to go.

562
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,520
One, two,

563
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,680
and run! Go!

564
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,720
Hurry!

565
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,120
Take the other stairs!
We can't go this way!

566
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,160
Go!

567
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,080
- Go!
- Come on!

568
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,240
- Go!
- Non, come on!

569
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,160
Just go!

570
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,200
Go! Go!

571
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,400
Now!

572
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,320
Run!

573
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,440
Fuck you!

574
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,760
Shit!

575
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,040
We have to go now!

576
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:00,960
Wait, Prao.

577
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,120
Go without me. I'll join you soon!

578
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,440
Fah! Fucking run! Run!

579
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,400
What are you doing?

580
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,560
Fah, run!

581
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,560
Fah!

582
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,640
Go!

583
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,280
Fah, you need to go!

584
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,360
Whoa!

585
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,080
Hey!

586
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,440
Fah! Fah!

587
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,200
Fah!

588
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,120
Pao!

589
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,040
Pao!

590
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,120
Run away, Fah!

591
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,680
Fah! Fah!

592
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,640
Fah!

593
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,920
Fah!

594
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,600
- Fah!
- Pao!

595
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,600
Fah!

596
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,320
Hurry.

597
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,400
This way. Come on.

598
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,920
Come on!

599
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,600
It's dead quiet down there.

600
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,920
No zombies are coming up.

601
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Of course!

602
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,240
That's because they got Fah!

603
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,320
Pao.

604
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,800
What?

605
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,880
- Pao, stop!
- Why didn't you wait for her?

606
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,400
- Why were you in such a hurry?
- Pao, stop it!

607
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,000
- Fucking stop!
- Huh?

608
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,440
Answer me, damn it!

609
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,520
Enough!

610
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,640
If he didn't save you,
you'd be dead by now.

611
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,760
Get to the rooftop.

612
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,880
The girls should be up there.

613
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,000
Let's go.

614
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,400
Wait.

615
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,040
Shit!

616
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,440
Whoa…

617
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,480
Let's go!

618
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,440
Wash your hands, Win! Wash them!

619
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,000
Come on.

620
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,400
Wash them. Do it.

621
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,360
Hurry.

622
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,800
Come off already.

623
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:07,920
Win…

624
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,520
Stay still. Don't move.

625
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,240
If I say run…

626
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,360
you run, okay?

627
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,120
Run! Go!
