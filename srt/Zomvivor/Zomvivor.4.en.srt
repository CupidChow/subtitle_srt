1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,640
Whoa!

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,280
What the fuck are they doing?

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,320
Where is the pack leader?

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,240
Take this with you if you wanna live.

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,600
Have you ever wondered why

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,840
whenever the lead actress
and the villain fight

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,280
it's always in the bathroom?

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,480
What do you want from me?

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,800
Three things.

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,840
Just get on with it.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,720
Firstly, you knew it all along,
didn't you?

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,800
That San's been cheating on you with me.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,120
Often.

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,040
Good, then.

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,240
So it'll be easier to talk.

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,160
He didn't take advantage of me.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,640
We just had sex.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,120
It was mutual.

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,960
And that's all.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
Nothing more.

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,640
That's the first thing.

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,760
Do you get paid for doing this?

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
I know

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,840
you're not okay
that your boyfriend cheats.

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,560
But you can't leave him…

26
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,640
because he pays for your brother's tuition

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,440
so that you can have time
for your oh-so-important research.

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,560
Am I right?

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,680
Cut to the chase, will you?

30
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,320
I'm so sorry for you.

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,000
That old bastard only gives scholarships
to poor kids who are geniuses…

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,160
not to middle-class kids
like your little brother.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,560
So you had to cling to San for support
until your brother graduates.

34
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,920
That's the second thing.

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,080
And the third thing is…

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,160
the end of the world.

37
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,600
You don't need someone
to pay for his tuition.

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,640
You don't have to put up with it anymore.

39
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,760
Cut the shit and tell the truth

40
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,960
or we're all gonna die.

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,400
I don't understand.

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,960
What does my private life
have to do with this?

43
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,640
You really don't know?

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,160
Why would San go with those PE kids?

45
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,440
Is he really that generous?

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
Or is he that nosey?

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
Hey.

48
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Are you sure?

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
<i>Non.</i>

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,480
<i>Non.</i>

51
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
Non!

52
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,600
Bring out the camera!

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hurry!

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Hey, Aek.

55
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,640
Damn! Look at that.

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,360
What are you talking about? What the hell?

57
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,040
What do you mean by that?

58
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,720
You don't have to believe me.

59
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,320
Why don't you go ask them yourself?

60
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,720
I know people like you very well.

61
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,960
The only problem you have…

62
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,600
is that no one finds you important…

63
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,360
so you have to make yourself important.

64
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,320
You can do whatever
the fuck you want to me, Prao.

65
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,320
But not to my brother.

66
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,520
I know how it feels, Ning.

67
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,600
The truth is too cruel to handle.

68
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,240
But you and I,
we still have long way to go.

69
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,400
Maybe until
the very last second of our lives.

70
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,640
Do you think I'm saying all this
just to mess with your head?

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,480
Think again.

72
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,560
I'm saying this
because I know that people like you

73
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,200
would never be a follower.

74
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,480
One day,
one of you will act like a smart-ass

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,280
and make us kill, just like Aek did.

76
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,480
If you keep pretending
to care for one person

77
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,440
when really you care for the other…

78
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,280
the rest of us will just be extras.

79
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,960
And I won't stand it.

80
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,240
If you don't make it clear…

81
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,400
I'll say it myself.

82
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,400
Let's start with your brother's tuition.

83
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,320
Stop it!

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,240
Why?

85
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,720
- Where are you going?
- Ning!

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,880
What's the matter?

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No, nothing.

88
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,800
What are you writing?

89
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,440
Information about the zombies.

90
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
What for?

91
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,000
So we can keep track
of how much we know about them.

92
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,720
Are you into it?

93
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,480
Huh?

94
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,200
I'm talking about zombies.

95
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,160
Damn.

96
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,240
Why should I feel guilty about this?

97
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,800
You know what?

98
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,920
<i>The Walking Dead</i> was my first zombie show.

99
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,080
I was around ten at the time.

100
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,120
I was really shaking.

101
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,520
And I didn't even blink.

102
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,120
Damn! It was fucking scary.

103
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,240
I could only imagine

104
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,880
if it could really happen…

105
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,800
if I would run around with Thorn
killing zombies.

106
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,080
It would be fun.

107
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,000
And I kept liking it more.

108
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,880
And even more, and a lot more.

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,679
I watched all the zombie movies.

110
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,559
Started with <i>Night of the Living Dead,</i>
directed by Romero.

111
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,120
I just watched the movies
even if they were bad.

112
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,760
When I saw them…

113
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,880
I felt like I was addicted.

114
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,680
I wanted to be that good,
make movies like that.

115
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,920
I wanted to have my own zombies. I'm like…

116
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,280
Damn it.

117
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,280
Because it's so wrong in this situation,

118
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,400
I'm sitting here wondering
what will happen to me.

119
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,080
If I say that I really like zombies
so damn much!

120
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Oh.

121
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
I'll go check on…

122
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,440
Yeah, go ahead.

123
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,320
That's so fucked up.

124
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,520
Damn it! Let's go. Move!

125
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,280
Wait for me!

126
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,920
Hey!

127
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,600
Are you okay?

128
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,800
Pao just left!

129
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,480
- Go after him!
- Pao!

130
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,080
Are they coming back?

131
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,000
No.

132
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,920
I don't think so.

133
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,600
Aek, look at that.

134
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,000
Over there.

135
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,280
The pack leader.

136
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,400
Why did he become like that?

137
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,760
Pao.

138
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,120
Damn it!

139
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,280
- Gus!
- Bro!

140
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,880
Look at that!

141
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,960
Shit!

142
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,160
Pao! I'll kill you!

143
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,160
Let go of me!

144
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Back off!

145
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
Jean! Earth is going to kill Pao.

146
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,560
Stay here!

147
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,560
Wait, wait!

148
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,920
Don't go, Mook.

149
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,880
Mook, calm down!

150
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,840
Is that aunty a pack leader?

151
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,240
How would I know? I just saw it, too.

152
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,840
What are they doing?

153
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,160
Are they bringing the food to Aunty?

154
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
Damn it.

155
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,000
They swarm around it and eat it.

156
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,600
Everyone!

157
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,480
Everyone, I'm here!

158
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,960
Everyone, I'm right here!
Come and take me!

159
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,360
Everyone! I'm right here! Hey! Everyone!

160
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,520
Did you all hear that?

161
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,240
Is that one of us?

162
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,600
How can that be one of us?

163
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,040
Go ahead. Keep recording it.

164
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,680
Come and take me.

165
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,680
Take me with you!

166
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,080
Pao! Son of a bitch!

167
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,160
What the fuck is wrong with you?

168
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,480
Let go of me!

169
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,680
Pao! Pao!

170
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Back off!

171
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
Let go of me!

172
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,040
Shit!

173
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,120
Go!

174
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,040
Go!

175
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,960
Hurry!

176
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,240
Faster! Hurry up!

177
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,599
Damn it! Earth!

178
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,720
- Korn!
- Hey!

179
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,120
Damn!

180
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,720
What's wrong?

181
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,800
Put the gun down!

182
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,560
What the hell are you doing?

183
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,760
Fuck you, bastard!

184
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,600
Jean!

185
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,720
- Leave me!
- Pao!

186
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,280
I'll kill him!

187
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,600
I will kill him!

188
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
We gotta go!

189
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
- Hurry!
- Pao!

190
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,640
Are you okay?

191
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,800
Help me.

192
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,000
Let's go now!

193
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
Pao, go!

194
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,480
They're coming!

195
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,320
Give me the gun!

196
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,880
Fuck! Fuck it!

197
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,760
Let go of me!

198
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,880
- Aek!
- What are you waiting for?

199
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,080
Run away!

200
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,760
I said go now!

201
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,840
Let's go!

202
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,960
I said run away!

203
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,240
Hey!

204
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,520
Come on!

205
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,240
- Go!
- I'm not leaving.

206
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,480
They're coming!

207
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,960
Shit. Let's go now!

208
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,080
Hurry up!

209
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,920
Go now!

210
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,920
No!

211
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,840
Now!

212
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,800
Korn!

213
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,280
I said run away!

214
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,800
Let me go! I'll go save him!

215
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,280
Korn!

216
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,400
Hurry!

217
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,720
Faster!

218
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,600
- Go!
- Take him to the building!

219
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,440
- I'll go save Aek!
- No, Jean!

220
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,880
Go! Now!

221
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,200
Aek! Snap out of it! We need to leave!

222
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,480
What the hell is that?

223
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,240
Aek! Move!

224
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Go!

225
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,920
Pao, stay with me!

226
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,560
- Take a step!
- Let's go!

227
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,720
We're getting there!

228
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,560
Jean! Hurry! Gosh!

229
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,120
Pao! Stand up! We're so close!

230
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,720
Come on.

231
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,800
Let's hide
inside the innovation laboratory!

232
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
Come inside.

233
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,280
Jean.

234
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,680
Hey, the generator is still working.

235
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,960
We can hide in here for a while.

236
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
Ning.

237
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,480
Aek got bitten!

238
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,600
Aek…

239
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,960
Don't come closer.

240
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,240
I'm not going to survive this.

241
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,560
I told you! This son of a bitch
will get us all killed!

242
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,760
Pao! Shut up!

243
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,920
Ning, open the door.

244
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
Now!

245
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Jean.

246
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,360
You know how to use the gun?

247
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,920
All the bullets are in there.

248
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,720
What are you doing?

249
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,080
Aek!

250
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,360
Pao!

251
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
Don't die.

252
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Pao!

253
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,360
Pao!

254
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
It's all set.

255
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,120
1 MONTH EARLIER

256
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,600
Watch out for your symptoms.

257
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,080
If there's anything abnormal,
come and see me right away.

258
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,600
Yes, Professor.

259
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,000
Jit, remember,
you're not allowed to see a doctor

260
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,200
or take any medicine on your own.

261
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,200
Call the next person in.

262
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,520
Well, I'll be going.

263
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,120
The next person can go in.

264
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,320
They really give the money right away?

265
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Yeah.

266
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,880
That's all?

267
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,040
There'll be more soon.

268
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
Got it.

269
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
Keng.

270
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
Keng.

271
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,000
Let me sit with you.

272
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,120
Hello. Please go.

273
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Aunty.

274
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,720
Why is your face so pale?

275
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,800
And why are you sweating like that?

276
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,160
Yeah. I'm confused, too.

277
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,560
I used to walk these stairs daily
without tiring.

278
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,080
Let me help you.

279
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,280
No, no worries.

280
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,520
I'm fine. I'll be better soon.

281
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,320
Aunty, these days
the heat waves are really strong.

282
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
You need to take good care of yourself.

283
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,320
Right, the world we live in
isn't normal anymore.

284
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,280
And what's all of this?

285
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,920
You didn't go home last night?

286
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,520
I have things to finish.

287
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,520
I'll go take a shower
and get back to monitoring the exam.

288
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,080
Oh.

289
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,600
With this kind of hard work,
you'll be rich soon.

290
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,960
I hope so.

291
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,040
Hang in there.

292
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,720
You're in your fourth year.
You're getting there.

293
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,320
I've been holding it together.
Aunty, I'm dying.

294
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,360
You will survive. You've done a good job.

295
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,000
Once you graduate, don't forget me.

296
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,120
Come back and visit sometimes.

297
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,800
Don't worry about it.

298
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,320
I still owe most
of my Patron's scholarship.

299
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,720
I'll keep visiting you
until you get sick of me.

300
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,520
All right then.
You should leave. Don't be late.

301
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,800
Go now.

302
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,760
I'll go then.

303
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,800
If this is too exhausting,
just use the elevator.

304
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,360
Don't give a shit about them.

305
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,640
Gosh!

306
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,440
You're the protagonist, yet you're using
swear words. Just go already!

307
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,560
Aunty, use the elevator!

308
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,040
All right! Just go now.

309
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,760
09:14
MONDAY 17 APRIL

310
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,560
KENG
MOM, CAN YOU TRANSFER 1,000 THB TO ME?

311
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,920
Open the door!

312
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,440
They're coming!

313
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,520
Hurry up!

314
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,440
I'm here with you.

315
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,960
I'll be here with you.

316
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,960
Why is everything like this?

317
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,640
Answer me.

318
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,240
Answer what?

319
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,680
What did you and Wiroj
do in this laboratory?

320
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
Jean…

321
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,240
What do you think I did?

322
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,280
This whole thing is about the medicine
for your mother, isn't it?

323
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,720
Are the doors all locked?

324
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,440
I don't know how else they can get in.

325
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,160
We have to stay quiet.

326
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,000
They're definitely coming for us soon.

327
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,160
Hey, you.

328
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,160
Is there any way they can get in here?

329
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,720
Say something. Why the hell are you quiet?

330
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,760
Son of a bitch! Say it!

331
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,160
- Why are you quiet?
- San, calm down.

332
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,600
- Say something!
- San.

333
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,680
Speak up!

334
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,680
We already lost.

335
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,440
We won't survive this.

336
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,040
And it's because of you.

337
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,240
What makes you think that?

338
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,280
Tell me the truth.

339
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,920
Where is this coming from?

340
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,600
I felt something was off
since you told me.

341
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,800
In the end,

342
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,560
you and Wiroj are going
to have to test the drug on people.

343
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,640
But since this project is confidential,
where will you find people?

344
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,720
And your mother's disease,
that's also a secret.

345
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
Jean…

346
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,280
The drug Wiroj and I made
was just an experiment.

347
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,719
Why did you bring people into the lab?

348
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,400
Huh?

349
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,320
I saw him bring ten people
over to the lab at night.

350
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,639
- Do you know nothing about it?
- Wait, over ten people?

351
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,920
Who did he bring to the lab?

352
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,760
Toom, Sak,

353
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,239
- Aunty Jit.
- Stop it!

354
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,679
When did you see this?

355
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,719
Why?

356
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,000
When did you see it?
Did you see it yourself?

357
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
Yes.

358
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,600
When was it?

359
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,280
A month ago.

360
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,000
Ning!

361
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:17,400
Jellyfish are invertebrates that have
existed on Earth for 500 million years.

362
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,160
They are one
of the most fascinating creatures

363
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,360
because they cannot swim
against the current.

364
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,040
This kind of creature
is what we call plankton.

365
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,000
And because
they can't swim against the current…

366
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,920
Then, it shows the distribution
of different plankton species…

367
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Listen to him, focus on the class.

368
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,520
…depends on the direction
of ocean currents.

369
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,680
And of course,

370
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,320
the direction of ocean currents is one
of the consequences of climate change.

371
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,360
That means climate change has altered
the direction and speed of ocean currents.

372
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,800
As a result,

373
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,200
the distribution of various
jellyfish species will also shift.

374
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Not long ago…

375
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,600
there was a report about the discovery
of an immortal jellyfish in Thai waters.

376
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,680
Did anyone hear this news?

377
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,920
Have you heard about it?

378
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,840
This immortal jellyfish
is very fascinating

379
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,360
because its body can produce
a certain group of chemicals

380
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,480
that prevent its cells from deteriorating.

381
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,640
Scientists are currently
trying to find answers about it.

382
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,960
And marine biologists
are conducting research on this.

383
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,400
If any of you has read older papers,
you would know that

384
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,960
a protein called telomerase had previously

385
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,240
been found in other jellyfish species.

386
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,840
This protein helps prevent…

387
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,120
its DNA from shortening
during cell division.

388
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:18,280
But in that immortal jellyfish,
marine biologists seem to have discovered

389
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,880
certain substances
that can reset cellular functions.

390
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,440
That substance is called

391
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,400
- reprogramming fact--
- Reprogramming factor.

392
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,080
You are not a TA in this subject.

393
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,280
Why are you here?

394
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,360
- I'm sorry but I couldn't contact you.
- Go wait for me outside.

395
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
Okay.

396
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,280
Where were we?

397
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,440
Professor.

398
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,480
I have a meeting.

399
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,760
Wait a second. Are you avoiding me?

400
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,280
Why would I do that, Ning?

401
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,280
I have no idea,

402
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,800
but the jellyfish compound
could reset my mother's cells.

403
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,200
We could extract
and apply it to the cells…

404
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,120
Ning.

405
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,560
…to see if it restores my mother's cells.

406
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,880
Do you know where to find
the immortal jellyfish?

407
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,480
Ning, now is not the time.

408
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,560
When is the right time?

409
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,120
Not here.

410
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,200
What is wrong with you?

411
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,080
Is this why my lab card is not working?

412
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,920
Right now,
I've got some trouble with the sponsor.

413
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,720
So I need to put your work on hold.

414
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,200
Once everything is better, you'll be back.

415
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,600
Put my work on hold?
Can it really be paused?

416
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,320
- My mother's life?
- Ning,

417
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
if you don't trust me,
we can't work together.

418
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,760
I only paused your lab work,

419
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
but out there,
I have no right to stop you.

420
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,800
You got it?

421
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,200
Once everything's sorted out,
I'll contact you.

422
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,640
Turritopsis… rubra?

423
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,240
A little high blood pressure, Jit,
but there's nothing else.

424
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,160
Am I allergic to the medicine?

425
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,880
I'll need to run some blood tests.

426
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,640
If there's even
a single sign of abnormality…

427
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,040
I'll stop it immediately.

428
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,200
And are there any other symptoms?

429
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,120
No.

430
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,960
Did you get some sleep?

431
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,520
Not really.

432
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,000
How many days?

433
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,720
Like three days.

434
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,040
You can't do that.

435
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,640
You need to get some rest.

436
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,280
Take a long leave of absence.

437
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,480
Otherwise, you'll wear yourself out.

438
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,360
A medical certification is required.

439
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,480
But as we know, I can't go to a doctor.

440
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,000
Will your pay be deducted
if you don't have a medical certificate?

441
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,720
If so, how much would you want?

442
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,760
I mean…

443
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,880
the amount that won't
cause you any problems later.

444
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,760
Give me your arm.

445
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,840
You do realize…

446
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,080
that the document you signed
carries legal weight, don't you?

447
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,280
If one day you collapse…

448
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,680
and someone takes you to a hospital…

449
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,800
and they detect our serum in your system…

450
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,400
that would mean
you've disclosed our secret.

451
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,720
The project owner
can take legal action against you.

452
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,080
That could land you in prison.

453
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,800
Well, is it possible for me

454
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,520
to request the remaining installment now?

455
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,000
That way, I won't inconvenience you.

456
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,120
I'll take it off.

457
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,880
Where have you been?

458
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,480
It's almost morning.

459
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,640
I went to film the movie.

460
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,880
What movie wears you out like this?

461
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,640
Non.

462
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,600
Non!

463
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,160
Non!

464
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,040
What now?

465
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,520
Just because Mom's sick doesn't
mean you can get away with anything.

466
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,360
And you're so perfect.

467
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,240
Mom must be so proud of you.

468
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,560
Mom's smart one.

469
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,440
Don't start.

470
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,280
Don't act like the victim.

471
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,640
Your life isn't that difficult.

472
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,720
Yeah, right.

473
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,120
You and Mom got rid of all the problems.

474
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,280
I never got to know a damn thing.

475
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,920
You never let me know what was going on.

476
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,200
Great job.

477
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,480
Mom's smart one.

478
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,360
Go to your room.

479
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,640
Mom's favorite kid.

480
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,040
Myxozoa?

481
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:55,000
JITTRA - HEMATOLOGY

482
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,640
It's just like I thought.

483
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,240
He used them to make the serum.

484
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,520
<i>What was it?</i>

485
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,400
<i>Jellyfish?</i>

486
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,400
<i>No, they're not.</i>

487
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,520
But they're infected jellyfish.

488
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,840
Shit!

489
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,200
Damn it!

490
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,280
Lily!

491
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,360
Lily! Take it easy!

492
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,400
It's me, Win!

493
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,960
- Get out of my way!
- No! Don't do it! Stop!

494
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,080
- What are you doing?
- What the fuck?

495
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,800
- I'm gonna kill it!
- What the fuck?

496
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,080
She is not human anymore!
She is a zombie. Let me go.

497
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,920
- Get off my way!
- Put it down!

498
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,800
Fuck.

499
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,880
Damn it.

500
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,480
Crouch!

501
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,640
Down on the floor!

502
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,800
What should we do?

503
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,920
It's roaring louder!

504
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,440
Didn't I tell you to kill it?

505
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,640
Stop it! Toto!

506
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,720
She is not a human.

507
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,760
Night.

508
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,320
The mushroom.

509
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,680
The mushroom. The mushroom.

510
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,120
What mushroom?

511
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,280
Mushroom?

512
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,080
Everyone! I need your help!

513
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,680
Help with what?

514
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,440
What kind of help?

515
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,160
What help?

516
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,680
What have you done?

517
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,600
It really works.

518
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,400
The magic mushrooms
can calm the zombies down.

519
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,920
That's not what I'd call calming.

520
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,560
We can't shove mushrooms
down every zombie's throat, Night.

521
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,000
It works ten times faster than usual.

522
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,000
That means…

523
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,400
psilocybe has a significant effect
on their brains.

524
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,000
Sun.

525
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,320
What?

526
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,680
Can I go out there?

527
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,040
That gunshots might be
from my brother's group.

528
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,040
No.

529
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,440
Why risk it?
If you leave, you'll get killed!

530
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,320
But here, it's like I'm already dead.

531
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,960
How long will you stay with that?

532
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,080
"That"?

533
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,920
She is your mentor! How dare you?

534
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,640
Gun…

535
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,240
Yeah! A gun!

536
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,200
Gun.

537
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,160
Gun.

538
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,160
Hey.

539
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,200
Stop!

540
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,040
Sit down.

541
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,760
The two of you are going nowhere!

542
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,440
Sit down.

543
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,120
And what are we gonna do next?

544
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,280
What are we going to do
once she sobers up?

545
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,840
Keep giving her mushrooms?

546
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,800
- What if we ran out of the mushroom?
- We can't just kill her.

547
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,840
Lily is still inside that body.

548
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,200
You don't have to believe me.

549
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,280
But look at her!
She is still a human being.

550
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,760
Can you really kill her?

551
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,800
That's a zombie. Can't you see?

552
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,640
Can you stop calling her a zombie?

553
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,000
- That's a human!
- We can also call her "that"!

554
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,160
That's a fact.

555
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,760
We were taught
what a zombie's supposed to be.

556
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,880
We're not really afraid of what they are.

557
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,480
We're afraid of the image we remember.

558
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,960
What are you talking about?
Do you think that was cool?

559
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,640
Just leave. All of you.

560
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,480
I'll be here with her.

561
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,360
What now? Another one acting up?

562
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,680
I don't trust you.

563
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,120
If she's with you, you'll kill her.

564
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,920
- You knew she couldn't swim!
- What should he have done?

565
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,360
Go kiss her or something?

566
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,680
Shut up, freshman!

567
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,200
What "freshman"? It's over.

568
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,720
We're all going to die.

569
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,840
Sun!

570
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,200
I think you're biased towards Win.

571
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,560
What biased?

572
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,000
Remember when Win quit
during the university event

573
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,200
and called the cops on you
for going overboard,

574
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,680
and the junior ended up
in a hospital from shock?

575
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,640
Huh?

576
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,760
Is that true?

577
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,680
That's why you love Lily.
She's the one you had left.

578
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,440
Others will never be enough for you!

579
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,400
That's right.

580
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,960
Be careful.

581
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,240
He'll use reverse psychology.

582
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,600
I admit it.

583
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,440
I don't love you all equally.

584
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,600
The day she found out that…

585
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,960
her father had another family…

586
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,800
that she and her mom
were just the second home…

587
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,640
Do you guys even know what happened?

588
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,440
She begged me to teach her
the cheer dance every single day…

589
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,880
because she was afraid…

590
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,480
that she might kill herself.

591
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,880
I stayed with her every night
for almost two months.

592
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,520
She kept falling down.

593
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,200
But she kept doing it
no matter how tired she was.

594
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,400
I told her to stop, I told her to pause.

595
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,000
But she just said she would keep going.

596
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,920
Because she knew…

597
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,440
that practicing cheerleading
was the only thing that kept her alive!

598
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,000
How could I let her die like this?
I just can't let it happen.

599
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,880
When she started to dance…

600
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,360
everyone said the same thing.

601
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,960
That she's the best cheerleader
of Kiatpipat!

602
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,520
She's the best one we've seen in 30 years!

603
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,440
She's better than me, her trainer!

604
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,880
It's not talent.

605
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,720
She's just a girl.

606
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,160
She was betrayed by her own father.

607
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,680
She just wants to get there…

608
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,760
to show everyone
she's worth more than she thinks!

609
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,520
Are you done?

610
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,320
Did it take you long
to make up this story?

611
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,320
Sun…

612
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,040
You can't expect us to be like Lily.

613
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,800
We didn't have the same dramatic life.

614
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,560
Believe whatever you want to believe.

615
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,640
I have no power left.

616
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,160
I only have my story with Lily left.

617
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,680
And that cheerleading dance routine!

618
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,200
But I want to try something.

619
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,200
If it doesn't work…

620
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,080
you can just leave me.
