1
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,280
So, it was you who let Pao out?

2
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,800
Why did you do that?

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,240
- I--
- You know many people died because of you?

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,000
I didn't mean to.

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,520
- I didn't know.
- How could you not?

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,040
You saw what he did to the PE students!

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,960
Hey.

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,800
San, do you think blaming her
will bring back the dead?

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,440
Where are Ning and Jean?

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,200
Why didn't you come back together?

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,120
Pao, Ning and Jean ran away with Aek.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,440
But we have no idea where.

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,360
They are with Aek.
They can look after themselves.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,880
No.

15
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,640
That's not true.

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,200
What the hell?

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,280
Huh?

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
My brother won't keep him alive.

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,040
He definitely got killed.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,760
What's wrong with you?

21
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Hey! The zombies are coming!

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,760
Thi, zip it! Don't make any sound.

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,720
The sound of rain
drowns out the sound in here.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,320
Listen to me.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,200
From now on…

26
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,280
all of you will take orders from me.

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,400
Only me.

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,800
Got it?

29
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,320
I found a Japanese article.
I asked my friend to translate it.

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,360
The immortal jellyfish were
infected with a parasite called Myxozoa.

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,800
Typically, this parasite
doesn't affect the host's behavior.

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,680
But in the seas around Japan,
they found that the parasite

33
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,880
caused the immortal jellyfish
to form groups

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,520
and attack other marine animals.

35
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,560
Some are turning on each other.

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,200
A research team in Japan
conducted an experiment

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,840
keeping both infected and uninfected
jellyfish in controlled conditions.

38
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,520
They found that the infected ones

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,120
regenerated their tissue
faster than the uninfected ones.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,560
The article said that they were
very excited about the discovery.

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,680
Obviously, nothing should be done
with this jellyfish.

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,440
Did you not know
that Wiroj brought them to make serum?

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,800
Yeah, I had no idea.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,160
He kept me away,
wouldn't even let me in the lab.

45
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,600
When I first realized it was possible,
I asked him to bring them to our lab.

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,600
But he didn't listen to me.

47
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,200
And when I found the paper,
I sent it to him.

48
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,600
I was too late.

49
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,600
I sent it to him too late.

50
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,040
He already used them to make the serum.

51
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,400
It might not be related.

52
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,720
He may be working on another project
or something else.

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,320
Jean, I'm not that stupid.

54
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,840
This project is top secret.

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,480
The best subjects are those
who have no choice at all.

56
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,600
He'd have brought alien labor if he could.

57
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,760
He wouldn't.

58
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,800
He's not that cruel.

59
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,519
I wasn't talking about Wiroj.

60
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,680
I'm sorry for talking like that.

61
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,240
But I really do believe it.

62
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,280
No.

63
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,240
We can't just speculate like this.

64
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,400
There's no proof.

65
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,480
I will go to Wiroj's office.
He's got a safe in there.

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,440
I'll go with you.

67
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,560
No, you stay. I can go by myself.

68
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
I'm going.

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,600
But I don't think that you should
see that place again.

70
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,800
It's okay, I can handle it.

71
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,440
Kanchana, please wake up.

72
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,200
Please.

73
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,480
I'm begging you.

74
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,240
Please wake up!

75
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
<i>It wasn't your fault.</i>

76
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,400
The one to blame
is the one who drove him crazy…

77
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,680
and the one who locked him up.

78
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,600
If that was your friend…

79
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,080
you wouldn't be saying this.

80
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,760
Make no sound now.

81
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,320
I wouldn't blame you
even if it was my dad.

82
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,840
I wasn't your fault. You're just stupid.

83
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,919
Thank you.

84
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,800
These people

85
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,280
believe that they are supposed
to be the leaders.

86
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,120
They'll do whatever it takes
to be in front.

87
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,160
Because that makes them special.

88
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,200
When they can make things go their way
or when they get to boss people around.

89
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,480
And when these people make mistakes,

90
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,520
you know
what's the first thing they'll do?

91
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,440
They will find someone…

92
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,840
and make the most useless one
take the fall.

93
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,120
Yesterday it was Pao.

94
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,680
Today it was you.

95
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,280
It'll be someone else tomorrow.

96
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,720
But it will never be them.

97
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,120
There's a way for you to help yourself
without relying on men.

98
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,880
Do you want to know how?

99
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,320
How?

100
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,840
If you don't get rid of them
and take their place…

101
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,920
you find out their secrets.

102
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,000
Wanna know the frontliners' secret?

103
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
San.

104
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,640
It'll be all right.

105
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,480
You'll be okay.

106
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,800
Damn, San is so fucking cool!

107
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,360
How much was it?

108
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,600
It was 20 fucking grand.

109
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,480
That didn't even include
the cost of his friend's table.

110
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Damn it. He's so chill.

111
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,880
He was like, "Here's the credit card."

112
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,640
And then he took out more cash
from his wallet

113
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,440
and handed it to the waiter.

114
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,720
Damn.

115
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,560
What do I have to do to be rich like him?

116
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,880
Give me free money.

117
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,920
- Can you go home by yourself?
- Of course.

118
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
Of course.

119
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,080
- I definitely can.
- Hey.

120
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,320
Guys, how are y'all getting home?

121
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,600
I'll call a cab.

122
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,160
What about you?

123
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,360
Taxi.

124
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,400
What about you, Thi?

125
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,280
Waiting for Thorn, right?

126
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,720
That's right.

127
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,280
I'll be waiting outside.

128
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,760
It's too loud inside.

129
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,880
Yeah.

130
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,800
Get home safe.

131
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,760
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

132
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,680
- Goodbye.
- Thank you so much, bro!

133
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,240
Bro. What about me?

134
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
See you then.

135
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,360
Thi.

136
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,640
Huh?

137
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,040
Where's my money?

138
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,400
Yo, let's go home.

139
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,840
Hey.

140
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,720
- Will you be able to drive?
- Of course.

141
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,600
Can you drive when you're this drunk?

142
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,120
Yeah, I do it all the time.

143
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,640
Stay here, I'll call the driver.

144
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,960
No.

145
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,160
Let go of me.

146
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,360
Turn off the engine.

147
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,200
San, turn off the engine.

148
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,040
Damn it!

149
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,840
I fucked up! I can do nothing!

150
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,080
San, what's wrong? Why are you crying?

151
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,280
There's nothing I can do.

152
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,160
What are you talking about?

153
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,560
There's nothing I can do.

154
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,920
There's really nothing I can do.

155
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,040
I can do nothing.

156
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,920
I can't…

157
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,760
Thank you.

158
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,680
Please take care of him.

159
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,880
All right. Don't worry.

160
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,400
Everyone! Hey! Thorn! Thorn!

161
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,800
Everyone!

162
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,079
Come see this!

163
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,720
- What is it?
- Bro, come here.

164
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,440
What I just told you,
only use it when you really need to.

165
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,120
You got it?

166
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,400
Non.

167
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,440
I…

168
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,600
I have something to tell you.

169
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,000
What is it?

170
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,600
It's about your mom.

171
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,440
What happened?

172
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,960
Thi called us to check something.

173
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,440
Just now.

174
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,120
Thi, pause it.

175
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,680
Mook…

176
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
was that Aunty Jit?

177
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,360
Hey.

178
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,880
- That's really her.
- You guys know her?

179
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,720
She's our faculty's janitor.

180
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,280
- But why is she…
- Here's the thing.

181
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,000
We now know that they will stick together
and they have a pack leader.

182
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,160
But the question is…

183
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,360
Why does it to have to be her?

184
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,720
Why Aunty Jit?

185
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,000
What makes her more special?

186
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,880
That's all you want to know?

187
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,640
Such fucking nonsense.

188
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,400
Hey. Thorn! If you're stupid, shut up.

189
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,000
Maybe you see nothing, but I do.
Stop thinking that I'm a fool.

190
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,400
Thi…

191
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,480
This is important.
It's a matter of life and death for us.

192
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
Nan.

193
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,560
Do any of you know
why they roar like that?

194
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,040
I mean, nothing happened to her.

195
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,800
It's like she cried
because her friend got eaten.

196
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,800
Her friend?

197
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,080
Then why didn't the others
see her as a friend?

198
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,000
She was the only one who cried.

199
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,960
And why didn't Aunty Jit
eat those corpses that they brought?

200
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,760
Why eat her and not the others?

201
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,040
Here.

202
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,600
This is the climax.

203
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,560
<i>She sacrificed her food</i>
<i>for the entire group.</i>

204
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,800
<i>She got just one in return.</i>

205
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,960
<i>Why this behavior?</i>

206
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,600
For real, does this sound
like nonsense to you?

207
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,920
If we can't find the answer,
all we can do is keep running

208
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,640
and miss the chance to survive,
and become one of them.

209
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,200
Come on, where is it?

210
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,000
Ning.

211
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,720
Yeah?

212
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
Check this out.

213
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,320
Where did you find it?

214
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,960
Wiroj's drawer.

215
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,520
NONNTHAKAN
8 JULY 2003

216
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Why…

217
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,960
Why did Wiroj
have a picture of my mom and Non?

218
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,760
The code for the safe
is six digits, right?

219
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,560
That's right.

220
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,200
Why don't we try this?

221
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,160
Are you crazy?

222
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
Are you kidding me?

223
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,920
How could my brother's birthday
be the code to his safe?

224
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,560
There's no harm trying.

225
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,080
The one that cried when Nan got eaten
is the zombie that bit her.

226
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
What do you mean?

227
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,880
She was the one who made Nan a zombie.

228
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,720
I know that.
But what does it matter? Why the roar?

229
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,240
I think they stick together,
kind of like they're related.

230
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,240
It's like an extended family.

231
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,520
So when a zombie turns another person
into a zombie,

232
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,120
they form an emotional bond.

233
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,040
It's passed on from one to the other.

234
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Just like…

235
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,640
humans or some animals
have bonds with their family…

236
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,760
between parents and their child…

237
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,600
or bonds between siblings and relatives.

238
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,440
So they're like a mother and child?

239
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,720
That's what I think.
I can't imagine it any other way.

240
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,120
But…

241
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,720
if they cry for another reason,
I have no idea what it is.

242
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,200
Wait.

243
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,160
If you're right…

244
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,840
it means Aunty Jit
is everyone's mom, right?

245
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,640
No.

246
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,200
Aunty Jit could be
their great-grandparent.

247
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,080
To summarize,
they all have a bond with Aunty Jit.

248
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,480
What the fuck?

249
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,800
Then Aunty Jit has a mom, too,
doesn't she?

250
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,000
Not necessarily.

251
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,640
And why not?
How could she have gotten infected?

252
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,320
This is going way too far.
I'm not buying this idea.

253
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,080
What if she got directly infected?

254
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,440
Then it means that there wasn't
another zombie before Aunty Jit.

255
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,600
Am I right?

256
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,840
Directly infected?

257
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
But how?

258
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,680
What faculty did she work in?

259
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,040
That's what I was talking about.

260
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,480
What project is this?

261
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,920
- Ning!
- Huh?

262
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,840
I found it.

263
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,040
VOLUNTEER PROFILE
FOR SERUM PROJECT

264
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,280
FUTURE BLOOD SAMPLE RESEARCH
CONSENT FORM

265
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,720
Letter of consent.

266
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,240
Anti-aging test.

267
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,960
What the hell?

268
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,840
This so fucking cruel.

269
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,960
How the hell could he do this?

270
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,000
He deceived these people
and used the contract as cover.

271
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,120
And it has no legal validity at all.

272
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,960
No way.

273
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,200
Mook, keep your voice down.

274
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,400
Don't you get it?

275
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,080
Killing Aunty Jit
is like killing their parent.

276
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,280
If you were them, what would you do?

277
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,920
What about everything we said?

278
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,600
There's nothing we can do about it.

279
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,280
Isn't that true? Isn't that true?

280
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,840
Yeah.

281
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,840
Now there's nothing we can do…

282
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,400
because what we know so far
still doesn't answer a lot of questions.

283
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,480
Like why did Aunty Jit have to eat Nan?
Why not the other zombies?

284
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,720
<i>When zombies eat their prey,</i>
<i>are they really eating them?</i>

285
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,600
<i>Or just trying</i>
<i>to keep their species going?</i>

286
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,720
<i>Why do they act like they're going</i>
<i>back to work like when they were alive?</i>

287
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,920
Is it a fixed action pattern,
like in animals?

288
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,480
Or is there something more?

289
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,680
And what's that swelling on their neck?

290
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,360
We still have no idea about these things.

291
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,240
But if you have to know everything
before you do anything,

292
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,960
will you ever have enough time?

293
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,160
We'll use what we know to our advantage.

294
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And what we know now…

295
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,960
is that the zombies
have the same weakness that we do.

296
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,160
And what's that?

297
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,600
Caring about others.

298
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,680
What if we don't kill it?

299
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,480
What if we bring it in alive?

300
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,320
Would they dare do anything
to the person who brought a knife?

301
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,480
You go around and get the gun.

302
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,000
Then shoot his head.

303
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,240
What about you?

304
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,560
I'll go and distract it.

305
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,080
You little shit, you've gone blind.

306
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,480
Aek!

307
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,040
Aek!

308
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,239
Aek!

309
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,199
Aek!

310
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,480
Jean!

311
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,960
Shoot!

312
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,800
Shoot now! Come closer!
Shoot it right to his head!

313
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,560
Get closer and shoot it! Hurry up!

314
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,680
You sit here first.

315
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,560
And close your eyes.

316
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,320
Take off your clothes.

317
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,040
No, don't touch it!

318
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,480
Don't use your hand yet.

319
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,040
If they really are parasites,
their blood is very dangerous.

320
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,160
When Gus was infected,
it might have been because that axe.

321
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,720
Can I open my eyes?

322
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,680
I'll do it myself. Get some rest.

323
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,480
It's a parasite.

324
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,640
Aek got infected before he shot himself.

325
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,520
Does that parasite
turn people into zombies?

326
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,440
We have no place to run to.

327
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,280
Hello.

328
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,880
My name is Wiroj Limmanapong.

329
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,520
Head of the Department of Biological
Innovation Research and Development.

330
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,760
Kiatpipat University of Innovation.

331
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,840
I record this video as my confession

332
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,760
because of a serious incident
caused by the serum I created.

333
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,240
<i>I can't yet say what the serious</i>
<i>incident is.</i>

334
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,360
<i>But because of the mistake</i>
<i>that was made today…</i>

335
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,520
innocent people may lose their lives.

336
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,840
<i>To anyone who gets this video,</i>

337
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,280
<i>be careful using my confession as proof.</i>

338
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,920
<i>It could end up hurting you</i>
<i>or someone you care about.</i>

339
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,320
Everything I'm going to say
from now on is true.

340
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,920
All of this began with a project
called Anisong.

341
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,080
<i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>they will turn into humans again.</i>

342
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,800
No one would dare to assume that.

343
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,680
But you once said
that they are like people who sleepwalk.

344
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Yes.

345
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,760
Like they're sleeping.

346
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,720
I think all the routines they do
are some kind of reflex.

347
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,240
And the rain and the temperature

348
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,240
have something to do with this behavior.

349
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,120
That means Aunty Jit
will do her routine, too.

350
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,800
If we need to do something with her,

351
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,360
we need to go
to the science faculty's janitor room.

352
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,800
Wait, wait, wait.

353
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,880
Isn't this idea a little too crazy?

354
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,640
Killing her might be easier.

355
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,760
One wrong move,
and it's over for all of us.

356
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,520
For me, all of our ideas are crazy.

357
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,080
But we figure things out
with what we know.

358
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,680
And killing their mother
will have more negative consequences.

359
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,040
But to catch her alive,
even if it's hard or impossible,

360
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,840
will give us more opportunity.

361
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
What opportunity?

362
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,000
We couldn't take her hostage,

363
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,680
but we've got the first group
of infected zombies.

364
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,080
And we also have a biologist with us.

365
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,000
Whatever is inside Aunty Jit…

366
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,280
it might answer the questions
that we have about them.

367
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,560
I think what we still don't know
is the way out.

368
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,040
Let's vote.

369
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,000
Anyone not in agreement, raise your hand.

370
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,520
It's settled then.

371
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,920
Let's plan this.

372
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,440
Our time runs out at sunrise.

373
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,800
Castor bean.

374
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,560
Blackboard tree.

375
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,360
Psilocybe mushroom.

376
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,880
What next? What next?

377
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,280
A gun! Gun! Yes, I need to find a gun.

378
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,440
Where's a gun? Gun, gun… Oh!

379
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,880
You scared me.

380
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,680
What gun?

381
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,520
A gun that…

382
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,680
Just a gun. A gun for shooting these.

383
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,760
Shoot what?

384
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,040
Shoot zombies.

385
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,920
Castor bean?

386
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,440
Yeah.

387
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,200
It's ricin, a substance
extracted from castor beans.

388
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,760
Have you watched <i>Breaking Bad?</i>

389
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,520
Yeah, what about it?

390
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,920
Jesse's cigarette.

391
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,960
Oh!

392
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,640
Damn!

393
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,280
Just 0.2 milligram.

394
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,080
It's twice as potent as cobra venom.

395
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,080
It's the most dangerous poison
derived from a plant.

396
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,680
- And currently, there is no antidote.
- Okay, I got it.

397
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,440
You want a gun to inject this
into the zombies

398
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,040
That's right.

399
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,160
Looking at Lily's symptoms,

400
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,000
they likely absorb plant toxins
much faster than humans.

401
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,360
But it's still just a hypothesis.

402
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,520
It might not be every substance
that they react to.

403
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,000
We need to find a gun that can shoot
at least four to five meters.

404
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,240
Or else it will be useless.

405
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,360
What about this?

406
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,560
Why didn't I think of this?

407
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,080
There are a lot more over there,
but we'll need more hands.

408
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,920
Let's go.

409
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,520
What the hell am I doing?

410
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,960
- Ready?
- Yes, sir!

411
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,440
- Ready?
- Yes, sir!

412
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,760
- Ready?
- Yes, sir!

413
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,480
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

414
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,960
Three, four!

415
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,440
Kiatpipat. The name Kiatpipat is grace.

416
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,520
Renowned across the heavens,
a mind of wisdom and a heart of virtue.

417
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,000
Nurturing people alongside wisdom

418
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:26,560
with honor and dignity,
your name echoes far and wide.

419
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,440
In blue and gold,
radiant lights that guide the way.

420
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,000
As the darkness
of ignorance is vanquished,

421
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,840
enlightenment brings radiant delight.

422
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,000
We're Kiat's people,
and we're proud to be.

423
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,120
We're Kiat's people,
and we're proud to be.

424
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,000
We're Kiat's people, willing to sacrifice,

425
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,760
to shed blood and flesh for Thailand.

426
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,240
Lily.

427
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,280
Lily.

428
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,040
Lily!

429
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,480
Three, four!

430
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,280
The name Kiatpipat is grace.

431
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,680
Renowned across the heavens,
a mind of wisdom and a heart of virtue.

432
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,400
Nurturing people alongside wisdom,

433
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,800
with honor and dignity,
your name echoes far and wide.

434
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,280
In blue and gold,
radiant lights that guide the way.

435
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,880
Come back to us!

436
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,080
As the darkness
of ignorance is vanquished,

437
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,280
enlightenment brings radiant delight.

438
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,200
Lily.

439
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,920
We're Kiat's people,
and we're proud to be.

440
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,760
We're Kiat's people,
and we're proud to be.

441
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,640
- We're Kiat's people--
- Shit!

442
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,720
- Everyone! Stop it now!
- To shed blood--

443
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,320
- I said stop!
- Huh?

444
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,400
Look at that!

445
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,240
- Shut the fuck up. Stay silent.
- We fucked up.

446
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,600
Oh, my! Shit!

447
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,920
We really fucked up.

448
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,320
We're Kiat's people, willing to sacrifice,
to shed blood and flesh for Thailand.

449
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,520
Shit.

450
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,840
Damn, Lily.

451
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,920
We're Kiat's people, willing to sacrifice,
to shed blood and flesh for Thailand.

452
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,400
Oh, my gosh.

453
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,960
Look.

454
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,080
To shed blood and flesh for Thailand.

455
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,960
Dedicate…

456
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,880
Lily.

457
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,280
Dedicate…

458
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,880
Lily, stop it, Lily.

459
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,200
- We'll all die.
- She's not gonna stop.

460
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,200
She led them to us.

461
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,800
Dedicate…

462
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,120
We will die for sure.

463
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,360
Dedicate…

464
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,560
<i>Why are Kiatpipat cheerleaders the best?</i>
<i>Answer me!</i>

465
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,440
<i>- Because our choreography is the oldest.</i>
<i>- No!</i>

466
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,280
<i>- It's about our accuracy!</i>
<i>- Still no!</i>

467
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,440
<i>Run ten laps around the field!</i>

468
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,880
<i>- We want to help our friends!</i>
<i>- No!</i>

469
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,960
<i>Answer me again!</i>

470
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,360
<i>Why are Kiatpipat cheerleaders the best?</i>

471
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,360
<i>Because we love each other so much!</i>

472
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,600
Dedicate…

473
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,920
Dedicate…

474
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,480
Lily.

475
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,760
I'll go out and bait them.

476
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,240
No way.

477
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,080
- Sun.
- Huh?

478
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,160
No way.

479
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,400
If I don't do this…

480
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,880
none of you will survive.

481
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,240
Sun!

482
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,880
You're not going.

483
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,400
If you go, we'll go with you.

484
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,600
Bring them outside.

485
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,560
And meet your brother at the gym.

486
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,560
What about Lily?

487
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,320
Let her go.

488
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,360
Both her time and mine are up.

489
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,280
Now it's your time.

490
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,440
I'm giving the mentor position
to both of you.

491
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,040
Sun.

492
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,280
I love the two of you.

493
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,040
I love you, too.

494
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,440
We love each other.

495
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,400
No! Sun, no!

496
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,600
Sun! Sun!

497
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,720
Sun!

498
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,360
- No.
- Sun!

499
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,120
- Sun!
- Sun!

500
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,000
Sun, don't do this!

501
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,160
Sun, please forgive me.
