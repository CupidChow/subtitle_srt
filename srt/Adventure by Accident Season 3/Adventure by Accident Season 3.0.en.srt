- We were here.

You all have different styles.

for the four brothers.)

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:08,910
(Surprised)

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,250
Oh, it's rising.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,949
It's coming up.

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,519
- Oh, the sunrise.
- Oh, my.

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,519
(Their last sunrise in Madagascar)

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,559
- What a magnificent view.
- How beautiful.

10
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,989
You have to go back to Korea now.

11
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,329
No! Episode ten can't end!

12
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:23,429
No! We want more!

13
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:25,600
- Let us go to Korea.
- Don't come back!

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,969
- Just stay there!
- Don't come back.

15
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,500
- Don't come up. Go back down.
- Go back down.

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,899
- Don't come up, sun.
- Don't come up.

17
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,699
- Don't come up. Go back down.
- Don't come up. Go back down.

18
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:33,869
(So...)

19
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,109

Can you hear me?

26
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,920
(- Oh, my. It's a live stream.
- Happy birthday, Pani Bottle!)

27
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,320
Oh, thank you.

28
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,990
I'll show you the scenery here.

29
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:59,030
This is Madagascar.

30
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,170
(- Isn't it Seoul?
- Isn't it Yongsan?)

31
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,799
"Isn't it Yongsan?" It's Madagascar.

32
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,069
(Beware of similar scenery)

33
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,069
Did I do a live stream
for my birthday last year?

34
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,680
(During the South America trip
1 year ago,)

35
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,049
(he also did a birthday live stream
with Kian84 and Si Eon.)

36
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:16,579
(He does a live stream
every year on his birthday.)

37
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,680
I did do a short one last year
in South America.

38
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,189
"Now that you've started the live stream,
beware of Kian84."

39
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,489
Thankfully, he's still sleeping.

40
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:26,959
He's still sleeping. The time right now...

41
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,590
What is it... What time is it right now?

42
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,129
Hello.

43
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:35,400
Kian84 is awake.

44
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,170
So...

45
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,469
(Letting out a laugh)

46
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:40,840
- We are in Madagascar.
- Why do I feel so anxious?

47
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,040
(- Be careful of spoilers.
- There he goes again.)

48
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,840
- Okay. Next person.
- Yes. Dex...

49
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,010
I think Kian84 must have
a lot he wants to talk about,

50
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,480
but he gave away so many spoilers
during the last live stream.

51
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,250
- Hello. I'm Dex.
- Did you sleep well?

52
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,790
- I slept well.
- How are you feeling?

53
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,189
I'm feeling good,
but my face is very puffy.

54
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,060
You must not know
what a true puffy face is.

55
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,129
This is what you call a puffy face.

56
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,459
(Laughing)

57
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,500
(Okay. Next person.)

58
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,870
Hello.

59
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,599
Your hair looks cool, Si Eon.

60
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,139
(Si Eon's surprise first greeting)

61
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,969
Everyone!

(Greeting the viewers
with too much excitement)

63
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,770
Kian84. Dex.

64
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,979
- Let's say goodbye one last time.
- Okay.

65
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,250
- I have to go now. There's no time.
- Go where?

66
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,580
Oh, the zoo?

67
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,879
(What a nice spoiler...)

68
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,789
Si Eon. Move.

69
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,520
- It wasn't me this time.
- Gosh.

70
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,530
Why did you do that? I just stopped Kian84
from giving away spoilers.

71
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,330
- Oh, I'm sorry. Gosh.
- Anyway, we...

72
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,960
Please give Adventure by Accident 3
lots of love.

73
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,469
This season will be even more fun.
I promise.

74
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,069
How was it for you all?
It'll be a fun season, right?

75
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:44,500
Can I just give away one thing?

76
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:46,340
- We kind of...
- No!

77
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,340
This has been Adventure by Accident.

78
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,840
Thank you!

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,080
(Since the season is over,)

80
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,379
(we'll give you all...)

81
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,310
(of the unreleased footage.)

82
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,310
(Hard drive)

83
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,349
(Being born...)

84
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,219
(was a surprise?)

85
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,289
I arrived in Madagascar.

86
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,289
Let's get one World Cola.

87
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:07,460
I wanted to have one.

88
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,460
(Getting local cola as soon as he arrives)

89
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,330
They don't sell Inca Kola here, right?

90
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,469
(A special treat
during the South America trip)

91
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,000
There's no cola.

92
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:20,469
(A yellow drink catches his eye)

93
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:21,909
Is this antifreeze?

94
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:23,840
I'll have one of these.

95
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
(He doesn't know what it is,
but he'll get it.)

96
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
I don't know what it is.

97
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,479
It says there is vitamin C in here,

98
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,050
so I don't think it's antifreeze.

99
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,090
Oh, my.

100
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,189
Oh, no.

101
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,560
(He spotted another drink
that appealed to him.)

102
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,759
They have Sprite.

103
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,060
(A drink that appears to be Sprite
in the row below)

104
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,159
Yujo.

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,259
I wonder how much it is.

106
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,740
(Purchasing 1 drink)

107
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,770
(Handing over money)

108
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,669
(Kian84's first transaction in Africa)

109
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,669
Thank you.

110
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,740
It was 5,000 ariaries. That means...

111
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,319
A bottle of drink is
about 1 dollar and 80 cents.

112
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:08,520
In terms of beverages, the prices
are the same, whether you're in...

113
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,949
India, Korea, or Peru.

114
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:12,389
They're all the same.

115
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,470
We will head from Antananarivo,
the capital of Madagascar,

116
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,410
to Moldodava? Moldovada?

117
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,170
Yes. We will go to Moldovada, the beach.

118
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,439
I think...

119
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:35,810
it might be the Jebudo Island
of Madagascar.

120
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,720
I'll get going.

121
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,519
(Heading to Morondava feeling excited)

122
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,790
Lots of rain. Lots of thunderstorms.

123
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:47,689
I'm not comfortable
about going through there.

124
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,629
Let's go tomorrow.

125
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,329
They say it's dangerous.

126
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Thank you.

127
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,699
(Kian84's first meal in Antananarivo)

128
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Thank you.

129
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,569
(Ramyeon in lots of broth)

130
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,339
(Glancing over)

131
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,910
(After filling his stomach
with half rain and half soup,)

132
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,879
(Kian84 hurries back
to the lodging they booked.)

133
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,220
What? Is this a bar on the street?

134
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:17,459
Excuse me.

135
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,160
Whiskey?

136
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:24,399
Let's see...

137
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:26,800
Vodka and whiskey?

138
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,899
Do you have?

139
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,970
(Are you not the owner?)

140
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,870
- Over there.
- What? Is the owner someone else?

141
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,509
Are you not the owner?

142
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,279
Oh, there's the owner.

143
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,649
Oh, yes. Whiskey?

144
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:44,819
(The owner is here.)

145
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:46,180
What whiskey?

146
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,319
- Whiskey?
- Yes.

147
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,050
A shot?

148
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,019
Shot? Yes.

149
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:57,360
Oh, this?

150
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,300
(Interested)

151
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,500
How much?

152
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,300
Seven thousand...

153
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Seven thousand...

154
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,370
Everyone.

155
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,879
I found hard liquor
cheaper than Napoleon V.

156
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:18,480
This must be about 2.2 dollars.

157
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,519
Okay.

158
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,250
(A clean transaction)

159
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,290
What is this called?

160
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,459
Madagascar rum?

161
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,459
(Yes)

162
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,529
(He's about to leave after paying,)

163
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,370
(but the owner seems to have something
he wants to say?)

164
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,910
Okay.

165
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,810
What did he say?

166
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,209
He asked for 1,000 ariaries more
for the cost of the bottle.

167
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,750
I see.

168
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:52,120
Okay. This, I'll take. Okay.

169
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,750
Here are 1,000 ariaries. Okay. Understand.

170
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,990
Thank you.

171
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,889
Oh, the bottle costs 1,000 ariaries?

172
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,060
I guess some people bring bowls
and just buy the alcohol.

173
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,160
Anyway, let's go.

174
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,600
(Walking down the dark street
with rum in his hand)

175
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,970
Oh, this feels like the Hongik University
of Madagascar.

176
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,069
How cool.

177
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,670
Some food to have with my drink.

178
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,970
(Spotting a street food stall)

179
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,040
What? Fritters?

180
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,350
(Various Madagascar-style fritters)

181
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,509
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

182
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,779
This. Two.

183
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,649
Two. This. Two.

184
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,250
And...

185
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,449
(Adding an egg he didn't order)

186
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,019
Wait. I asked for this.
Why are they giving me that?

187
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,759
What? Why are they giving me that?

188
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,790
(An error in ordering)

189
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,000
(Oh, not that one...)

190
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,500
Here. This.

191
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:44,600
That...

192
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,670
Oh, I guess I eat them together.

193
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:50,310
And this. One.

194
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,339
And this. One.

195
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,550
(Swallowing his saliva)

196
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,120
- And this. Two.
- Two?

197
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,420
(Buying lots of fritters
since he already bought some alcohol)

198
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,819
(Appetizing)

199
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,959
I'm takeout. Takeaway.

200
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,160
To go.

201
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,430
- How much?
- Ariary.

202
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,500
What?

203
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,800
What's going on? From his reaction,
I feel like they're asking for too much.

204
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,939
How much?

205
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,009
(Write it here for me.)

206
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,040
(Whispering)

207
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,910
Hey, they're talking to each other.

208
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,879
Oh, don't rip me off.

209
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,779
(10,000 ariaries)

210
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,019
Three dollars?

211
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:37,090
(About 3 dollars?)

212
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,159
(Whatever price they asked for,)

213
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,460
(he always said okay.)

214
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,259
(When there's no change,)

215
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,299
(he considers it a tip.)

216
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,830
(Kian84 is a magnanimous customer
with zero negotiation skills.)

217
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,029
Three dollars?

218
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,139
(Will he be different on his third trip?)

219
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:55,570
(Our friend next to Kian84
is nervous too.)

220
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:57,279
Okay. Let's just pay for it.

221
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,080
So about 3.3 dollars?

222
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,450
(Another magnanimous purchase)

223
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,379
Okay. Thank you.

224
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
(He bought
about 3 dollars' worth of fritters.)

225
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,549
It was 3 dollars and 30 cents.

226
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,789
The prices are lower here.

227
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:13,620
I do think they kind of ripped me off
for the noodles too,

228
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,759
but it's still cheap.

229
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,860
(Back at his lodging)

230
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,870
(Unexpectedly spending
1 night in Antananarivo)

231
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,639
A two-dollar vodka.

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,769
And three dollars of noodles and fritters.

233
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,980
(Opening the rum first)

234
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:39,779
(How does Madagascar rum taste?)

235
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,360
(Another sip)

236
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,289
Oh, my.

237
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:48,789
(Madagascar rum gets a pass.)

238
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,700
(Now, it's time to try the fritters.)

239
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,899
(Naturally eating with his hands)

240
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:55,970
(Sniffing)

241
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,000
This is...

242
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,200
(Naturally eating with his hands)

243
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,639
(On the 1st trip in South America,)

244
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,539
(and also on the 2nd trip to India,)

245
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,779
(he ate with his hands
without hesitation.)

246
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,580
(It feels weird
if he doesn't eat with his hands now.)

247
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,919
The potato one is good.

248
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,620
(Wiping his oily hands on his clothes)

249
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,220
(Stopping to suddenly smell his shoes...)

250
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,730
(Sniffing)

251
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,730
(The intense smell of his feet
stimulates his appetite?)

252
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,870
(Eating)

253
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,000
(Wiping)

254
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
(Eating)

255
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,870
(Wiping)

256
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,539
(Eating)

257
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:36,970
(Wiping)

258
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,039
(Eating one last bite)

259
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,049
(Putting it away for now)

260
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,679
(Looking around)

261
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,750
(He suddenly takes out a notebook.)

262
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,620
Let's see...

263
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,759
(Okay. I've decided!)

264
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,230
(He's starting to draw something?)

265
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,230
(On his first night in South America,)

266
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,330
(he drew the tough time he had
during his flight.)

267
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,470
(On his first night in India,)

268
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,610
(he drew the young men in Varanasi
that helped him find the hotel.)

269
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,039
(What will he draw today?)

270
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,179
(The object in his drawing is...)

271
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:18,519
(A rainy sky?)

272
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,419
(As soon as Kian84 arrived in Madagascar,)

273
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,090
(he was greeted by lightning.)

274
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:24,960
(Lightning strikes)

275
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,919
(Even after he arrived in the city,)

276
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,259
(there was thunder and lightning.)

277
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,299
(His first record of Madagascar
will be...)

278
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,870
Okay.

279
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,429
(The memories he had with the lightning)

280
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,639
(Hoping for good weather
for the remainder of the trip...)

281
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,769
Beautiful.

282
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,009
It's complete.

283
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,809
"Adventure by Accident Season Three."

284
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,379
"Hoping for no rain
every day of the trip."

285
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:54,419
I'm done drawing.
Now I'll head to bed soon...

286
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,490
since I have to wake up
at 3:30 a.m. tomorrow.

287
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,059
We had a slight change of plans,

288
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,259
but that's what traveling is all about.

289
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,929
I'll eat a bit more, then head to bed.

290
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,759
(Goodnight)

291
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,269
(If our plans hadn't changed,)

292
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,570
(this wouldn't have been drawn either!)

293
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,500
(Adventure by Accident Season 3!
October 18. Hoping for no rain.)

294
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,610
(But his wish didn't come true...)

295
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,480
(Diving into the bed in clothes
that are still wet from the rain)

296
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,610
(Pani Bottle: What are you up to, Kian84?
Is it tough there?)

297
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,720
(Dex: I miss you, Kian84.)

298
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,019
Where is this?

299
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:28,450
(Where are you guys now?)

300
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,019
(Pani Bottle: We're at Han River.
Dex: Try to guess by the picture, Kian84.)

301
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,490
They're in Madagascar.

302
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,929
Wait. If they were here,
they would've said so.

303
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:40,399
(Are you in Varanasi?)

304
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,509
(Pani Bottle and Dex
are currently in Varanasi?)

305
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,039
But Varanasi does look like this at night.

306
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,509
The width of the river
is a bit short there too.

307
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,580
- I see.
- And the two sides of the river...

308
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,009
have completely different atmospheres.

309
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,679
(Varanasi is famous for its
beautiful night view of the Ganges River.)

310
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,019
It feels nice to be here.

311
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:05,590
Right. It always feels nice
to be out here.

312
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,460
(The Seine River in Paris, France)

313
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:13,500
That place is pretty.

314
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,500
- Oh, what is this?
- What is this?

315
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,269
(Dex and Pani Bottle have a layover
in Paris on their way to Madagascar.)

316
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,139
Parisians really do dress well.

317
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,909
Like the people in coats.

318
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,779
(Observing Parisian fashionistas)

319
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:28,649
- They dress very gently.
- Right.

320
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,309
(Looking fashionable)

321
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,519
We should start seeing some restaurants.

322
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:36,389
If you see any restaurant you like,
we can eat there.

323
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,090
You can just stop and tell me
which restaurant you want to eat at.

324
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,159
Okay.

325
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,659
There are a lot of Asian restaurants.

326
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,059
I see Japanese and Vietnamese restaurants.

327
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,700
(They end up in the alley
of Asian restaurants.)

328
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,259
But...

329
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,570
we're in Paris.
Isn't eating Asian food kind of lame?

330
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,100
(Even before arriving in Paris,)

331
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,210
(Pani Bottle and Dex looked forward
to food in Paris.)

332
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,240
(I want to have an authentic pasta dish
from France.)

333
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,379
This must be that alley.

334
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,710
The alley with a lot of Asian restaurants.

335
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,379
What is this?

336
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,620
(He stops at a Korean restaurant.)

337
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,289
Pick the restaurant you want.

338
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:09,350
I'm good with anything.

339
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,820
(Then let's go inside.)

340
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:13,789
Hello.

341
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:14,830
(They enter a Korean restaurant.)

342
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,789
We walked around,
but we ended up at a Korean restaurant.

343
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,029
(They're Korean to the bones.)

344
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:19,159
This is crazy.

345
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,000
One order of the fried dumplings,

346
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,269
one order of kimchi jeon,

347
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,169
one order of tteokbokki,

348
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:27,610
one order of spicy stir-fried pork,
one order of kimchi stew,

349
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,169
and one bowl of jjajangmyeon. Perfect.
And we need more food.

350
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,539
One beer.

351
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,309
And one bottle of makgeolli.

352
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:35,210
- Can we finish everything?
- Four cans of Zero Coke.

353
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,110
- Zero Coke? Four?
- Yes. Four.

354
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,419
(Ordering a feast of Korean food)

355
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,720
Gosh. You would've been so disappointed
if we didn't come to a Korean restaurant.

356
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,149
I'm going to satisfy my last cravings...

357
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,419
for Korean food here tonight.

358
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:48,559
(Their last supper begins in earnest.)

359
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,129
(Having a heap of rice)

360
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:54,500
(Slurping)

361
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,929
(Crunchy)

362
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,240
(Steaming hot)

363
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,769
This is crazy. It's so tasty.

364
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,639
(This is what I'm talking about.)

365
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,710
(Cheers)

366
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,840
(They have a Korean feast in France.)

367
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,080
(Happily shaking his head)

368
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,980
Check out what Kian84 is doing now.

369
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,950
I bet this is what he's doing now.

370
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,779
(Hitting the spot)

371
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,649
Is he having a glass of whisky
at a bar or something?

372
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,019
(That's correct.)

373
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,190
I bet he bought some food and liquor
and ate them in a hotel room.

374
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:22,730
I bet he bought a bottle of hard liquor.

375
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,830
And here's the important part.

376
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,429
The room probably has
a table or side table.

377
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:26,529
He won't sit on the chairs.

378
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,700
- He would sit on the floor.
- He'd sit on the floor.

379
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:29,629
That's Kian84 for you.

380
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:33,669
(They have become three brothers
who know everything about each other.)

381
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,139
Now that we're drinking,

382
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,679
let's have a heart-to-heart conversation.

383
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,940
Have you been busy lately in Korea?

384
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,639
- Before the trip?
- Yes.

385
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,610
- Because...
- You want me to be honest? I was so busy.

386
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:44,779
I was extremely busy.

387
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:47,149
Because you were so busy,

388
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:48,820
did you experience any signs of burnout?

389
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,990
I'm already experiencing a burnout.

390
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,320
- Already?
- Yes.

391
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:56,759
But I think it has to do
with my personality too.

392
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,230
- I didn't star on a lot of shows.
- Right.

393
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,700
So I never felt burned out
from starring on TV shows.

394
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,029
But I got burned out from traveling.

395
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,399
- From traveling.
- Yes.

396
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,169
That's the thing. Traveling...

397
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:07,440
became work now.

398
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,940
I thought I would never experience this.

399
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,980
I loved traveling so much that
I wouldn't get burned out from it.

400
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,379
But the type of trip I want...

401
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,850
and the type of trip people want to watch
didn't align.

402
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,279
So I got burned out.

403
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,580
What's the type of trip you want to go on?

404
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,850
- Me? Just doing whatever I want.
- Yes.

405
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,389
Let's say I'm in Paris.

406
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,289
I feel lazy,
so I don't want to do anything.

407
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,190
- Instead of going out?
- I would stay at the hotel.

408
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,100
- To me, that's also traveling.
- Yes.

409
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,299
As for the time
I have left in Korea in 2023,

410
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,230
it's fewer than two weeks.

411
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,370
- Really?
- Yes.

412
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,970
I'll have to keep traveling after this.

413
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:41,340
I'm already booked out for the year.

414
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,070
- As for this year,
- You don't have any free days.

415
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,110
all of my days are booked.

416
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,909
- You know, we should be grateful.
- Totally. I'm so grateful.

417
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:49,179
People want to work with us.

418
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,779
But it's hard not to feel burned out
despite knowing that.

419
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:52,779
(They are grateful to be loved
despite their busy schedules.)

420
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:54,220
We ought to overcome it.

421
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,919
As for the members of our show,

422
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:57,789
you, Kian84, and me,

423
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,190
we weren't popular in the beginning.

424
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:02,759
Yes. You're right.

425
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,460
It's not like we started our careers
as an elite group.

426
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,430
When Kian84 wasn't doing well
as a webtoon artist...

427
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,529
I know the kind of life he had.

428
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,500
- I knew you were on "Toy Soldiers."
- Right.

429
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,569
You weren't as famous as now.

430
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,140
- I know how it had been for you then.
- You do.

431
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,180
You know how it had been.

432
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,380
Of course, I wasn't famous at all.

433
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,710
I think that might be why
the viewers love...

434
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,819
the combination of the cast.
That crossed my mind.

435
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,250
People who had a hard time
in the beginning are on this show.

436
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,960
You're right.

437
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:38,900
Seriously. We destroyed this meal.

438
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,029
(The food is gone.)

439
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,769
Seriously. I'm so full.

440
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,369
What do you say?
We should go to the Louvre.

441
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,210
Forget about the Louvre.

442
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:51,039
(They had a productive day in Paris.)

443
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,079
(The Seine)

444
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,539
(The strong man)

445
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,579
(The next day)

446
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,079
(The airport lounge while making
a transfer to go to Madagascar)

447
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,890
(Dex is spotted
playing a game against a kid.)

448
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,690
(The kid, Dex)

449
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,089
(Ruthlessly kicking the kid's character)

450
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,700
(Chuckling)

451
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,059
This is the bitter taste of life.

452
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:16,200
(The kid's character is knocked out.)

453
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,339
(I'm leaving.)

454
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,599
(Laughing)

455
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,670
(Glancing)

456
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,539
(A triumph mixed with shame)

457
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:25,640
I won.

458
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,109
(The kid leisurely leaves.)

459
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,779
The kid went to his parents
the moment he lost.

460
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,920
I think I need to walk away
from the scene.

461
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,019
Let's go.

462
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,519
(Making a stop in Paris was fun!)

463
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,390
(Hello, My Friends from Madagascar)

464
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:46,059
(In the meantime,
Kian84 met some Vezo people.)

465
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,500
(After struggling with spearfishing,)

466
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,569
(he revealed a wild side of himself
he had never shown before.)

467
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,299
(The local guy was shocked.)

468
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,869
(They come back to the land side
of Belo sur Mer.)

469
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:57,309
(They're going to the market
to buy ingredients for dinner.)

470
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:58,880
(His local friend, Florant)

471
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,210
(Hello)

472
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,650
- What? Your friend?
- Yes.

473
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,680
- Your friend?
- Yes.

474
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,079
(See you later.)

475
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,119
(Greeting)

476
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,150
Hello.

477
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:12,660
(Like the zoomer,
he says hi to his friend from the area.)

478
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,460
(We're here.)

479
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,490
Gosh, this is a market.

480
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,430
(Welcome to the market.)

481
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,859
This is a market.

482
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:24,069
(A small market is set up
on the sandy beach.)

483
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,210
(There's an abundance
of freshly caught fish...)

484
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,309
(and fruits.)

485
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,480
(Belo sur Mer Market)

486
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,009
(Fascinated)

487
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:41,920
What's going on?

488
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,190
The ladies are angry.

489
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,460
They're talking, but they sound so angry.

490
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:49,329
(Surprised)

491
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:50,329
What's this?

492
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:51,660
(Mangos and grilled fish)

493
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,730
Fish.

494
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,500
(Rice)

495
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:56,930
(Charisma)

496
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,369
(Oh, right.)

497
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:02,210
Where can I buy a toothbrush,
toothpaste, and a razor?

498
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,710
(The night before)

499
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,980
Oh, the toothpaste.

500
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,509
I forgot to bring
a toothbrush and toothpaste.

501
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:12,250
(He nonchalantly rinses his mouth
with water.)

502
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,079
(Feeling refreshed)

503
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,990
Are you looking for a brush?

504
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,250
(Right here.)

505
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,359
No, not that kind of a brush.

506
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,089
(A huge brush)

507
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,559
Does he only sell one?

508
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,160
(Luckily, he also sells small brushes.)

509
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,599
(He buys a toothbrush.)

510
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,660
(He also gets the toothpaste.)

511
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:29,230
A toothbrush and toothpaste cost a dollar.

512
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,269
(A toothbrush and toothpaste,
equivalent to 1 dollar)

513
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:31,339
Thank you.

514
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,700
Let's go.

515
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,710
Will this be enough fish
for our dinner later?

516
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,839
One bunch of fish.

517
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,240
Should we buy these too just in case?

518
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,380
(Well...)

519
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,579
Do you not like them?

520
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,049
No?

521
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:46,079
You don't like them?

522
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,420
What do you like?
Then what about these? Good?

523
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,420
What do you say? Good?

524
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,819
Okay. I'll buy them.

525
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,859
That many fish cost 10,000 ariaries.

526
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,130
(They cost about 3 dollars.)

527
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,930
They're cheap.

528
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:01,130
Okay?

529
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,130
(Spotting something)

530
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,599
Why are these sweet potatoes so big?

531
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:06,400
Check them out. They're sweet potatoes?

532
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,039
(Huge sweet potatoes from Madagascar)

533
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,640
This too. Yes.

534
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,410
(2 of the huge sweet potatoes
cost about 60 cents.)

535
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,480
The sweet potatoes...

536
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
(It's on the house.)

537
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,079
Okay.

538
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,150
They are the biggest sweet potatoes
I've seen in my life.

539
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,279
(Her generosity is befitting
of the huge sweet potatoes.)

540
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,390
(They're really done shopping
for groceries.)

541
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,390
(Oh, right!)

542
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,390
I almost forgot the most important one.

543
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:30,059
Well, where can I buy some liquor?

544
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:33,359
(It's that way.)

545
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,730
Let's go.
It could've been awful if I forgot.

546
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,470
We're having a party tonight.

547
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,609
We could have ended up having
only fish and sweet potatoes.

548
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,039
Okay. What's the total?

549
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,039
(They also buy liquor.)

550
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,549
I got them. Okay.

551
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,079
(They're finally done shopping.)

552
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,750
Let's go.

553
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,880
(They head over to Florant's house
for the dinner party.)

554
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,920
(Hello)

555
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,049
A photo.

556
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:57,690
A photo.

557
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,420
Hey. Why are you...

558
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,519
(Is this the kid version of Yerpe?)

559
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,990
A photo.

560
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:04,329
(He twirls away.)

561
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,529
(They arrive at Florant's house.)

562
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:12,299
(The dinner is being prepared.)

563
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,299
Do you wear hats?

564
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,170
This is really rare.

565
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,809
It's a limited-edition hat
of a fashion brand...

566
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:20,240
a famous Korean rapper launched.

567
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,750
Do you want to put this on?

568
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,250
(Impressed)

569
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,519
You look like a rapper from Madagascar.

570
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,259
Do you like it? Do you want to keep it?
Thank you.

571
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,059
That's a really precious hat.

572
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,529
(Smiling)

573
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:37,859
Do you wear socks?

574
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,329
(Barefoot)

575
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:41,400
Okay.

576
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,200
I have a canoe. Do you want to go see it?

577
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,539
I want to show it to him.

578
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,369
- Your boat?
- Yes.

579
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,180
Okay. Let's go.

580
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
Did you make it?

581
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,849
- Yes.
- Gosh. Good.

582
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,980
He's got skills.

583
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,150
(How will the canoe he built look?)

584
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,220
(It's over there.)

585
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,220
That's the boat.

586
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,589
(Impressed)

587
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,730
Did you build this on your own?

588
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,599
(Florant built it solely on his own.)

589
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,339
(The craftsmanship is good enough that
he can even take it out to the water now.)

590
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,009
(He just has to paint it now.)

591
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,880
Did you name your boat?

592
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,849
Titiabasua?

593
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:31,279
Titiabasua? What does it mean?

594
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:34,319
It means "love for my family."

595
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,019
Then will you fish
and make a lot of money?

596
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:39,119
Yes.

597
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,160
(Let's see.)

598
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,829
Then...

599
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,759
why don't I...

600
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,900
You know, I'm an artist...

601
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,140
in Korea.

602
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,839
So...

603
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,640
I would like to draw something
on the boat for you.

604
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,339
I would like to wish you safety
on the water and bountiful catch of fish.

605
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,480
Can I draw you something?

606
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:04,109
- Yes.
- Are you cool with that?

607
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,849
I'll draw something cool tomorrow morning.

608
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,319
If you don't like it, you can cover it up.

609
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:11,720
(Laughing)

610
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,859
Then should I go and buy some paint?

611
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,660
Yes. Okay. Let's go.

612
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,559
Gosh. This place is so cool at night.

613
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,529
Do you have any design in mind?

614
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,900
A big whale.

615
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,170
- A big whale?
- Yes.

616
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,970
That's romantic.

617
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:35,609
(As they walk in the village...)

618
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,349
Hello.

619
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:40,549
Hello. Any paint?

620
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,819
- Paint?
- Paint.

621
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,460
I see. Are there any colors you want?

622
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,190
Green. What else?

623
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,529
(Yellow, green, white, and red)

624
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:55,269
Green, white, and red.

625
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,529
And black?

626
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,869
- Yes.
- That's black? You already picked it.

627
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:02,769
You're milking this chance.

628
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,170
Nice. I like your attitude.

629
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:06,809
That's 180,000 ariaries.

630
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,109
Hold on. How much is that in dollars?

631
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,880
That's about 50 dollars.

632
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,619
Okay.

633
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:19,190
(He purchases the paint
without bargaining the price.)

634
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,460
Loha, catch a lot of fish.

635
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:27,130
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

636
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:30,730
No freebies?

637
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,769
Come on.
Give me one more brush as a freebie.

638
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,140
I'll give it to you next time
as a present.

639
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:40,009
Gosh. She's a good businesswoman.

640
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,180
Okay. Thank you.

641
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,279
Thank you.

642
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,920
Let's go.

643
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,019
Thank you.

644
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,150
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

645
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,559
(That's how they drew
the whale together on the boat.)

646
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:01,200
(Although they couldn't communicate
in the same language,)

647
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,839
(being with each other became
more natural than being alone.)

648
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,910
(As he rooted for Florant's future,)

649
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,609
(Kian84 drew a whale on the boat.)

650
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:15,609
That looks cute.

651
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,980
(Florant will be smiling
just like the whale on the boat.)

652
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,250
(After saying goodbye to Florant,)

653
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,190
(he came back to Morondava.)

654
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:27,420
(He united with the two brothers
he had missed.)

655
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,289
Why am I so happy to see you guys?

656
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,160
Nice.

657
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,470
(They are lifting
random items they see to work out.)

658
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,500
Two.

659
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,140
(Panting84)

660
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,740
(Feeling proud)

661
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,740
(After their intense workout
at the beach...)

662
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,480
Gosh. Look at him.

663
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,910
- Right.
- He elbowed the other kid.

664
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,150
(He approaches a kid.)

665
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,779
One.

666
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,950
Two. Okay.

667
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,950
One.

668
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:58,420
No. That's one.

669
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
One.

670
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,490
(An enthusiastic student shows up.)

671
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,960
One. Hey.

672
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:07,660
One, two.

673
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:11,400
(The second student catches up fast.)

674
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:13,269
(Giggling)

675
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,140
Well done.

676
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,579
(The first student shows up again.)

677
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,609
(He's showing off his flexibility.)

678
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,349
How to...

679
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:27,920
(Let me join you.)

680
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,049
(They dive backward together.)

681
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,019
(Trying hard)

682
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:38,529
(They're loving it.)

683
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:39,859
Good.

684
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,769
(Sweet Dex is popular among kids.)

685
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:44,000
Gosh. The kids have well-defined abs.

686
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:46,269
- Good.
- Okay. Ready.

687
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,339
(It's time to go and see
the baobab trees.)

688
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,039
Gosh. This is nice.

689
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,009
Let's go.

690
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,250
(They will finally get to see
the long-awaitedbaobab trees in person.)

691
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,950
I'm really curious about the baobab trees.

692
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,279
I'm looking forward to them.

693
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,589
Should we guess the height?

694
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:05,589
Let's guess the height
of the longest tree.

695
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,589
- The longest tree...
- Then I'll go with 20m.

696
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:10,660
- I say 40m.
- I say 50m.

697
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,329
- Fifty? Gosh. That means...
- Well...

698
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:14,900
I bet they rarely die. They can live
for thousands of years and on.

699
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,700
Right.

700
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,299
(Should I have picked
a higher number then?)

701
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:21,640
Gosh.

702
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,339
(The mecca of baobab trees...)

703
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,579
(finally came into view.)

704
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,990
(The history for the thousands of years
is evident...)

705
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,259
(in the biggest habitat of baobab trees
in the world.)

706
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,140
(Every moment is accompanied
by a different view of Mother Nature.)

707
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:55,970
(And such beauty unfolds here.)

708
00:28:57,339 --> 00:29:02,349
(Baobab Avenue)

709
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,650
- A photo. Yes.
- Should the three of us take a photo...

710
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,880
- before we go?
- Let's take a picture before we go.

711
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,289
- Excuse me. A picture, please.
- Can you take a picture of us?

712
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,990
- You should be in the middle.
- Okay.

713
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,960
Right here. The light is...

714
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,730
- I see. This way?
- Yes.

715
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,190
- Okay. This way.
- I see. This way.

716
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,329
(The three baobab-tree-loving brothers
are painted by the sunset.)

717
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,940
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

718
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,200
- What?
- Sorry?

719
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,609
Are you actors?

720
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:30,509
- Well...
- Yes. He's like an actor.

721
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:32,309
- Yes.
- A Korean actor.

722
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,240
- Okay.
- Thank you. Where are you from?

723
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,009
I'm from Morondava. From here.

724
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:37,849
- Really? Okay.
- Morondava.

725
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,819
Are you a guide or just visiting here?

726
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:42,019
We work here.

727
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,519
Are you a movie actor?

728
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,960
No. He's a YouTuber. And then...

729
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,759
- YouTuber.
- A famous YouTuber.

730
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,289
We keep telling them
about each other's fame.

731
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,200
- He's famous.
- He's...

732
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,230
- He's famous in Korea.
- Yes.

733
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,430
- And he's famous on a streaming website.
- Really?

734
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,640
- No.
- Really?

735
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
Yes. Really.

736
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,869
- You can find him on the website.
- Yes.

737
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,839
Is he famous? Your friend?

738
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,680
- He's so handsome.
- Very handsome.

739
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,410
- Is he an actor?
- He's a Spanish actor.

740
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:10,180
- A Spanish actor? Really?
- Spanish?

741
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,119
- A Spanish actor.
- Hello.

742
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:15,349
I work in Spain and Madagascar.

743
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,250
Are you from Spain?

744
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:19,990
Yes. My mother is from Spain,
and my father is from here.

745
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,059
- I see.
- I see. He's in his hometown.

746
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,029
Are you a famous man?

747
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,730
- I'm not famous. But I'm trying.
- When did it get turned off?

748
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,829
You're trying. I see. That's right.

749
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,369
How about this? Maybe,

750
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:34,170
after this video gets uploaded,

751
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,039
you'll be famous in Korea.

752
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:38,940
- Yes.
- Okay?

753
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:41,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

754
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,680
- Gosh. He knows Korean.
- Yes.

755
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,880
Correct.

756
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,680
So you do YouTube videos?

757
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,650
- Yes.
- He's a YouTuber.

758
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,220
A famous YouTuber.

759
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,019
- I want to see it.
- I'll show you. Okay.

760
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:53,559
- Yes. Show them.
- Yes.

761
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:56,289
I should make business cards
with the address for my channel.

762
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,700
I'm starting to make videos now.

763
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,400
- Really?
- Here in Madagascar.

764
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,000
What is... Could you type here?

765
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,430
- Okay.
- Okay.

766
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,240
(He shares his channel address
with the aspiring YouTuber.)

767
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:07,339
Pani Bottle is popular abroad.

768
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,569
And I. There's a space,
and then type "Bottle."

769
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,410
- "Bottle."
- Pani Bottle.

770
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,349
- On YouTube?
- Yes.

771
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:18,279
I see. People all over the world
love meeting celebrities.

772
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,750
- I think you are...
- Let's see.

773
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,990
- doing well on YouTube. Yes.
- Yes.

774
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,920
- Very handsome.
- Thank you.

775
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,289
- Do you have an Instagram page?
- Yes. I think so.

776
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:31,430
Okay. I'll follow you.

777
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,859
(I'm envious.)

778
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:35,200
Can we take a selfie?

779
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,799
- Yes. Sure.
- Sure. Yes.

780
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,200
(Recording a moment
with new friends on Baobab Avenue)

781
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,170
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

782
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:43,869
Can you take another picture of us?

783
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,839
- The three of us together?
- One last picture.

784
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,509
(They take one more picture
before the sun goes down.)

785
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,349
Thank you so much.

786
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,710
- Thank you.
- Yes.

787
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,150
(They enjoyed the sunset on Baobab Avenue
with new friends.)

788
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:54,680
The sky looks beautiful.

789
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,549
- I think this is the view.
- Yes.

790
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,490
Gosh. This is nice.

791
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,529
(They're feeling sentimental.)

792
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,029
Gosh. The backlight and the trees...

793
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,339
Anyway, I think I won the bet.

794
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,599
- What bet?
- I said it was 20m.

795
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,839
- It's 30m tall.
- Gosh. It's only 20m tall.

796
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,240
- Just 20m?
- No.

797
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,710
- Kian84.
- We said it had to be the tallest one.

798
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,180
I said it had to be the tallest one.
My guess was 30m.

799
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,079
- The tallest one among here?
- It has to be over 30m.

800
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,809
But your guess was 40m. My guess was 50m.

801
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,950
(The three of them had a bet
on the height of the tallest tree.)

802
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,289
(He gave a moderate number.)

803
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:32,220
(Kian84 made a bold guess.)

804
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,289
(Dex made a reckless guess.)

805
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,089
- I think Pani Bottle won this bet.
- But...

806
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:37,589
- Let me win one bet.
- Pani Bottle.

807
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:38,700
It will be over 30m.

808
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,059
If it goes over 30m,
I'll accept my defeat.

809
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,599
Well, you don't have to.
But the fact is, it goes over 30m.

810
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,630
- Really?
- Yes.

811
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,140
- Who won and lost?
- Right.

812
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,140
- That's important.
- That's important.

813
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,869
I'm curious about the victor of this bet.

814
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:50,509
Then my guess was the closest
to the correct answer.

815
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:53,609
- Gosh. He's so stubborn. I'm out.
- Listen.

816
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,349
Then should we get going?

817
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,650
(They put an end to this meaningless
battle of knowledge.)

818
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,279
Gosh. This is nice.

819
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,849
(The three of them had to the campsite.)

820
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:02,190
Gosh, this place is nice.

821
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,720
We can go in that way.

822
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,960
(Pani Bottle guides them to the campsite.)

823
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:09,190
Wait. Do they sell the seeds
of baobab trees here?

824
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:11,589
It's 15,000 ariaries.

825
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,200
- It's 15,000 ariaries. That's cheap.
- That's cheap.

826
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Actually...

827
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,029
Is this a baobab tree?

828
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,000
- Yes. It's a baobab tree.
- Really?

829
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,339
(He's the groundskeeper.)

830
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:20,339
(The seedlings for baobab trees)

831
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:22,769
How old are these baobab trees?

832
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:25,579
How old are these baobab trees?

833
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:30,410
- Sir.
- "How old are these baobab trees?"

834
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,380
- They're three months old.
- Two?

835
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,589
(He kindly tells his answer
with his fingers.)

836
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:38,650
Then they must be 2,000 years old.

837
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,660
(What?)

838
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,960
(No. They're about 3 months old.)

839
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,259
Gosh. They are that old?

840
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,089
- If they're 2,000 years old,
- They are way too old.

841
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,859
- are they 100 million years old?
- They are way too old.

842
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,430
- I think there was a misunderstanding.
- Right.

843
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,130
- Let's get going.
- Hey, then...

844
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:54,299
how many generations of my family
must be around to see those trees?

845
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,039
(They are 2,000 years old by accident.)

846
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,980
(The night has come.)

847
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,880
(They're pitching the tents
to camp out for the night.)

848
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,910
Gosh.

849
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:05,680
Should I ask them to give me some water?

850
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,019
(Dex walks around the village
to get some water.)

851
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:09,090
Thank you.

852
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,119
(Thank you.)

853
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,690
(He was going to ask them
for some hot water.)

854
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,059
(But the family is already eating.)

855
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:15,190
Enjoy your food.

856
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,530
(Have a nice dinner.)

857
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,130
Gosh. They're having dinner.
I should go somewhere else.

858
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,599
Gosh. It's dinnertime.

859
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,300
Everyone is having food.

860
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,639
(He goes to a different house.)

861
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,869
- Hello.
- Hello.

862
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,539
You're the driver from earlier.

863
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,349
(Giddy-up!)

864
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,519
(It was the house of the ox cart's driver
from the afternoon.)

865
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:42,190
It's nice to see you here.

866
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,090
What's that?

867
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,019
(Rice)

868
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:49,360
(They haven't had dinner yet.)

869
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,630
I need hot water.

870
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,070
(Hot water)

871
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,199
(For this!)

872
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,340
Three.

873
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,469
(Please give me some water.)

874
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,909
(Okay.)

875
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,849
(Thanks to the water
that was as warm as his heart,)

876
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:15,250
(the three of them
got to have a warm meal.)

877
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,519
If you don't mind,
can I look around the house?

878
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,860
I'm just curious.

879
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,289
Can I take a look?

880
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,559
(This is Dex's first time
at a local family's house.)

881
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:25,599
I'm curious.

882
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,000
I need to take off my shoes here.

883
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,030
(It unexpectedly turns into
a Korean housewarming party.)

884
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,199
Thank you.

885
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,539
(He politely enters the house.)

886
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:38,010
(The trees and soil from Morondava
were used...)

887
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,679
(to make up the cozy house.)

888
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,150
This is nice.

889
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,679
I have a question.

890
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,820
I would like to know
how you start the fire.

891
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,190
Can you teach me how to start the fire?
Can I try it?

892
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,389
(Is there a traditional method
that shows the wisdom of their ancestors?)

893
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:56,559
(I got it.)

894
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,260
(Anticipating)

895
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,530
I see. You use a lighter.

896
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,969
(Civilization trumps
the wisdom of their ancestors.)

897
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:08,739
Well, I thought... A lighter.

898
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,340
- A lighter?
- Yes.

899
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,880
(- I also have that.
- A lighter is the best.)

900
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,179
That was a silly question.

901
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,780
I'm good then.

902
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,650
Yes. We now have smartphones.

903
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,690
I'm the fool for thinking
they would use a traditional method.

904
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,889
(The morning after camping
on Baobab Avenue)

905
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:30,230
Gosh. They're fighting.

906
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,989
- The cows are fighting.
- The cows?

907
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,730
(The two zebu cows are butting heads.)

908
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,099
Gosh, they're fighting.

909
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,269
- It sounded like a gourd breaking.
- The sound...

910
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,809
(Cracking)

911
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,039
- It sounds like something is cracking.
- Gosh.

912
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:48,280
The goats are watching them fight.

913
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,750
(The flock of goats came out to watch.)

914
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,780
- The goats.
- The goats too.

915
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,119
(It's fun to watch them in the front row.)

916
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,219
They look like cartoon characters.

917
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:56,849
(They're actively watching the fight.)

918
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,260
They're cheering for the cows.

919
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,929
(Let just any cow win.)

920
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,300
It's fun to watch fights.

921
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:09,199
Back in the day, people said that...

922
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:11,230
no one could stop angry oxen.

923
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,239
Gosh, look at their eyes.

924
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,340
(Those are definitely angry eyes.)

925
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:18,670
- Gosh. This is getting serious.
- Things are getting heated. Wait.

926
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,909
(Focused on the fight)

927
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:22,239
They're so strong.

928
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:25,579
Even if the victor
will end up with wounds.

929
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:28,380
Why are they fighting
this early in the morning?

930
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,460
"You teased me and called me a pig first."

931
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:35,519
Gosh. Come on.

932
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,960
- You guys are close. What are you doing?
- You're friends. Don't fight. Hey.

933
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,659
- Talk this out. Hey.
- Hey.

934
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,199
Our teacher will come soon.
Stop it already.

935
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,269
Hey, get the teacher.
Gosh. What are you doing?

936
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:49,909
(As the black cow stirs up the dust,)

937
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:50,940
(the black cow wins.)

938
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,010
It's over.

939
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:56,250
When he knew he lost,
he quickly accepted his defeat.

940
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,579
He's alone now.

941
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,250
All right. The black one won.

942
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,320
(The winning zebu cow hangs out
with the others.)

943
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:04,090
(They're done watching the fight
that stirred up the dust.)

944
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:06,590
- Let's clean up and get going.
- Yes.

945
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:08,460
- Let's hurry back.
- Okay.

946
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,059
(Baobab Avenue was filled
with intense memories.)

947
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:11,429
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

948
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:13,500
All right.

949
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,260
(After returning
to the capital city, Antananarivo,)

950
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:19,500
(the exercisers of the pull-up bars
welcomed them.)

951
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,800
(They headed to the mecca
of muscular men, the gym.)

952
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,110
(They enter the gym.)

953
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,969
Are you a bodybuilder?

954
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,679
- A bodybuilder?
- A bodybuilder?

955
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,280
- This place is packed.
- This is so impressive.

956
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,210
- Are the muscles natural?
- This is firmly fixed.

957
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,210
Are they natural?

958
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,420
- Natural muscles?
- Natural muscles?

959
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,280
- Those are natural muscles indeed.
- His muscles look great.

960
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,289
(It's indeed the country of muscles.)

961
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,849
(Staring)

962
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,320
Should I climb up to that point?

963
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,590
(What does he want to do?)

964
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,230
Is this safe?

965
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,659
(Will he climb the ladder?)

966
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,730
(The ladder goes up all the way
to the 2nd floor of the building.)

967
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,670
If you do that, you'll get hurt.

968
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,510
I'll only climb up to that point.

969
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,840
Just a little bit.
I can't go all the way up.

970
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:01,309
Be careful.

971
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:02,380
(Charismatic Pani
bravely goes to the ladder.)

972
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,809
(Staring)

973
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,150
Gosh, hey. Be careful. Watch his legs.

974
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,550
(Pulling back)

975
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,150
(Laughing)

976
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,460
(He's trying to lift his body
with his soft arms.)

977
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,519
(Shaking)

978
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,530
(Soft Tofu Bottle falls down
without any resistance.)

979
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,789
That was really tough.

980
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,329
(Watch this.)

981
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,030
(The local training helper demonstrates.)

982
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,139
(Climbing up)

983
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:27,170
This is crazy.

984
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,610
This is the world of monsters.

985
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,639
(Just passing the entrance
is tough in Madagascar.)

986
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,309
I'll only watch them.
I won't get cheeky here.

987
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:36,610
What's the weight?

988
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,119
Each one weighs 10kg.
So the total is 60kg.

989
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,449
Maybe, it's about 70kg.

990
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,889
- It's 70kg.
- It's 70kg.

991
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:44,489
- It's 70kg. Okay.
- Kian84.

992
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:46,690
- The fight of men has begun.
- Darn it. Hey.

993
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,690
- We can't lose to them.
- Are you sure?

994
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,059
We must show it to them.

995
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,929
(They can't lose this battle
of muscular strength.)

996
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:53,460
- This weighs 70kg?
- It weighs 70kg.

997
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,630
(Let's go.)

998
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,670
(Gosh, Kian84.)

999
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:59,800
(Surprised)

1000
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,269
This weighs 70kg?

1001
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,039
(Clenching his teeth)

1002
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,840
(Screaming)

1003
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,150
- It's too heavy.
- Hey, this isn't 70kg!

1004
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,320
(Laughing)

1005
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,179
(Chuckling)

1006
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,590
- Let me try it.
- Okay.

1007
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,190
(Suit yourself.)

1008
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,489
Will he show us?

1009
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,760
(The eldest brother tries it out
since he's at the gym.)

1010
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,929
Great.

1011
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,400
(Can he lift weights?)

1012
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,599
- One.
- Are you ready?

1013
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,699
(Lifting)

1014
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:32,599
Hey, he can do it.

1015
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,639
(Impressed)

1016
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:36,909
(The old guy
is doing better than expected.)

1017
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:40,039
Five, six, seven.

1018
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,539
(He's pretty good.)

1019
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:43,710
(Surprised)

1020
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,920
- He's gotten stronger as he got older.
- Six, seven...

1021
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,219
(Lifting with all his might)

1022
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,989
(Si Eon grew tougher as he got older.)

1023
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,289
(Clapping)

1024
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,860
You still got it.

1025
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,360
(Feeling proud)

1026
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,400
(Jealous84 is motivated
to work out harder thanks to him.)

1027
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:01,829
Let's go over there.

1028
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,000
- Should we stay out?
- Gosh, my back.

1029
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,329
- We're not going to work out.
- Let's sit down.

1030
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,670
I went at it too hard.

1031
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,469
(Republic of Korea in Madagascar?)

1032
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:12,679
So this is the airport terminal.

1033
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,280
Gosh. This airport terminal reminds me...

1034
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,179
of the terminal I went
in order to visit my relatives in Yeoju.

1035
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:21,150
It reminds me of the bus terminal
in Icheon, Gyeonggi Province.

1036
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,719
- You're bringing up Yeoju again.
- There he goes again with Yeoju.

1037
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,420
He mentioned
his relatives' house early this time.

1038
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,360
There were traces of Yeoju
all over the world.

1039
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,820
(Even when he came to Antananarivo
for the first time...)

1040
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,059
This place is just like Yeoju.

1041
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:33,400
(he saw the vast rice paddies of Yeoju.)

1042
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,429
When my relatives had a block party,

1043
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,670
everyone in the village
came over like this.

1044
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,800
We cooked a whole pig.

1045
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,940
The elders came together and had a meal.

1046
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,010
(You guys did this too?)

1047
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:45,739
This culture was around
when I was in elementary school.

1048
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:47,440
- In Yeoju?
- In the countryside. Yes, in Yeoju.

1049
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,650
(He was walking along the path
with the others in the countryside.)

1050
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:52,250
No way.

1051
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:55,679
There was Yeoju...

1052
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:57,690
in Madagascar.

1053
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,889
(He mentions Yeoju again.)

1054
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,389
(The atmospheres of Korea
were hidden all over Madagascar.)

1055
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,130
"Youn's Restaurant?"

1056
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,400
(He spotted a Korean restaurant
with a familiar name in Antananarivo.)

1057
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:09,000
What? There must be
a Korea-related building here.

1058
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,130
What is this?

1059
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,570
"Trinity."

1060
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,570
(Why is there a Korean flag?)

1061
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,800
"Dreaming Library."

1062
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,739
I see. Someone from Korea
must have built a library here.

1063
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,150
- How old is this car?
- But this is cool.

1064
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:25,409
Isn't this such a classic car?

1065
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,420
(Even when they were going
to the University of Antananarivo...)

1066
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:28,980
There's a Korean car
with "beginner driver" sign.

1067
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:31,619
(A familiar "beginner driver" sign)

1068
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:33,460
Gosh, isn't that Mashimaro?

1069
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,320
That's Korean. It must have been
imported from Korea.

1070
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,389
(They followed traces of Korea...)

1071
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:41,030
(to University of Antananarivo's...)

1072
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,599
(library of books
about the Korean language.)

1073
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,300
I've never seen this before.

1074
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,269
- A workbook for proficiency in Korean.
- What's that?

1075
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,940
"Listen to the following
and choose the appropriate response."

1076
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,869
- Okay.
- "Is the apple good?"

1077
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,579
Number one, "There's no apple."

1078
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,280
Number two, "The apple is good."

1079
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,949
Number three, "The apple is expensive."

1080
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,809
Number four, "I like apples."

1081
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,280
"Is the apple good?
Yes, the apple is good." Number two.

1082
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,219
- Number two.
- I see.

1083
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:05,820
(He's proud of his fluent Korean.)

1084
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,429
(He is now in Teacher Dex mode.)

1085
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:11,530
(Look who we have here.)

1086
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:16,269
(He approaches a student
who is studying hard.)

1087
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:17,630
What year are you in?

1088
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,900
- What year of university are you in?
- I'm in...

1089
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:23,670
First year? Second year?
Third year? Fourth year?

1090
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,170
- Year?
- Yes.

1091
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,010
- Of university.
- University?

1092
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,409
- I'm in my 2nd year.
- Your 2nd year?

1093
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:29,449
- Yes.
- I see.

1094
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,079
Your Korean is great.

1095
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,519
- A little. It's not great.
- How...

1096
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:36,550
How many years
have you been studying Korean?

1097
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,760
- Two years.
- Really?

1098
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:41,519
But you're very good.

1099
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,690
You should visit Korea sometime.

1100
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,130
Yes, I want to visit in the future.

1101
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,300
- You do?
- Yes.

1102
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,500
Can I take a look at
what you've been studying?

1103
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,570
- Sure. I study...
- Yes.

1104
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:52,570
Studying Korean...

1105
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,739
What's difficult about studying Korean?

1106
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,769
- It's easy at first. Yes.
- I see.

1107
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,409
But there is so much grammar.

1108
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,710
- There's so much grammar?
- Yes.

1109
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:05,949
Well, I'm Korean,

1110
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:08,619
so I'll help you out with
the things you find difficult.

1111
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,489
- Okay.
- Show me.

1112
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:11,750
- Okay. This is my book.
- Right.

1113
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:14,719
This one is a bit tricky.

1114
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,329
- It's "eunikka" and "haeseo."
- I see.

1115
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,989
How are they different?

1116
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,429
So, "eunikka" means...

1117
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:23,429
(He's expectant.)

1118
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,170
"Eunikka" means...

1119
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,940
"myself." "Eunikka."

1120
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,570
- "Eunikka."
- Yes. But...

1121
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:31,840
with "haeseo," it's more...

1122
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,579
(Brain freeze)

1123
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:37,250
like you're talking about something
that's very close, a bit far.

1124
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:42,449
You say to a friend,
"Because I had lunch,"

1125
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:45,090
or "Since I had lunch..."

1126
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,190
- "I feel sleepy."
- "I feel sleepy."

1127
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,829
- Did that help you understand?
- Yes, thank you.

1128
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:50,989
No problem.

1129
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,730
So which part are you studying right now?

1130
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,170
(He's flustered.)

1131
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:58,429
Right here. I think that's it.

1132
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,300
- Thank you.
- Good.

1133
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:02,739
(The two arrived in Antsirabe first,
and they are having dinner.)

1134
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:04,210
What's this?

1135
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,280
It's called romazava, and it has spinach,

1136
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:10,079
- and they used chicken here.
- I see.

1137
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,679
To compare it with Korean food,
it's like...

1138
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:14,650
doenjang jjigae or kimchi jjigae.

1139
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,619
(He tastes a spoonful of it.)

1140
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:22,860
This is just like siraegi gukbap.

1141
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,199
It's as if I'm eating Korean food
all of a sudden.

1142
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,130
(Let's talk about Madagascan food.)

1143
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,599
This is just like sungnyung.

1144
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,969
- That's interesting.
- It was exactly Korean food.

1145
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,039
(Even the food they eat
on special occasions...)

1146
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:41,980
(was like the Madagascan version
of the meat stew we eat in Korea.)

1147
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:46,010
(It's fun running into Madagascan versions
of Korean food.)

1148
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,320
This tastes totally the same as gukbap.

1149
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:51,349
(He digs into the Madagascan gukbap.)

1150
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,289
(Slurping)

1151
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,190
Gosh, I...

1152
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:00,929
can't help but mix in rice.

1153
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:02,230
(He can't help but mix in rice.)

1154
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,599
(The rice makes it taste
even more like Korean food.)

1155
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,170
I'm so satisfied with this.

1156
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,610
It's so satisfying for me too.

1157
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,010
(He's even holding the bowl up
and gathering all the remaining food...)

1158
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:19,079
(to finish it off.)

1159
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,789
That was good. I'm full.

1160
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:27,320
This was exactly like Korean food.

1161
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:31,789
(All together rather than alone)

1162
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,199
(At Morondava beach,)

1163
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:37,570
(the three Madagascar brothers
had an epic swimming match.)

1164
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,969
(They're taking a minute to freshen up.)

1165
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:47,210
(Pani Bottle is freshening up
his stomach with a coconut.)

1166
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,110
(Dex is freshening up
by readjusting his swim trunks.)

1167
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,320
Pani Bottle, this is insane.
Take a look at this.

1168
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,389
What's up?

1169
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,889
What's this?

1170
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:04,190
(A fist full of sand came out
of his swim trunks.)

1171
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:06,530
- You're not pooping, are you?
- No.

1172
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,460
Wait, there's a whole lot of it in here.

1173
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,969
A whole bunch... It keeps coming out.

1174
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:16,170
(Stay tuned while we find something more
aesthetically pleasing for you to watch.)

1175
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:22,039
(He's enjoying some spare time against
an aesthetically pleasing backdrop.)

1176
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:24,809
(He's not day-drinking.)

1177
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,420
(Taking a sip)

1178
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,489
I think this will taste good.

1179
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,449
Gosh, that's a great idea.

1180
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,489
(He's a true eating show content creator.)

1181
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:35,619
This is so refreshing.

1182
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:39,329
The ice makes the orange juice
taste completely different.

1183
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,699
I didn't realize how precious ice was.

1184
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:43,329
(Gosh, that's cold.)

1185
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,130
I'm drinking way too much
liquid fructose today.

1186
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,139
(He's worried about his health.)

1187
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:51,869
(But he's still pouring down
so much liquid fructose.)

1188
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,880
Want some?

1189
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,409
No, you have it.

1190
00:47:57,449 --> 00:47:59,280
- Gosh, let's go.
- All right.

1191
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:03,090
What is this?

1192
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:05,119
What's wrong?

1193
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,019
- What's that?
- Goodness.

1194
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:08,519
Oh, my gosh.

1195
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,059
What on earth did you eat, Kian84?

1196
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:12,860
It's like seeing llamas poop.

1197
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:15,000
Llamas just drop poop, you know.

1198
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:18,469
- Goodness.
- This is what he meant.

1199
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,500
You only had a little, though.
I thought I was a pooping elephant.

1200
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,699
(Dex was almost like an elephant.)

1201
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,039
Shall we go?

1202
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:25,469
Let's go.

1203
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:27,940
Do you want to look around
and see what they have?

1204
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,849
Hey, I need cola.

1205
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,909
I needed a comb.

1206
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:34,980
(He found a store that sells
traditional combs.)

1207
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,349
I should get one in black.

1208
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:37,650
Gosh, this is nice.

1209
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:41,420
- Capri?
- This?

1210
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,559
(The two older brothers
stopped by a snack bar...)

1211
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:45,829
(to buy drinks and snacks.)

1212
00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:47,500
This is...

1213
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,469
the Morondava airport lounge.

1214
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:56,099
Are these chocolate wafers?

1215
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,969
These are barbecue-flavored.

1216
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,679
These are the chips
Pani Bottle kept talking about.

1217
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,110
I'll give it a taste.

1218
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,949
- Do you like chips, Pani Bottle?
- Yes.

1219
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,449
- Salty ones, not sweet ones.
- Why is my face like this?

1220
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:11,550
What's wrong with it?

1221
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,719
Don't you think
something's wrong with my face?

1222
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,019
You look handsome to me.

1223
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,889
What? My face? Or your face?

1224
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,260
You're so mean.
Isn't he being really mean?

1225
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,400
I wasn't...

1226
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,400
You're mean.

1227
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,230
What are you going to do
when we get to Antananarivo?

1228
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,840
They say it's election season
in Madagascar.

1229
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,769
Do you want to go see
the election campaigns of Madagascar?

1230
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:33,710
- Like go and campaign with them?
- Yes.

1231
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:34,739
You?

1232
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:35,739
(Laughing)

1233
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,250
(Since their trip to South America,)

1234
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,480
(Kian84 has had a strange bucket list.)

1235
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:44,550
(I want to come with you.)

1236
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,159
- I want to come with you.
- You want to come?

1237
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:48,260
I should come with you.

1238
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,260
(Pani Bottle always tags along,
for some strange reason.)

1239
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:56,159
(They threw Kian84 a birthday party
at a restaurant in Antananarivo.)

1240
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:03,670
(The three got drunk on excitement
and lost themselves in the songs.)

1241
00:50:05,139 --> 00:50:08,010
Gosh, singing is fun.

1242
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,849
- One more?
- One more.

1243
00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:12,380
- One more?
- One more.

1244
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,619
- This is going to be the last one.
- The way I see it...

1245
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:14,949
- "Running in the Sky," is the last one.
- It's really the last song.

1246
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:18,519
("Running in the Sky" by Lee Juck)

1247
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:21,820
I'll only sing the first verse.

1248
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:24,929
(Expectant)

1249
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,960
Yeah.

1250
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,400
(My heart pounded)

1251
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,469
Park Jae Hwan!

1252
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:34,599
(Pani Bottle's real name is Park Jae Han.)

1253
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:36,469
(Someone was chasing after me)

1254
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:38,869
(At the edge of the black cliff)

1255
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,280
(He's serious.)

1256
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,610
(There was nowhere else
to put my foot down)

1257
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,880
(I kept getting choked up)

1258
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,789
(So I desperately repeated your name)

1259
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:52,750
(In my ears rang)

1260
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,789
(Your voice full of warmth)

1261
00:50:55,789 --> 00:50:56,860
(That was my salvation)

1262
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,789
(They're cheering him on
with their chopsticks.)

1263
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:02,530
(I'm running in the dry sky)

1264
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:04,170
(He's humming along.)

1265
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,199
(If that means you will hug me
in your arms)

1266
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:14,039
(I don't care my body might break)

1267
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:18,880
(Even if I fly too close to the sun)

1268
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,320
(He's humming along.)

1269
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,619
(And both my legs melt away)

1270
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:30,329
(My heart will run toward your heart)

1271
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:33,829
(I'll keep running to you forever)

1272
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,599
- I thought you were Lee Juck.
- I'm only going to sing the first verse.

1273
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,599
(They quickly end the song.)

1274
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,340
- That was great.
- You're Pa Juck.

1275
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,300
- Pa Juck.
- That was great.

1276
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:43,769
Pa juck.

1277
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:45,769
(Si Eon and Pani Bottle are
exploring the streets of Antananarivo.)

1278
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,210
Gosh, this is amazing.

1279
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:49,409
Let's check out the food.

1280
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,210
I did want to try this one.

1281
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,420
I'll try it for you.

1282
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,449
Okay.

1283
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,119
- Hello.
- Hello.

1284
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,730
(He's ordering the food with the excuse
of trying it out for Si Eon.)

1285
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:06,230
- It's 2,000 ariaries.
- It's 2,000 ariaries.

1286
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:07,800
- It's 2 dollars?
- No, it's 50 cents.

1287
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,730
- What?
- It's 50 cents.

1288
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,570
(She's preparing
the food for him to taste.)

1289
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:16,199
It looks so delicious, though,
don't you think?

1290
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,309
(Sure)

1291
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:19,980
I'm supposed to
mix everything together, right?

1292
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,079
What?

1293
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,150
It tastes just like a salad.

1294
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:27,820
Do you know those crab salads?

1295
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,380
- It tastes like that.
- I feel like I'm watching his YouTube.

1296
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:33,420
(He starts to taste it earnestly.)

1297
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,659
(Eating)

1298
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:39,789
(He eats very well.)

1299
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,000
(He's exercising
through masticatory movement.)

1300
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,230
Okay.

1301
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,940
(He finishes one bowl alone.)

1302
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:51,510
(They returned to
the accommodation briefly to refresh.)

1303
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:54,880
(Dex is showering.)

1304
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,980
(His target)

1305
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,309
It looks tasty.

1306
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,119
(Pani Baguette eats a baguette first.)

1307
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:03,750
You eat very well.

1308
00:53:04,289 --> 00:53:05,750
The food here is delicious.

1309
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,989
You're born to travel.

1310
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,630
(A travel YouTuber calmly
prepares for an eating show.)

1311
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,599
Is the ice cream tasty?

1312
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:18,300
- Have one. It's delicious.
- It's not sherbet, right?

1313
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,500
No, it isn't.

1314
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,670
- That's a shame.
- It's made of milk fat.

1315
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,039
I don't need to eat it. Help yourself.

1316
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,980
(He resumes eating the baguette
after refusing an ice cream.)

1317
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,480
(Chewing vigorously)

1318
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,750
There's Pringles.

1319
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:33,980
Oh, it isn't. It's a different brand.

1320
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,650
(He eats his baguette first.)

1321
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:39,960
(Stands up)

1322
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:44,130
(He approaches the others quietly...)

1323
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,929
(and naturally steals their snack.)

1324
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,739
(Having a bite of a salty snack)

1325
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:57,170
(Having a bite of carbohydrates)

1326
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,739
(Amazing collaboration
of carbohydrates and salt)

1327
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:03,309
What is this? Is this a soda?

1328
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,150
(A soda?)

1329
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,619
- What?
- It's a coconut yogurt.

1330
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,679
- Oh, my.
- I'll eat it.

1331
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:13,150
(Drinking)

1332
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:15,960
(After drinking,)

1333
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,960
(he continues to fuel himself
with carbohydrates.)

1334
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,599
(He finished showering.)

1335
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,400
- Dex.
- Yes.

1336
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,900
- Have one ice cream.
- Okay.

1337
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,539
(Moisturizing)

1338
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:31,840
(I'm having water too.)

1339
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,409
(Rummaging)

1340
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:37,010
I'm in trouble. It's so delicious.

1341
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:39,650
(His appetite is speeding up very fast.)

1342
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,250
(Licking)

1343
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:47,889
(He starts his 2nd round
with an ice cream.)

1344
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,530
(He even consumes dessert heartily.)

1345
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:53,260
(10 minutes ago)

1346
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,570
What time shall we depart?

1347
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,909
After ten minutes.

1348
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,210
- Ten?
- Yes.

1349
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,280
I have ten minutes more.

1350
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:13,820
(I still have 10 minutes to eat.)

1351
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,719
You're having your lunch here.

1352
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,019
(Clean plate)

1353
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:21,719
Right?

1354
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:22,719
(His lunch is over.)

1355
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,590
(Maybe it's good to be alone sometimes?)

1356
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:29,699
(Before meeting at Antsirabe...)

1357
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:34,400
(Pani Bottle suggested traveling solo.)

1358
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,900
I agree.

1359
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,539
(The next morning)

1360
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:40,079
(They're asleep
in their separate bedrooms.)

1361
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,949
(Dex woke up the earliest.)

1362
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,550
I slept so well in the hotel.

1363
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,920
I'm going to eat the hotel breakfast.

1364
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,059
It's my first time
in Adventure by Accident.

1365
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:01,730
(The first hotel breakfast footage
in Madagascar.)

1366
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,570
The hotel breakfast looks like this.

1367
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,269
One omelet, please.

1368
00:56:06,769 --> 00:56:08,039
- Omelet.
- Omelet.

1369
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,409
I was greedy so I asked for 4 eggs.

1370
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,340
They're all in.

1371
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,139
(Morning protein)

1372
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,110
This looks tasty.
Isn't this a chocolate-flavored cereal?

1373
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:20,719
Dex.

1374
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:22,679
Dex.

1375
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,389
(Pani Bottle came down to eat breakfast
as soon as he woke up.)

1376
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:26,320
Did you have a good sleep?

1377
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,059
I fainted.

1378
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,719
Would...

1379
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:31,989
I be able to eat anything?

1380
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,389
I'm still full.

1381
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:34,429
- You don't need to eat.
- Yes.

1382
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:35,829
- I'll have a cup of coffee.
- I see.

1383
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:38,369
My breakfast is simple.

1384
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:43,909
(A simple big bowl of coffee)

1385
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,550
(Since a big bowl of coffee is
too simple...)

1386
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:54,750
The weather is very good.

1387
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,320
(He has one bite
with an excuse for good weather.)

1388
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,190
(Looking around)

1389
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:02,590
(Let's see.)

1390
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:04,530
(He has a yogurt too.)

1391
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:10,130
(He's a typical Korean.)

1392
00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:14,070
(He eats a simple yogurt too.)

1393
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:17,210
(Dex eats his omelet too.)

1394
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:21,610
(This is Pani Bottle's minimalist meal.)

1395
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,809
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1396
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:27,150
(Kian84 joins after getting ready.)

1397
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,150
Hello. Gosh, it looks delicious.

1398
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,519
You can choose how many eggs you want.

1399
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:33,989
- Did they cook the omelet for you?
- Yes.

1400
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:37,460
I need to take a shower and leave.

1401
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:39,530
Help yourself. I'll get going.

1402
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:41,000
- What?
- I don't have much time.

1403
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,659
You don't want to be with me
even a little?

1404
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,900
- There're only two seats.
- What?

1405
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,940
- Okay. Let's go.
- See you later.

1406
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,039
- See you later.
- Okay.

1407
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:50,170
I'll have a cup of coffee.

1408
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,170
(Kian84 chooses
to have a morning coffee too.)

1409
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,440
- Did you sleep well?
- I slept too well.

1410
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,409
I had a great meal.

1411
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:57,409
(Stands up)

1412
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:58,579
I had a great meal.

1413
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,519
- Hey.
- See you at Antsirabe.

1414
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:04,320
Everyone is leaving after I sat down.

1415
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,449
(It's so fun to tease him.)

1416
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:06,820
Come safely.

1417
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,360
- Okay.
- Come faster.

1418
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,960
(He's somewhat lonely.)

1419
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,989
See you at the hotel alive.

1420
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:14,130
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

1421
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:17,030
(They start traveling solo.)

1422
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,369
What's up?

1423
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:23,199
Hey.

1424
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:27,309
Do you know any traditional shops?

1425
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,710
What?

1426
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,449
I need a knife.

1427
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,250
- What?
- A knife.

1428
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:36,519
Do you know? A knife.

1429
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,420
(Slicing)

1430
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,960
I want to buy a knife.

1431
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,019
(He's confused by a foreigner
searching for a knife.)

1432
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:44,289
- I think he's looking for a bag.
- A bag?

1433
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:46,059
Is it over there?

1434
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,260
- A knife shop.
- Yes.

1435
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,969
- You can...
- Ammonite.

1436
00:58:50,969 --> 00:58:52,769
(He has an ammonite.)

1437
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,940
No, ammonite. Sorry.

1438
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,000
(He tries a new tactic
to make sales by rhyming.)

1439
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,639
- Sorry.
- It's a good price.

1440
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,010
- No.
- It's metal iron.

1441
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,139
- I don't need it.
- Lucca stone.

1442
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:03,380
- I want a knife.
- Yes.

1443
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,380
(It's there.)

1444
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,449
- Over there?
- Yes.

1445
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:06,880
(Buy this first.)

1446
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,949
I'm so sorry.

1447
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:09,519
But good price or no money to buy.

1448
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:11,150
- But I love you. It's all lies.
- No.

1449
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:13,519
This isn't easy.

1450
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,389
Can you come together?

1451
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:17,429
(He asks the boy for guidance.)

1452
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,559
How old are you?

1453
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,699
I'm 29.

1454
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:24,670
(Instead of telling his age,
the boy guides him to somewhere.)

1455
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,670
Here?

1456
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:27,699
Oh, this way?

1457
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,639
Okay. Let's go.

1458
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:32,070
(Dex follows him.)

1459
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:33,309
A knife.

1460
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,349
This is a hotel.

1461
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,210
No, a knife.

1462
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,250
(He asked for a knife,
but the boy guided him to a hotel.)

1463
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:46,320
(It's inside.)

1464
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:49,619
They're not the right people.

1465
00:59:50,389 --> 00:59:51,559
- No.
- No?

1466
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:53,760
Okay. Thank you.

1467
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,400
Bye.

1468
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:58,670
We were looking for...

1469
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,199
different things,

1470
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,840
so we said goodbye.

1471
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:06,110
I'll travel alone.

1472
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,639
(He searches alone after accepting
that they can't communicate.)

1473
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,309
Hello.

1474
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:12,110
(Is he the first Korean to meet
in Madagascar?)

1475
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,019
(Perhaps?)

1476
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,250
Hello.

1477
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:17,789
Are you Korean?

1478
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:19,389
No. I'm Chinese.

1479
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:21,389
Oh, no. It's okay.

1480
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,860
I just have a question.

1481
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,630
So I want to buy...

1482
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,599
a knife from Madagascar.

1483
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,429
Where is the shop for it? Do you know?

1484
01:00:33,269 --> 01:00:34,539
(I don't know.)

1485
01:00:34,539 --> 01:00:36,300
He doesn't know. Okay. Bye.

1486
01:00:36,739 --> 01:00:37,739
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1487
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,139
Gosh. It's not easy.

1488
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,750
I think today will be difficult.

1489
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,349
(While he was struggling
to buy Pani Bottle's present...)

1490
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:46,679
It's a bummer.

1491
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:51,889
(Pani Bottle starts traveling solo too.)

1492
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,159
(Oh, my goodness)

1493
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:56,460
When the market opens, it's spectacular.

1494
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:59,789
An observatory is not needed here.

1495
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:01,760
I can just watch it here.

1496
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,969
The whole hillside road is a market.

1497
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:08,840
(Beach umbrellas lined up
along the slope.)

1498
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:12,769
The market is so huge.
I'm not sure where to find it.

1499
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,510
They're opening up now.

1500
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:18,809
There's a slipper.

1501
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:20,820
(Pani Bottle is here to buy new slippers.)

1502
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:21,849
Hello.

1503
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,320
This looks nice.

1504
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,489
(He likes this pair of slippers.)

1505
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,760
Thirty thousand?

1506
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,559
It's 9 dollars. Quite expensive.

1507
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:38,969
(He tries to haggle.)

1508
01:01:38,969 --> 01:01:40,769
No? Okay.

1509
01:01:40,769 --> 01:01:41,869
(He gets declined.)

1510
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,039
Sorry.

1511
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,110
(He turns his back.)

1512
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:45,809
(Hey, wait.)

1513
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,539
Twenty.

1514
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,679
(He succeeds in bargaining
to 20,000 ariaries.)

1515
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:51,710
Okay.

1516
01:01:52,449 --> 01:01:54,650
(Bargaining looks the same
in every country.)

1517
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,650
(It's cute.)

1518
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,590
Okay.

1519
01:01:59,389 --> 01:02:02,590
(He buys a pair of slippers
for 6 dollars.)

1520
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:03,719
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1521
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,460
Okay. Bye.

1522
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:14,469
(With his new slippers,)

1523
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:18,170
(he walks to a sunglass stall.)

1524
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:22,139
(Trying to choose one)

1525
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:28,750
(He carefully selects items
at the market.)

1526
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:29,780
There's no mirror.

1527
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:36,019
(She finds it fascinating
to see foreigners shopping.)

1528
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,900
This is nice.

1529
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,599
(This pair of sunglasses he chose here...)

1530
01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:48,670
(Depending on the viewer,)

1531
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:50,769
His glasses make him look like a fly.

1532
01:02:50,769 --> 01:02:53,909
(it becomes a fly costume,)

1533
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,079
Hello, Robin?

1534
01:02:56,409 --> 01:02:58,480
He looks like a successful
businessman in Africa.

1535
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,750
(or it becomes an item
of a successful businessman.)

1536
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,219
It's like "Casino."

1537
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:04,219
(How much is it?)

1538
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,159
(It's 15,000 Ariary.)

1539
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:08,219
It's reasonable.

1540
01:03:08,489 --> 01:03:10,489
(Searching)

1541
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:16,829
(A pair of fly sunglasses
of a successful businessman: 5 dollars)

1542
01:03:16,829 --> 01:03:17,869
Thank you.

1543
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:20,739
I don't need to haggle
if it's 15,000 ariaries.

1544
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:23,099
So how much is it?

1545
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,840
About 3 to 4 dollars?

1546
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,309
Antananarivo never disappoints.

1547
01:03:26,909 --> 01:03:29,079
They don't overprice to foreigners.

1548
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:32,309
(Pani Bottle heads to Antsirabe.)

1549
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,750
(The taxi stops at a rest area.)

1550
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,849
Is it a rest area?

1551
01:03:41,019 --> 01:03:42,619
It's quite different
from what I had imagined.

1552
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:46,860
Can we eat here?

1553
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:49,000
- Yes.
- Eat.

1554
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,159
(Can we eat something here?)

1555
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:53,269
(I can't miss this chance.)

1556
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,440
(Hello)

1557
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:58,070
(He gets off making a groan.)

1558
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:00,369
I'm hungry.

1559
01:04:03,179 --> 01:04:05,210
(Give me this one.)

1560
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:08,019
(He chooses one cheese ball.)

1561
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:10,050
- Five thousand ariaries.
- Five thousand ariaries.

1562
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:12,150
- Oh, 5,000 ariaries.
- It's 5,000 ariaries.

1563
01:04:13,219 --> 01:04:15,719
(Together with the cheese ball,)

1564
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,059
Yes, one.

1565
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:19,190
- One?
- Yes, one.

1566
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,630
(he adds another snack.)

1567
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:21,699
Okay.

1568
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,429
(He pays 4,000 ariaries
which is around 1.3 dollars.)

1569
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:27,570
Chicken.

1570
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:30,539
(This one?)

1571
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,739
There's its head too. My goodness.

1572
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:34,510
Wait.

1573
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:37,579
My goodness. I thought it was the feet.

1574
01:04:38,909 --> 01:04:40,050
(Laughing)

1575
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,780
I'll take this one.

1576
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,019
(Chicken without a head)

1577
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,849
(A piece of chicken is 2,000 ariaries.)

1578
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:46,920
Okay.

1579
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,360
Bye.

1580
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,360
(He buys a few snacks.)

1581
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:51,190
I'm starving.

1582
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,289
(He goes to eat.)

1583
01:04:52,929 --> 01:04:54,000
A sausage?

1584
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,599
(It's a restaurant that sells
hand-made sausages.)

1585
01:04:56,599 --> 01:04:58,099
How much is it?

1586
01:04:58,570 --> 01:04:59,570
(5,000 ariaries)

1587
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:00,800
I think she means 5,000 ariaries.

1588
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,139
(He enters after checking the price.)

1589
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:06,269
(What is this?)

1590
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,510
- Lasage?
- Lasa Rianada.

1591
01:05:09,309 --> 01:05:11,849
(If you don't know, try it.)

1592
01:05:15,949 --> 01:05:17,050
It's okay.

1593
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,690
Give me this and this
together with the sausage.

1594
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:21,760
I'll take a seat.

1595
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,130
(For a heavy-eating customer,)

1596
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:26,789
(she prepares the food quickly.)

1597
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:31,269
It's a convenient...

1598
01:05:31,329 --> 01:05:32,929
amount to eat on the go.

1599
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,670
The sausage...

1600
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:37,070
(He starts his simple meal.)

1601
01:05:37,409 --> 01:05:38,739
looks primitive.

1602
01:05:43,579 --> 01:05:44,679
It's super tasty.

1603
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,380
It's grilled very well.

1604
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:51,320
(The local food suits his taste again.)

1605
01:05:52,889 --> 01:05:54,019
They won't leave me, right?

1606
01:05:54,989 --> 01:05:55,989
(Reading the room)

1607
01:05:57,389 --> 01:05:59,559
(Being a meerkat)

1608
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:01,630
I can't focus on the meal as I'm worried
if they'll leave without me.

1609
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:06,699
(But his mouth is straightforward.)

1610
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:19,309
(Sausage over rice:
6,000 ariaries which is around 2 dollars)

1611
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1612
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,219
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

1613
01:06:26,219 --> 01:06:28,559
(He returns after filling
his stomach full.)

1614
01:06:29,889 --> 01:06:30,960
My goodness.

1615
01:06:31,889 --> 01:06:33,059
Is it okay to eat the chicken here?

1616
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:34,429
(I'll have my dessert now.)

1617
01:06:34,429 --> 01:06:35,599
(Taking it out)

1618
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,099
(He takes a bite.)

1619
01:06:41,469 --> 01:06:42,769
It's delicious. It's grilled well.

1620
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:46,909
It tastes somewhat like a fried yakgwa.

1621
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,309
My favorite chicken breast part.

1622
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:53,050
(Chicken breast: tastes like yakgwa)

1623
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,719
I was shocked to see the chicken head.

1624
01:06:56,719 --> 01:06:57,949
(Even though the chicken
tastes like yakgwa,)

1625
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:00,320
(it's delicious.)

1626
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,389
Oh, protein.

1627
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,989
(Is he local?)

1628
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:11,000
(Taking out something)

1629
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:12,900
Holy cheese ball.

1630
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,570
(Would you like some?)

1631
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:19,340
(He doesn't refuse.)

1632
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,739
(Eating)

1633
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,210
(It's tasty.)

1634
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,280
It's stimulating.

1635
01:07:28,019 --> 01:07:31,989
(He eats the cheese balls
as if someone's chasing him.)

1636
01:07:32,489 --> 01:07:36,360
(Licking his fingers)

1637
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,590
(He wraps it up by licking his fingers.)

1638
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:45,469
(The professional traveler has finished
his satisfying meal.)

1639
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,400
(Zoning out)

1640
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:52,909
I want a baguette.

1641
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,110
With a slice of cheese on top.

1642
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:58,750
(His favorite food of all is
always baguette.)

1643
01:08:00,449 --> 01:08:02,380
(At Antananarivo, after two days)

1644
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:04,789
(After finishing the university tour,)

1645
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:05,920
(Pani Bottle was heading
to the animal sanctuary.)

1646
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,920
My goodness.

1647
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:09,960
(He found a hair salon.)

1648
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,289
Shall I cut my hair?

1649
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:15,760
It's time for me to trim.

1650
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,359
Hello.

1651
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:20,000
(Can you cut my hair?)

1652
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,569
(The hair salon only has
children customers.)

1653
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,170
Maybe it's only for kids.

1654
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:27,409
We'll find another one on the way, right?

1655
01:08:28,409 --> 01:08:31,880
(Adult Pani Bottle is
looking for a hair salon for adults.)

1656
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:34,949
The sausage looks delicious.

1657
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,680
They fry it.

1658
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,420
(They look tasty.)

1659
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:41,319
(He doesn't get distracted
by the sausages.)

1660
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,130
(He looks for a hair salon.)

1661
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:46,930
Wait!

1662
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,729
Missy Umban.

1663
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,100
(Can I cut my hair here?)

1664
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,670
(Yes, you can.)

1665
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,100
How much is it?

1666
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:56,899
(It's written there.)

1667
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,470
(How much is it to have a haircut
in Madagascar?)

1668
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:59,510
It's cheap.

1669
01:08:59,739 --> 01:09:02,409
(It's 2,000 Ariary
which is around 60 cents.)

1670
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:04,579
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1671
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,350
It should be fine, right?

1672
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,880
(Beeping)

1673
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,479
Why can I hear chicks?

1674
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,319
(He enters the hair salon
with welcoming beeping.)

1675
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,689
I need to trim my hair.

1676
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,319
Will it be okay?

1677
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:19,159
Is this price correct?

1678
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:22,000
Yes. If it's 2,000 ariaries,
it's around 60 cents.

1679
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,399
It's a haircut worth 60 cents.

1680
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,039
There are many people behind me.

1681
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,670
They're here to see me have a haircut.

1682
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:33,739
(Are you going to cut your hair?)

1683
01:09:33,739 --> 01:09:35,680
Yes, in Madagascar style.

1684
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:38,609
- Please cut.
- Yes?

1685
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,350
Cut his hair like mine.

1686
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:45,989
I'm going for the Madagascar style.

1687
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,560
(Go away.)

1688
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,619
(The hairstylist chases them away.)

1689
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:50,420
(I'll do it my way.)

1690
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,630
I have no idea,
but I think it's going well.

1691
01:09:54,329 --> 01:09:57,770
(He starts cutting in Madagascar style.)

1692
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,369
I feel good. He's bold.

1693
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:01,470
(- Is it good?
- It's good!)

1694
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:05,569
(His hair is getting trimmed boldly.)

1695
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:09,079
The more shorter my side hair is,
the more convenient.

1696
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,949
(His back hair gets shorter too.)

1697
01:10:11,949 --> 01:10:14,350
(The top of his hair gets shorter too.)

1698
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:17,279
(He's changing into Madagascar style.)

1699
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,949
Why are they looking at me?

1700
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:23,989
I'm just here to have a haircut.
But everyone's watching.

1701
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:26,430
All passers-by are looking at me now.

1702
01:10:26,829 --> 01:10:28,029
(What's going on?)

1703
01:10:28,029 --> 01:10:30,529
Why are they laughing? I'm very curious.

1704
01:10:31,829 --> 01:10:34,770
(His back of his head is charming.)

1705
01:10:35,539 --> 01:10:38,010
I don't think I look that funny.

1706
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:40,409
(Is it weird?)

1707
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,239
I think it's fine. He's doing a good job.

1708
01:10:42,909 --> 01:10:45,079
Shabby places have good skills.

1709
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:46,979
(The hairdresser's skill
looks professional.)

1710
01:10:46,979 --> 01:10:48,449
It looks clean. It's cooling.

1711
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:50,579
It's cooling.

1712
01:10:51,319 --> 01:10:53,220
(Make him feel cool!)

1713
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,590
(He takes out a new tool.)

1714
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:57,729
(No way. This is...)

1715
01:10:57,729 --> 01:10:59,659
(A barbershop razor?)

1716
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,960
(Excited)

1717
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:05,170
Foreign hair salons shave your beard
when you cut your hair. It's nice.

1718
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:07,170
(He gets excited to get his beard shaved
which is unexpected.)

1719
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:08,340
(He makes his sideburns sharp.)

1720
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,869
It's a full service.

1721
01:11:09,869 --> 01:11:11,609
(He makes his sideburns sharp.)

1722
01:11:11,609 --> 01:11:15,609
(He makes his back hair clean too.)

1723
01:11:15,739 --> 01:11:18,079
His razor...

1724
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:19,579
(Sharpening the lines)

1725
01:11:19,779 --> 01:11:21,050
It's so good.

1726
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:23,279
(It's very nice.)

1727
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:25,850
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

1728
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:27,520
(Front hair)

1729
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,960
(Side hair)

1730
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:33,229
(His haircut and his shaving are done.)

1731
01:11:33,229 --> 01:11:34,430
Thank you.

1732
01:11:36,699 --> 01:11:38,500
He cut very well.

1733
01:11:39,229 --> 01:11:41,699
This is the price, right?

1734
01:11:42,539 --> 01:11:43,640
- Yes.
- Okay.

1735
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:46,670
(Sixty cents)

1736
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:48,680
Oh, my gosh. It's 60 cents.

1737
01:11:49,109 --> 01:11:52,710
(Amazing)

1738
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,050
(Clapping)

1739
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,479
(Congratulations!)

1740
01:11:56,850 --> 01:12:01,289
(He just had a haircut, but everyone is
congratulating and supporting him.)

1741
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,560
My goodness.

1742
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,229
It was a good deal.

1743
01:12:05,229 --> 01:12:06,289
Thank you.

1744
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,760
(Bangs his head)

1745
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,100
Thank you.

1746
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,100
(He shakes hands with his fans too.)

1747
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,369
Why?

1748
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:14,270
I just had a haircut.

1749
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:19,810
Honestly,
I thought my hair would look funny.

1750
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:21,539
But it looks good and clean.

1751
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,539
(And...)

1752
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:24,979
(he expresses how satisfied he is again.)

1753
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:26,310
I'm good.

1754
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:32,020
(Showering with bottled water)

1755
01:12:32,789 --> 01:12:34,789
(A manly man from Korea?)

1756
01:12:34,789 --> 01:12:37,659
(Their hearts are fluttering.)

1757
01:12:38,829 --> 01:12:39,829
It's refreshing.

1758
01:12:39,829 --> 01:12:42,930
(It's thrilling!)

1759
01:12:44,029 --> 01:12:47,199
(With all eyes on him,)

1760
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:52,369
(the cost-effective superstar
is leaving unhurriedly.)

1761
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:56,739
(Welcome, My Brother)

1762
01:12:57,279 --> 01:12:59,050
By the way,

1763
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:01,850
aren't you guys expecting a guest?

1764
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,979
- I...
- I think there will be a guest.

1765
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,689
- If you go to a baobab tree,
- Yes.

1766
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:08,159
you'll see Si Eon.

1767
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:09,420
- Hanging on the tree?
- Yes.

1768
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:11,689
- I think there will be something.
- Isn't he doing a drama?

1769
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:13,859
- It's over.
- Is it?

1770
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:15,029
It's perfect.

1771
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:16,359
Is Dex here?

1772
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:17,529
(The next day,
under the baobab tree where they'll camp)

1773
01:13:17,529 --> 01:13:18,600
He's not here yet.

1774
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,340
There might be someone inside the tent.

1775
01:13:23,069 --> 01:13:25,869
(He suddenly has a weird feeling.)

1776
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:29,279
(Approaching)

1777
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:31,579
(Swinging)

1778
01:13:31,579 --> 01:13:32,579
Is it perhaps...

1779
01:13:32,979 --> 01:13:33,979
Si Eon?

1780
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:39,149
(He carefully checks if he's there.)

1781
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:41,119
Si Eon.

1782
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,390
(Empty)

1783
01:13:42,659 --> 01:13:44,460
(His guess is wrong.)

1784
01:13:44,859 --> 01:13:45,960
He wouldn't come here.

1785
01:13:46,859 --> 01:13:47,960
"He wouldn't come here."

1786
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,329
(That's true.)

1787
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,869
(That's how Kian84 forgot about Si Eon.)

1788
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:57,970
(But several days later,)

1789
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:02,909
(he arrived in Madagascar.)

1790
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:07,149
(He's still in full combat gear.)

1791
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:09,880
Finally, I'm in Madagascar.

1792
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:11,350
The country of penguins.

1793
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:13,149
- The home of hip-hop.
- Right.

1794
01:14:13,689 --> 01:14:15,020
(There's nothing right
about his knowledge.)

1795
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,460
Welcome to Madagascar.

1796
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:18,659
Madagascar.

1797
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,000
(He was given money for a trip.)

1798
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,930
Do I get less because I arrived late?

1799
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:25,930
(He got 100 dollars per day,
which is 400 dollars in total.)

1800
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:28,500
Four hundred won?

1801
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:30,170
It's only 400 won?

1802
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:31,970
(Again, it's 400 dollars.)

1803
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:34,640
I...

1804
01:14:35,609 --> 01:14:38,079
came almost at the end.
So I think this will be enough.

1805
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:40,710
Let me exchange the money first.

1806
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:43,550
Hi.

1807
01:14:46,289 --> 01:14:47,289
Four hundred.

1808
01:14:47,289 --> 01:14:48,819
(This is 400 dollars. Please exchange it.)

1809
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:53,460
I got 1,688,000 Korean won.

1810
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:57,899
(He got a roll of bills.)

1811
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:01,640
(He feels pressured for no reason.)

1812
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,340
(He's feeling the Madagascan air
outside the airport.)

1813
01:15:07,939 --> 01:15:10,779
It's much better than I thought.

1814
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:12,850
(The first impression is good.)

1815
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:14,649
(Looking around)

1816
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:16,180
(He's going
to the center of Antananarivo.)

1817
01:15:16,649 --> 01:15:18,050
Gosh, it's Tiburon.

1818
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:22,119
I think it's Tiburon Turbulence.

1819
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:23,119
(An old Korean sports car
he found in another country)

1820
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:25,960
Santa Fe and Grace.

1821
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,630
(You can commonly see
Korean second-hand cars in Madagascar.)

1822
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:29,159
I see many Korean cars.

1823
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:35,140
It kind of feels like Korea.

1824
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:38,640
Korea used to look like this.

1825
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,310
(It looks familiar,
including the cars and the paddies.)

1826
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,239
Now, I came...

1827
01:15:43,779 --> 01:15:47,149
to a market in Madagascar.

1828
01:15:47,149 --> 01:15:48,649
(He came to a market
with an interesting sense of familiarity.)

1829
01:15:51,819 --> 01:15:52,949
It's my cup of tea.

1830
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:56,260
Hi.

1831
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,520
(He was a city man with his guard on.)

1832
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,689
I feel more comfortable as I've been to
other countries a few times.

1833
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,100
(He's back as a traveler
who can enjoy the journey.)

1834
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,399
(This one)

1835
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:08,340
(He happily greets the helicopter guy
on the street as well.)

1836
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,640
There's something
I really wanted to do in Africa.

1837
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,210
I'm looking for it.

1838
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:16,010
(Si Eon's Africa bucket list)

1839
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,550
I really wanted to try cornrows.

1840
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:19,779
(Cornrow hairstyle)

1841
01:16:19,779 --> 01:16:21,350
- Hi.
- Hi.

1842
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:23,149
It's a baby.

1843
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:25,520
Cute.

1844
01:16:25,989 --> 01:16:27,590
I'm hair.

1845
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:28,590
(I'm hair.)

1846
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,359
(He wants to experience
the local culture.)

1847
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:31,930
How much is it?

1848
01:16:32,789 --> 01:16:34,930
Cornrows.

1849
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,000
Same hair with you.

1850
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,170
Yes.

1851
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,640
(Okay)

1852
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:46,239
(He sits down after making a request.)

1853
01:16:48,279 --> 01:16:49,539
I'm finally doing it.

1854
01:16:51,579 --> 01:16:54,350
(She's prepping his hair carefully.)

1855
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,479
I'm worried I might lose hair.

1856
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:00,220
(Don't worry, mister.)

1857
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:03,189
(She starts braiding it.)

1858
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,229
(Thrilled)

1859
01:17:05,229 --> 01:17:06,229
Oh, my gosh.

1860
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,500
No hair.

1861
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:11,199
No hair.

1862
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:13,300
No hair.

1863
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,869
(She's making ridges without hesitation.)

1864
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,010
A mirror?

1865
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:21,779
(An interim check)

1866
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,880
(Is he laughing because he's satisfied?)

1867
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:25,550
Oh, my gosh.

1868
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:27,449
(What do you think
of the Madagascan hairstyle, Korean?)

1869
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,350
This is not what I imagined.

1870
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,920
I thought I would look so cool.

1871
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,489
Like those hip-hop artists in Hollywood.

1872
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:37,090
(He can't get close to his dream.)

1873
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:40,630
(It's almost finished.)

1874
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:42,460
No hair.

1875
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:47,930
(Laughing)

1876
01:17:48,569 --> 01:17:51,970
(Half nervous, half excited)

1877
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:58,409
(The local swag look is completed.)

1878
01:17:58,949 --> 01:18:00,609
(After transforming like that,)

1879
01:18:01,579 --> 01:18:02,880
(he sneaked into the accommodation
where the younger ones are staying.)

1880
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,949
I think it's going to be hot and dusty.

1881
01:18:03,949 --> 01:18:04,949
What's this?

1882
01:18:04,949 --> 01:18:07,590
(Without being suspected by anyone,)

1883
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:09,119
- What's this?
- My gosh!

1884
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:10,520
(he surprised them successfully.)

1885
01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:14,390
(Even his best friend of 10 years...)

1886
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,329
(and his travel buddy in Latin America
are shocked.)

1887
01:18:16,329 --> 01:18:17,399
- What's this?
- My gosh!

1888
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:18,729
(Si Eon's surprise appearance)

1889
01:18:18,829 --> 01:18:19,930
I knew it.

1890
01:18:21,069 --> 01:18:22,970
- I made it.
- But...

1891
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:24,069
I made it.

1892
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:25,439
He's a good actor.

1893
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:26,470
(All brothers are finally here.)

1894
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:28,739
(The 4 Madagascar Brothers...)

1895
01:18:29,409 --> 01:18:31,210
(had a college tour with Generation MZ,)

1896
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,810
(had a tear-jerking birthday party,)

1897
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:37,779
(and went through many hardships.)

1898
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:43,060
(And they got to Nosy Be.)

1899
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,460
(They went to a grocery store
before taking a ship.)

1900
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:47,529
- So this is it.
- Yes.

1901
01:18:50,029 --> 01:18:53,829
Okay. Here, we'll buy things
before going to the port.

1902
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:55,170
Okay.

1903
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,670
A supermarket in Nosy Be. A big bazaar.

1904
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,010
It's a grocery store.

1905
01:19:03,779 --> 01:19:04,949
It has everything.

1906
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:07,710
Should I get this?

1907
01:19:08,149 --> 01:19:09,579
I'll carry it.

1908
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:10,619
(They got a cart.)

1909
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:12,619
(I can't believe it.)

1910
01:19:12,619 --> 01:19:13,689
I can't believe it.

1911
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:16,090
There are many things that look delicious.

1912
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,390
Finally, it's our last shopping.

1913
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:23,760
Brush every day.

1914
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,170
- Brush.
- Brush.

1915
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:28,369
(Are you guys doing well?)

1916
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,369
Hey, how about this one?

1917
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:33,039
- You guys like it.
- Nice.

1918
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:34,239
(I got something you like.)

1919
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:35,710
Okay. Corn.

1920
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,340
And the pasta sauce you like.

1921
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:38,880
- Let's get pasta sauce.
- Here.

1922
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:41,210
Should I get something
that looks like French?

1923
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:43,020
- Yes. Let's get the French one.
- "Tomato."

1924
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:46,720
Si Eon, let me quiz you.

1925
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:49,689
What are the essential items to survive?

1926
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:52,460
- Pani Bottle, you can answer too.
- Water.

1927
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:54,159
- Water. Fire.
- Fire.

1928
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,130
How about tools?

1929
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:57,300
- A knife.
- The tool you need the most to survive.

1930
01:19:58,869 --> 01:20:00,970
- Is this difficult?
- As expected, you're a soldier teacher.

1931
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:02,039
Is this hard to guess?

1932
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:03,039
(He feels good anyway.)

1933
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:05,340
When you sleep
in the same room with someone,

1934
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:08,109
I guess it makes the bond stronger
even between guys.

1935
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:11,210
I think we have a firm friendship.

1936
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,119
And there's a very strong bond between us.

1937
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,680
They have pork belly here.

1938
01:20:18,619 --> 01:20:20,319
This is pork belly.

1939
01:20:21,319 --> 01:20:22,520
Pig.

1940
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,590
(They got a big chunk of pork belly
they will eat on the island.)

1941
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:24,859
(Is it pork?)

1942
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:26,159
(Yes)

1943
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,460
- Is this...
- Chocolate rolls.

1944
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,029
It's what Dex eats all the time.

1945
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:31,529
There are many things to eat.

1946
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:32,770
Jam.

1947
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:34,569
"Madagascan number one."

1948
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:37,069
We're going to spend
all the money we got here.

1949
01:20:37,539 --> 01:20:39,270
- Snacks.
- Okay.

1950
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,840
We still have some money left.

1951
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:42,479
Pick a snack you want.

1952
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,140
It's cheap.

1953
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,050
What's this?

1954
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:47,680
Why did you get two toothpastes?

1955
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:50,520
- Why did you get two?
- I'll use them.

1956
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:51,920
I use a lot of toothpaste.

1957
01:20:52,289 --> 01:20:53,489
I use so much toothpaste
that I can get two.

1958
01:20:53,489 --> 01:20:54,689
- Get them.
- Okay.

1959
01:20:54,689 --> 01:20:57,020
- I just pour it in my mouth.
- Okay.

1960
01:20:57,859 --> 01:20:58,859
Let's go then.

1961
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:00,130
(The cart is full.)

1962
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:01,699
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1963
01:21:01,699 --> 01:21:03,100
- We don't have time.
- Go.

1964
01:21:03,699 --> 01:21:06,529
(They got a lot of items.)

1965
01:21:06,869 --> 01:21:08,130
We might not have enough money.

1966
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:13,210
Roughly,

1967
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:16,340
- it's going to be 170 dollars.
- About 170 dollars?

1968
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:18,279
It's going up.

1969
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:19,550
I should take out the money.

1970
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:20,550
(Let me see. How much is this?)

1971
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:22,979
How much is it already?
It's 48,000 ariaries?

1972
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,649
- Is it pork belly?
- Yes, it's pork belly.

1973
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:28,090
That's 60,000 ariaries.

1974
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,319
Now it's 70,000 ariaries
and 90,000 ariaries.

1975
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,260
It's become 100,000 ariaries.

1976
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,729
No, that's...

1977
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:36,859
(Stop. Are you trying to sneak that out?)

1978
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:38,430
(He almost shoplifted.)

1979
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:40,800
- I'm sorry.
- She caught you sneaking that out.

1980
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:43,739
- That's 100,000 ariaries.
- It's 120,000 ariaries.

1981
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:44,840
It's 130,000 ariaries.

1982
01:21:45,569 --> 01:21:46,569
It's 160,000 ariaries.

1983
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,739
Two, four, six...

1984
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:52,750
- Twenty thousand.
- That's 210,000 ariaries.

1985
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:54,050
Thirty thousand.

1986
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:56,319
- Goodness.
- Ninety thousand.

1987
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,289
That's about 70 dollars.

1988
01:21:58,989 --> 01:22:01,090
- Let's bag them.
- This bread is still warm.

1989
01:22:02,189 --> 01:22:04,289
- Where are the croissants?
- I got them.

1990
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:06,930
(Tzuyang Bottle makes sure
they've got the bread.)

1991
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:09,399
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1992
01:22:09,829 --> 01:22:11,300
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1993
01:22:11,899 --> 01:22:13,529
- Bye.
- Bye.

1994
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:15,039
We don't get a watermelon? Do we just go?

1995
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:16,100
- Watermelons?
- Yes.

1996
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:18,470
Let's get some if we see them on the way.

1997
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:19,470
Okay.

1998
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:25,109
(Getting on the tuk-tuks
that were waiting for them)

1999
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:31,020
- We have a little more to go.
- Okay.

2000
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,020
(Off to the harbor)

2001
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:34,390
The fruits here look fresh.

2002
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,760
Mangoes.

2003
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:37,789
- Buy some.
- I'll buy some with the change.

2004
01:22:38,329 --> 01:22:39,890
- Mangoes, please.
- Mangoes?

2005
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:40,930
(They can't miss mangoes.)

2006
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:43,060
It's sad that I can't take them to Korea.

2007
01:22:44,199 --> 01:22:46,500
Is that a coconut?

2008
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,039
- Is that a papaya?
- How much are they?

2009
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:50,399
Shall we try that?

2010
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:52,840
I was wondering what you were doing.
You were buying fruit.

2011
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,310
(They buy large fruit
without knowing what it is.)

2012
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,180
- What is that?
- We don't know.

2013
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:59,909
- Let's go.
- We've got a lot of food now.

2014
01:23:00,649 --> 01:23:02,479
We have enough now.

2015
01:23:03,619 --> 01:23:06,050
We bought too much. Gosh.

2016
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,289
How long will it take from here?

2017
01:23:08,289 --> 01:23:09,390
(Now they're off to the harbor
to take a boat for real!)

2018
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:11,829
We'll be there soon. We're close.

2019
01:23:13,729 --> 01:23:14,930
It's so cool.

2020
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:17,529
It looks cooler
because it's a wooden boat.

2021
01:23:17,729 --> 01:23:20,199
- I know. I like how quiet it is.
- Yes.

2022
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:24,140
I think I like wooden boats
more than steel ones.

2023
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:27,010
So here we've got food.

2024
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,210
There's some bread for you too.

2025
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,579
- Breakfast?
- Breakfast?

2026
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:34,149
- It's free.
- Thank you.

2027
01:23:34,149 --> 01:23:36,350
- Help yourself.
- Okay. Thank you.

2028
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:39,289
- I've been so hungry.
- I see.

2029
01:23:39,649 --> 01:23:41,189
- Shall we try some?
- Let's eat.

2030
01:23:42,189 --> 01:23:43,689
This looks good.

2031
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:45,989
Is it bread?

2032
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:48,460
It's good.

2033
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,000
- The jam is good.
- I knew they'd have a jam.

2034
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:54,869
It's a little spicy.

2035
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,039
It's a little weird that bread is spicy.

2036
01:23:57,039 --> 01:23:58,100
(The bread they bought at the supermarket)

2037
01:24:01,409 --> 01:24:02,409
(Brewing coffee)

2038
01:24:02,409 --> 01:24:04,279
- That's coffee.
- Is that so?

2039
01:24:04,279 --> 01:24:06,109
Is that coffee?

2040
01:24:06,109 --> 01:24:08,649
- My goodness.
- He's brewing coffee himself.

2041
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:09,649
(That's the way to go.)

2042
01:24:09,649 --> 01:24:11,819
- That's drip coffee.
- That's amazing.

2043
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:14,119
He's using a filter like that.

2044
01:24:14,619 --> 01:24:15,989
- Is that a filter?
- Yes.

2045
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:22,760
It smells so good.

2046
01:24:23,229 --> 01:24:25,729
- Ethiopia is famous for its coffee.
- Yes.

2047
01:24:25,729 --> 01:24:28,470
Malagasy coffee must be good food.

2048
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:30,739
- That is...
- That coffee...

2049
01:24:30,739 --> 01:24:32,409
(Can we try it?)

2050
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:34,170
Can I have a cup of coffee?

2051
01:24:35,739 --> 01:24:37,010
Thank you.

2052
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:38,210
(Have some coffee.)

2053
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:39,609
Thank you so much.

2054
01:24:41,579 --> 01:24:42,680
(Slurping)

2055
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,189
It's so delicious.

2056
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:48,189
- Delicious? Okay. Cheers.
- Cheers.

2057
01:24:48,189 --> 01:24:50,359
(Do you like it? Then, cheers.)

2058
01:24:52,789 --> 01:24:55,699
(On a boat with a sea breeze blowing)

2059
01:24:55,699 --> 01:24:57,399
Si Eon, the coffee is so good.

2060
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,270
The coffee is good.

2061
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:03,000
- The coffee?
- It's so tasty.

2062
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,470
Are these coffee beans from Madagascar?

2063
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:07,810
- Yes.
- From Madagascar?

2064
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:08,909
It's good coffee.

2065
01:25:08,909 --> 01:25:11,609
You're drinking a local coffee
from Madagascar.

2066
01:25:11,609 --> 01:25:13,449
They used coffee beans from Madagascar.

2067
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,520
- It's delicious.
- It's good.

2068
01:25:15,579 --> 01:25:17,020
The coffee is amazing.

2069
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,050
It's even better than the coffee
from a global coffee chain.

2070
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:23,159
This is what delicious coffee tastes like.

2071
01:25:24,859 --> 01:25:28,359
(After drinking a dreamy coffee)

2072
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,260
Shall we open the papaya?

2073
01:25:30,729 --> 01:25:33,270
(The questionable fruit was a papaya.)

2074
01:25:33,369 --> 01:25:36,470
Si Eon, let's open it and make chocolate.

2075
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:37,569
Make chocolate?

2076
01:25:37,569 --> 01:25:38,869
- Chocolate?
- How do you do that?

2077
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:40,970
Papaya is the main ingredient
in chocolate.

2078
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:42,140
Isn't that coconuts?

2079
01:25:42,409 --> 01:25:44,510
It's papaya.
Papaya is the main ingredient.

2080
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:46,479
Chocolate is not made from papaya.

2081
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:48,079
Is that so?

2082
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,520
Dex.

2083
01:25:50,119 --> 01:25:52,720
- What happened to you, Dex?
- What is made of papaya?

2084
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:55,050
- I think he got struck by lightning.
- He sure did yesterday.

2085
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,260
- It must have struck him slightly.
- Yes.

2086
01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:59,829
- It must have gone past him.
- It went past him.

2087
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:01,960
Gosh.

2088
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:05,930
(Suddenly wiping his face
with a wet tissue)

2089
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:07,270
How refreshing.

2090
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:10,340
(Let me help you.)

2091
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,670
Look how Dex is wiping my face.

2092
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:14,010
- What?
- Has he done it for you?

2093
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:15,439
He won't text you
once we go back to Korea.

2094
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:17,479
(Does he feel guilty?)

2095
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:18,479
- Here we go again.
- Jealous84.

2096
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:19,579
Blow your nose.

2097
01:26:19,579 --> 01:26:21,409
(Blow your nose, Si Eon.)

2098
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,079
He's being nice to you for the last time.
He's nice before saying goodbye.

2099
01:26:24,319 --> 01:26:25,720
(I'm jealous.)

2100
01:26:25,819 --> 01:26:26,890
Let me see.

2101
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:28,819
How come nothing sticks to your skin
whatever you apply?

2102
01:26:28,819 --> 01:26:30,119
Apply some of it to your neck.

2103
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:32,859
Wait. Your philtrum.

2104
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:36,500
- It's not sticking here.
- He's getting so much love.

2105
01:26:36,699 --> 01:26:39,199
- It looks like you're teasing him.
- What is this?

2106
01:26:39,729 --> 01:26:41,600
- Should I clean your sunglasses?
- Okay.

2107
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,739
Dex, do you like me or Si Eon?

2108
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:47,340
What are you talking about?
Give me your sunglasses.

2109
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,369
What?

2110
01:26:48,539 --> 01:26:49,810
Give me yours.

2111
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:51,409
Si Eon, me or Dex?

2112
01:26:51,409 --> 01:26:52,449
Dex.

2113
01:26:53,449 --> 01:26:54,510
Oh, dear.

2114
01:26:55,319 --> 01:26:57,949
(The boat is filled with dreams
and a hint of jealousy.)

2115
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:02,689
- It's so nice.
- I'm full.

2116
01:27:02,689 --> 01:27:04,960
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, dear.

2117
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:07,260
(The travelers arrived on Nosy Iranja.)

2118
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:08,460
This is crazy.

2119
01:27:10,329 --> 01:27:11,359
Oh, my.

2120
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:12,729
(The emerald sea greets them.)

2121
01:27:12,729 --> 01:27:14,500
This is insane.

2122
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:22,579
(In a paradise surrounded
by the primordial sea,)

2123
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:29,720
(the Madagascar Brothers reached
the end of their journey.)

2124
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:36,020
I hope all of you stay healthy
and safe and be happy!

2125
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,630
The trip...

2126
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:43,029
ended so quickly for me.

2127
01:27:43,729 --> 01:27:44,760
What?

2128
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,130
It will be truly beautiful memories
that I can't return to...

2129
01:27:48,739 --> 01:27:51,399
when I look back on it in 5 to 6 years.

2130
01:27:53,109 --> 01:27:55,270
I don't think I can ever come back
to this time again.

2131
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:59,479
Once I felt like we were just traveling,

2132
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:01,510
- I feel good!
- it made me relax.

2133
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:04,180
I'd been exhausted in Korea,

2134
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:06,090
but my mind was at ease...

2135
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:08,119
during the trip.

2136
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:14,329
It didn't matter
if they were traveling with me again.

2137
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,960
Here's what I thought my role was.

2138
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:20,270
Obviously,
Kian84 and Si Eon were the main cast.

2139
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:25,199
And I should help them
with what they don't know.

2140
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:29,239
I thought my role was to assist them.

2141
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:33,250
But as I went, it became my trip too.

2142
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:35,149
(But as I went, it became my trip too.)

2143
01:28:37,319 --> 01:28:41,020
(And the man who was both the beginning
and the end of the trip)

2144
01:28:41,619 --> 01:28:43,720
(How the trip started)

2145
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,460
Nothing is fun, and I've done everything.

2146
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:48,029
(He'd been feeling like
he was stuck in a rut.)

2147
01:28:48,029 --> 01:28:50,260
I didn't know if I was alive or not.

2148
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:51,760
I felt like a farmed flatfish.

2149
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,270
It eats what it's fed,
and it's just perfect for living.

2150
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,100
But it doesn't feel alive.

2151
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,409
(That's how he ran away...)

2152
01:28:59,409 --> 01:29:01,609
(or dreamed of a new beginning in life.)

2153
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:05,109
(He started traveling with no plans.)

2154
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:07,609
(Can I get this to go?)

2155
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,750
(How come you don't have
side-view mirrors?)

2156
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:14,489
(The beginner traveler was clumsy
at everything.)

2157
01:29:15,659 --> 01:29:18,590
(But he experienced the local culture
in his own way without prejudice...)

2158
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:20,189
(Gluping)

2159
01:29:20,729 --> 01:29:23,560
(and fully immersed himself in it.)

2160
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,869
(Then he adapted
to the new environment...)

2161
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:31,100
(and embraced the local culture
like a local.)

2162
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,170
(A raw traveler)

2163
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:36,909
(Even though he was a stranger,)

2164
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:42,010
(the people he met on the other side
of the world opened their hearts to him.)

2165
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:46,449
(They shared deep affection
like family...)

2166
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:50,760
(and cherished their encounters.)

2167
01:29:50,989 --> 01:29:53,260
I'm so grateful...

2168
01:29:53,529 --> 01:29:57,029
that I met people from the other side
of the world and communicated with them.

2169
01:29:57,029 --> 01:29:58,659
(The traveler embraced
the unfamiliar world with open arms.)

2170
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:01,069
I was a farmed flatfish,

2171
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:03,470
but while filming Adventure by Accident,

2172
01:30:04,369 --> 01:30:06,210
I felt like a wild flatfish.

2173
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:09,210
I've become a wild flatfish.

2174
01:30:09,609 --> 01:30:11,140
I feel alive now.

2175
01:30:11,909 --> 01:30:14,010
(And he's grateful to have had his friends
along on the journey with him.)

2176
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,649
(He was alone at the start.)

2177
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:18,279
(They became two,)

2178
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:19,649
(three,)

2179
01:30:19,649 --> 01:30:20,989
(and four.)

2180
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,720
(Kian84's world expanded further.)

2181
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:32,029
(The past days are more precious
as they can't come back again.)

2182
01:30:33,699 --> 01:30:36,739
(Birth itself is a journey.)

2183
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,970
I hope all of us...

2184
01:30:41,939 --> 01:30:43,340
eat good food,

2185
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:45,710
visit nice places,

2186
01:30:46,609 --> 01:30:47,949
and live with no regrets...

2187
01:30:49,449 --> 01:30:52,050
until we depart this world.

2188
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:55,090
I wish that for everyone.

2189
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:56,689
(I wish everyone a journey
with no regrets!)

2190
01:30:57,489 --> 01:30:58,520
Let's go.

2191
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:02,300
Good work, everyone.

2192
01:31:03,399 --> 01:31:07,000
Traveling is about seeing
completely unfamiliar things,

2193
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,239
embracing challenges,
and facing unpredictable situations.

2194
01:31:11,569 --> 01:31:13,909
(The third journey
of Adventure by Accident has ended.)
