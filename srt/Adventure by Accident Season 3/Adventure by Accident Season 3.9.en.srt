1
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,870
- Shall we clean up?
- That was a nice meal.

2
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,039
That was a nice meal.

3
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,979
(They all gathered in the room
to get ready for bed.)

4
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,149
Goodnight, everyone.

5
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:51,410
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

6
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,290
(Suddenly talking)

7
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,459
Do you know how careful you are
around people?

8
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,159
- What was that?
- What was that?

9
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,659
What?

10
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:08,659
(Surprised)

11
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:11,929
- What did you say, Kian84?
- I'm... Talking in my sleep.

12
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,970
Is he talking in his sleep?

13
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:16,569
Si Eon.

14
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,539
<i>Like this</i>

15
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:22,310
Are you singing in your sleep too?

16
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:23,779
What?

17
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:25,910
(Humming)

18
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,950
Pani Bottle.

19
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,719
Do something about this punk.

20
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,649
He must've been very tired.

21
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:34,520
(The night grows darker
with Kian84's scary sleep singing.)

22
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:38,029
(Day 10 of the Madagascar Trip)

23
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:40,160
- Is it already the tenth day?
- That was a long trip.

24
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,329
- Are you all ready, Kian84?
- Yes.

25
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,440
Kian84 and I will go to see the monkeys.

26
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,869
- Okay. See you later.
- See you later.

27
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,809
- You have to come to the motorcycle shop.
- Okay.

28
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:53,839
(Last night, they were discussing
what to do last in Antananarivo.)

29
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,979
- We leave for the island tomorrow.
- You're right.

30
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:58,209
I'm going to rent a motorcycle tomorrow.

31
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:00,050
- A motorcycle?
- Yes.

32
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,580
Do you want to go with me tomorrow?

33
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,589
That sounds good. I like motorcycles too.

34
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:06,190
Since I couldn't see the monkeys today...

35
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,390
I want to go too.

36
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,830
Our flight that day to Nosy Be...

37
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,559
was in the afternoon,

38
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,059
so we had some free time in the morning.

39
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:17,100
So we decided to split up
and do what we each wanted.

40
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,069
As you can see,

41
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,470
we're in units sometimes,

42
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,899
- and other times, we're one group.
- Right.

43
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,240
- Like an idol group?
- Exactly.

44
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,140
- It's like EXO.
- EXO?

45
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,380
(The 4-member Madagascar group
are EXO's juniors?)

46
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,179
Should we just wave down a taxi?

47
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,479
Hello.

48
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,380
(Chewing)

49
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,520
(Waiting with dental floss in his mouth)

50
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:40,319
(Creaking)

51
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:43,229
Oh, my. It's creaking.

52
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:46,199
(They get in for now.)

53
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,330
What? I think the car is broken.

54
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:50,769
He suddenly took out a pair of pliers.

55
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:53,340
- What?
- Pliers?

56
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,970
Is he repairing it on the spot?

57
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,009
How many miles does this have?

58
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,079
It says 210,000.

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,039
- I think it's more like 1,210,000.
- Right.

60
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,549
I can't believe
it's still running in this state.

61
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,419
(Creaking)

62
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,560
Pani Bottle. What is this noise?

63
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,859
There's some strange sound.

64
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,190
I keep hearing some grinding sound.

65
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,799
Please kill me.

66
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,269
It's cruising
through the streets of Madagascar.

67
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,100
Creak.

68
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,109
(A sudden traffic jam)

69
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,549
(Yawning)

70
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,579
- Did we move about 1km?
- Yes.

71
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,350
I think we've been in this spot
for 20 minutes now.

72
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,289
It was the same situation the day before.

73
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:49,190
- Right. That place.
- Yes.

74
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,889
I'll report on the traffic jam.

75
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:53,729
I'll check out the situation first.

76
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:56,370
- Is it too far to walk?
- It's too far to walk.

77
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,900
(Sighing)

78
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,470
Gosh. Look at everyone lined up.

79
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,310
Oh, it just doesn't end.

80
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:06,239
Gosh. Everyone is completely stopped.

81
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,910
(Welcome to Madagascar's traffic jam.)

82
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:13,880
Isn't this crazy?

83
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,019
It's 8:11 a.m. right now.

84
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,389
We headed out early today.
Around 7:30 a.m.

85
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,660
Because we thought
the traffic would be bad.

86
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,289
But it was no use.
What in the world is going on here?

87
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:26,460
- What's going on?
- Like La Paz,

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,329
the traffic is bad here.

89
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,870
(They experienced the pain of traffic jams
in La Paz, Bolivia last year.)

90
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,569
(The cause was
the backed up three-way intersection.)

91
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,370
We'll look for the spot...

92
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,710
that is causing this traffic jam.

93
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,880
- Wait. What is this?
- What are they doing here?

94
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,479
- Why aren't they going?
- What?

95
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:45,579
What?

96
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,819
What?

97
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,549
What? They just stopped here.

98
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,620
- These people are the problem.
- There isn't actually much traffic.

99
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,319
- They're just stopped here.
- What is this?

100
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,620
Why aren't they moving?

101
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:57,359
What is going on?

102
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,929
- Why aren't they moving?
- Why aren't the drivers...

103
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,299
- What is this?
- Why are they blocking the way?

104
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:04,169
- How is that possible?
- What is this?

105
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:06,270
- Did the car break down?
- So it wasn't actually a traffic jam.

106
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,570
Oh, what is this?

107
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,140
- But nobody is honking their horns.
- They don't.

108
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:13,109
- Why aren't they going?
- Is there a reason?

109
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:15,340
- Police?
- Police?

110
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,379
- The police are blocking the road.
- I see.

111
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,650
- Is there a reason?
- They're the police?

112
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,820
I guess the police are doing something.

113
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,220
They're blowing their whistles.

114
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,350
(The police officer is directing traffic
in the intersection.)

115
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,689
Everyone. I figured out the reason.

116
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,129
I found out an amazing truth.

117
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,999
- What could be the reason?
- Let me explain.

118
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:36,330
- Did something happen?
- This place...

119
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,970
has one, two, three, four.

120
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:42,400
It has four roads.

121
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,869
But since the traffic is so bad,

122
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:48,039
They're giving each road ten minutes.

123
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,749
- Ten minutes?
- That's long.

124
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:51,549
- Isn't that too much?
- Normally, traffic lights...

125
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:53,479
are around three minutes, right?

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,150
Three minutes are not enough.

127
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,320
Here, they do ten minutes.

128
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:58,689
- But it's not ten minutes.
- It's not?

129
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,619
Since they give each road
ten minutes each,

130
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,619
when these three roads go,

131
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,229
- it's a total of 30 minutes.
- I see.

132
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:06,059
- Until it gets to my road, right?
- Right.

133
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:07,760
That's insane.

134
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,669
Since I've waited for about 30 minutes,

135
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,429
they should be next.

136
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,100
When they're done, it'll be our turn next.

137
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,539
But since this is a roundabout,

138
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,340
I think the traffic could naturally flow
like fish in a stream.

139
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:23,249
Why is this happening?

140
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,780
- Gosh.
- Ten minutes is so long.

141
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,419
But the important thing...

142
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,590
is that the people waiting
aren't complaining at all.

143
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:32,749
For locals, this is very natural.

144
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:34,260
- Right.
- It must be natural for them.

145
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,689
If you're lucky, you can go quickly.

146
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,530
If you're unlucky, you'll be late.

147
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,729
It's been about 30 minutes now.
I hope we're going soon.

148
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,169
If that's not the case,

149
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:46,169
I'll turn the camera back on
and tell you about it.

150
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,700
Ten minutes later.

151
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,739
We haven't moved for 40 minutes.

152
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,210
- Why?
- Are you going to miss the monkeys today?

153
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,109
This car doesn't have air conditioning.

154
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,580
I'm dying from the heat.

155
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:04,119
(Meanwhile, Pani Bottle is fast asleep.)

156
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:09,160
- I'm going to get out.
- Gosh. This must be so tiring.

157
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,629
This was so unexpected.

158
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:14,160
And this isn't...

159
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,530
some small road.

160
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,299
It's the main road...

161
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,369
in the Capital.

162
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:23,510
It's the same
as blocking off one side of the road...

163
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,379
on Gangnam-daero for 40 minutes.

164
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,450
Install some traffic likes, Bolivia.

165
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,809
(Madagascar)

166
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,179
The traffic shocked me a bit.

167
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,390
When there's a traffic jam...

168
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,049
People turn off their cars...

169
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,619
when they're stopped at a light...

170
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,390
- and have some coffee.
- They seem so used to it.

171
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,090
- Oh, really? They just leave their cars?
- That's how it is in Madagascar.

172
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,390
You could go eat a meal.

173
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,489
You could.

174
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,859
We have different views.

175
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:50,200
It was tough
because I hadn't gotten used to it.

176
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,429
It felt so stuffy in the car,
so I waited outside.

177
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:54,340
But Pani Bottle...

178
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,239
was sleeping there
as if he was meditating.

179
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,570
He is on another level.

180
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,910
- I just turn off my switch.
- So impressive.

181
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:02,340
We're moving.

182
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,650
We're finally moving.

183
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,979
We were there for about 50 minutes.

184
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,020
Oh, my.

185
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,950
(They were about to start moving, but...)

186
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:12,820
(The engine sounds a bit weak.)

187
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,890
Why aren't we moving now?

188
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,359
- Oh, no. The car.
- What?

189
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:18,729
- Please!
- Is the car not turning on?

190
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,400
- Sir.
- Everyone else is moving.

191
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,100
Should we push from the back?

192
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,999
Okay. Back.

193
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:24,999
(Getting out of the car
before the driver even responds)

194
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,369
If we get stuck here again,

195
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:28,100
we have to wait for another 50 minutes.

196
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,869
Nice. It turned on.

197
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:34,939
(Hearing Kian84's desperate prayers,
the car turned on.)

198
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:36,080
Gosh.

199
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,379
The lemurs we get to finally see...

200
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:41,520
after going through so much trouble
must be so cute.

201
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,989
If they're not cute, I might get angry.

202
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,090
We're going to see lemurs...

203
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,760
after waiting at 1 light for 40 minutes.

204
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,989
- Gosh.
- We're coming, monkeys.

205
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,530
We should get there soon
now that we're past that traffic jam.

206
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:57,799
The road is so open now.
Oh, this feels so nice.

207
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,439
- Gosh.
- You went through so much.

208
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:03,340
The view is getting much better.

209
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,869
(After getting through the packed road,
the scenery is much more open.)

210
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,580
It does feel
like we've gotten out of the city.

211
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,679
(Antananarivo, destination)

212
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,979
Getting there isn't easy.

213
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:11,309
(They're almost at their destination.)

214
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:13,850
- I'm excited.
- The symbol of Madagascar.

215
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,649
Oh, Lemurs’ Park. Here.

216
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:17,950
Oh, there it is.

217
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,619
(Lemur, wet-nosed primates)

218
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,229
Oh, there it is.

219
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,190
Oh, look at those white ears.

220
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,399
- Oh, my.
- That's how they look?

221
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,629
They look a bit different
from the monkeys we know, right?

222
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,430
(Arriving 2 hours and 30 minutes
after heading out)

223
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,170
- It should've taken an hour.
- What is this?

224
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,800
But it took you more than double the time.

225
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,670
(Making sure the door is closed)

226
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,670
Thank you.

227
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
How much?

228
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,909
It's 120,000 ariaries?

229
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:46,109
Thank you. Let's go.

230
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:48,550
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

231
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:50,590
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Goodness.

232
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,989
We're finally at the entrance. Goodness.

233
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:54,060
(Finally arriving at the animal sanctuary)

234
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,090
- Do they sell something inside?
- Oh, my.

235
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,629
Can you see them once you get inside?

236
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,129
(What?)

237
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,100
There are monkeys here?

238
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,670
It's just a normal park.

239
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,269
Is this a sanctuary
for monkeys that have been abused?

240
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,570
(Lemurs' Park)

241
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,940
Oh, that's how it looks.

242
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,850
Lemurs' Park is about 20km away...

243
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,409
from the center of Antananarivo.

244
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:21,580
Various animals live here,

245
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,420
including six species of lemurs,

246
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,350
turtles, iguanas, and chameleons.

247
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:29,320
This animal sanctuary
works on preparing animals...

248
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,229
that have been rescued from the wild...

249
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:33,830
or abandoned by owners...

250
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,460
after keeping them in protection.

251
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,930
It's an animal sanctuary. I see.

252
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,670
So you're going over to their house.

253
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:41,100
In Jeju,
we have tangerines and dolhareubang.

254
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,940
In Madagascar,

255
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,670
they have lemurs and baobab trees.

256
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,279
They're most famous for these two things.

257
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,649
It feels as if
I'm walking into an animated movie.

258
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

259
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,350
- Hello.
- Hello.

260
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,989
- Hello. English?
- Yes.

261
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:02,659
Okay. Can I keep my luggage here?

262
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,330
- Yes.
- It's too heavy. Yes.

263
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,300
Are the monkeys here sick?

264
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,129
- Yes.
- Why are they sick?

265
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:14,200
Where are the monkeys in this area from?

266
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,269
They were rescued.

267
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,840
- Rescued.
- They were pets.

268
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,379
Most of them were brought here.

269
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,180
- Only some of them were born in our park.
- I see.

270
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,080
This is what I think.
Raising animals as pets...

271
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,779
Oh, I raise a cat too.

272
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,749
- But cats are different.
- But I found my cat...

273
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:35,320
- on the street. Right.
- I see.

274
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:36,960
It's a rescue, then.

275
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,029
A rescue? It's kind of similar to that.

276
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,560
- Go. Let's go.
- Okay.

277
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,930
- Yes.
- There's a tour for 35,000. I see.

278
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,869
It's not free.

279
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:47,899
There's a tour
where the guide explains things to you.

280
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,109
- Now, we want to start.
- Right.

281
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,109
- Let's go.
- Tuwan is my name.

282
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:55,609
- Tuwan.
- Okay.

283
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,249
- Okay, go.
- Yes.

284
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,979
Are there only monkeys here? Or...

285
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:02,019
We have six species.

286
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:04,249
- Oh, they have six species.
- Six kinds.

287
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:08,159
Lemurs are indigenous to Madagascar
and can only be seen there.

288
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,389
- They have evolved for 50 million years.
- What?

289
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,930
Now, it is believed
that there are about 111 species.

290
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,300
They are now the most famous animals
of Madagascar.

291
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,729
The monkeys.

292
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,499
How can there be so many species?

293
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,239
The environment here is so nice.

294
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:25,139
- Right.
- Coming here after being in Antananarivo,

295
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,840
- the air feels so clean, and it's quiet.
- Right.

296
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:29,440
- It feels so nice without air pollution.
- I'm grateful.

297
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,409
It's only an hour away,
but it was very quiet, unlike the city.

298
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:34,920
The river is pretty too. The color.

299
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,190
- This is a magnificent view.
- This is beautiful.

300
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,460
- Oh, my.
- Is the river brown?

301
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,859
- Yes.
- It's muddy.

302
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:43,529
It looks like red clay.

303
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,659
These monkeys live in such a big area.

304
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,560
- And they stay in the park...
- Yes?

305
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,629
Because they don't swim.

306
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,100
- To keep them from crossing over.
- Since the monkeys can't swim.

307
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,200
So this is a fence. Nature's fence.

308
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,040
It's like a fence.

309
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,639
Right. Nature's fence.

310
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,080
(Nature's fence wraps around the park.)

311
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,450
(Walking along nature's fence...)

312
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,009
But I don't see any monkeys.

313
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,850
- It must be hard to find.
- Since they're not kept in cages,

314
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,290
you can't see them right away.

315
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,619
- Right.
- You have to find them.

316
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:14,389
If they don't come out,
you have to leave without seeing them.

317
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,420
- Oh, really?
- Because it's such a big place.

318
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,889
This requires luck too.

319
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,529
(Looking around)

320
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,830
There aren't any.

321
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,269
- We might not see any.
- I can't see any.

322
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,029
(Worried)

323
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:27,340
The day before,

324
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,899
I didn't get to see the lemurs
because I didn't have time.

325
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,540
I was left with lots of regret.

326
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,580
Not seeing lemurs while in Madagascar...

327
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,979
is like not eating sushi while in Japan.

328
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:39,909
It's like not eating pho while in Vietnam.

329
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,119
Why are you comparing it to food?

330
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,190
Did you do the interview
when you were hungry?

331
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,590
(Did you do the interview
when you were hungry?)

332
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,960
Since I can't see lemurs...

333
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,629
anywhere else in the world...

334
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,800
It's the same as yesterday.
They turned their engines off.

335
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,970
We've been sitting here for 40 minutes.

336
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:58,930
(Please. Let us see just one.)

337
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,139
Yes. Please.

338
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:02,739
Where are they?

339
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,869
- Oh, I see one.
- Where?

340
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:06,540
(Kian84 spotted something.)

341
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,580
- Black... A black one.
- This is a black lemur.

342
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,649
- That's the name of the species.
- Oh, my.

343
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,509
(Exclaiming)

344
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,019
(Black lemur)

345
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,249
- How fascinating!
- I can't believe...

346
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:19,220
- Oh, my.
- our cameras recorded this.

347
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,619
- It's cool, right?
- They look so cool.

348
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:23,989
They're cute.

349
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:26,560
- Oh, they're cute.
- The male is black.

350
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,600
- Okay.
- And the female is brown.

351
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,200
(The females are a light brown color.)

352
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:33,029
All of the females are that color.
The black ones are male.

353
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:34,769
- Oh, really?
- I see.

354
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:36,570
- That one is jumping around.
- Oh, my.

355
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,109
(Jumping around in front of their eyes)

356
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:39,940
Look at that one jumping.

357
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,840
(Jumping)

358
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,810
They're so fast.

359
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,109
(Flying around like the wind)

360
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,580
Oh, how cute.

361
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,420
So cute.

362
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,350
- You look so excited, Kian84.
- They were very fascinating to look at.

363
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,850
- Oh, really?
- Oh, my.

364
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,859
(Jumping onto a branch)

365
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:56,159
(Laughing)

366
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,989
Look at the mouth.

367
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,859
- It's sticking out like a dog.
- Sticking out like a dog.

368
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,259
That must be why we call them
fox monkeys in Korea.

369
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:04,769
(They are called fox monkeys in Korea
because their mouths look like foxes.)

370
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,440
That female is very aggressive.

371
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,040
- Oh, really?
- Oh, my.

372
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,070
Why are only the females aggressive?

373
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,909
- Because now, she's pregnant.
- The mouth...

374
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,479
She's very sensitive right now
because she's pregnant.

375
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,249
- Her? This one? Okay.
- Yes.

376
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,710
(Crying)

377
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,580
- What?
- What is she saying?

378
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,879
- She's sensitive.
- She's telling you not to come close?

379
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:22,920
(Crying)

380
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,249
Oh, she's crying.

381
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,290
- It's a territorial sound.
- Why is she crying?

382
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,119
Just to tell us, "Don't get too close."

383
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,159
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

384
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,629
She's rubbing her butt on the tree.

385
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:33,629
She's saying it's her territory
and to stay away.

386
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:34,859
Unless we have a death wish.

387
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:36,399
- They have a chemical.
- Oh, my.

388
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,330
- She's marking.
- What?

389
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:40,970
- So cute.
- She's marking...

390
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,239
- her territory.
- I see.

391
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,710
Okay. I think we'd better move.

392
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,639
- Let's leave this place.
- For her? Okay.

393
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,979
They look so fascinating.

394
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,879
How fascinating.

395
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:53,050
They're totally different
from the monkeys we know.

396
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:54,550
From the tail to the face.

397
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:57,220
Oh, they're eating something.

398
00:16:57,989 --> 00:16:59,820
- Are those two a couple?
- They are.

399
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,320
- Oh, my.
- They look good together. Oh, my.

400
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:02,759
He's not giving it to her.

401
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,989
He wasn't very gentle.

402
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,300
- That bamboo shoot...
- What is that?

403
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,999
They're eating something.

404
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,129
Bamboo shoot?

405
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:14,100
- You're right. They're bamboo shoots.
- Bamboo. Bamboo shoots. Right.

406
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:15,340
How cute.

407
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,310
- They eat bamboo shoots, I see.
- They're herbivores.

408
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,639
Do they mainly eat fruits?

409
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,379
- The guava fruits.
- Guava.

410
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,749
- Bananas.
- Okay.

411
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,279
What about bugs?

412
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,119
- No bugs?
- No.

413
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,249
They only eat fruit, not bugs.

414
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,550
- Gosh. They're vegetarians. Vegans.
- They're vegetarians.

415
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,560
- They're good at peeling those.
- How cute.

416
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
(These gentle animals only eat plants.)

417
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,629
How cute.

418
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,560
They're so cute.

419
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:41,729
I didn't think
I'd ever see them with my own eyes.

420
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:43,029
(Happy)

421
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,300
- So cute.
- They're kind of like puppies.

422
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,999
They are so cute.

423
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,440
Kian84, do you want to take a picture?

424
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,609
Okay.

425
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,279
One, two, three.

426
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,649
(A picture with the husband monkey)

427
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,249
Look at me, Pani Bottle.

428
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,420
(Despite feeling shy,
Pani Bottle got a picture too.)

429
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,149
You can't touch them
or give them anything, right?

430
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,359
- Right.
- Right.

431
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,720
- You can't give them food.
- I see.

432
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,129
You just have to pass by.

433
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,560
- Okay. Let's go to find some...
- Let's go.

434
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,259
- Some other monkeys.
- Let's go to see more.

435
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,800
We're going to see dancing lemurs.

436
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,100
- Dancing lemurs?
- Dancing lemurs?

437
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,840
Yes. Because they jump sideways.

438
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,869
- Oh, like this?
- Yes.

439
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,570
- Yes. I know about those.
- Right.

440
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,170
- These?
- They're famous.

441
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,710
- These? They're famous.
- Right.

442
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,649
(These lemurs do aerial stunts
that look as if they're dancing.)

443
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,979
(They jump on the ground.)

444
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,649
- They're basically flying.
- So cute.

445
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,450
Dancing monkeys.

446
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,249
- Later...
- Oh, over there.

447
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,790
Look at that one jumping.

448
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,690
- How fascinating. They're like humans.
- They jump so well.

449
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,989
- They really are like humans.
- Right.

450
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:47,800
(Taking a bite)

451
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,100
It's eating something.

452
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,100
How cute.

453
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,199
Oh, my. What is this?

454
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:57,109
- Dancing monkeys?
- There are so many of them.

455
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,010
They're called dancing lemurs.

456
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,980
They like hanging from trees like that.

457
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:03,980
- Oh, my. What is that?
- Oh, my.

458
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,050
(A live aerial stunt show)

459
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,090
- They're so fast.
- That's why they're monkeys.

460
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,550
- What is that?
- That monkey is called...

461
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,490
Coquerel's sifaka...

462
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,560
What?

463
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,659
- Sifa?
- What?

464
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,659
This lemur named Coquerel's sifaka...

465
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:24,100
can even jump up to 11m...

466
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,300
- when jumping from tree to tree.
- Oh, my.

467
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:30,540
These lemurs
that jump sideways on two feet...

468
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,869
can only be seen in Madagascar.

469
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,080
(Impressed)

470
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,679
(Hanging)

471
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,080
- That one is really cute.
- So they have...

472
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,350
Hello.

473
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,949
- Gosh, that monkey is scratching.
- What is it?

474
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:46,820
(Did you call me?)

475
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,520
- That's a doll-faced monkey.
- That's a beautiful monkey.

476
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,889
- That monkey resembles a koala too.
- Right.

477
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:54,000
(Passing by
the koala-resembling monkeys...)

478
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,459
They are lemurs? Gosh.

479
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:57,929
- Goodness.
- Look at the baby lemur.

480
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,840
- Not really. But...
- Not really. I see.

481
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,169
(They spot more lemurs.)

482
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,040
So cute.

483
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:07,139
- They sort of resemble sloths.
- Yes.

484
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,780
They look really kind.

485
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:11,510
- That's a baby lemur on the back.
- They seem gentle.

486
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,879
(Cooing)

487
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,419
So cute.

488
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:15,850
(Smiling like a dad)

489
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,020
- They have kind faces.
- Yes, they seem kind.

490
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,659
- They are cute.
- They were gentle.

491
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:22,689
Right.

492
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,429
- They look like us when they eat.
- Right.

493
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:27,359
(Holding it with one and munching)

494
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,560
Goodness. How fascinating.

495
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,899
The lemur is licking the leaves.

496
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:32,399
They spray salt water over the leaves...

497
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,369
because it's difficult for them
to consume salt.

498
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,770
They spray nutrients on the leaves
to help the monkeys consume them.

499
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,510
Isn't this environment great?

500
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,340
- There aren't fences around here.
- Right. It's much better.

501
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,780
They get to roam around the entire park
as they please.

502
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,280
- Right.
- There's a river here too.

503
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,219
They get to do everything they want here.

504
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,449
When I go to zoos,
I feel bad for the animals.

505
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,919
But it wasn't like that there at all.

506
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,859
It's like running into monkeys
during your walk around the park.

507
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:55,990
- Right.
- Yes.

508
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,560
(Like the scenery of nature
he stumbles upon,)

509
00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:02,100
(he naturally gets fascinated
by them and watches them.)

510
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:03,770
You know,

511
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,399
this is the most peaceful place
I have been to so far.

512
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:09,040
- Of all places in Madagascar?
- Yes.

513
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,209
- I feel like I'm at an arboretum.
- Right.

514
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:15,010
Listen. If we're comfortable here,
they must be comfortable too.

515
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,540
- Yes. You're right.
- Right?

516
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,709
- Gosh. You...
- If monkeys feel comfortable here,

517
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:20,149
people must feel the same way.

518
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:21,580
That's perfectly put.

519
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,119
- When I listen to his thoughts,
- You're right.

520
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,290
he sounds like a poet.

521
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,419
- Is that so?
- It's the things you say.

522
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,459
Gosh.

523
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,320
But I get how you can feel that way.

524
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,830
(Quickly accepting it)

525
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:35,230
- As for the monkeys I saw, their tails...
- Yes.

526
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:38,030
were in the white-black patterns.
How come...

527
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,500
I think you're talking
about the leaf monkeys.

528
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,570
Gosh.

529
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,869
(He's been looking for them
since the beginning of the trip.)

530
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,469
(The indigenous species in Madagascar)

531
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,580
(The leaf monkeys)

532
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,010
(I thought...)

533
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,780
(leaf monkeys
would have dominated Madagascar.)

534
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:54,719
It hadn't met the monkeys in the towel.

535
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:56,820
- I see. The ones in the towel.
- The ones with the stripes.

536
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,119
The striped monkeys.

537
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,449
- Madagascar is known for them.
- Yes.

538
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,520
(Where are these monkeys?)

539
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:05,929
What?

540
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:07,929
I see. Kian84. Look over there.

541
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,230
- Is there a monkey?
- Gosh.

542
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,359
- Can you see it over there?
- What?

543
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,629
Yes. They're the ones I talked about.

544
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,939
You wanted to see them.

545
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:15,369
- The number one monkey I wanted to see.
- Yes.

546
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,840
The leaf monkeys.

547
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,540
(I found the leaf monkeys.)

548
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:20,409
- Yes. They're the ones.
- Gosh.

549
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:21,879
Madagascar is known for leaf monkeys.

550
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:25,179
You're seeing the most famous species
of lemur in Madagascar.

551
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:26,909
They are the ring-tailed lemurs.

552
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:29,050
Their tails resemble those of tigers.

553
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,649
They're also called
the tiger-tailed lemurs.

554
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,219
Gosh. It feels like
I'm looking at mythical animals.

555
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,060
(Bobbing)

556
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,129
- Gosh.
- What was that?

557
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:41,659
Those lemurs look really cute.

558
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,830
(They carefully approach the lemurs
after the greetings.)

559
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,609
- It's coming.
- It came to us.

560
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,570
- Gosh.
- It's coming.

561
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,340
Seriously. The tail was
in the shape of a question mark.

562
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,639
- That was the default shape.
- Gosh.

563
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,679
- Gosh.
- It must feel friendly around people.

564
00:22:58,679 --> 00:22:59,850
It looks like a question mark.

565
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:02,149
When lemurs approach you,

566
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,520
you can't act startled.

567
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,090
If we move, the lemurs might be startled.

568
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,560
- Right.
- The guide told us to stay still.

569
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:09,590
(We finally meet.)

570
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,929
You finally saw one.

571
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:13,129
(Another tourist is
actively taking pictures.)

572
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:15,000
That one was definitely popular.

573
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,399
- You drew that for me yesterday.
- Yes.

574
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:19,399
This one looks really fascinating.

575
00:23:19,469 --> 00:23:21,399
- It looks just like the drawing.
- Totally.

576
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,139
- The baby lemur is dangling there.
- Yes.

577
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,510
How cute.

578
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,379
Gosh. That's so cute!

579
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:30,679
- This is so interesting.
- The baby lemurs are dangling.

580
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:31,679
(The baby lemur is embraced
by the mother lemur.)

581
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:35,820
The mother lemur
is breastfeeding the baby.

582
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,719
- That's motherly love.
- Yes.

583
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,990
There are so many of them. Gosh.

584
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:43,389
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

585
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:47,189
This is like a scene from a documentary.

586
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:48,459
Gosh.

587
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,429
(It's a scene of nature in the raw.)

588
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,469
So cute.

589
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,300
(They are glued together into one body.)

590
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,800
They look so beautiful.

591
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,310
(They embrace one another.)

592
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,469
This is a rare clip.

593
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:02,709
- Gosh. This is nice.
- It's peaceful.

594
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:04,209
It was a therapeutic moment for you.

595
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,280
(How's our baby?)

596
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,850
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

597
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,550
(As if they had forgotten
about their fight...)

598
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,750
Their tails look so interesting.

599
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,290
- They have such cool tails.
- Yes.

600
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,159
Goodness. How can they walk so gracefully?

601
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,359
(They walk together,
making a line of question marks.)

602
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,929
(Finding them cute)

603
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:22,399
Imagine if he didn't go to the park.

604
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,169
There's a fence here,
but it doesn't do anything.

605
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:26,429
They freely cross over the fence.

606
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:29,639
This wall does nothing.
This isn't a zoo either.

607
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,639
This is intriguing.

608
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:33,409
(He's happy for the animals
even to the last moment.)

609
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:34,510
Okay. Let's go.

610
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,250
They have likable faces.

611
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:40,250
When I met the lemurs,

612
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,280
watching them put me in a good mood.

613
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,689
They lived in a peaceful environment.

614
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:47,389
They seemed cozy there
with their friends and families.

615
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:50,189
Watching them healed my soul in a way.

616
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:51,659
It made me feel good.

617
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:54,560
I was the one who got comforted here,
not the lemurs. This is great.

618
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,859
That's nice.

619
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:57,899
Gosh. How should I put it?

620
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,230
It was like having kebab in Turkiye.
It hit the spot.

621
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,469
(Looking at ease)

622
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,369
And this is what I liked the most
about the trip.

623
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:06,209
Kian84 said this behind me.

624
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,580
"I'm at ease here."

625
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,679
When we were in Antananarivo,

626
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,949
it was dusty, the air was polluted,
and it was noisy.

627
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:14,250
Everywhere was crowded.
We were in a hectic environment.

628
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,219
But the park was so quiet and peaceful.

629
00:25:16,219 --> 00:25:17,889
I thought the animals
would be happy there.

630
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,689
You got to see them as much as you wanted.

631
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,260
- We'll go back.
- Yes.

632
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,290
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

633
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,260
- We'll give you our tip here.
- Okay.

634
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,629
- Let me give him the tip.
- How much?

635
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:29,760
Thank you.

636
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,929
- He was really kind to us.
- Thank you so much.

637
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:32,969
- Here.
- Thank you.

638
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:34,199
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

639
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,969
It wasn't just you guys
who saw the lemurs.

640
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:37,639
- We got to see them thanks to you.
- Right.

641
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,439
I didn't expect a lot from it,
but it was nice.

642
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,639
We had to see the lemurs no matter what.

643
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,510
(This is the heart of Antananarivo.)

644
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,280
Let's go.

645
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,980
(Dex and Si Eon leave the lodging.)

646
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,449
You guys are similar.
You both have big backpacks.

647
00:25:52,189 --> 00:25:54,020
- I already found a shop.
- Okay.

648
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,689
(Last night, Si Eon planned
to ride a motorcycle.)

649
00:25:57,929 --> 00:25:59,189
(Do you plan to ride it in Antananarivo?)

650
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,399
(His plan was to ride the motorcycle
to the airport.)

651
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:02,800
We'll take a taxi there.

652
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,070
Then let me get a taxi for us.

653
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:07,199
(Glancing)

654
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,439
Today, I'm traveling with Dex,
a guy I don't know much about.

655
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,669
Hello.

656
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:13,369
The two of us decided to go on a trip.

657
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:16,209
This feels great.

658
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,449
(Chuckling)

659
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,919
(Awkwardly laughing
from the start of their trip)

660
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,449
- We need to load our backpacks too.
- Right.

661
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,350
- That one looks good. Right?
- That one?

662
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,389
It has a trunk too.

663
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:29,760
The white car looks nice.

664
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,159
The white car looks good.

665
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:32,230
Let's get in the white car.

666
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,760
We want to go here.

667
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,129
- How much?
- How much?

668
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,260
(Tapping)

669
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,300
So 40,000 ariaries? That's so cheap.

670
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,840
- Okay. Good.
- Okay.

671
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:43,040
- That's a really good price.
- Gosh. He has a nice car too.

672
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,639
That car looks nice.

673
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:47,310
- Nice car.
- I see.

674
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,879
- This is the best car we got so far.
- Right.

675
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:51,350
(Amazed)

676
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:53,980
(They're grateful that
the trunk opens up.)

677
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,080
(Helping Dex)

678
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,389
Okay.

679
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:01,389
(They load the soldier's gear.)

680
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,790
We're leaving this city now.

681
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:03,919
Right.

682
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,260
(They set out to rent the motorcycles.)

683
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,659
(Scratching)

684
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,669
(Quiet)

685
00:27:13,469 --> 00:27:15,699
Si Eon and I...

686
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:18,469
will go and rent motorcycles now.

687
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,080
(It's their first time being alone
with just each other.)

688
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,280
That's true.
It's just the two of them together.

689
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:27,080
(Turning away)

690
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:30,679
You're not looking at each other.

691
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,219
(Pondering)

692
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,990
I'm on my way with Dex, a guy...

693
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:38,060
- I don't know much about.
- You keep saying that about Dex.

694
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,990
How long have you been riding motorcycles?

695
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,800
Actually, I've been riding them
for a long time.

696
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,530
What about you?

697
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:45,469
As for me,

698
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,699
it's only been 1 or 2 years
since I got my license.

699
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:49,869
(It's only been 1 or 2 years
since I got my license.)

700
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:54,439
(Their conversation is over.)

701
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,209
The reaction was the same. "I see."

702
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:59,580
It was a bit awkward
when it was just the two of us.

703
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,949
- Gosh.
- I feel suffocated just watching this.

704
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:02,250
(Their taxi ride was suffocating.)

705
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,090
- We have similar palates.
- Right.

706
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,689
- You like spicy food too.
- You and I have similar palates. Yes.

707
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:09,389
You guys have a lot in common.

708
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:10,820
Right. They're both city boys.

709
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,560
- My gut health isn't that strong.
- Same here.

710
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,300
(When edible caterpillars were served,)

711
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,429
(he shook his head.)

712
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,030
(I have a weak stomach.)

713
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,770
I won't eat it. You eat it.

714
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,500
(He said he wouldn't eat it
whenever he got a chance.)

715
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,139
(Si Eon was a picky eater.)

716
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:26,939
(Gosh, the cilantro...)

717
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,149
(The youngest was a picky eater too.)

718
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:32,280
Gosh. I remember that.

719
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,649
(I've been observing you. Dex, you are...)

720
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:36,149
(Little Si Eon.)

721
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:37,219
He's just like you.

722
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:39,419
Kian84 said that a lot.

723
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,990
I'm not like Kian84.
I have a hard time trying out new food.

724
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,219
There's a chance
I might get a stomachache if I do that.

725
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:45,659
I'm like that.

726
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:46,689
(They use their weak stomach
to find common ground.)

727
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,560
Well, it was my first time...

728
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,030
spending time alone with Si Eon.

729
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,199
I thought that
I should bond with him quickly.

730
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,740
I thought the best way to bond
with him would be...

731
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,439
finding what we had in common.

732
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:01,040
So I wanted to start talking
about food first.

733
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,679
I think we bonded well over food.

734
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,179
- What is this?
- Did you decide to approach him now?

735
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,250
It's been only two days since I met Dex.

736
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,889
Our palates are really similar.

737
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:13,219
I think we're compatible in that way.

738
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:14,659
I like him.

739
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:16,520
- Why is he acting so shy?
- Wait.

740
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:18,330
- What was this?
- Earlier...

741
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,100
- Why did you cover your knee like this?
- Gosh.

742
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,730
Can you change the romantic song
to something else?

743
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,129
- You really didn't want to see that.
- He really didn't like that.

744
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,969
Hey. Are you acting jealous right now?

745
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,500
(There's love in the taxi.)

746
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,869
Thank you.

747
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:33,209
(They arrive at the destination
in no time.)

748
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,840
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

749
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,510
Gosh.

750
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,080
"One Hundred Percent Motor."

751
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,379
- Gosh. Look at this. This one is cool.
- Oh, my.

752
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,919
I see. This is from Fantic.

753
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:46,350
- Gosh. What's this?
- This motorcycle is...

754
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,419
from an Italian brand, Fantic.

755
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,419
- Really?
- Yes.

756
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,990
He recognized the brands right away.

757
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,159
He's the walking encyclopedia
of motorcycles.

758
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,260
Gosh. Should we go inside?

759
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

760
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,629
(They enter the motorcycle shop.)

761
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,399
- Gosh. I see a lot of motorcycles.
- Nice.

762
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,840
The motorcycles look good too.

763
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:05,070
I didn't know there was a motorcycle
as big as this from Husqvarna.

764
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,639
(Rumbling)

765
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:11,310
(The booming exhaust sound...)

766
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,679
(gets him utterly excited.)

767
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,949
(Feeling the thrill)

768
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,750
(Discharging the exhaust sound)

769
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,090
It was tingling.

770
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:21,419
Good.

771
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,560
Seriously. I got excited for real.

772
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,530
I think Pani Bottle can take this one.

773
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,790
This is good for Kian84.

774
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:28,100
I don't think he can ride this one.

775
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,199
It has to be small.

776
00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:31,530
I know what kind of motorcycle he likes.

777
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,469
(I have short legs.)

778
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:36,240
(I want a smaller one.)

779
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,510
(Pani Bottle emphasized that
his legs were short in South America.)

780
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:44,649
They like riding motorcycles
that are suitable for their bodies.

781
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:45,709
It's because my head is big.

782
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,719
So I had to be careful
when I was picking out the motorcycles.

783
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:53,419
My friend is small. So...

784
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,959
(Can we rent this?)

785
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:56,560
(I see.)

786
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,629
Are you sure about that?

787
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:00,030
- Not for me.
- No.

788
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,530
- For my small friend.
- It's for my friend.

789
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,730
- So...
- My friend has short legs.

790
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,129
(We have a small yet precious friend.)

791
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,869
- A small friend.
- "My small friend."

792
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:09,500
- No.
- It sounds like a title of a novel.

793
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:11,639
- "My Small Friend."
- "My Small, Precious Friend."

794
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,540
(This is perfect then.)

795
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,240
- Yes. That's good.
- Is that okay?

796
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:16,709
(His feet touch the ground,
so he'll take it.)

797
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:17,780
Okay.

798
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,050
- Can I try this on?
- Try on anything you want.

799
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:21,580
What's the size for this one?

800
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,050
We'll rent 3 regular helmets
and 1 more helmet.

801
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,949
It has to be very big.

802
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,959
- It's for my friend.
- Extra-large, please.

803
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:32,429
Does he have a big head?
For the second one?

804
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:33,889
Yes. A big helmet, please.

805
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,629
(Rushing)

806
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,030
A friend with a big head.

807
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,830
A small friend
and a brother with a big head.

808
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:42,770
- "Who are these people?"
- Right. "Who are they?"

809
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,439
(Approaching)

810
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,639
- This is for the guy with a big head.
- Yes. Is it the last one? Is it very big?

811
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:50,510
- Okay.
- This one is very big.

812
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,010
- Okay.
- Gosh, that's big.

813
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,250
Okay.

814
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,219
- Good. This is for Kian84.
- Did you try it on?

815
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:58,389
- This is very big, right?
- Thank you so much.

816
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,719
He checked that several times.

817
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:04,090
(Now that they carefully picked out
the equipment, it's time to pay.)

818
00:32:05,129 --> 00:32:07,560
We're a group of four men.

819
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,100
- One, two, three, four.
- Yes.

820
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:10,859
(Glancing)

821
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:13,530
Guys. Do you like to take some bikes?

822
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,800
Yes. We'll rent first.

823
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,369
- We'll meet up later...
- Okay.

824
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,010
in another area.

825
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,409
- Okay.
- Can you bring the bikes...

826
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,510
- to that area?
- Okay.

827
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,109
- By 11 a.m.?
- Sure.

828
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,580
And secondly,

829
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,780
we'll take off via airplane.

830
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,419
- He fell for him.
- I was really surprised. Gosh.

831
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:30,550
He was really good.

832
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,020
Can you pick up the motorcycles
at the airport?

833
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,020
- Okay.
- Can you?

834
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,020
- No problem.
- Thank you.

835
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,119
And lastly,

836
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,859
we have very big backpacks.

837
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,300
Can you pick up the backpacks for us?

838
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,399
Yes, sure. No problem.

839
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:44,459
(Dex is so cool.)

840
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:45,699
No problem? Thank you so much.

841
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:46,899
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

842
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:48,469
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you so much.

843
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,570
Gosh. He's good.

844
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:51,869
- Everything is good.
- Okay.

845
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:52,939
- Really?
- Gosh.

846
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,480
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

847
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,679
(Their first date went smoothly.)

848
00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:00,879
The people at the motorcycle shop said
they would bring our stuff to the airport.

849
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,649
And everything they did for us
was included in the rental fee.

850
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:06,189
- I see. That's nice.
- It was part of their rental package.

851
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:09,560
All right. Si Eon and I...

852
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,590
will wait until the others come back.

853
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,359
We decided to wait at a cafe,
so I did some research. Apparently,

854
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,699
we are in Cheongdam-dong of Madagascar.

855
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,169
This place is suitable
for Actor Lee Si Eon, isn't it?

856
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:21,240
Of course.

857
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,570
It was the most luxurious cafe
in Madagascar.

858
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,209
We are indeed in Cheongdam-dong.

859
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:29,540
Gosh. That looks nice.

860
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:31,949
Si Eon and I had similar palates.

861
00:33:31,949 --> 00:33:34,949
I picked a cafe with food
we would like for sure.

862
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:37,149
- Should we have some caviar?
- There was caviar?

863
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,850
Let me check my wallet.

864
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,119
(The high-end food, caviar,
comes with the cafe.)

865
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,659
- Hello.
- Hello.

866
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:44,659
Let's start with coffee.

867
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,760
They also have chocolate drinks too.
"Cafe." That's coffee.

868
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,100
One iced chocolate and one iced coffee.

869
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,070
And one pizza bread.

870
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:55,570
Gosh. Dex is good.

871
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,139
I felt reassured to have Dex with me.

872
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,109
(Pizza bread)

873
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:00,139
(Their food and drinks are served.)

874
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,139
Thank you.

875
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:03,840
(They sip on their cool drinks
at the same time.)

876
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:06,080
(This is it.)

877
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:07,780
I feel alive now.

878
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,080
(He elegantly cuts
the appetizing pizza bread.)

879
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,320
(The city guys smell the food first
to verify it.)

880
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,290
(The picky eaters have a bite
at ease after smelling it.)

881
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,730
- This is good.
- It's definitely tasty.

882
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,429
Thank you.

883
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:22,129
- Gosh.
- That looks good.

884
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:23,429
- Look at the quality of the food.
- The craft burger.

885
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:26,129
- Gosh. I'm salivating just at the sight.
- That looks tasty.

886
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,330
(How is it?)

887
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,570
(Humming)

888
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,340
- Is it nice?
- Yes.

889
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,639
(He has a big bite of the nice burger.)

890
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:34,939
Isn't it good?

891
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:36,580
(The burger is nice.)

892
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,810
- We're in Korea right now.
- Right?

893
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,850
We're in Korea.

894
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,419
I love it. Gosh.

895
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,119
Doesn't it look like
we kind of bonded at the cafe?

896
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,389
- A bit.
- A bit?

897
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,919
- We bonded more there than in the taxi.
- Seriously. We met by chance.

898
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,859
Si Eon, how long have you been acting now?

899
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:52,590
Me? I debuted in 2009.

900
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,330
I was in a drama
called "Friend, Our Legend."

901
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:55,800
Do you know the drama? Hyun Bin was in it.

902
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,500
- Of course.
- I was in it.

903
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,169
I auditioned for it and got first place.

904
00:34:59,169 --> 00:35:00,629
- Really?
- Gosh.

905
00:35:01,129 --> 00:35:03,000
I read in an article that
you would be in a drama too.

906
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,840
Right. I somehow ended up
starring in a drama.

907
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,010
Actually, I had questions about acting.

908
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,780
Right. They can now talk about acting
because they're both actors.

909
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,409
I was a bit shy to ask him.

910
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:15,119
But there were so many questions
I wanted to ask him personally.

911
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,379
- It's because this is your first time.
- He's Dex's senior actor.

912
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:20,050
I don't know how I'm going to stay calm.

913
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,619
- I think I'll get so nervous.
- As for that,

914
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,219
I have a good method.

915
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,290
You must play your role
as if you're not going to see them again.

916
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,699
- I see.
- Just be yourself. Do what you do.

917
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,570
I'm not sure if I can do this.
I need to do well.

918
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:33,369
"I won't let this get to me."

919
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:35,100
- So you need to be fit physically.
- I need to be fit?

920
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,469
That's important too. I mean, this is you.

921
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,840
But Dex playing that role...

922
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:40,209
That sounds fun.

923
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:41,810
Can I visit you at the shoot?

924
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,080
No.

925
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,810
I might do a worse job if you come.

926
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,580
No. Reading the script together
before the shoot even if it's just once...

927
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,649
It will still be helpful.

928
00:35:49,419 --> 00:35:51,150
Then can you help me
when we go back to Korea?

929
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,819
- Let's read it together and go.
- Seriously.

930
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,089
- It's all about your confidence.
- I can tell...

931
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:56,290
he wants to give Dex
as much advice as he can.

932
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,790
Knowing this in advance
can be helpful, actually.

933
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,029
Even if they say something,
don't let it get to you.

934
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:04,000
- "I'm right."
- "I'm right."

935
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:06,469
To be honest,
I thought he would sort of laugh at me.

936
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:08,540
"Hey, you're not good enough
to be an actor."

937
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,400
But he didn't look down on me.

938
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,869
He said, "This is your first role.
You will get nervous. It's fine."

939
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,139
It must've taken a lot of courage
to open up to me about the drama...

940
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,639
and that he was going to try out acting.

941
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:19,549
When he told me that
he was going to help me,

942
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:20,980
I was really grateful.

943
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,119
What is this? I think I like Dex.

944
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,920
Gosh. These guys are so sweet.

945
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,690
I didn't know
he would win me over this quickly.

946
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,920
(I'll keep Dex in my heart.)

947
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:31,560
That's his final decision.

948
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:33,830
- That's his final decision?
- He might pick Dex.

949
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,330
They might pick each other.
What do you think?

950
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,460
- I agree.
- The final decision.

951
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,369
- I think they'll pick each other.
- Right.

952
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:40,869
- I think I will pick him too.
- It's a done deal now.

953
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,670
A couple will be matched from the show.

954
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:44,810
(His first date with Dex,
a guy he doesn't know much about)

955
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,440
(It was awkward between them
as they both looked away.)

956
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:49,980
(They became curious about each other
as they found things in common.)

957
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,880
(Then when the new guy flirted...)

958
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,409
(Captivated by Dex)

959
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,610
(He moved on from Jealous84.)

960
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,150
(Don't steal Dex from me.)

961
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,089
I ended up opening up to him completely.

962
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,819
I'll pick you.

963
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,920
(The final decision: Dex and Lee Si Eon)

964
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,290
(We're close now.)

965
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:07,659
(Glancing)

966
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:09,429
They're coming.

967
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:10,529
They're here.

968
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:12,230
- They seem tired.
- They look exhausted.

969
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,170
The entire gang is together now.

970
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,500
(Kian84 and Pani Bottle join the couple.)

971
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,199
- Welcome.
- "Gracias."

972
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,369
- "Gracias."
- "Gracias."

973
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,009
- Isn't that "Thank you" in Spanish?
- Good job, you guys.

974
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:24,310
- The traffic jam was awful. It was crazy.
- Here you go.

975
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,509
- Have some food.
- You had to wait for a long time, right?

976
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:27,679
- Yes.
- No. It's okay.

977
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,750
We already rented all the motorcycles.

978
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,350
We parked them over there.
We set everything up.

979
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,449
- Let's eat first.
- Let's eat.

980
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:33,989
- I'll enjoy the food.
- Were there monkeys?

981
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:35,089
Did you see the monkeys?

982
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:36,460
(Opening his mouth wide)

983
00:37:37,259 --> 00:37:38,790
He must've been so hungry.

984
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,560
You were enjoying it so much.

985
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,860
(Savoring)

986
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,560
- This is so good.
- I ordered it for you.

987
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,830
Pani Bottle, that guy...

988
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,869
will bring the suitcases to the airport.

989
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:50,270
We can't load them on the motorcycle.

990
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:52,670
We have helmets,

991
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,469
but we don't have goggles.

992
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:57,040
So I brought them from Korea.

993
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,310
- You did?
- Yes.

994
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:00,009
I brought everything I had.

995
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:01,210
For everyone.

996
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,619
It must've been heavy.

997
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:04,150
There's a reason why your bag is big.

998
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,319
You brought four?

999
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:06,350
I have this one.

1000
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,560
- This is for Pani Bottle.
- Okay.

1001
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:11,060
- I thought Kian84 wouldn't wear goggles.
- Okay.

1002
00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:13,489
- So I prepared windshield glasses.
- I like this.

1003
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:14,659
He's so thoughtful.

1004
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,900
- He thought about their taste too.
- This is cool.

1005
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,299
- I like glasses like this.
- This one is to wipe the glasses.

1006
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,730
Keep it. It's for you.

1007
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,000
- Why are you giving it to me?
- No, I...

1008
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,239
What about me?

1009
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,940
- Did you bring something for me too?
- No.

1010
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,810
You did.

1011
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,179
You're joking with him now.

1012
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:31,580
Yes. We got a lot closer.

1013
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,210
- We can pick one of these.
- Yes.

1014
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,710
You pick first. I'll have the other one.

1015
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,420
Both are mine anyway, so...

1016
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,080
- You're a prankster.
- Under the sunlight,

1017
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,190
it becomes dark.

1018
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,290
(Foodie)

1019
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,290
- "Foodie."
- Do you have that thing?

1020
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,920
- The radio?
- Yes.

1021
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,389
- We should keep a safe distance.
- It's a must.

1022
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:47,759
The Bluetooth radio.

1023
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,060
There's no traffic light.

1024
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,569
I'll be in the head
and Dex will be in the tail.

1025
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,799
(I see.)

1026
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:53,799
So...

1027
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:55,299
(Excited)

1028
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,339
What time should we leave then?

1029
00:38:57,339 --> 00:38:58,969
- In five minutes?
- Take a rest...

1030
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,210
- and get ready.
- Yes.

1031
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,339
- Let's meet after ten minutes.
- Let's go.

1032
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,239
- I'll eat more.
- First...

1033
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,850
- No.
- Take a look at the motorcycles.

1034
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,750
- Are you not worried?
- Let's see the motorcycles first...

1035
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,779
- Yes.
- before taking a rest.

1036
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,679
- Let's take a look first and come back.
- What's this?

1037
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,020
As expected of Tzuyang Bottle.

1038
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,819
(Even the eldest guy
can't stop his gluttony.)

1039
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,759
(Eating)

1040
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:18,560
He's cute.

1041
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:21,460
You should do an eating show on YouTube.

1042
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,100
(Alter ego: Tzuyang Bottle)

1043
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,569
- I enjoyed the food.
- Okay. Let's go.

1044
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:26,830
(The break is over.)

1045
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,469
(The sun is in the middle of the sky now.)

1046
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,500
I enjoyed the food.

1047
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,739
Let's go.

1048
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,380
Sandro, my friend.

1049
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,139
- He's my friend.
- Oh, yes.

1050
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,909
Hey, Sandro, you handsome guy.

1051
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:40,580
Lacoste, man.

1052
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,080
- Hey, brother.
- Lacoste. Yes.

1053
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,580
- My brother. Yes.
- Hi.

1054
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,449
I can tell which motorcycle is for whom.

1055
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,389
What? It's pretty.

1056
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,889
- I'll ride this one.
- Okay.

1057
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,159
You'll ride this one.

1058
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,429
This one is for Pani Bottle.

1059
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:56,299
Yes. I can tell it's mine.

1060
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:58,369
This is for Dex. It's very high.

1061
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,529
Dex got a perfect one for him too.

1062
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,040
The suitcases and the bags.

1063
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,100
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1064
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,170
- Okay.
- Please.

1065
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,509
Guys, take out all your bags.

1066
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:09,739
- Put them here.
- Because it's dangerous.

1067
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:11,279
- He's the leader.
- He's indeed the leader.

1068
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:14,279
Si Eon knows a lot about motorcycles.

1069
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,549
We can just let him decide.

1070
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,350
(After giving them his bags,
he's checking the windshield sunglasses.)

1071
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,020
This is nice.

1072
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,119
(Impressed)

1073
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,589
I can see the Sun too.

1074
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:25,929
- That's nice.
- His strong eyes.

1075
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,460
(He has to wear a helmet now.)

1076
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:30,830
The big one was small for him.

1077
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,799
So he got a super big one.

1078
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:34,670
I have a big head.

1079
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:37,969
Is it perhaps...

1080
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,009
- It's good.
- Yes. It fit my head.

1081
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:43,279
This one is really big.

1082
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,350
- Isn't it nice?
- It's nice.

1083
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,679
You look good in the helmet, Pani Bottle.

1084
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,779
- I'm jealous.
- This is perfect. The small helmet.

1085
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:51,719
- He looks good in it.
- It's not small.

1086
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,889
- Is it not?
- He looks cute.

1087
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:54,389
- It's pretty.
- It's cute.

1088
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:55,389
- You look good in it.
- It's perfect.

1089
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,889
When you're wearing a helmet,
you should use the radio like this.

1090
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,029
Look at this.

1091
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,929
- Turn it on.
- Let's press it.

1092
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:01,960
- Give it a try.
- This...

1093
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,699
is the most important.
We can talk through this.

1094
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:06,369
This is an essential item
for motorcycle riders.

1095
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,569
- I don't hear anything.
- It popped up. The Bluetooth.

1096
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,339
- Beep.
- Does it have the Bluetooth sign?

1097
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:12,509
I don't hear anything.

1098
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:15,040
- Hello?
- I can't hear it.

1099
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,409
- Look.
- I can't hear it.

1100
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:17,880
Can you hear me, Pani Bottle?

1101
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,110
- I hear it.
- I can't hear it.

1102
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,380
- Why can't I hear it?
- Hold on.

1103
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,219
Kian84. Pani Bottle.

1104
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,719
- Dex.
- Hello.

1105
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:24,750
- Hello.
- Say something, Dex.

1106
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,119
- One, two.
- Hello?

1107
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,020
(The eldest one is fixing the error.)

1108
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:30,489
- Public.
- It said, "Public."

1109
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,290
Okay. Say something.

1110
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,460
It works. I hear Kian84.

1111
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,830
I can hear it.

1112
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,699
- Say it again.
- I can hear it.

1113
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,029
Hello?

1114
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,029
(The issue with
the second eldest's device is fixed.)

1115
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:42,569
Hello?

1116
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:43,940
- Wait.
- Hello?

1117
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,369
(But the second-youngest one
still has a connection issue.)

1118
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:47,969
I'm Park Jae Han.

1119
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,779
Who is he calling?

1120
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,080
- Hello?
- Four people.

1121
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
Four.

1122
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,279
- Four people.
- It's working.

1123
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,819
- I can hear it.
- I can hear it.

1124
00:41:55,819 --> 00:41:57,549
I can hear it. It's working now.

1125
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,719
It'll take about an hour and a half
by motorcycle.

1126
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,759
- An hour and a half.
- It's going to be fun.

1127
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,290
(The 2 older ones get on it 1st.)

1128
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,819
(Screaming)

1129
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:06,360
- Is it because it's hot?
- It's hot.

1130
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:08,130
What was the sound?
I heard someone screaming.

1131
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,929
I think my buttocks will be cooked.

1132
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,069
It felt like my buttocks would be cooked
like some pork.

1133
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:18,239
This is a very aggressive posture.

1134
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,170
(The youngest one
is checking the motorcycle as well.)

1135
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,210
He looks cool.

1136
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:23,339
Let's make a turn.

1137
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:24,679
- Dex.
- Yes?

1138
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:25,710
Do you want to switch?

1139
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,779
Try this.

1140
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,580
- Are you okay with it?
- I'm okay.

1141
00:42:30,819 --> 00:42:33,290
I got a small motorcycle.

1142
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:35,920
Dex is a better rider than me,
so I asked him to switch.

1143
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,290
You had to be in an aggressive position
on that motorcycle.

1144
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,830
Dex was considerate.

1145
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,929
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

1146
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,569
We're ready.

1147
00:42:45,569 --> 00:42:46,569
(The four brothers are ready.)

1148
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,600
Si Eon's motorcycle
has the biggest engine.

1149
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:54,009
It's cool.

1150
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:56,940
(Vroom)

1151
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,880
I was excited.

1152
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,380
Dex, it's a nice posture.

1153
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,409
(Laughing)

1154
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,750
- Let me go 1st.
- The leader is going 1st.

1155
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,750
Kian84, follow him.

1156
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,850
No. I'll go third.

1157
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,759
Until we got to the airport,
Si Eon led us in the head.

1158
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:12,830
And the younger ones followed him.

1159
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,460
We're going to turn left.

1160
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:16,100
Left.

1161
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,130
Left?

1162
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,500
(They're turning left
with the help of the human traffic light.)

1163
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,969
- Turn left.
- Turning left.

1164
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:24,699
Thank you.

1165
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,710
It's nice.

1166
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,779
Everyone likes riding a motorcycle.

1167
00:43:29,779 --> 00:43:31,639
- Right.
- It looks nice.

1168
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,549
It's amazing
that all of us can ride a motorcycle.

1169
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:35,650
It's amazing.

1170
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,489
Why don't we cheer once?

1171
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,089
In 1, 2, 3, we got this!

1172
00:43:40,089 --> 00:43:41,750
- We got this!
- We got this!

1173
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,089
Anna.

1174
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:44,719
Ala Shilla.

1175
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:45,929
Maru.

1176
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:49,400
It's the combination of Bolivia and India.

1177
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:51,460
Right.

1178
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,000
In Peru, actually...

1179
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:56,839
I had so much fun.

1180
00:43:58,509 --> 00:44:00,969
(The 1st destination
in season 1 was South America.)

1181
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:03,080
The riding course in Peru...

1182
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,179
is famous among motorcycle riders
all over the world.

1183
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:07,880
It was so beautiful.

1184
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,480
(A 390km journey where they drove along
the Route of the Sun)

1185
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,389
- It's incredible.
- Gosh.

1186
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:14,449
- Is it a postcard?
- Look at that.

1187
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:15,920
That place is amazing.

1188
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,429
It's something I can be proud of
in my life. Seriously.

1189
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:21,690
We're going to turn right.

1190
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,500
We're turning left over there.

1191
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,969
- I got it.
- Okay.

1192
00:44:26,299 --> 00:44:27,869
He's the control tower. Very cool.

1193
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:30,339
- It looks like he's a bodyguard.
- The control tower.

1194
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:32,639
(Surprised)

1195
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,909
(As they had a tough schedule
at a high altitude,)

1196
00:44:34,969 --> 00:44:36,580
(the Prince of High Mountains was born.)

1197
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,210
I'm watching it again,
but it's still amazing.

1198
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,679
(It wasn't a comfortable trip,)

1199
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,949
(but they were happy while they were
traveling South America by motorcycle.)

1200
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:48,759
The four of us gathered.

1201
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:52,290
The one thing we all like
is to ride a motorcycle.

1202
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:58,670
(The youngest enjoyed nature
while riding a motorcycle in India.)

1203
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:02,940
I think it was meaningful...

1204
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,239
to do something we all enjoy together.

1205
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,009
I thought the four of us
were the perfect combination to travel.

1206
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,449
I'm happy.

1207
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:15,210
(The four brothers are happy.)

1208
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,589
- Let's turn right.
- I got you.

1209
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,219
Watch out for the cars.

1210
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,759
Be careful.

1211
00:45:27,529 --> 00:45:29,560
Watch out for the cars.

1212
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,469
(Approaching)

1213
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,000
The cars keep trying to cut me off.

1214
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,270
Let's be careful until the cars are gone.

1215
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,610
- Yes.
- I got it.

1216
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,339
- You should be careful no matter what.
- Yes.

1217
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:42,710
Because there's no traffic light.

1218
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,639
Si Eon looked at the map...

1219
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:46,580
and watched the road in the head.

1220
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,210
So we could travel safely.

1221
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:51,250
It must be hard for the one in the front.

1222
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,520
- Right.
- Looking this and that.

1223
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,549
That's why the best rider is in the head.

1224
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,860
There's a hole.

1225
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,000
Watch out for the hole in the road.

1226
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,400
Watch out for the hole.

1227
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:04,659
Okay.

1228
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,469
I think we should turn right.

1229
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:09,339
Let's turn right.

1230
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,739
Turn right.

1231
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,770
(They're traveling without a problem,
following the eldest's lead.)

1232
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:16,239
(He's still a reliable control tower.)

1233
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:17,540
He's indeed the leader.

1234
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,980
This scooter is so nice.

1235
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:21,350
It's nice, right?

1236
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:23,750
(Cheering)

1237
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,350
(Let me cut in.)

1238
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,790
A van is coming.

1239
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:30,159
Kian84 and Pani Bottle
are slightly lagging behind.

1240
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,759
- We're okay.
- Right.

1241
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:35,799
- Yes, they're behind the white bus.
- Yes.

1242
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,630
When you're traveling on motorcycles,
you tend to speak in that...

1243
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,900
particular way people speak
on two-way radios.

1244
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,409
- Like, "Yes, sure thing."
- "Yes."

1245
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,069
- It's like we turn into middle-aged men.
- Right.

1246
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,409
Yes.

1247
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:50,880
(He's like an excited middle-aged man.)

1248
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:52,549
Gosh, this is nice.

1249
00:46:52,549 --> 00:46:55,250
- Gosh.
- This is so nice.

1250
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,880
It really is. Look at the sky.

1251
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,049
- Gosh, look at that sky.
- That must have been great.

1252
00:47:01,049 --> 00:47:02,219
The weather was nice too.

1253
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,460
(Looking at the sky)

1254
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:08,089
We can start speeding now.

1255
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,529
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1256
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,429
The traffic congestion has cleared.

1257
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,069
The road is clear now.

1258
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:17,270
(They're finally facing an open road.)

1259
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,839
Gosh, we can speed now.

1260
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,139
- Come on.
- Goodness.

1261
00:47:20,509 --> 00:47:22,339
Let's go.

1262
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,549
Let's go to the airport.

1263
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,580
Let's go.

1264
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,080
(The youngest is boosting up speed.)

1265
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,719
- Dex. Gosh.
- It's like a scene from "Beat."

1266
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,250
It's like he's Jung Woo Sung in Africa.

1267
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,759
- I was getting heated up.
- Gosh.

1268
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:39,290
This is it.

1269
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,029
The air is getting fresher.

1270
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:43,560
- This is so fun.
- Right?

1271
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,929
- It's so fun.
- It's joyful as I expected.

1272
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:50,239
(He's excited.)

1273
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:53,869
I like this.

1274
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:57,310
The road to the airport was so smooth.

1275
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,380
It was great for riding motorcycles.

1276
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,650
Gosh, it's so nice.

1277
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,250
Goodness, the weather is great too.

1278
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,580
Gosh.

1279
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:06,150
This is better than drinking alcohol.

1280
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,219
You like it better than drinking?

1281
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:09,259
Enjoy the scenery too. Gosh.

1282
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,690
Gosh.

1283
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,659
I didn't realize Antananarivo
had such great scenery.

1284
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,630
I didn't notice it when we got here.

1285
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,730
Look at that sky, though.

1286
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,869
It must feel so different from
when you're in a car.

1287
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:21,699
- It is.
- When you're on a motorcycle,

1288
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,270
you get a panoramic view,

1289
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:24,699
so it's completely different.

1290
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:28,909
I'm so happy!

1291
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,009
(This is the best feeling.)

1292
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,779
Gosh.

1293
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,580
This is completely different
from South America.

1294
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:38,889
Right.

1295
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:41,750
When else would I be able to
ride a motorcycle in Madagascar?

1296
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,389
This is such an unbelievable experience.

1297
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,630
Gosh.

1298
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,429
What's also amazing is that
all four of us have similar hobbies.

1299
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:51,600
Watching the four of us having fun
while riding motorcycles...

1300
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,230
made me think that
we were perfect for each other.

1301
00:48:53,529 --> 00:48:56,069
When you bring people together,
there's bound to be conflict.

1302
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,940
But we get along with each other.

1303
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,369
That doesn't mean we have
similar personalities, though.

1304
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,110
We're all different from each other.

1305
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,080
I think that's very interesting,

1306
00:49:03,139 --> 00:49:07,179
and I feel like it's going to be hard
for me to meet...

1307
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,520
- better travel partners than them.
- Gosh.

1308
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,719
This really is the best group.

1309
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,889
Incoming cows.

1310
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:15,389
- Let's slow down.
- Cows?

1311
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:16,860
There are cows on our right.

1312
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:21,889
(Scanning)

1313
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:24,730
There's a helicopter at your 1 o'clock
up in the sky.

1314
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,770
We even saw a helicopter.

1315
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,239
(Even trivial parts of the scenery
are giving them joy.)

1316
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,270
Gosh, this is amazing.

1317
00:49:33,509 --> 00:49:34,710
I feel so light-hearted.

1318
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:36,810
Look at how green the fields are.

1319
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,239
(Fields of green are widely spread
in front of them.)

1320
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:40,080
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

1321
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,350
(Beeping)

1322
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:45,819
- What?
- What is he doing?

1323
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:48,020
I wanted them to beep after me.

1324
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,819
(Glancing)

1325
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:51,089
Who was that?

1326
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,929
(It's me, the youngest.)

1327
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:56,529
Who's playing the beat
that brings out Korean patriotism...

1328
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,630
right in the middle of Madagascar?

1329
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,029
(Republic of Korea)

1330
00:50:00,569 --> 00:50:03,440
(Beeping)

1331
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,170
It's giving me flashbacks of 2002.

1332
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,540
They're so excited.

1333
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,270
(Feeling dignified)

1334
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:09,380
It's amazing.

1335
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:12,610
I'm having so much fun.

1336
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:16,549
This is so great.

1337
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:19,420
Is everyone okay with the speed?

1338
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,690
Yes.

1339
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,560
I'm okay.

1340
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:23,790
All right.

1341
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,560
I think we're nearing the airport.

1342
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,159
Right. If we're by the lake, it means
we're almost at the airport.

1343
00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:33,770
I see the lake.

1344
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,529
We're almost there.

1345
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:37,040
- Already?
- Right.

1346
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,139
It's so close.

1347
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:39,869
You're there already?

1348
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:42,710
We were having so much fun
that time just flew by.

1349
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,380
So long, Antananarivo.

1350
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,949
Say goodbye, Si Eon.

1351
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,080
Say goodbye to Antananarivo.

1352
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:53,219
Goodbye, Antananarivo.

1353
00:50:54,089 --> 00:50:56,560
Say goodbye to Antananarivo, guys.

1354
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,960
It was a blast, Antananarivo.

1355
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,659
Our time here is over now.
I almost got attached.

1356
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,130
We made great memories here.

1357
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,869
This is the only place I've been to,
but it was great.

1358
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,239
(Meanwhile, the second-oldest brother
is sad about leaving.)

1359
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:14,469
This is goodbye.

1360
00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:15,980
Bye.

1361
00:51:17,009 --> 00:51:18,810
So long, gym.

1362
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:22,350
So long,

1363
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,850
Vanilla Lady.

1364
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,489
(The power of goodbye even romanticized
his experience of being ripped off.)

1365
00:51:28,489 --> 00:51:29,619
It's all an experience.

1366
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:31,589
What? I guess we're here.

1367
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:32,730
I'm sad.

1368
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,429
We haven't even sped
past level four on the motorcycle.

1369
00:51:35,529 --> 00:51:37,659
Let's go ride around the parking lot.

1370
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:39,000
Sure.

1371
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,580
What a bummer.

1372
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,710
It's a total bummer.

1373
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:54,009
- I did feel sad to leave.
- It's understandable.

1374
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,779
Still, coming to an end
when it's sad to do so...

1375
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,619
- Right.
- will allow you to move on to the next.

1376
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:59,650
I feel like we haven't had enough. Gosh.

1377
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,150
We had fun, still.

1378
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,020
- That was such an exciting ride.
- Right.

1379
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,699
How do we return these?

1380
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,630
They'll come to pick them up.

1381
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,699
Do we just park them here
and go tell them?

1382
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:15,000
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1383
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,739
- Lacoste man.
- How was your trip?

1384
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:19,040
- What's up, Sandro?
- It was very good.

1385
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,310
- Hey, guys.
- The ride was too short.

1386
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,980
Do you want me to
insert the key in the ignition?

1387
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:26,210
Okay.

1388
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,449
- Where are our bags?
- Your bags are here.

1389
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:30,150
- Over there.
- Okay.

1390
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,690
It was perfect. Things aren't supposed to
go so smoothly on trips.

1391
00:52:33,089 --> 00:52:34,219
Thank you.

1392
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,650
- Lacoste man.
- Thank you.

1393
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,219
- Good seeing you.
- Thank you.

1394
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,060
- Let's go.
- Take care.

1395
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,759
Gosh. Antananarivo.

1396
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,699
- I'm sad to go.
- Time really flew by, though.

1397
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:46,100
It feels like our ride was ten minutes.

1398
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,830
(They leave behind their disappointment
and head to the airport.)

1399
00:52:49,869 --> 00:52:52,339
(Kian84 turns on the self-camera
before they leave Antananarivo.)

1400
00:52:52,909 --> 00:52:54,509
(Humming)

1401
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,239
Do you recognize this place, everyone?

1402
00:52:57,009 --> 00:52:59,580
This is where we began
"Adventure by Accident 3."

1403
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,580
We're at Antananarivo airport.

1404
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,679
There was the first lightning festival,

1405
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:07,150
"Psionic storm!"

1406
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,589
Gosh, the lightning is so picturesque.

1407
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:10,759
so we unintentionally began our trip here.

1408
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,290
Here, we...

1409
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,960
It feels so sentimental.
He was by himself.

1410
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:17,529
(He had felt depressed
from the series of rip-offs,)

1411
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:19,900
A lot has happened to him.

1412
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,130
(but the lightning comforted him
and lifted his mood.)

1413
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,900
(His younger brothers threw him
a surprise birthday party too.)

1414
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,569
(Happy)

1415
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,839
I experienced the funeral culture
in the countryside.

1416
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:31,279
- You really had a variety of experiences.
- We did experience a lot.

1417
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:33,279
(They became one with Madagascar
through these moments.)

1418
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:34,350
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1419
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,279
Also, I didn't think he'd come,

1420
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:38,219
- but Si Eon...
- His visit was a gift.

1421
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:40,250
(Si Eon's surprise appearance)

1422
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:42,219
showed up without getting the hint.

1423
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:45,060
(Joyful)

1424
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,860
No wonder I felt like
I was walking on eggshells.

1425
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,029
(You know how I feel about you.)

1426
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:49,929
(The four brothers walked the streets
of Antananarivo together.)

1427
00:53:49,929 --> 00:53:52,429
It felt like a combination
of seasons 1 and 2.

1428
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:54,529
(Sometimes he walked by himself.)

1429
00:53:54,529 --> 00:53:56,139
They went to the university too.

1430
00:53:56,739 --> 00:53:58,639
It feels like our group is whole,

1431
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,610
so it's refreshing, and I feel good.

1432
00:54:03,009 --> 00:54:05,080
We're now leaving this place,

1433
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:07,009
and we're moving on
to the final location of this trip.

1434
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,580
Where are we going? I forgot again.

1435
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:13,920
My memory seems to be declining.

1436
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:15,489
Anyway,

1437
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:18,159
there's Pani Bottle,
who's indispensable when traveling.

1438
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:21,089
Dex, who knows his way
into women's hearts.

1439
00:54:21,089 --> 00:54:24,060
Si Eon, who came here
without taking the hint.

1440
00:54:24,529 --> 00:54:27,199
And me. The four of us will...

1441
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,670
prepare well for our trip
until the very end.

1442
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:31,799
This is the best combination of people.

1443
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:34,170
We'll soon be on a plane there,

1444
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,610
so I'll be back with Kian84 TV then.

1445
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:39,580
(It's now Si Eon TV instead of Kian84 TV.)

1446
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:41,350
Where are we going?

1447
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,219
We are now going to Nosy Be.

1448
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:44,250
- Nosy Be.
- Yes.

1449
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,779
- It'll take us about an hour and a half.
- Yes.

1450
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,850
It's a very famous vacation spot
in Madagascar.

1451
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,489
(The clear ocean awaits them.)

1452
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:52,690
- Look at the color of the ocean.
- Gosh.

1453
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:54,389
It's amazing.

1454
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,100
- It's like the Jeju Island of Madagascar.
- I see.

1455
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:00,469
Apparently, a lot of tourists go there.

1456
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:02,230
- I've never been there.
- It looks nice.

1457
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,940
I've always wanted to go there.

1458
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,670
The purpose of season three was the ocean,

1459
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:08,210
so we're finishing off with the ocean.

1460
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:10,540
The plane is small.

1461
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,949
It's better than you think.

1462
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:15,179
Gosh, this is really the end.

1463
00:55:15,509 --> 00:55:17,449
The end?
This is my first location of the trip.

1464
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:18,719
(Si Eon is puzzled.)

1465
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,150
I just got here, and it's over.

1466
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,619
(It'll take them an hour and a half
from Antananarivo to Nosy Be.)

1467
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,159
The sun is setting. It's almost evening.

1468
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:31,199
We've arrived on the island
called Nosy Be.

1469
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:32,299
Nosy Be.

1470
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,670
As soon as I land,
I can feel the humidity.

1471
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,270
- Oh, my.
- It feels similar...

1472
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:41,270
- to the summer in Korea.
- I know.

1473
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:44,380
Madagascar is indeed huge, though.

1474
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,150
They have diverse seasons in one country.

1475
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:49,110
- I know. It's so fascinating.
- It's amazing.

1476
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,219
(Glancing over)

1477
00:55:52,179 --> 00:55:54,949
Si Eon got close to Dex in a short time.

1478
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:56,819
- Is he jealous?
- He's jealous?

1479
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:58,259
- He's quite jealous.
- Jealous84.

1480
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:01,460
I think Dex is stressed out by him...

1481
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:03,400
but is playing along with him for now.

1482
00:56:03,529 --> 00:56:06,330
Like, "I should take care of the old man."

1483
00:56:07,569 --> 00:56:09,739
None of our bags are here yet.

1484
00:56:09,739 --> 00:56:11,440
(The eldest is sad.)

1485
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,139
Wait.
The three of you checked in your luggage.

1486
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:16,339
- Yes.
- Only Kian84 had one bag.

1487
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:19,310
The rest of us checked in our bags,
but they were not coming out.

1488
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,210
If we're really lucky,
we can see whale sharks.

1489
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:22,819
- Gosh.
- Whale sharks.

1490
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,650
If I see a whale shark,

1491
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:27,049
I will feel overwhelmed.

1492
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:28,489
There are blue whales too.

1493
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:29,759
It'd be amazing if we could see them.

1494
00:56:29,759 --> 00:56:31,619
When you're out on a boat,

1495
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:34,659
- whales sometimes lift their tails.
- Seriously.

1496
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:36,799
I heard blue whales sleep
while standing in the water.

1497
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,000
- Why?
- I saw that.

1498
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,429
- I saw it. They do that.
- They sleep in a standing position.

1499
00:56:41,429 --> 00:56:43,440
How do you know? You haven't even asked.

1500
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,299
Well, people documented it.

1501
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:48,770
The US acknowledged the existence of UFOs.

1502
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,639
It's hard to follow their conversation.

1503
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:52,980
What does UFO have to do with blue whales?

1504
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,549
I mean...

1505
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:57,049
You know what? UFO is not equal to aliens.

1506
00:56:57,049 --> 00:57:00,489
UFO means unidentified flying object.

1507
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:02,659
- All of a sudden?
- It means we don't know what it is.

1508
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,520
- It might be related to aliens.
- I know what UFOs are.

1509
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,360
They're operated by people
from the future.

1510
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,900
- UFOs are their time machines.
- Our luggage didn't arrive,

1511
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,159
so we kept talking nonsense.

1512
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:12,900
- Dex, let's go.
- That's possible.

1513
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,400
- Because...
- I can't stay here.

1514
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,199
- But UFOs are not aliens.
- Goodness.

1515
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:19,540
I made them argue and left.

1516
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,110
- Good job.
- It's that.

1517
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:22,839
You guys seem to hit it off.

1518
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,909
- Gosh.
- We're the best team.

1519
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:27,679
- Let's stick together.
- Si Eon, this is what I learned.

1520
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:30,520
Once you get close to Dex,
he stops reacting often.

1521
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:32,790
- They just met.
- He reacts well for now...

1522
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:34,290
- because you're getting close.
- Exactly.

1523
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,860
He responded to me
with enthusiasm at first.

1524
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,119
"Hey, do you want to eat this?" "Really?"

1525
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,389
"I would love to!"

1526
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,929
By the time we went home,
he didn't even respond when I called him.

1527
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
- He must have been tired.
- I had to call him four times.

1528
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,699
"Dex!"

1529
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:50,639
I was really tired,

1530
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:52,569
and he kept calling me without noticing.

1531
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,540
- You should've called him Mr. Dex.
- Right.

1532
00:57:55,009 --> 00:57:57,040
- At 1st...
- When you 1st join a game,

1533
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,580
- they give you bonuses.
- It's like a discount deal.

1534
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,710
As we speak, the suitcases are coming out.

1535
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:04,119
Here it comes.

1536
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:06,089
Si Eon's luggage.

1537
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,119
The luggage is coming out.

1538
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:10,060
(The eldest brother picks up
his bag first.)

1539
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,460
(Then the conveyor belt stops.)

1540
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,560
- What is it?
- What?

1541
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,989
- It stopped.
- Why did it stop again?

1542
00:58:16,029 --> 00:58:17,429
Why did they only get one bag?

1543
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:19,060
Sometimes,
you don't get all your bags at once.

1544
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,569
It stopped.

1545
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:24,100
What is it called? Garter belt?

1546
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,310
- Garter belt?
- Garter belt?

1547
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,639
Pani Bottle, what is it called?

1548
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:30,440
- Garter belt.
- Conveyor belt.

1549
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,909
- Conveyor belt.
- I'm sorry.

1550
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:33,380
- It's called a conveyor belt.
- I called it a garter belt.

1551
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:34,909
You got half of it right, though.

1552
00:58:34,909 --> 00:58:37,049
- Half of it right?
- That's good enough.

1553
00:58:37,049 --> 00:58:38,750
(Their luggage doesn't arrive
while they're talking about the belt.)

1554
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,089
The foreigners on our right
are also waiting for their luggage.

1555
00:58:43,089 --> 00:58:44,989
When that happens,
the one with no luggage is the winner.

1556
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:49,330
(Winner84, who didn't check in his bag,
plops down to relax.)

1557
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:52,869
- Who didn't get their luggage?
- You.

1558
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:55,569
- Me and Pani Bottle.
- I didn't get mine either.

1559
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:58,469
I guess they put big luggage
further in the back.

1560
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:02,779
(They kept waiting.)

1561
00:59:02,779 --> 00:59:04,339
We waited for a while.

1562
00:59:04,339 --> 00:59:05,839
- Oh, my.
- For about an hour.

1563
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:07,150
It must be exhausting.

1564
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,449
Maybe it didn't pass through security.

1565
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:12,850
(People start to leave.)

1566
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:15,989
(Why are they leaving?)

1567
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,759
Look at that. People suddenly left.

1568
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:20,360
Did they give up their luggage?

1569
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:21,630
What happened?

1570
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:23,900
How come everyone left
except for the three of them?

1571
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,960
I realized we were left alone
at some point.

1572
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,500
Please come out.

1573
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,009
How many suitcases didn't arrive?

1574
00:59:33,009 --> 00:59:34,710
- No way.
- Gosh.

1575
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,679
Goodness. There's no way.

1576
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,139
(Looking around
with the camera in a hurry)

1577
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:40,279
Even the crew's luggage hasn't arrived.

1578
00:59:40,279 --> 00:59:42,179
If there's a problem,
they must announce it.

1579
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:44,080
- I know.
- There wasn't really an announcement.

1580
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,850
- You can't just keep waiting.
- They're waiting somewhere else.

1581
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:49,719
Why aren't they unloading the luggage?

1582
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,819
- Shouldn't they find out why?
- Shouldn't we ask?

1583
00:59:51,819 --> 00:59:52,860
Yes. Ask.

1584
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,889
(Standing up)

1585
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:58,000
We've been waiting for our bags.

1586
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,429
- Why bag?
- "Why bag?"

1587
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:02,230
- Why aren't they on the conveyor belt?
- "Why bag?"

1588
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:03,239
(How would I know?)

1589
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,900
That's a currency exchange booth.

1590
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:06,909
- Currency exchange booth?
- Yes.

1591
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:08,440
Isn't it where you get your tickets?

1592
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,409
I felt so frustrated.

1593
01:00:10,409 --> 01:00:12,179
She must have thought
you wanted to exchange currencies.

1594
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:13,509
Si Eon.

1595
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,449
(Come here.)

1596
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:16,920
What's going on?

1597
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,449
(What's going on?)

1598
01:00:19,279 --> 01:00:21,850
Even the crew didn't
get their luggage, right?

1599
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,259
(The crew nods.)

1600
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:26,659
What is this?

1601
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:28,230
(Glancing over)

1602
01:00:28,989 --> 01:00:30,560
They're waiting somewhere else.

1603
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,560
There was a waiting place outside.

1604
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,730
Pani Bottle is indeed good.

1605
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,969
I didn't know what they were waiting for
at that time.

1606
01:00:36,569 --> 01:00:39,239
(Murmuring)

1607
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:43,440
It's not just 1 or 2 bags.
Quite a few bags haven't arrived.

1608
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:47,309
Excuse me. Do you know what happened here?

1609
01:00:47,749 --> 01:00:51,579
We understand that none of the bags came,

1610
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,349
and that they're coming tomorrow.

1611
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,090
- What?
- Coming tomorrow.

1612
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,550
- Really?
- Yes.

1613
01:00:57,019 --> 01:00:59,260
They'll be on the same flight
tomorrow afternoon.

1614
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:01,829
They're coming at the same hour tomorrow?

1615
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:03,090
What?

1616
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:04,729
The airline made a mistake...

1617
01:01:04,729 --> 01:01:07,329
and didn't load my luggage...

1618
01:01:07,329 --> 01:01:09,599
and more than half of the staff's luggage.

1619
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,740
It didn't even leave Antananarivo.

1620
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:13,200
Things were going so well in Antananarivo.

1621
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,410
- I knew it.
- I know.

1622
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:16,010
Nothing goes as planned.

1623
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:17,840
- But...
- What do you have to do?

1624
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,439
they'll have other luggage to load
from the customers tomorrow.

1625
01:01:19,439 --> 01:01:20,950
Will they have enough room
for your luggage?

1626
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:23,150
I guess half of the customers tomorrow...

1627
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,680
will have their luggage the next day.

1628
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,479
So it keeps going?

1629
01:01:26,479 --> 01:01:27,990
- They keep loading half of it only?
- They only load half of it.

1630
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,950
It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul?

1631
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,789
I'll ask them.

1632
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:33,930
(Inside the airport,
they're also finding out what's going on.)

1633
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,660
- What?
- What is it?

1634
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:38,660
- The airport is closed.
- Closed.

1635
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,130
They turned off the lights
without a warning.

1636
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,769
They have a good work-life balance there.

1637
01:01:42,769 --> 01:01:44,169
They're asking us to leave.

1638
01:01:44,169 --> 01:01:45,700
- You should leave when it's closed.
- "Get out."

1639
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,039
Excuse me.

1640
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:48,910
Our bags haven't arrived.

1641
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:50,380
We didn't get our bags.

1642
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,510
(Please go outside and check.)

1643
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,309
That's the baggage claim? What?

1644
01:01:55,309 --> 01:01:57,280
That's when we first realized
that we had to go out.

1645
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,220
It's not just us.

1646
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,389
- Lots of them didn't get their bags.
- Right.

1647
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:03,990
I was so clueless that I carried the cart
to load their bags.

1648
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,189
(Carrying his luggage only)

1649
01:02:05,189 --> 01:02:06,490
I feel bad.

1650
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,189
(They join Pani Bottle,
who figured out what's going on.)

1651
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,160
- What do we do?
- What?

1652
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,829
- Our luggage is coming tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

1653
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,999
- I think so.
- What?

1654
01:02:13,999 --> 01:02:15,229
(They can't believe the shocking news.)

1655
01:02:15,229 --> 01:02:17,030
- Our bags are coming tomorrow.
- They must be stunned.

1656
01:02:17,099 --> 01:02:18,200
They left them in Antananarivo.

1657
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:19,900
- They left them?
- It seems like it.

1658
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,970
That's ridiculous.

1659
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:24,479
That's not good. They left our bags.

1660
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,639
Then our luggage...

1661
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,610
Pani Bottle and I didn't get our bags.

1662
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,950
Do you have anything important there?
Do you have something to use?

1663
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,619
I put everything in my bag.

1664
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:34,289
- Oh, dear.
- Do you have anything you can use?

1665
01:02:34,289 --> 01:02:35,490
Do you have some clothes?
What do you have?

1666
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,650
- A short-sleeved shirt and shorts?
- I've got nothing.

1667
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:37,889
This pair is it.

1668
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,360
You can wear it for a little longer.

1669
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:43,229
Do you have your money?

1670
01:02:43,229 --> 01:02:45,099
- I have all my money here.
- You got your money.

1671
01:02:45,459 --> 01:02:47,329
- Where's your passport?
- I got mine here.

1672
01:02:47,329 --> 01:02:48,970
Right. You should have it with you.

1673
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:50,439
- You should have it on the plane.
- Right.

1674
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:52,340
My tent is in the bag too.

1675
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:54,269
- We can rent a tent.
- Yes.

1676
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,539
But I have nothing with me now.

1677
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,240
That's chaotic.

1678
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,880
- Wait. The crew doesn't have their bags.
- Do you have enough battery?

1679
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,479
- They can't film.
- They don't have all the gear.

1680
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:04,079
We can't film at all without a battery.

1681
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,619
You can't check in batteries,
so they must have them.

1682
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:09,820
- Pani Bottle is dependable.
- He's indeed good.

1683
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,360
Save the battery on your camera...

1684
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,959
- just in case.
- Still...

1685
01:03:14,689 --> 01:03:17,329
(The experienced entertainer
is only worried about the shoot.)

1686
01:03:17,959 --> 01:03:20,160
There was a real problem, though.

1687
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,229
Our audio directors
didn't get their gear, bags,

1688
01:03:23,229 --> 01:03:25,639
boom mics, and water-proof items.

1689
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:28,369
It could have interfered with our shoot.

1690
01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:29,510
You were scheduled to film in the ocean.

1691
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:31,410
If our mouths don't match the sound,
it's because we didn't have the mics...

1692
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:33,209
- and they added the sound later.
- They added it later.

1693
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,280
- The sound equipment hasn't arrived.
- Right.

1694
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,079
- Oh, dear.
- The whole team became Kian84...

1695
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,280
by the end of the trip...

1696
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:41,220
- because of the airline's mistake.
- But I got my bag.

1697
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,320
He was lucky.

1698
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:45,860
- People are waiting here...
- Do we have to write something?

1699
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,829
because they want to write down
the address...

1700
01:03:48,829 --> 01:03:51,800
to have their lost bags delivered.

1701
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,059
Right. They should deliver them.

1702
01:03:53,059 --> 01:03:55,470
- I've never experienced this. It's new.
- Well, this...

1703
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:58,499
They'll bring our luggage tomorrow,
but if we come here in the evening...

1704
01:03:58,499 --> 01:04:00,300
(If our luggage come tomorrow,
the problem is...)

1705
01:04:00,669 --> 01:04:02,539
(A few days ago,
Pani Bottle suggested a plan in Nosy Be.)

1706
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:06,139
(How about we rent a boat?)

1707
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,349
On the island?

1708
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,150
(They wanted to visit other islands
in Nosy Be as well.)

1709
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,249
Right.
They rented a boat to visit other islands.

1710
01:04:11,249 --> 01:04:13,990
We planned to go to another island
and camp there.

1711
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:16,919
We're going to stay one night there,
so even if our bags arrive tomorrow,

1712
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:19,419
- we won't be able to pick them up.
- Right.

1713
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:20,829
Actually, it'd be better to think...

1714
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:23,160
that we won't have our bags
until the end of the trip.

1715
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,630
- This is it.
- Pani Bottle has all his things there.

1716
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:27,729
- I'm going into Kian84 mode now.
- Right.

1717
01:04:27,729 --> 01:04:29,169
- Everyone is in Kian84 mode now.
- Yes.

1718
01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:30,499
- They'll have just one outfit from now.
- Yes.

1719
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:32,700
This place was what I looked forward to
the most in Madagascar.

1720
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,269
Goodness.

1721
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:36,439
- Gosh.
- Let's borrow things.

1722
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:37,740
That's good.

1723
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,010
- I understand why he's cursing.
- Goodness.

1724
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,510
- You can't help but curse.
- It must be infuriating.

1725
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:42,780
What is this?

1726
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,249
The airline... Seriously.

1727
01:04:45,249 --> 01:04:46,380
(After realizing what's going on,
he suddenly feels overwhelmed.)

1728
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,789
My luggage didn't arrive.

1729
01:04:48,749 --> 01:04:51,820
I got flustered when I heard
that it would come tomorrow.

1730
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:55,360
To me, Nosy Be was the highlight...

1731
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,559
of my Madagascar trip.

1732
01:04:57,229 --> 01:04:59,260
(He kept mentioning the island
even before the trip.)

1733
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,329
- He was excited about it in Korea too.
- Right.

1734
01:05:01,329 --> 01:05:04,169
(Nosy Be was the only item
on Pani Bottle's bucket list.)

1735
01:05:05,539 --> 01:05:07,869
I love diving into the ocean.

1736
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:12,139
Half of my luggage was filled
with diving gear.

1737
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:14,380
I didn't have much except for that.

1738
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,380
I got ticked off at that moment.

1739
01:05:17,419 --> 01:05:19,720
They failed to bring our bags
but didn't apologize for it.

1740
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,849
That's what they're usually like overseas.

1741
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:24,919
"Your bag is not here?
We'll bring it to you tomorrow."

1742
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:26,990
"So what?" It's like this.

1743
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,030
(It's normal to get angry
at unfriendly service.)

1744
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:29,660
They're not apologetic.

1745
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,360
This is absurd.

1746
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,499
- Pani Bottle was a little angry.
- I know.

1747
01:05:33,499 --> 01:05:34,999
- Of course.
- He's quite mad.

1748
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,840
I was surprised. It was unbelievable.

1749
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,099
They started loading our luggage
as we were getting on the plane.

1750
01:05:40,439 --> 01:05:42,309
Did they just stop loading halfway,

1751
01:05:42,809 --> 01:05:44,840
saying, "Hey, let's not load the rest."

1752
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:46,539
Was it like that?

1753
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,780
"Hey, stop. Stop loading."

1754
01:05:50,209 --> 01:05:52,249
And did they just leave?

1755
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:53,880
I don't know what to say.

1756
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,320
He's glad that he got his bag.

1757
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,090
That's why we had a good day yesterday.

1758
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,419
(Their Madagascar trip is unpredictable.)

1759
01:05:59,019 --> 01:06:00,930
(I can do nothing but smile.)

1760
01:06:01,189 --> 01:06:03,189
Still, I'm glad Si Eon has his bag.

1761
01:06:03,189 --> 01:06:05,160
- He must have lots of things in there.
- Of course.

1762
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,229
He and I are similar,

1763
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:09,930
- so I think he brought lots of things.
- I have many clothes.

1764
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:11,300
- New clothes too?
- I've got new clothes.

1765
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,499
- Extra underwear too?
- Si Eon is well-prepared.

1766
01:06:12,499 --> 01:06:13,800
I have new underwear too.

1767
01:06:14,439 --> 01:06:16,709
The great actor is indeed different.

1768
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,110
(Chuckling)

1769
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,849
I saw him before going to bed last night.

1770
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:23,579
He had a facial mask on his face.

1771
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:24,579
He did that all the way there too?

1772
01:06:24,579 --> 01:06:25,849
I thought he was similar to me.

1773
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:28,349
I prepared 30 facial masks too.

1774
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:29,550
Two masks per day.

1775
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:32,820
I saw Si Eon's bag on the cart...

1776
01:06:33,019 --> 01:06:35,490
and thought it wasn't the worst.

1777
01:06:35,889 --> 01:06:37,800
This is quite fun.

1778
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,599
- What happened?
- I like...

1779
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,829
- how something unexpected happened.
- I like it too.

1780
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:44,070
- I don't like it at all.
- It's so eventful.

1781
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:47,510
- What is this? Seriously.
- Pani Bottle is upset.

1782
01:06:47,769 --> 01:06:49,470
- Let's try to survive with my things.
- Okay.

1783
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:50,979
I've got some things too.

1784
01:06:50,979 --> 01:06:53,309
- Kian84, what do you have?
- Dental floss.

1785
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:54,680
- Dental floss?
- I've got some clothes.

1786
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:57,479
- We should buy some basic necessities.
- You'll buy some?

1787
01:06:57,479 --> 01:06:59,119
I have toothpaste and a toothbrush.

1788
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,389
I don't mind sharing my toothbrush.

1789
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,260
But they wouldn't want that.

1790
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,289
We can't do that
just because you're okay with it.

1791
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:08,130
- Do you have an extra?
- If I didn't have one,

1792
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,760
I wouldn't mind using yours.

1793
01:07:10,829 --> 01:07:12,130
I'd rather not brush my teeth.

1794
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,829
I was shocked when I saw his toothbrush.

1795
01:07:16,669 --> 01:07:17,840
It looked like a soccer field.

1796
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,200
- "Please throw me away."
- It looked like a grass field.

1797
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,639
My current toothbrush is sturdy.

1798
01:07:20,809 --> 01:07:23,340
- Are your gums okay?
- They're healthy.

1799
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:24,639
He's just a strong person.

1800
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:27,579
- He's actually stronger than you think.
- His toothbrush...

1801
01:07:27,579 --> 01:07:29,349
Do you get sick easily?

1802
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:31,050
- When I was little.
- When you were little.

1803
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:32,550
Kian84 is really strong.

1804
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:36,490
I'm not that surprised
that our bags didn't come, though.

1805
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:39,619
I'd be surprised
if the plane landed in the wrong place.

1806
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,389
It should be that bad to surprise me.

1807
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:42,630
That would be an accident.

1808
01:07:43,189 --> 01:07:44,329
- Gosh.
- Okay.

1809
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,700
- This is okay.
- I'm not mad for some reason.

1810
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,099
- I'm not angry either.
- Not at all.

1811
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:49,999
Because you have your bag.

1812
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:51,869
That's because I had my bag.

1813
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:53,900
- You have your things.
- You have everything with you.

1814
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,610
- You didn't know?
- I ended up...

1815
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:57,639
- acting like I was positive.
- Yes.

1816
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:01,050
(Kian84 and Si Eon have their bags,
and Dex has given up.)

1817
01:08:01,709 --> 01:08:04,119
I just accepted it right away.
"My luggage isn't here. I see."

1818
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:06,079
- Why am I angry alone?
- Are you angry?

1819
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:07,820
- Pani Bottle.
- I want to break everything down.

1820
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:09,550
- My goodness.
- It's like the last day of Bolivia.

1821
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:12,289
It's so normal how you feel.

1822
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:15,160
I've become more generous...

1823
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,630
than when I went to India.

1824
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,030
I couldn't understand at all.

1825
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:20,530
I was so angry,

1826
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:24,439
but Kian84, Si Eon, and Dex
were super relaxed.

1827
01:08:24,769 --> 01:08:28,340
I asked Dex why he wasn't angry,

1828
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:31,039
and he said getting angry
wouldn't change anything...

1829
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:33,539
because it already happened.

1830
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:36,079
Once he said that,
I realized he was right.

1831
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:38,019
It wasn't the worst either.

1832
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,680
We were safe and sound.

1833
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,150
We had our passports...

1834
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,289
- and our money.
- He realized something.

1835
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:45,590
- Getting mad won't bring you the bags.
- Right.

1836
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:48,189
So I calmed myself down.

1837
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:50,289
Thinking about it
makes me mad again, though.

1838
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:53,130
He still seems quite angry.

1839
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,999
There was only one flight
when we were at the airport.

1840
01:08:54,999 --> 01:08:56,269
How could they get confused?

1841
01:08:56,269 --> 01:08:57,740
I get it if they were busy.

1842
01:08:58,139 --> 01:09:00,070
But there... I'll stop here.

1843
01:09:00,139 --> 01:09:01,539
(Laughing)

1844
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:03,669
I should laugh.
You should smile to invite luck.

1845
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:07,439
Our bags didn't arrive. Then that's it.

1846
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:08,880
- What can we do?
- Because he had his bag with him.

1847
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:11,050
- You got your bag.
- Because his bag arrived.

1848
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:12,550
Can we fight with them or what?

1849
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,289
I just accepted it.

1850
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:17,349
We once stopped...

1851
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:19,660
at the intersection for an hour.

1852
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:20,660
(He couldn't understand why there was
a traffic jam at the intersection.)

1853
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:22,959
Lights would go out all of a sudden.

1854
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:26,599
Out of nowhere, dark clouds appeared
in the clear sky, and lightning struck.

1855
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,840
I got to accept those weird incidents.

1856
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,840
That happens.

1857
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,039
That kind of mindset really helps
when you travel.

1858
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:37,439
Right.
Your trip doesn't always go as planned.

1859
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,639
I learned a lesson.

1860
01:09:39,639 --> 01:09:41,349
I didn't learn a lesson.

1861
01:09:41,349 --> 01:09:42,709
I just had my bag with me.

1862
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:44,079
I know.

1863
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,550
Can you find out how to get a taxi?
I'll figure this one out.

1864
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,950
They pulled themselves together
and decided to leave.

1865
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:51,959
- We came to our senses.
- We had to split up to hurry.

1866
01:09:51,959 --> 01:09:54,590
If we leave our hotel address and number,

1867
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,490
they'll deliver our bags there.

1868
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:57,630
I'll ask them about it.

1869
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:58,959
What if...

1870
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:00,929
we don't get our bags until we leave?

1871
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:01,969
That would be an accident.

1872
01:10:02,269 --> 01:10:04,200
Kian84's drawing is in there.

1873
01:10:04,639 --> 01:10:06,469
- His knife and your helmet too.
- Right.

1874
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,910
- We'll get the bags anyway.
- We will.

1875
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:10,979
I don't mind losing anything...

1876
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:13,080
but my birthday gifts.

1877
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,349
- That's true.
- Right.

1878
01:10:14,349 --> 01:10:15,379
- He loved the gifts.
- I couldn't help getting mad.

1879
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:17,110
- I see why Pani Bottle was furious.
- Right.

1880
01:10:17,309 --> 01:10:18,820
Let's see how much a taxi ride would be.

1881
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:20,750
I'll be waiting here.

1882
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,719
Let's get ready to leave.

1883
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,750
(In charge of their taxi ride)

1884
01:10:24,589 --> 01:10:26,189
(In charge of communicating
with the airport staff)

1885
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,360
What time can we get our bags?

1886
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,030
You're much more generous...

1887
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:34,530
than I had heard.

1888
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,099
What did you hear about me?

1889
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:38,370
- They criticized you a lot.
- Did Kian84 try to come between us?

1890
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,110
- Taxi?
- Yes.

1891
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:43,110
- Okay.
- Okay.

1892
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:44,580
Which one is your car?

1893
01:10:45,339 --> 01:10:46,540
- This one.
- Okay. Let's go.

1894
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,080
- Let's check out his car.
- Okay.

1895
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,049
- Is this your car?
- Yes.

1896
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,580
(I see.)

1897
01:10:52,219 --> 01:10:54,320
- It's quite big.
- That looks nice.

1898
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,719
- It's a minivan.
- A minivan.

1899
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:57,150
How much would it cost?

1900
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:58,620
It'd be 80,000 ariaries.

1901
01:10:58,620 --> 01:10:59,990
- It's 80,000 ariaries?
- Yes.

1902
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,629
- It's 80,000 ariaries?
- Yes, it is.

1903
01:11:01,629 --> 01:11:03,259
- That's all right.
- Our lodging was far away.

1904
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,299
- It was.
- Right.

1905
01:11:04,299 --> 01:11:05,700
- One person should sit in the front.
- I'll go.

1906
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,700
Are they tinted?

1907
01:11:09,129 --> 01:11:10,939
- Are the windows tinted?
- Can we open the windows?

1908
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:11,939
You can open them.

1909
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:13,900
- Please open it.
- Open it, please.

1910
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:16,009
(Rolling down the window manually)

1911
01:11:16,009 --> 01:11:18,139
- That's good!
- Oh, my.

1912
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,450
- The windows are plastic.
- It's okay.

1913
01:11:21,879 --> 01:11:23,210
They seem to be talking about the fee.

1914
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,179
We got a taxi.

1915
01:11:25,179 --> 01:11:27,219
- It's 80,000 ariaries for 40 minutes.
- It's 80,000 ariaries?

1916
01:11:27,219 --> 01:11:28,490
- Okay.
- Why is it so cheap?

1917
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:30,049
It's not that bad.

1918
01:11:30,049 --> 01:11:31,389
- We can keep the windows open.
- Then...

1919
01:11:31,389 --> 01:11:33,290
- Let's go.
- Let's get going.

1920
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,559
I should be grateful that I'm alive.

1921
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:38,030
This time there are seat belts.

1922
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:40,200
- He has side-view mirrors and everything.
- Yes.

1923
01:11:40,299 --> 01:11:41,830
I love this neighborhood.

1924
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,170
- Let's go.
- Go. Move.

1925
01:11:45,799 --> 01:11:48,570
I don't have much luggage,
so there's nothing to lose. I love it.

1926
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:50,710
Oh, dear. You're the real winner.

1927
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,740
We should plant our flag tomorrow
since we're wrapping it up.

1928
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:55,049
- What?
- We should.

1929
01:11:55,049 --> 01:11:56,110
- Our paint!
- Our paint!

1930
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,879
- You must do that no matter what.
- Capture it now.

1931
01:11:59,879 --> 01:12:01,250
Hold it here.

1932
01:12:01,549 --> 01:12:03,650
(The signature
of the Adventure by Accident series)

1933
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:05,620
You really need the paint.

1934
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,629
(We should draw on our flag
at the end of the trip.)

1935
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:10,960
(They bought more paint and brushes
at the market.)

1936
01:12:11,599 --> 01:12:13,330
(Where's the paint?)

1937
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,929
- I have it.
- He does.

1938
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:17,200
- That's why...
- I've got towels.

1939
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,969
That's why you shouldn't
carry too many things.

1940
01:12:18,969 --> 01:12:21,469
- I got it.
- Kian84 is indeed amazing.

1941
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:25,639
(Kian84 has been emphasizing
his travel philosophy.)

1942
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:27,750
(Do not check in bags.)

1943
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:31,719
- It's a good travel tip.
- His minimalism came to shine here.

1944
01:12:31,719 --> 01:12:32,780
You should travel light.

1945
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,080
He looks proud and confident.

1946
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:37,189
All of you minimize your luggage
next time.

1947
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,490
- I'll follow your example.
- No more than two outfits.

1948
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:40,719
- I learned from you.
- Okay.

1949
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,759
- No more than two?
- Including what we're wearing?

1950
01:12:42,759 --> 01:12:43,759
- Including that.
- No.

1951
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,229
- So you bring 1 more outfit.
- It's not 2 outfits, then.

1952
01:12:45,229 --> 01:12:47,160
How come all his words turned out
to be correct?

1953
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,030
If you have two sets of clothes,

1954
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,700
wear them alternately.

1955
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,939
He's a travel master.

1956
01:12:51,939 --> 01:12:55,170
You wash and wring out your clothes
when you take a shower.

1957
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:58,139
If you put it on, it dries in 30 minutes.

1958
01:12:58,139 --> 01:13:00,879
Besides, it not only dries
but also has a cooling effect.

1959
01:13:00,879 --> 01:13:03,049
- That's killing 2 birds with 1 stone.
- Dry it under the sun.

1960
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:05,780
You need shampoo, conditioner,

1961
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:07,379
toner, and lotion.

1962
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,589
There are too many specific products
in the world.

1963
01:13:09,849 --> 01:13:13,120
- Actually, you just need detergent.
- Detergent?

1964
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,759
That sounds philosophical.

1965
01:13:15,429 --> 01:13:18,360
- Look at that.
- I complained a lot at first...

1966
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,960
Then I saw how much at peace
you all were...

1967
01:13:21,469 --> 01:13:23,530
- and calmed myself down.
- Exactly. This will be...

1968
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:24,570
- our final trip.
- What's the point of getting mad?

1969
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:25,599
If I were alone,

1970
01:13:25,599 --> 01:13:26,839
- I'd still be mad.
- Right.

1971
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,370
It'll all pan out.

1972
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,370
(Pani Bottle is...)

1973
01:13:30,269 --> 01:13:32,580
(quick to anger.)

1974
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,939
He's rather hot-tempered.

1975
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:36,849
(He's always up for a fight.)

1976
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:39,979
(The way he fights is a bit odd though.)

1977
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,349
(He speaks up against injustice.)

1978
01:13:42,349 --> 01:13:43,790
- Don't touch.
- It's been a while.

1979
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,559
- "Don't touch our camera."
- "Don't touch our camera."

1980
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:46,589
He's charismatic.

1981
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,589
He's at peace now.

1982
01:13:49,589 --> 01:13:51,929
I like how quiet this place is.

1983
01:13:51,929 --> 01:13:53,460
I agree.

1984
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:54,929
(They enjoy the night drive on Nosy Be.)

1985
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:56,969
I hope they have toothbrushes
at the lodging.

1986
01:13:56,969 --> 01:13:59,240
- I do have two toothbrushes.
- Do you?

1987
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,570
But one of them was used once.

1988
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,570
Can you give me that one?

1989
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,780
- Come on.
- I don't mind it at all.

1990
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:07,710
My wife used it.

1991
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:10,379
- Why would you use it?
- You can boil it first.

1992
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:11,920
I don't mind it,

1993
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,179
- Well...
- but maybe you will.

1994
01:14:13,179 --> 01:14:15,019
- It's a bit...
- Of course.

1995
01:14:15,549 --> 01:14:16,620
Right.

1996
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,519
Gosh, did you see these beautiful houses?

1997
01:14:18,519 --> 01:14:20,259
- No.
- I just saw them.

1998
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,189
Hey, you only care about Si Eon
since he came.

1999
01:14:23,189 --> 01:14:26,099
- Come on, now.
- He's jealous.

2000
01:14:26,099 --> 01:14:28,530
You were right next to him.

2001
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:30,129
And you guys wore similar hats.

2002
01:14:30,129 --> 01:14:32,439
- He's jealous nonstop.
- Come on. That's not true.

2003
01:14:32,439 --> 01:14:34,740
You're all precious and equal to me.

2004
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,110
- You're all equal to me.
- We're all the same?

2005
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:37,769
Nothing is equal in this world.

2006
01:14:37,769 --> 01:14:38,809
You're all equal to me.

2007
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,809
- We must be there already.
- Gosh.

2008
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,450
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2009
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:47,379
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

2010
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:49,990
(They're finally in Nosy Be
for the first time.)

2011
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:52,889
Thank you.

2012
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:54,530
(They bring their simple luggage in.)

2013
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,689
- Gosh, they startled me.
- Gosh, they startled me.

2014
01:14:57,689 --> 01:14:58,700
What are they?

2015
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:02,030
The chickens in Madagascar have long legs.

2016
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,900
- Are they chickens?
- They look like eagles.

2017
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,370
- They look better with long legs.
- They look like eagles, right?

2018
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:08,439
Yes.

2019
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,540
- Are they really chickens?
- They have great body ratios.

2020
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,339
- Right?
- They must be a different species.

2021
01:15:12,339 --> 01:15:13,610
Their legs remind me of an ostrich.

2022
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,110
- Hey, there's a swimming pool.
- Is this it?

2023
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:17,280
It is.

2024
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,519
- Gosh.
- There's a swimming pool.

2025
01:15:18,519 --> 01:15:20,479
- The water is in emerald color.
- It can't be.

2026
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,019
- Goodness.
- How is that possible?

2027
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:25,759
You picked out a nice place.

2028
01:15:26,089 --> 01:15:27,719
This is our last lodging.

2029
01:15:27,759 --> 01:15:29,290
- This is our last lodging.
- Gosh.

2030
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:30,990
We'll be camping tomorrow.

2031
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:32,900
This is the last time
we'll be sleeping in a lodging.

2032
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:34,969
- Goodness.
- Gosh, this is huge.

2033
01:15:34,969 --> 01:15:36,700
It's not bad.

2034
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:38,040
How much was this place? It's 100 dollars?

2035
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,240
There's even an AC.

2036
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,370
How much was this place, Dex?

2037
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:41,910
- It was 200,000 ariaries.
- Here.

2038
01:15:42,009 --> 01:15:44,439
- Sixty dollars for one day?
- Yes.

2039
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:47,610
- Hold on. There are 2 beds each.
- There are 2 each.

2040
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:49,610
- I'll go over there.
- I'll sleep with Dex.

2041
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:50,910
We'll take that one.

2042
01:15:52,179 --> 01:15:53,549
I felt bad.

2043
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:56,849
- What is this love triangle?
- I got close to him as well.

2044
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:59,689
- He is...
- Dex was probably disappointed deep down.

2045
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,290
That's not true.

2046
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:03,259
He's trying to come between us.

2047
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:05,000
- Hey, you're too jealous.
- What?

2048
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,129
No, I'm not jealous.

2049
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:07,360
Then do you want to sleep with Dex?

2050
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,170
No, I want to sleep with Pani Bottle.

2051
01:16:09,299 --> 01:16:11,370
- Okay.
- Do I not have a say in this?

2052
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:13,170
- Right.
- Let me sleep with you.

2053
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:14,469
I don't mind.

2054
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:16,809
So... Are we finished?

2055
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:18,179
- Yes.
- Okay.

2056
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:20,809
We'd like to order some food.

2057
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:23,150
Do you want to eat in?

2058
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:24,349
- Yes.
- Okay.

2059
01:16:24,349 --> 01:16:26,920
- It was 9 p.m. and too late to eat out.
- Good idea.

2060
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,950
We have crabs, lobsters,

2061
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:33,059
curry, and more.

2062
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,559
So can we pay with ariaries?

2063
01:16:35,559 --> 01:16:37,530
- Ariaries?
- Yes.

2064
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:40,500
When the food is ready, please call me.

2065
01:16:41,469 --> 01:16:44,129
- Darn it. No!
- What's wrong?

2066
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:47,170
Where did the cockroach go?
It's driving me crazy.

2067
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,639
- I hate it.
- It's over there.

2068
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:51,479
- Isn't that the hissing cockroach?
- It was huge.

2069
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:53,809
(Is this the hissing cockroach
that Si Eon's nephew mentioned?)

2070
01:16:58,549 --> 01:17:01,150
You should've brought it back!

2071
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:02,849
It was a regular one.

2072
01:17:02,849 --> 01:17:04,719
- It wasn't the hissing cockroach?
- Look at that.

2073
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,089
Pani Bottle is the best.

2074
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,589
Was it not the hissing cockroach?

2075
01:17:08,589 --> 01:17:10,429
No, it wasn't.

2076
01:17:10,429 --> 01:17:12,229
It was this big. I'm not lying.

2077
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:13,860
You used your shoe.

2078
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:15,900
You know that sound, right?

2079
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,170
- The crunching sound?
- Yes.

2080
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:18,670
It sounded like shrimp shells bursting.

2081
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:21,309
Nevertheless, I caught it.

2082
01:17:21,309 --> 01:17:23,769
You sure are the best. I feel safe.

2083
01:17:23,769 --> 01:17:24,879
This is the least I can do.

2084
01:17:24,939 --> 01:17:26,740
- Charismatic Pani.
- Charismatic Pani.

2085
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,509
- Not at all.
- Believe it or not,

2086
01:17:28,509 --> 01:17:30,150
I'm actually scared of cockroaches.

2087
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:32,349
(He's terrified of cockroaches.)

2088
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:34,349
Pani Bottle saved me.

2089
01:17:36,049 --> 01:17:37,820
- Ready?
- Yes.

2090
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,719
- Let's go.
- Let's eat.

2091
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:42,360
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

2092
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,460
Let's eat.

2093
01:17:43,589 --> 01:17:45,530
The restaurant must be behind the lodging.

2094
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,099
It's breezy. It's facing the ocean.

2095
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,099
Hey, it's the ocean.

2096
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,700
Nice.

2097
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,370
We can appreciate the view while eating.

2098
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,139
What is this?

2099
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,809
(It's a flower embroidery.)

2100
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:01,509
It's not a bug.

2101
01:18:01,509 --> 01:18:02,610
This is tough.

2102
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,950
Who caught the cockroach?

2103
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:06,450
Pani Bottle did.

2104
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,320
I thought it was a shrimp.

2105
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,490
Gosh.

2106
01:18:12,019 --> 01:18:13,219
What kind of fish is this?

2107
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,030
Isn't it a shark?

2108
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,990
(The fish is humongous.)

2109
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:18,229
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

2110
01:18:19,429 --> 01:18:21,129
(Here's the highlight.)

2111
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:22,799
It's so cheap. This is insane.

2112
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,330
You can never go wrong with seafood.

2113
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:25,339
(They even get juicy lobsters.)

2114
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,870
- That's a feast.
- There's a lot of food.

2115
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,469
It's such a nice meal.

2116
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:32,040
(Exclaiming)

2117
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,979
- Put it here.
- Okay.

2118
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:35,780
- It's huge.
- Look at all that meat.

2119
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:37,250
The fish is huge.

2120
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,580
(He tries the fish.)

2121
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:39,679
That looks good.

2122
01:18:39,879 --> 01:18:41,620
- It's so meaty.
- Meaty.

2123
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:44,420
(The city guy munches on it too.)

2124
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,719
- How's the curry?
- It's delicious.

2125
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:49,160
Really? I can eat it if Si Eon can.

2126
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,360
- Sure.
- I'm a total city guy.

2127
01:18:51,629 --> 01:18:54,059
You guys have similar tastes.

2128
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:57,299
(Dex copies Si Eon
and has some curry too.)

2129
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,740
(Grabbing)

2130
01:19:00,799 --> 01:19:03,210
(Pani Bottle gobbles up the food.)

2131
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:04,540
Gosh, you eat so well.

2132
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:08,150
(They enjoy dinner in their own ways.)

2133
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:10,379
(There's a crash of thunder.)

2134
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:11,750
- Gosh.
- There's lightning again.

2135
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:14,049
Maybe it's the same lightning from before
that followed Kian84.

2136
01:19:14,379 --> 01:19:15,519
There's lightning.

2137
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:17,790
- We need to be careful...
- This is bad.

2138
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:18,920
tomorrow.

2139
01:19:19,219 --> 01:19:21,089
- There's lightning again.
- You summon it every time.

2140
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:23,290
- What's going on?
- I like the vibe though.

2141
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:25,200
- Gosh.
- What's going on?

2142
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:28,330
We need to wake up a bit early tomorrow.

2143
01:19:28,429 --> 01:19:29,830
We need to leave by 7 a.m.

2144
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:31,129
- That early?
- Yes.

2145
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:34,000
- For the boat?
- We lost our luggage.

2146
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,839
We need to stop by the mart
before taking the boat.

2147
01:19:36,839 --> 01:19:38,839
- The mart?
- We need to buy some stuff.

2148
01:19:38,839 --> 01:19:40,509
We may have to prepare more things...

2149
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:41,979
- than we thought.
- Exactly.

2150
01:19:41,979 --> 01:19:43,349
We need to make a wise grocery list.

2151
01:19:43,349 --> 01:19:45,849
It's not about camping comfortably.

2152
01:19:45,849 --> 01:19:47,820
- We just need the bare minimum.
- I like that.

2153
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,389
We had no luggage.

2154
01:19:49,389 --> 01:19:51,490
It's only hard the first time.

2155
01:19:51,889 --> 01:19:53,420
- Gosh.
- Oh, no.

2156
01:19:53,519 --> 01:19:55,059
This is impressive.

2157
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,360
I hope the weather is better tomorrow.

2158
01:19:58,299 --> 01:20:01,000
This is the fourth lightning festival.

2159
01:20:01,099 --> 01:20:02,469
It's going to be more fun.

2160
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:04,030
- I prefer the rain.
- Me too.

2161
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:06,439
It's better to sleep
in the rain than the heat.

2162
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:09,139
I don't think I'd mind the rain...

2163
01:20:09,639 --> 01:20:10,809
since it's this show.

2164
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:12,379
If it rains, then so be it.

2165
01:20:12,979 --> 01:20:14,639
If we get hit by lightning, then so be it.

2166
01:20:15,509 --> 01:20:17,309
That's a bit scary.

2167
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:19,280
I want to be one of those guys...

2168
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,620
who survived getting hit by lightning.

2169
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:21,950
The probability of survival is
extremely low.

2170
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,089
But you can't even catch a cockroach.

2171
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,259
Are you afraid of bugs?

2172
01:20:26,519 --> 01:20:28,330
Cockroaches are on another level.

2173
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:30,129
I don't think he's afraid.
He just hates them.

2174
01:20:30,129 --> 01:20:31,360
They give me goosebumps.

2175
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,330
(Another thunder
sends chills down their spines.)

2176
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:34,559
How nice.

2177
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:38,099
This weather seems to prepare us
for the grand finale.

2178
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:39,740
We're heading toward the final round.

2179
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:41,200
Before our last battle.

2180
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,170
- Right.
- He's getting all passionate again.

2181
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:46,910
It started to feel like
the thunder was summoning me.

2182
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:49,110
(It started to feel like
the thunder was summoning me.)

2183
01:20:49,309 --> 01:20:51,519
I think tomorrow will be tough,
but I'm looking forward to it.

2184
01:20:51,650 --> 01:20:53,379
- Right.
- I think I've become weird.

2185
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:55,389
You have no expectations now.

2186
01:20:55,589 --> 01:20:57,790
It's all about your mindset.

2187
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:59,389
Humans adapt.

2188
01:20:59,389 --> 01:21:01,360
You guys are becoming more similar.

2189
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,330
What's wrong?

2190
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,429
The thunder.

2191
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:07,929
Are you scared?

2192
01:21:08,469 --> 01:21:10,429
(You're so weak.)

2193
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:13,240
- I want to run on the beach naked.
- What?

2194
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,370
- I want to run on the beach naked.
- That sounds nice.

2195
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:17,110
I really want to try that.

2196
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:19,280
It'd be even better if it rained.

2197
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:22,849
I'd personally like to build a dugout hut.

2198
01:21:22,849 --> 01:21:24,610
- A dugout hut?
- With the sand?

2199
01:21:24,809 --> 01:21:27,019
- With things like that.
- No, with branches.

2200
01:21:27,019 --> 01:21:28,650
- Let's do that.
- Hey.

2201
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:31,790
Should we just build dugout huts
instead of setting up tents?

2202
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:32,920
Dugout huts?

2203
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,089
We'll each build our own place.

2204
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:38,799
We'll pick where to settle once we arrive.

2205
01:21:38,799 --> 01:21:39,960
- I like it.
- I'm all for it.

2206
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,170
- Then we'll build our houses.
- Will they be okay?

2207
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:45,370
We've slept in a tent before.

2208
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:46,500
It'll be meaningless.

2209
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,210
- So let's just build huts this time.
- My goodness.

2210
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:50,839
Let's get back to the basics.

2211
01:21:51,469 --> 01:21:53,009
- I like it.
- Me too.

2212
01:21:53,009 --> 01:21:54,639
- Let's get back to the basics.
- I'm all for it.

2213
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:55,809
They're becoming weird.

2214
01:21:55,809 --> 01:21:57,849
Let's buy an ax tomorrow.

2215
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:00,679
- An ax?
- I was serious. It was our finale.

2216
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,750
I can picture tomorrow.

2217
01:22:03,389 --> 01:22:05,490
But I can't make myself say
that it won't work.

2218
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:08,290
If it doesn't work,
I'll still find a way to sleep outdoors.

2219
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,360
This is insane.

2220
01:22:09,589 --> 01:22:12,429
- I love this insane plan.
- Insane plan?

2221
01:22:12,429 --> 01:22:15,070
I give you my word.
I won't use a tent tomorrow.

2222
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:16,969
- Me too. No matter what happens,
- That's right.

2223
01:22:16,969 --> 01:22:18,339
even if there is thunder and lightning,

2224
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:21,139
- Gosh, that's a good attitude.
- I will do it.

2225
01:22:21,139 --> 01:22:22,769
- I will do it.
- Let's find a cave.

2226
01:22:22,769 --> 01:22:24,809
Whether we find a cave
or sleep in the trees...

2227
01:22:24,809 --> 01:22:26,309
"Determined for no reason."

2228
01:22:26,309 --> 01:22:27,479
(Determined for no reason)

2229
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:29,650
- Even if I have to sleep in the sand,
- Or dig a hole in the ground.

2230
01:22:30,049 --> 01:22:32,019
- I won't rely on a mere tent.
- I might dig a trench.

2231
01:22:32,019 --> 01:22:33,420
- Look at his eyes.
- His eyes.

2232
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,920
For our last night tomorrow.

2233
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,150
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

2234
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:37,420
Let's come back alive tomorrow.

2235
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:39,920
Did you get struck
by lightning indirectly?

2236
01:22:40,759 --> 01:22:42,860
(Tingling with electricity)

2237
01:22:43,059 --> 01:22:44,589
This is what the boat looks like.

2238
01:22:45,129 --> 01:22:47,429
- If you look here...
- Gosh.

2239
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,670
This looks like something out
of the "Pirates of the Caribbean."

2240
01:22:50,969 --> 01:22:53,500
The boat itself was
a different kind of boat...

2241
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,969
from the ones I had been on before.

2242
01:22:55,269 --> 01:22:57,110
There is the animated series
called "One Piece."

2243
01:22:57,269 --> 01:23:00,210
Should I say
that it looks like a sailboat?

2244
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,150
(On the endless sea,)

2245
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:05,179
(they ride a sailboat
that looks like it's from a cartoon.)

2246
01:23:05,179 --> 01:23:06,820
- Is that the boat?
- That looks nice.

2247
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,389
That's so cool.

2248
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:11,620
It's like a sailboat from
the Age of Discovery.

2249
01:23:12,759 --> 01:23:14,559
Isn't that boat quite romantic?

2250
01:23:15,089 --> 01:23:16,889
(Thinking)

2251
01:23:17,089 --> 01:23:18,259
There's a lot to do.

2252
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,559
I'll go and take a shower.

2253
01:23:20,559 --> 01:23:21,929
You're going to take a shower in the rain,
aren't you?

2254
01:23:21,929 --> 01:23:23,830
- Oh, here?
- Hey, you don't have a change of clothes.

2255
01:23:24,729 --> 01:23:26,070
I can just dry them.

2256
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,370
- How will you dry them?
- It's raining. How will you dry them?

2257
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:28,969
We have to leave at seven in the morning.

2258
01:23:28,969 --> 01:23:32,080
Actually, when I saw the lightning,
I wanted to go toward it.

2259
01:23:32,439 --> 01:23:33,479
- Toward the lightning?
- In the direction of the lightning?

2260
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:35,080
- He was entranced by the lightning.
- He's drawn to it.

2261
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,309
- I was entranced a bit.
- You'll catch a cold.

2262
01:23:39,019 --> 01:23:41,219
(Roaring)

2263
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:42,519
(Exclaiming)

2264
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,019
I liked that.

2265
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,019
(Feeling awesome)

2266
01:23:45,019 --> 01:23:46,290
Hey, come on!

2267
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:48,290
Hang on. I have to sleep next to Kian84.

2268
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:50,360
Hey, come on!

2269
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,360
You shouldn't be saying that.

2270
01:23:54,299 --> 01:23:56,299
I really want to try that too.

2271
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:58,370
I'd go too if I had a change of clothes,
but I don't.

2272
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,769
It's raining so hard.

2273
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:03,469
(Exclaiming)

2274
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,780
Gosh, this is so refreshing.

2275
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:07,809
(This man is so familiar with the rain.)

2276
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:09,679
Fire!

2277
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:14,320
(He steps into the eco-friendly shower
as if he's entranced.)

2278
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:19,120
(Oh, lightning!)

2279
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,620
Here comes the lightning.

2280
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:21,790
Here it comes.

2281
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:25,700
(Lightning was with him
since his first day in Madagascar.)

2282
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,729
(Making him forget the sadness
of the flight cancellation)

2283
01:24:28,729 --> 01:24:32,200
This trip started with lightning,
and it's ending with lightning.

2284
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:33,839
Gosh, everyone.

2285
01:24:34,139 --> 01:24:36,269
(It made him forget
about getting ripped off.)

2286
01:24:36,269 --> 01:24:37,910
He gets the most excited
when there is lightning.

2287
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:40,210
(The 2nd lightning festival)

2288
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:42,549
(Excited)

2289
01:24:42,549 --> 01:24:43,950
Let it rain!

2290
01:24:44,549 --> 01:24:46,120
Fire!

2291
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:48,320
This sight never gets old.

2292
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,549
The third lightning festival.

2293
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,460
I guess lightning was
always with you throughout the trip.

2294
01:24:56,490 --> 01:24:58,559
Si Eon, it's so refreshing.

2295
01:24:58,559 --> 01:25:00,400
(He always said this
to the Kian84 TV camera in a lonely way.)

2296
01:25:00,559 --> 01:25:01,769
It's so refreshing.

2297
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:04,269
- Nice.
- Gosh.

2298
01:25:04,269 --> 01:25:06,839
You were enjoying the lightning alone,
but now you have a buddy.

2299
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,400
(The youngest sets off too.)

2300
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,969
Oh, I don't know anymore.

2301
01:25:10,269 --> 01:25:11,370
Is everyone going?

2302
01:25:14,009 --> 01:25:15,150
Bring it on!

2303
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,080
Let down the lightning!

2304
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,150
Lightning, come on down!

2305
01:25:23,049 --> 01:25:24,049
Here it comes.

2306
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,120
(Screaming)

2307
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:29,830
I hope it rains just this much
tomorrow too.

2308
01:25:30,389 --> 01:25:32,229
Only those who have experienced this
know what it feels like.

2309
01:25:32,229 --> 01:25:34,129
This freedom. It's just...

2310
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:37,170
It's more romantic
with the thunder and lightning.

2311
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:38,799
This really is the best.

2312
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,900
- It's romantic.
- It is.

2313
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,809
(This is romantic!)

2314
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:45,809
(Somewhere between
being electrocuted and feeling romantic)

2315
01:25:45,809 --> 01:25:47,710
"Somewhere between
being electrocuted and feeling romantic."

2316
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:49,280
"Being electrocuted."

2317
01:25:49,509 --> 01:25:50,879
Pani Bottle!

2318
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:53,519
Gosh, that looks like a youth drama.

2319
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:55,820
I think an experience like that...

2320
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:58,320
won't happen very often
throughout my entire life.

2321
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,460
If it had been the usual me,

2322
01:26:00,519 --> 01:26:02,030
I wouldn't have done that.

2323
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:04,389
But I felt that I was becoming one
with these guys.

2324
01:26:04,589 --> 01:26:05,929
It was very romantic.

2325
01:26:05,929 --> 01:26:07,200
They are absorbing one another.

2326
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,099
All of the uncomfortable feelings
from today are being washed away.

2327
01:26:10,299 --> 01:26:12,339
- Shall we go for a run?
- Run?

2328
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:14,200
(Shall we go for a run?)

2329
01:26:15,509 --> 01:26:18,979
A lot went wrong today, like our luggage
not arriving, but we forgot about it all.

2330
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:20,910
You were able to wash it all away.

2331
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:23,479
- Gosh, tomorrow...
- Will it keep raining tomorrow?

2332
01:26:23,479 --> 01:26:25,620
- Gosh.
- It looks like you're going to get hit.

2333
01:26:25,719 --> 01:26:27,849
(Do not try this yourself.)

2334
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:31,320
(Meanwhile, Pani Bottle is left alone.)

2335
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:33,089
I don't have a change of clothes.

2336
01:26:33,589 --> 01:26:34,790
(Contemplating)

2337
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:36,589
- Oh, Pani Bottle.
- Will he finally get going?

2338
01:26:37,929 --> 01:26:40,530
(Oh, whatever)

2339
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:43,500
- Oh, hang on.
- How much is he taking off?

2340
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:44,500
I mean...

2341
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:46,700
He's going out in just his underpants.

2342
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,099
They called him "Chicken Bottle."

2343
01:26:54,679 --> 01:26:56,580
- It looks kind of scary.
- He looks crazy.

2344
01:26:56,710 --> 01:26:57,979
(His body looks like a sausage.)

2345
01:26:57,979 --> 01:26:59,250
That's hilarious.

2346
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,320
(Screaming)

2347
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,719
(Is that a new friend of ours?)

2348
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:06,620
What a sight.

2349
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:08,929
That was purely because
I didn't have any other clothes.

2350
01:27:08,929 --> 01:27:10,129
Gosh, this guy...

2351
01:27:10,129 --> 01:27:11,790
Gosh, he's enjoying it fully.

2352
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:13,429
I like the placement of the water droplet.

2353
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:16,370
I'm in charge of looks on
Adventure by Accident.

2354
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,769
- It's nice and cool.
- Gosh.

2355
01:27:19,769 --> 01:27:20,839
(Amid a fierce battle
for who's in charge of looks,)

2356
01:27:22,139 --> 01:27:23,939
(Lightning Man starts
to connect with something.)

2357
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:28,309
- Hey, look. He's in charge of looks?
- What is this?

2358
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:29,509
(Oh, the deity of lightning!)

2359
01:27:29,509 --> 01:27:31,150
Everyone has kind of lost it.

2360
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:34,580
(They're so happy
that they're at a loss for words.)

2361
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:35,650
He's happy.

2362
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:38,549
(Walking off)

2363
01:27:39,019 --> 01:27:41,360
- He looks even weirder.
- Where did he go?

2364
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:43,629
I want to go back!

2365
01:27:44,629 --> 01:27:45,860
What? Gosh.

2366
01:27:46,229 --> 01:27:47,729
Shouldn't someone stop him?

2367
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:49,330
What is he doing?

2368
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,229
- Where did he go?
- There he goes.

2369
01:27:51,229 --> 01:27:54,299
(What was that?)

2370
01:27:55,969 --> 01:27:57,269
Isn't he Lightning Man?

2371
01:27:57,269 --> 01:27:58,540
(The appearance of the new Lightning Man)

2372
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:00,580
(Like a bolt of lightning)

2373
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,009
(Running with incredible force)

2374
01:28:04,009 --> 01:28:05,280
I look like a madman.

2375
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:08,450
He looks like
he has been struck by lightning.

2376
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,219
(Waving his arms around)

2377
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:14,860
It's a ritual.

2378
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:16,389
(A ritual for the deity of lightning)

2379
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,160
Please let us get
eight percent viewer ratings!

2380
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:22,429
(Communing with his entire body)

2381
01:28:22,799 --> 01:28:25,670
He's indeed GrandAward84.
He even worries about viewer ratings.

2382
01:28:26,099 --> 01:28:29,040
- Just wait for it.
- Shouldn't we do a ritual for rain?

2383
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,910
- A ritual for rain.
- Yes, let's go.

2384
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,009
Hurry up. Lightning. Go in circles.

2385
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:35,110
- Hurry up. The deity of lightning.
- Go in circles.

2386
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:36,710
- The deity of lightning.
- Go really fast.

2387
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:39,049
(They all copy Lightning Man
and try to contact the spirits.)

2388
01:28:39,049 --> 01:28:42,089
- Viewer ratings.
- "Try to contact the spirits."

2389
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:44,389
(Their spirituality is burning
with passion even as they watch it again.)

2390
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:47,320
(The followers move in perfect order.)

2391
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,860
- Here comes the lightning.
- Lightning.

2392
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:50,030
(Screaming)

2393
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:54,629
- "He has responded!"
- "He has responded."

2394
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:58,129
- Oh, dear skies!
- Eight percent!

2395
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:00,170
Please let our show be a success!

2396
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:02,009
The skies were moved just now.

2397
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:03,610
They're answering your prayers.

2398
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:06,479
- Let it be a success!
- "Another religious fanatic."

2399
01:29:06,679 --> 01:29:08,710
Please let us get good viewer ratings
at least.

2400
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:10,849
(Rumbling)

2401
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:14,580
- The skies just said they understood.
- The skies were moved.

2402
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:17,019
- They just said they understood.
- "An express message was delivered."

2403
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,790
The deity of lightning has
given his approval.

2404
01:29:19,019 --> 01:29:21,790
I've met the deity of lightning
four times now.

2405
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:23,059
But today,

2406
01:29:23,429 --> 01:29:25,160
he answered me at the end.

2407
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,429
There was a reason
why you won seven awards.

2408
01:29:27,429 --> 01:29:29,229
- You prayed to the deities...
- That was the reason.

2409
01:29:29,229 --> 01:29:31,870
- while you were there.
- Gosh, the deity of lightning...

2410
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:33,939
Honestly, do you want it to rain
tomorrow or not?

2411
01:29:33,939 --> 01:29:36,870
Tomorrow? In this current state,
I wish it would rain.

2412
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:38,070
I wish it would rain too.

2413
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:39,740
Then, we'll really build a hut tomorrow.

2414
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:41,110
Of course, we should.

2415
01:29:41,179 --> 01:29:43,250
But, let's go. Let's build a hut.

2416
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,849
- Let's go.
- We should build a hut.

2417
01:29:44,849 --> 01:29:46,820
If we can't,
we can at least sleep under the trees.

2418
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:47,820
- We can do that.
- Right.

2419
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:48,820
We can all huddle together.

2420
01:29:49,349 --> 01:29:50,490
It'll be fine.

2421
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:51,920
The deity of lightning has come.

2422
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,019
(Where will these guys end up sleeping?)

2423
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:59,000
(They set off on a romantic boat.)

2424
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:01,460
(The four brothers'...)

2425
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:04,070
(final journey!)

2426
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:05,229
(Adventure by Accident)

2427
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:06,639
(This is...)

2428
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:10,469
(the scale of Madagascar's
paradise on Earth.)

2429
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:12,509
(When you look back, a trip is...)

2430
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:15,110
(so new that it is exhilarating.)

2431
01:30:15,549 --> 01:30:17,009
(It is a series...)

2432
01:30:17,009 --> 01:30:20,820
(of moments that are more joyful
because they're unpredictable.)

2433
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:23,889
(Slowly losing their minds is
an added bonus.)

2434
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:26,189
(Their rough hut is completed.)

2435
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:28,790
(The sky is as uneasy as ever.)

2436
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:30,559
(You can't get off that easily.)

2437
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,460
(I had fun, you darned world!)

2438
01:30:33,759 --> 01:30:35,870
(- Hey, I'm going to sleep.
- What?)

2439
01:30:35,969 --> 01:30:37,370
(I'm going to sleep!)

2440
01:30:37,929 --> 01:30:39,900
(Unpredictable to the end)

2441
01:30:40,599 --> 01:30:43,870
(The last page of this journey)

2442
01:30:44,469 --> 01:30:47,540
(The end of their long but short journey)

2443
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:51,879
(A trip they took together by accident)

2444
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:56,219
(Our last story,
which we will remember for a long time)

2445
01:30:59,290 --> 01:31:00,420
(Goodbye, Madagascar.)

2446
01:31:01,219 --> 01:31:08,129
(Pani Bottle, Lee Si Eon,
Kian84, and Dex were here.)
