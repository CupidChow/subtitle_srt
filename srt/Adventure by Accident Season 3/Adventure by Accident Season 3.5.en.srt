1
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,780
(The people in the village
are already up and about.)

2
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,290
The morning has come.

3
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,960
(Wiggling around)

4
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
(Waking up)

5
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,400
(Clumsily coming out of the tent)

6
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:51,900
(Pani Bottle woke up
just before the break of dawn.)

7
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:55,879
Hello... My friends.

8
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,640
Dex. Kian84.

9
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:03,449
Let's get up. The sun is rising.

10
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,750
- Yes. So?
- What?

11
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,349
So... Why... Sun... What time is it?

12
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,720
It's 5:07 a.m.

13
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,820
I see.

14
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,729
Let's get going.

15
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,529
Can I sleep ten minutes more?

16
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:19,769
I think the sun will have already risen
if you sleep ten minutes more.

17
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:20,930
- Really?
- Yes.

18
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,200
- It rises that quickly?
- Yes.

19
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,440
(Sounding groggy)

20
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,610
- Oh, my.
- Okay.

21
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:34,980
(Kian84 comes crawling out on all fours.)

22
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,550
Oh, my.

23
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:42,420
(The darkness is slowly going away.)

24
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,690
(Kian84 is trying hard to wake up.)

25
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:52,800
(A morning under the baobab trees!)

26
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:56,170
(The view has captured Kian84.)

27
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,200
(Scratching)

28
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:59,470
- Oh, my.
- There he goes again.

29
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,269
There's the baguette again.

30
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:02,739
(Ripping, eating)

31
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:04,879
(Chewing)

32
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:08,480
Pani Bottle eats it habitually.

33
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,550
He's still here?

34
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,950
Does he eat bread?

35
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:17,560
That dog kept hanging around us
since the night before.

36
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:18,659
(The dog was right by their camp
last night as well.)

37
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,090
A dog came.

38
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,099
(Taking a seat)

39
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,330
Give me some.

40
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,070
(Eating it himself)

41
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:29,100
Oh, you wanted to eat it?

42
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,700
I thought you were giving the dog some.

43
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,269
- I thought that's why you asked for some.
- I gave him meat yesterday.

44
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,880
We gave him a lot yesterday.

45
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,480
(Crunch)

46
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,580
(Pani Bottle gave away everything he had.)

47
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,550
Gosh. I'm thirsty now.

48
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:52,660
(Vocalizing)

49
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,959
(He saw someone feeding chicken
while saying "dak.")

50
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,929
(I see.)

51
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:01,869
(Saying "Da," as he learned)

52
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,809
You're supposed to say "da da da"
to them there.

53
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,369
Gosh.

54
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,380
Hey. Look at this. Gosh.

55
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:13,880
Gosh, the view.

56
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:15,880
What is this?

57
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,290
Oh, my.

58
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,119
- That's what I call a baobab view.
- Yes.

59
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,089
(Day 6 of the Madagascar Trip)

60
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,230
(Rushing over)

61
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,200
Oh, this is nice.

62
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:37,040
(Snapping a picture)

63
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,570
- He's so cute.
- Hey.

64
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,809
Did you just take a picture?

65
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,080
Pictures turn out best
when you're being natural.

66
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,110
(Only the Madagascar Brothers...)

67
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,709
(are on this wide road.)

68
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,880
- There are no tourists there.
- Not a single person.

69
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,450
- It's just the three of you, right?
- Yes.

70
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,489
(Shouting)

71
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:59,189
Kian84. Now is the time. Nobody is around.

72
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,790
Let's go.

73
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:03,730
One, two, three.

74
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,730
(Excitedly taking pictures)

75
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,130
It felt very different
without any people there.

76
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,800
- This is nice.
- Dex.

77
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,040
Let's climb a baobab tree this time.

78
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,239
Please try climbing it.

79
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,179
- This?
- I'll push you up.

80
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,450
This is that place.

81
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,749
<i>Hey, my nana</i>

82
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:21,749
It's that.

83
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,820
(Hey, my nana, give me a banana)

84
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,320
(The banana song
perfectly suits this place.)

85
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:34,290
He came all the way here.

86
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,929
- Who?
- The dog?

87
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:37,160
Look at him running toward us.

88
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,660
He must like you.

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,300
He's walking over like this.

90
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,540
How cute.

91
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:46,869
He likes you.

92
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,809
- Good boy. Good girl.
- Even dogs like Dex.

93
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:52,139
- Pani Bottle gave him the bread.
- Right.

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,780
Why did you have to say that?

95
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,020
- He's a bit...
- I wasn't thinking about that.

96
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,650
Let's watch it together.

97
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:00,989
Do you want to come with me?

98
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,819
Do you want to get on the plane with me?

99
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,030
Are you...

100
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,189
the fourth member?

101
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:09,999
It was such a cute puppy.

102
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:11,100
(The fourth member)

103
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,230
Let's give him a name.

104
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,270
How about Dexi?

105
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,939
(While playing with the dog...)

106
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:17,970
Come here.

107
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,509
(Baobab Avenue is lighting up
with the morning sunshine.)

108
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,739
The colors are beautiful.
The sun must be rising soon.

109
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,579
The colors are different from a sunset.

110
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,809
- Sunsets are more orange.
- This is more yellow.

111
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,650
Right now, it's pinkish,
and it's purple over there.

112
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,650
- It's different.
- Right. The colors are totally different.

113
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,389
The sky is like a work of art.

114
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,160
- Gosh. Look at those colors.
- Oh, my.

115
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:43,400
- Gosh.
- It's pink.

116
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,199
(The sun is slowly appearing
from behind the baobab trees.)

117
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:48,869
It's so magical.
The colors remind me of an aurora.

118
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,999
Oh, it's rising.

119
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:54,069
I can see it between the trees.

120
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,770
This is like a painting.

121
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,319
- Oh, my.
- Look at that gradient.

122
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,079
- Gosh.
- They did a good job recording it.

123
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,290
This is so beautiful.

124
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:10,259
Why are the cows out?

125
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,360
Oh, my. It's a goat.

126
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,460
(A goat has appeared too.)

127
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,629
When you go to the paradise,

128
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,929
there are cows, dogs, horses,
and everything, right?

129
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:19,329
- Have you been there?
- Have you been there?

130
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:20,400
Have you died?

131
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,970
- I mean...
- That's amazing.

132
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,239
- On drawings in church, there are...
- On the drawings, yes.

133
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,210
- Right.
- Dogs, cows, horses, sheep,

134
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,670
and people are there all at once.

135
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,939
- Right.
- That's how it felt.

136
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:30,340
I thought he had been there.

137
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,449
They're a family.

138
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,809
(Our animal friends all came
to greet the morning with us.)

139
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:37,020
Even the chickens are out.

140
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,550
- Gosh.
- All of the town animals are out here.

141
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,989
It was a rendezvous point.

142
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,860
Dogs, chickens, cows, ducks,
and baobab trees.

143
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,530
It feels unnatural for people to be there.

144
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,559
Exactly.

145
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:58,770
Oh, my.

146
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:01,040
(The sun is finally radiating light
all over.)

147
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,009
- This is so unreal.
- Seriously.

148
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,579
(The brilliant light shines over Africa.)

149
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:12,379
The light looks like CGI.

150
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,619
That's amazing.

151
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:22,629
This has been here for 2,000 years.

152
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,470
(This baobab must have seen the sunrise
for thousands of years from this spot.)

153
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:29,199
From the baobab's perspective,

154
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,139
we're just passing by.

155
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,710
Aren't we like flies?

156
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,480
In 100 years, we'll all be gone,

157
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,280
but that will keep growing like that.

158
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,309
- Right.
- Exactly.

159
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,119
Gosh. This is a beautiful view.

160
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,480
Wait. Are these not baobab trees?

161
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,489
- They're growing.
- Oh, right. They're growing.

162
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:49,020
You're right. This is a baobab tree too.

163
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,360
How old do you think this one is?
About 100?

164
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,829
Hey. They're babies.

165
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:54,429
- This is a baobab...
- Yes.

166
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:55,660
This is a baby baobab.

167
00:08:56,429 --> 00:09:00,069
It does look like a baobab tree.
It has that vibe.

168
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,999
Gosh. For this to grow that big...

169
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,410
Imagine being born and realizing
you will live for 2,000 years.

170
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,139
I ended up living for 2,000 years.

171
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:12,579
(Living 2,000 years by accident)

172
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:15,480
- The infants are over there.
- Oh, my.

173
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,319
- Infants.
- These are infant baobab trees.

174
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:19,749
(Infant baobab trees)

175
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:21,350
That was nice.

176
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,720
(The sunrise at Baobab Avenue
was marvelous.)

177
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,689
(Opening the tent)

178
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:30,259
I brought...

179
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,100
some coffee.

180
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:36,670
There is a place I went
to get hot water for ramyeon yesterday.

181
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,100
I feel bad just asking for water.

182
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,910
Is there something we could give them?

183
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,910
- What about this?
- I think they'd like the sauce.

184
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,579
- Sauce?
- This is new, right?

185
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,009
Should we take this and ask for hot water?

186
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,920
- Yes. Let's go.
- Just hot water?

187
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,150
- Okay.
- Okay.

188
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,219
- Hello.
- Hello.

189
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,859
(People in the town
are busy making breakfast.)

190
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:00,260
- Hello. Good morning.
- Good morning.

191
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,459
He gave us hot water yesterday.

192
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,300
- He even pulled the cart for us.
- Right.

193
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,699
He also gave you water.

194
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:07,069
A gift.

195
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:09,069
(Smiling wide)

196
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:11,339
Could you give us some hot water?

197
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,839
Hot water?

198
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,770
They were about to eat breakfast too.

199
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,740
Oh, they have some left.

200
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,839
Right.

201
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,010
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

202
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,079
(Kindly sharing)

203
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,780
We should give him some of these.

204
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,349
- Oh, coffee. Right.
- Yes.

205
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:26,589
(Have some coffee.)

206
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,949
- He'll give you a demonstration.
- Like this.

207
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,290
We now have one more fan of K-Contents.

208
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,059
Like this. Mix.

209
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,199
(I see.)

210
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:37,660
Okay.

211
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,670
- I see.
- Coffee is best in the morning.

212
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,900
(Trying a sip of K-morning coffee)

213
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,170
Good? Nice.

214
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,670
- Give him a few.
- Let's give him a few.

215
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,469
(Giving him a handful)

216
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:49,540
(One moment, please.)

217
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:52,380
What is it?

218
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:54,609
- What?
- Wait.

219
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:56,719
- What is this?
- It's the fruit of a baobab tree.

220
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,719
- Oh, my.
- Baobab trees have fruit?

221
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,219
Oh, thank you.

222
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:02,349
- Baobab?
- Yes.

223
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:04,660
I heard that was famous as a superfood.

224
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,990
- Gosh. How fascinating.
- It's very light.

225
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,229
Do we eat this?

226
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:09,260
Eat?

227
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,699
- Oh, we have to cut it.
- Oh, cut? I see.

228
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,569
(A demonstration
from an experienced teacher)

229
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,770
It has an interesting sound.

230
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,640
(Lightly tap the skin with a knife,)

231
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,880
(then open the fruit.)

232
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
(Gathering around to try the superfood)

233
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,719
It's kind of like a walnut.

234
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:31,179
(Sniffing)

235
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,719
It tastes like popcorn.

236
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,189
It's like rice puffs and popcorn.

237
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,189
- And it's a bit sour.
- It is sour.

238
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:42,160
- Oh, right. Popcorn.
- Does it not have much moisture?

239
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,459
- I see.
- Right.

240
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,300
Oh, it's sour.

241
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:47,400
(Laughing)

242
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,030
- It's kind of like gourd in Korea.
- It's melting.

243
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,270
It's kind of like gourd or walnut.

244
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,500
Oh, my.

245
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:54,140
Thank you.

246
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,910
Thank you.

247
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,209
- Let's go.
- Bye.

248
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,609
I like this.

249
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
How do they pick these? It's so high up.

250
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,380
They fall...

251
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,750
- like chestnuts or persimmons.
- Right.

252
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,050
- When they're ripe.
- Yes.

253
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:10,120
(Back at the tent)

254
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,160
This...

255
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,729
Why is this fruit so cute?

256
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:14,990
(Wiping)

257
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:16,059
- Right?
- I'm going to...

258
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,459
- It has hair.
- Right.

259
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,770
It's kind of like shortly-cut puppy hair.

260
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,800
It does.

261
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,870
Do we have water? Let's rinse this.

262
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:25,439
- We have water.
- Water.

263
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,240
Water...

264
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:30,939
Water.

265
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:32,510
Water.

266
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,179
- Water.
- Water.

267
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,380
They were imitating him.

268
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,819
Look at them imitating me. Water.

269
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:40,990
- Water.
- Water.

270
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,420
They suddenly imitated me.

271
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,920
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

272
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,229
How adorable.

273
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,660
Their pronunciation is good.

274
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,199
(Let's have a cup of morning coffee.)

275
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,559
A cup of coffee in the morning.

276
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,900
There's nothing better than this
in the morning.

277
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:57,140
Cheers.

278
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,870
Gosh. With the view of the baobab trees.

279
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,309
(Sipping)

280
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
(Gosh)

281
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,079
Gosh. The coffee is good.

282
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:08,309
- Gosh.
- This is nice.

283
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,920
Oh, it's sweet.

284
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,490
(Ripping off a piece of baguette)

285
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,689
- The baguette.
- How many baguettes do you have?

286
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,319
Is the bread multiplying?

287
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:20,790
Having breakfast here...

288
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,929
with bread and coffee...

289
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,630
We didn't have any food waste,
thanks to Pani Bottle.

290
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:29,839
(Glancing over)

291
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,839
(An animal's cry)

292
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,410
What was that?

293
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,240
Are they killing something?

294
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
Oh, my.

295
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:40,679
They are.

296
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,920
- They are?
- Yes.

297
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,120
- They're killing something?
- It sounds like some animal.

298
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,819
- The other ones are there.
- They are slaughtering something.

299
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,490
Gosh, they are.

300
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,229
Oh, my.

301
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,400
(This is daily life for people here,)

302
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,569
(but for the Madagascar Brothers,
it is an unfamiliar sight.)

303
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,339
It was like that for a while.

304
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:10,479
How it sounded so scared.

305
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:17,020
It knew the end was coming.

306
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,819
(Looking away with a heavy heart)

307
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,959
I used to see things like that a lot
in the countryside when I was young.

308
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:31,260
- Slaughtering cows and such.
- They used to slaughter pigs.

309
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,260
- Pigs...
- With the head...

310
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,469
I saw people slaughtering pigs
when I was young.

311
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:36,300
Pigs and chicken.

312
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,240
They used to slaughter everything
except people.

313
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:45,209
(Feeling a sense of solemnity)

314
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:47,609
I felt bad for the goat,

315
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,420
but like in Korea,

316
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,819
some people may run restaurants.

317
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,819
Some are in the livestock industry.
My aunt raises cows too.

318
00:14:57,819 --> 00:14:59,459
Right. For some, it's a job.

319
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:02,130
She provided for her kids by raising cows.

320
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,530
If I think about it that way,
everything is intertwined.

321
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:07,270
I can't say anything about it. It's so...

322
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,699
It's just...

323
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:12,370
I think that's how life really is.

324
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,870
Just the fact itself...

325
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,380
without any sugar-coating.

326
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,679
It made me think so many things. Yes.

327
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,709
(Sincerely praying for the goat)

328
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:22,010
Did you pray?

329
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,880
I prayed for it to be born as a human
in its next life.

330
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,550
(I pray you are born as a human
in your next life.)

331
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,689
(Leaving their heavy hearts behind)

332
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:35,729
- Let's clean up and go.
- Okay.

333
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:37,160
- Let's be quick.
- Yes.

334
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,770
Hello!

335
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,469
- That's it, right?
- I think so.

336
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:43,170
- That one.
- Hello.

337
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:44,640
Okay. Let's go home.

338
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,709
We let them know the night before.

339
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,510
- To meet you there?
- Yes. To meet us at a certain time.

340
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,410
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

341
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,250
- What's that?
- It's a turkey.

342
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:55,410
- What's that?
- A turkey.

343
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:57,420
GoPro. Wait.

344
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,189
Is that a turkey?

345
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:01,920
How fascinating.

346
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,420
We just found a turkey.

347
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,359
Hello.

348
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,959
Key, key, turkey.

349
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,359
Sir? Interview.

350
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,469
- What's with the beak? Is that a net?
- Seriously.

351
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:17,199
There's some meat hanging from the beak.

352
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,270
Is that a tongue or something?

353
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,540
Mr. Key?

354
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,740
Interview, please.

355
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,439
Are you a turkey?

356
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,309
I couldn't grab it...

357
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:28,510
because its toenails
looked like a velociraptor's.

358
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,020
- I see.
- Oh, the toenails of a dinosaur?

359
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,650
If I attacked,
I would've gotten scratched.

360
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:34,319
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

361
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,319
(Kian84 failed to get a private interview
with Mr. Key.)

362
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:37,459
This is our last day in Morondava.

363
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:38,859
- It is the last day in Morondava.
- Right.

364
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,530
I crossed two things off of my bucket list
in Morondava.

365
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,229
- What were they?
- Fight with a strong person.

366
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:46,530
And camp in front of the baobab trees.

367
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,929
- You did everything.
- Yes.

368
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,530
I won't be able to forget it.

369
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:51,740
This morning was so intense.

370
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,839
- I have no regrets.
- It was a great time.

371
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,880
(They're back at their lodging.)

372
00:16:58,109 --> 00:16:59,410
Gosh.

373
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,880
Good work, everyone.

374
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:05,179
We had to be on time
for our flight to Antananarivo.

375
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:06,520
So we are getting ready to leave.

376
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:11,459
(Grabbing the hat he had taken off...)

377
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,829
(and heading outside first)

378
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm going to go down and wait for them.

379
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,370
This is our last day in Morondava.

380
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,599
(Laughing)

381
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,069
For some reason,
your hat with the flowers on it...

382
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:31,309
reminds me
of "Park Won Sook's Live Together."

383
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:32,609
("Park Won Sook's Live Together" style)

384
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,809
You look so pretty and elegant.

385
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:38,219
(Satisfied)

386
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,679
I washed up,

387
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,290
then I washed my clothes
and put them on right away.

388
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,689
I think they'll dry quickly
because it's hot right now.

389
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,859
But take a look. Can you see it?
It's clean, right?

390
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:52,500
(Dirty)

391
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,770
- That isn't bad.
- Exactly.

392
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,170
Also,

393
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,469
since it's my birthday today,
I have to reply...

394
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,679
I have to reply to people on KakaoTalk,

395
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,880
so I came down first.

396
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,319
When Pani Bottle and Dex get here,
we'll leave Morondava together...

397
00:18:11,949 --> 00:18:16,120
and return to the capital. All right.

398
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,189
- Let's go.
- Give it to me. I'll hold it.

399
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:21,089
(Pani Bottle and Dex finished packing.)

400
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:23,460
- Let's go.
- Yes.

401
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:26,159
Gosh. I feel so much better. This is nice.

402
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,069
Bye.

403
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:29,470
- Bye.
- Bye. Thank you so much.

404
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,240
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

405
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,040
- See you.
- Thank you. See you.

406
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:34,569
(Bye)

407
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:37,280
- Our kind host.
- Yes.

408
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,540
- Thank you so much.
- She was so kind.

409
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,809
Thank you.

410
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:41,879
- Thank you.
- She was so kind.

411
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,379
I'm sad to leave.

412
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,450
Were we in Morondava for three days?

413
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,490
(4 days)

414
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,190
(Kian84's dream, the wild ocean)

415
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:55,030
(He tasted pure nature.)

416
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:59,359
(The Generation MZ he so wanted to meet)

417
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:03,669
(They finally arrived at the party.)

418
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:05,500
You did so much in that time.

419
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,809
Seriously. You did everything.

420
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,740
Who else would have a trip like this?

421
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,309
(Underneath the baobab trees
where they could see the Milky Way,)

422
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,220
(the Madagascar Brothers
grew even closer.)

423
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,389
I think we had a great start to our trip.

424
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,659
Thank you.

425
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:27,629
- Bye.
- See you.

426
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:30,030
- Bye.
- Morondava was really nice...

427
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,530
- because the locals were so kind.
- Right.

428
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,800
I couldn't help but feel positive
about the area.

429
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,500
- Right.
- They all helped you.

430
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,240
I think people leave...

431
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,440
- the most lasting impressions.
- Exactly.

432
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,240
It would be too far to take this, right?

433
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,379
There's a rickshaw.

434
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:46,879
- Hello.
- Hello.

435
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,609
Airport?

436
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,020
- Airport?
- I think we'll need two for our luggage.

437
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,050
Right.

438
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,990
- Dex. You should ride in one car.
- Right.

439
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:57,490
Why do I keep wanting more things...

440
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,059
- the more I travel?
- Airport?

441
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:00,089
- Why did I bring so much?
- I have so much stuff.

442
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,889
- I'll get that myself.
- Okay.

443
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,260
Hello.

444
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,530
Airport?

445
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,329
Airport.

446
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:09,869
(Whirring)

447
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:10,899
How much?

448
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,240
How much does he want?

449
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,869
Three?

450
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,069
How much did he ask for?

451
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,680
- Airport.
- Airport?

452
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,040
How much?

453
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:20,849
- What?
- What is it?

454
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,450
- Hold on. He wants 400,000 ariaries?
- He wants 400,000 ariaries?

455
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,180
- That's 100 dollars. That's nonsense.
- What?

456
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,520
- That's tenfold higher.
- Let's get off.

457
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
- Let's get off. No way.
- Gosh.

458
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Let's get off.

459
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:28,919
That's crazy.

460
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,290
He asked for 400,000 ariaries.

461
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,490
- Gosh. That was nonsense.
- That was crazy.

462
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,389
- Hey, my guy asked for 30,000 ariaries.
- He's trying to rip us off big time.

463
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:37,030
- This is crazy. He wants 100 dollars?
- Okay.

464
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,500
- He said okay.
- What? He said okay to nine dollars.

465
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,760
- Nine dollars.
- Thirty thousand?

466
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:41,869
- He got a 101-dollar discount.
- By the way...

467
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:43,869
By the way, he didn't fight back.

468
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:46,139
Or did he press an extra zero by mistake?

469
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:47,369
That's possible.

470
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,609
Okay. Thank you.

471
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,940
(He peacefully loads his bag
after negotiating the price.)

472
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,750
Thank you. Okay. Let's go.

473
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:55,980
Airport.

474
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,349
- Airport. Let's go.
- Okay. Let's go.

475
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:00,589
(They set out to Morondava Airport.)

476
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,159
Once we get there, we'll spend a "me day."

477
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,230
- Right.
- What are you going to do?

478
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,129
- I'm going to...
- That day,

479
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:11,099
we were going back to the capital city.

480
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:12,659
- Then we were going to have our own day.
- Right.

481
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:15,230
After that, we planned to meet up
at a Korean restaurant to have a party.

482
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,869
- You need some time to yourselves.
- Right.

483
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:21,069
Let's go to a hotel that has Wi-Fi today.

484
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:22,210
- Okay.
- Okay.

485
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:23,839
I'll book a nice hotel.

486
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:27,349
So when we flew back to Antananarivo...

487
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:29,079
Hey,
you look like the owner of the rickshaw.

488
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:30,950
I would call for a taxi if he cycled by.

489
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,950
(He would make a great rickshaw driver.)

490
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,990
The 22nd was Kian84's birthday.

491
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,389
So once we got to Antananarivo,

492
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:37,990
I was going to give him
the present I brought from Korea.

493
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,460
To celebrate his birthday,

494
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,260
we were going to have Korean food
at a Korean restaurant. That was our plan.

495
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,000
Goodbye, Morondava.

496
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,399
(As they look forward
to having a me day in the capital city...)

497
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,569
Thank you.

498
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:52,700
(They arrive at the airport.)

499
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,309
All right. Let's go.

500
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,809
Let's go.

501
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,809
Remember what we always talked about?

502
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,149
- We wanted to have our own room.
- Right.

503
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,879
- Should we book the hotel now?
- Should we do that today?

504
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:05,550
Let me book three rooms
with good air conditioners.

505
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,720
I'll book a hotel with good Wi-Fi.

506
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,250
- Good Wi-Fi sounds good too.
- Yes.

507
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,119
- Was Wi-Fi slow at the other hotel?
- Wi-Fi...

508
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,290
Right. We didn't get good cell reception
in general in Morondava.

509
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,859
We practically slept out
on the street last night.

510
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:19,599
- Don't put it that way. It was camping.
- Right. Camping.

511
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,730
- Camping was on my bucket list.
- Okay.

512
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:25,240
- But I can't find three single rooms.
- Okay.

513
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:27,040
- The conditions are different.
- Okay.

514
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:28,540
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- How about this?

515
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,379
We should just split the cost
evenly among the three of us.

516
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:35,079
But we should give the best room to Kian84
since it's his birthday today.

517
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,379
- Gosh.
- Come on.

518
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:38,050
- We should let him have the good room.
- Gosh. Don't do that.

519
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,649
He should get the best room
since it's his birthday.

520
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,750
You should get the second-best room.

521
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,149
Since I'm the youngest,

522
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:43,690
- I'll get the regular room.
- How sweet.

523
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:45,859
- Well...
- Let's go and check it out first.

524
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:47,730
- So this is...
- By "Let's go," he means...

525
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,359
- "Sure. Let's do that."
- Right.

526
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:51,000
- That's Kian84's language.
- Kian84's language.

527
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,230
By the way,

528
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,930
even when I went to a very nice hotel,

529
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,730
I barely remember
enjoying the amenities of the hotel.

530
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,200
There was a dry sauna room.
I was told to try it out and all.

531
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,339
But I couldn't enjoy all the amenities.

532
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:02,510
(The oldest brother
rarely enjoys the amenities.)

533
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,579
Then why don't you two switch rooms?

534
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,680
You should take the regular room.

535
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:08,180
- No, I didn't mean it like that.
- Dex...

536
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,520
- What's wrong with that?
- I'll take the best room today.

537
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,349
- Then you...
- Isn't that what you were implying?

538
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:13,750
I was just saying.

539
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,790
(I'll take the good room.)

540
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:17,059
- You know how to handle Kian84.
- I was just saying.

541
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:18,159
I mean, I would have usually...

542
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,859
- given the best room to the youngest.
- It's a good gesture. Just take it.

543
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:21,589
- But it's his birthday.
- Right.

544
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,430
Let's go and check-in.

545
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,460
(The rooms have been assigned
for the sake of the birthday guy.)

546
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:26,700
Hello.

547
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,970
(They hand over their passports.)

548
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:31,970
(The younger ones check their heavy bags.)

549
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,369
Here it goes.

550
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,109
Thank you.

551
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,280
- Then Kian84 didn't check any luggage?
- Thank you.

552
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,940
- I don't do that.
- He just went?

553
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,149
- He has no luggage to check.
- He has nothing to check.

554
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:44,450
- That's a useful tip for traveling.
- Right.

555
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,079
- Get rid of your luggage.
- Get rid of it.

556
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,849
(He has her respect.)

557
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,119
- We're done, right?
- Yes.

558
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,520
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

559
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:54,790
- This is the gate.
- The departure gate.

560
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,889
Let's go.

561
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:57,260
(Following after Pani Bottle)

562
00:23:58,859 --> 00:23:59,899
You saw me?

563
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:02,899
You saw him?

564
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,399
- Me?
- Yes.

565
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:06,869
He recognized Dex.

566
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:09,069
- It's me.
- He saw us both.

567
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:10,680
- Yes. You two.
- Gosh.

568
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:13,710
I must have gotten famous in Morondava.

569
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,980
I guess a lot more people watch
the moraingy matches.

570
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,020
(Two days ago,)

571
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:22,819
(even the champion of Morondava
tried out the moraingy match.)

572
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,960
(He had a heated match
while countless locals watched him fight.)

573
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,629
So he was at the match.

574
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:32,530
(Thanks to that,
he became a celebrity in Morondava.)

575
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,270
How many people recognized him so far?

576
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,399
Right?
So there's no entertainment like Netflix.

577
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:39,040
The moraingy matches
are their entertainment.

578
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,770
Did I fight the champion?

579
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:44,440
Darn it.

580
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,109
By the way, he was a real champion.
I asked him.

581
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:50,419
I know that. Everyone does.
Don't worry about it.

582
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,780
- You already mentioned that many times.
- You fought well.

583
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,950
- He seems coy now.
- I...

584
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,250
- You did well.
- I did a good job too.

585
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,419
You did.

586
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:57,460
"Your performance..."

587
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,859
"Your performance wasn't all bad."

588
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:02,290
- You were cool.
- You know that hurt even more, right?

589
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,359
(It's a painful memory for him.)

590
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,359
- Let me shave your head at the hotel.
- Stand up.

591
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,899
- Stand up. Okay.
- Stand up. Yes.

592
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:08,129
Why? For a picture?

593
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,770
(In front of the camera,)

594
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,500
(we should pretend to punch each other.)

595
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,770
I see. You want that?

596
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,669
He was trying to teach me.

597
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,780
He was trying to teach me some poses.

598
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,010
(The two of them are getting along well.)

599
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,710
He did that because Dex was a winner.

600
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,020
- I guess a lot of people had fun...
- Yes.

601
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,349
- watching Dex's match.
- Right.

602
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,819
No one is approaching me about my match.

603
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:33,089
Kian84 ends up feeling disappointed.

604
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,260
Check out the look on his face.

605
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,089
- There's nothing for the loser.
- He's feeling bitter.

606
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:38,960
"Well done. You had a good fight too."

607
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,530
- You were cool too.
- "You were cool too."

608
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,399
- Winning second place is impressive too.
- Besides, you didn't lose.

609
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,339
You too. You...

610
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:46,339
No, he did lose.

611
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:48,240
(Brutally honest)

612
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,869
- No.
- You did well.

613
00:25:49,869 --> 00:25:51,109
- Gosh.
- You did well.

614
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:52,540
- We all watched it.
- Right.

615
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,379
- He was good, wasn't he?
- Yes.

616
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:56,309
- He had a good fight, didn't he?
- You too. You...

617
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,750
- Gosh. No.
- Gosh. He keeps...

618
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,780
He keeps approaching Dex.

619
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,950
- No. Don't be so nice to him.
- What? Why did he give his hat to Dex?

620
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,690
You look like a soldier.

621
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,490
- Come on. It looks good on him.
- Right.

622
00:26:07,389 --> 00:26:09,089
(Envious)

623
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:10,159
It looks perfect on you.

624
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,300
Victory.

625
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,300
(Responding with a salute)

626
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,430
- Goodness.
- Gosh, that...

627
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,530
It's rare for a police officer
to put his hat...

628
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,069
- on a civilian. Seriously.
- Right.

629
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:18,869
He's not that disciplined.

630
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,139
(Dex's number 1 fan)

631
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:21,240
(Dex's number 2 fan)

632
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,510
He's Dex's number three fan.

633
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,639
(I welcome any fans.)

634
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,280
(Dex's number 3 fan is satisfied.)

635
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Okay?

636
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,879
- Good luck.
- Goodbye.

637
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,379
- Goodbye.
- Hey, it looked like that guy...

638
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:33,550
was in love with you for real.

639
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,619
- Yes.
- Yes.

640
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:37,659
(He sets out to board the plane
with full of envy.)

641
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:38,690
Thank you.

642
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,690
Gosh. It's hot.

643
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,260
(Suddenly training his eyes)

644
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,669
The sun in Africa is...

645
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:50,369
- definitely on another level.
- Right.

646
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,639
When we arrive in Antananarivo,
the weather will be cool.

647
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:54,639
That makes me happy.

648
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,210
But it will be as hot as here
in Antananarivo during the day.

649
00:26:57,309 --> 00:26:58,379
I see.

650
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,480
But because the altitude is high,
it will be slightly cooler.

651
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,849
- Right.
- Will you get the altitude sickness?

652
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:03,849
- No.
- I'm worried about that.

653
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:05,119
If I pass out, carry me on your back.

654
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:07,250
(Do that before he turns into this.)

655
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,919
- My limit is 500m.
- I think he'll be okay.

656
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,089
- He started to accept that about him.
- Right.

657
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,619
He won't deny that.

658
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:14,530
But you're strong underwater.

659
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,530
- Right.
- Yes.

660
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,260
I'm looking forward
to seeing him on Nosy Be.

661
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,000
Right. Let's go underwater.

662
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,099
- What?
- What is this place now?

663
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,169
Nosy Be.

664
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:26,800
- Seal Bottle.
- Gosh.

665
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,240
(He freely swims like a seal.)

666
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:30,579
(Screaming)

667
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,079
(Did he see a sea turtle,
the symbol of good luck?)

668
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,909
- It's rare to spot sea turtles.
- A sea turtle.

669
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:38,220
(He will soon become
the prince of the sea.)

670
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,319
(They arrive in Antananarivo
after the 1-hour flight.)

671
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,559
Antadari. No.

672
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,829
I was all alone when I went to Morondava.

673
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:52,859
But I came back as a trio.

674
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,169
My wife and my son.

675
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:57,470
(My wife and my son)

676
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,399
It just means we have bonded a lot.

677
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:00,569
- That's right.
- Right.

678
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:01,809
You guys are a family now.

679
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,040
I'm back now.

680
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:06,680
Andotada.

681
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,409
(The right name is Antananarivo.)

682
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:09,879
I'll be disappointed
if he gets the name right.

683
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,780
- Taxi.
- Taxi.

684
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,790
Yes, I know.

685
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,050
- Yes, I know.
- How much?

686
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,059
- How much?
- One hundred thousand.

687
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:19,659
- One hundred thousand?
- Yes.

688
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:20,960
That's about 30 dollars.

689
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,389
How long does it take?

690
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:23,760
Forty-five minutes.

691
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,930
- Forty-five minutes.
- That's quite far.

692
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,000
When I went to a hotel
around the same neighborhood by myself,

693
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,700
I paid about 20 dollars.

694
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:30,839
Then it's not a bad price.

695
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,000
- It's exactly 100,000 ariaries.
- Sure. Let's take it.

696
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,740
- Right.
- There are three of us now.

697
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:35,309
Okay.

698
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:36,609
That wasn't a bad price.

699
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:39,180
The price of gas there is
the same as the price in Korea.

700
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,579
Let's go.

701
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:43,109
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

702
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:46,720
(The taxi leaves the airport
and starts heading downtown.)

703
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:50,220
I see a mansion here.

704
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:52,260
Expensive apartments?

705
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,260
Yes.

706
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,159
They are brand new.

707
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,730
- Now that we're in the capital city,
- Yes.

708
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,700
things look sophisticated here.

709
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,970
- It looks nice. It's clean too.
- It is, right?

710
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,500
The atmospheres are totally different.

711
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,040
(They drive past
the tall apartment buildings...)

712
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,569
(and head toward the view
of the countryside.)

713
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:11,180
Gosh. The view here looks different now.

714
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,849
They're drying their clothes on the lawn.

715
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,619
They don't use the washing machines
because electricity is scarce.

716
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:19,819
They wash their clothes
and dry them on the lawn like that.

717
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,349
- Just like Kian84.
- Right.

718
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:23,119
I use a washing machine.

719
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,419
(I use a washing machine.)

720
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:25,559
What?

721
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,829
- What a surprise.
- What are you talking about?

722
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,990
Hey, check that out.

723
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,129
There are houses along the ridge.

724
00:29:32,129 --> 00:29:34,129
There are houses on the mountain.

725
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:35,899
(The houses are densely standing
along the ridge.)

726
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:38,740
They're weeding the rice paddy.

727
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:43,770
This sort of reminds me
of the countryside in Korea.

728
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,639
It's indescribable.

729
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,109
This is fascinating.

730
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:51,079
(The local people...)

731
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:55,550
(cultivate their lives on the vast field.)

732
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:58,089
Gosh. This place is interesting.

733
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:01,260
- The view here is quite fascinating.
- It sort of reminds me of Mongolia too.

734
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,760
Gosh. Look at the clouds too.

735
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,829
Right. It was different from Morondava.

736
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:06,859
How cool.

737
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:11,240
(They soak up the view as they look
forward to their trip at another city.)

738
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,040
(Spotting something)

739
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:15,510
What's going on? They're dancing.

740
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:16,970
Where?

741
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:19,440
- Over there. They're dancing.
- What's going on?

742
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,450
- What's going?
- Isn't that a coffin?

743
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,809
(They spot a coffin and local people.)

744
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,450
- Yes. It's a coffin.
- It's a coffin.

745
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,480
- That's a traditional funeral.
- Okay.

746
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,220
- A funeral? I see.
- A traditional funeral.

747
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,450
What's "funeral?"

748
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:31,020
- Is that a real coffin?
- The ceremony for the deceased.

749
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,190
That's a funeral.

750
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,490
(People are dancing
in front of the coffin.)

751
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,030
- A dance party?
- A coffin?

752
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,300
I know what it is.
People in Africa do this.

753
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,960
- Okay.
- In places like Ghana,

754
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,569
- their funerals are like festivals.
- Right.

755
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:43,000
(Ghana has a unique funeral tradition
where people dance.)

756
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:44,440
You mean the people who dance
in front of the coffin?

757
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,669
Yes. They do that in Ghana.

758
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:48,210
It looks like there's a similar tradition
in Madagascar too.

759
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,780
Gosh. That really startled me.

760
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,710
The traditional funeral is called...

761
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,680
Famadihana.

762
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,879
At the funeral, people dance to music,

763
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,349
(People dance with music
at Madagascar's traditional funerals.)

764
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:01,849
This is a famous tradition in Africa.

765
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,589
These rituals
don't look like funerals at all.

766
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:04,919
(Bringing out the body
from the graveyard...)

767
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,159
(and rewrapping it with new silk clothes
are the key parts of the tradition.)

768
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,859
- That's a big event.
- Yes.

769
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:13,059
We take out the corpse,
put it in a big wooden box,

770
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:15,669
- and bring it to the village.
- I see.

771
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:18,440
After we dance in the village,
we come back.

772
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,300
They take out the corpses for this,
Kian84.

773
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,569
What?

774
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:24,740
They bring out the bodies
from the graveyards.

775
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:27,480
They must rewrap the bodies again.

776
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,750
- They're shrouding the body again.
- Right.

777
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,309
- That's it.
- I see. You call that shrouding.

778
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,480
For how many days does the funeral last?

779
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,389
One day, two days, three days,
or four days?

780
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,619
- If the family is rich,
- Yes.

781
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:37,659
it lasts for two weeks.

782
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:38,690
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks.

783
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,760
If the family isn't rich,
how long does it last?

784
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,730
Then it doesn't last a long time.
One or two days.

785
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,829
One or two days?

786
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,960
- It was different based on your wealth.
- Right.

787
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,169
Rich people would have long funerals.

788
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,069
(As they check out the views outside,)

789
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:54,740
(they arrive at the downtown area
in no time.)

790
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,940
This is the capital city.

791
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,109
- The capital?
- The capital. Here.

792
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:01,409
- Hey, I see a building.
- I see. There are many companies here.

793
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:02,409
That one is huge.

794
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:04,480
There are many businesses here.

795
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,649
- What's that?
- That's the tallest.

796
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:07,950
A skyscraper.

797
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,919
There's a skyscraper in Madagascar.

798
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:13,819
That's equivalent
to Lotte Tower in Madagascar.

799
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,559
I see some tall buildings
in this neighborhood.

800
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,930
The atmosphere here
is definitely more sophisticated.

801
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,730
This city feels luxurious too.

802
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,200
Gosh. I'm back here.

803
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:25,169
I guess this is the main part of the city.

804
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,169
There's a big market up here.

805
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:28,839
- Here? A big market?
- Yes.

806
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,409
- A famous big market.
- It's great.

807
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,839
- I saw this market.
- Actually...

808
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:34,079
Check out the color of the trees
on the street.

809
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,409
- Look at the purple tree.
- Isn't it pretty?

810
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:36,649
- This is so pretty.
- How pretty.

811
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:38,220
- Aren't the flowers really pretty?
- Right.

812
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,649
Even the soldiers are watching.

813
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:42,190
Is there another boxing match?

814
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,690
(They can't stop laughing
as they sightsee together.)

815
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,319
I was alone when I left.

816
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:48,129
But I came back as a trio.

817
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,889
They weren't my wife or my son.

818
00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:52,129
I was joined by two men when I came back.

819
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,399
I could rely on them.
So I felt more at ease.

820
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,839
It was raining on my first day there.

821
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,369
- Right.
- Gosh. Look at that.

822
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:00,500
- Right.
- He was lonely too.

823
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,440
- He ate ramyeon in the rain too.
- It feels like that was ages ago.

824
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:04,409
(Now that they're together,
they can't stop laughing...)

825
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:05,710
It's great
when the three of them are together.

826
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,809
(in the heart of Madagascar...)

827
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:11,950
(at the 1,400m-high plateau.)

828
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:17,889
(The home
of the energetic 3 million residents)

829
00:33:18,089 --> 00:33:19,919
(The land of endless opportunities)

830
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,190
- Hey, that place looks great.
- That's so cool.

831
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,659
The city has a unique layout.

832
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,200
It's called Hotel Restaurant La Varangue.

833
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,230
- Okay.
- Keep an eye out for that.

834
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:31,940
I have high expectations of this hotel.

835
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,240
- Is this the place? It's right here.
- Nice.

836
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,270
It looks great.

837
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,180
- Gosh. No way.
- Goodness.

838
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,040
(A collection of classic cars)

839
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,149
- So cool.
- Really?

840
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:42,510
- Check out the classic cars.
- This is...

841
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,379
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

842
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:47,990
You said "thank you"
in a combination of three languages.

843
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,089
(He spoke in 3 languages
as he was excited.)

844
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:50,149
A combination of three languages.

845
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:52,319
(They arrive at a fancy hotel.)

846
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,819
Let's go inside.

847
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:55,659
- Hello.
- Hello.

848
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,559
(They enter the hotel
with excitement in their voices.)

849
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,329
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome.

850
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,730
- Hello.
- Should we wait for a minute?

851
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:03,500
(They wait in the lobby
before they check in.)

852
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:06,440
Hey, are we going to eat first or what?

853
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:09,609
- Our dinner is at a Korean restaurant.
- Okay.

854
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:12,409
Let's set a time to meet at the restaurant
after we enjoy our own downtime.

855
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,079
- Sounds good.
- Yes.

856
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,710
Let's not contact each other until then.

857
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,809
Okay.

858
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:18,319
- You don't hate traveling with us, right?
- No.

859
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:20,579
Let's not say hi even if we run into
each other and establish eye contact.

860
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,990
That sounds fun.

861
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,290
There's a reason behind that.
Keep watching.

862
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,990
- Right. We must do laundry, though.
- Laundry.

863
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,159
- We should do laundry together.
- We should ask them about laundry.

864
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,490
Can we...

865
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,430
How do you say "laundry service"
in English?

866
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:33,500
- "Laundry service."
- "Laundry service."

867
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,800
- Can we request laundry service?
- Yes.

868
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,339
If you give me the clothes now,
you'll get them back tomorrow.

869
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:40,839
- Tomorrow. When tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

870
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,540
- Tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow morning.

871
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,339
- Maybe at 8 a.m. or... Okay.
- Give them to me now.

872
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,079
We should give her the clothes now.

873
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,339
- Okay. Right now.
- Hurry.

874
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,079
- Right now.
- I don't have any dirty laundry.

875
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:50,250
- You don't have any dirty laundry?
- No.

876
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,349
- Okay.
- Here.

877
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:53,250
You're wearing dirty laundry right now.
What's he talking about?

878
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:56,389
That was a sharp comment.

879
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,119
- How harsh. That was pretty sharp.
- He...

880
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,589
- Why are they so sharp-tongued?
- I wanted to understand him,

881
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:02,730
- but I couldn't. Seriously.
- Hear us out, guys.

882
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,200
It's because we've gotten very close.

883
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
- Right. This is the third season.
- Yes.

884
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,829
(Don't get the wrong idea.
We're very close.)

885
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,270
Okay.

886
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,369
(He gathers his dirty laundry
after delivering his sharp comment.)

887
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,339
- Well...
- My laundry is here.

888
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,069
This is my laundry.

889
00:35:15,669 --> 00:35:16,710
Is there a place I can change?

890
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,879
I should go and dust off my shoes.

891
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,750
(Trudging)

892
00:35:22,309 --> 00:35:24,050
(He takes off his shoes on the ground.)

893
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,689
- Gosh.
- Gosh. What is that?

894
00:35:28,189 --> 00:35:29,620
Is he on the blackboard duty?

895
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,359
- I bet their laundry service is great.
- Right.

896
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:33,560
I can't wait to get clean clothes back.

897
00:35:34,229 --> 00:35:37,459
(The oldest brother has been doing
his own laundry for 6 days.)

898
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,430
Does it include breakfast or not?

899
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,370
- It's included. Yes.
- It's included?

900
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,530
Gosh. We can get breakfast?

901
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,339
Well, we booked an expensive room.

902
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,269
- Right. Have some breakfast at the hotel.
- Right.

903
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:51,339
So it comes with the deal.
Kian84. Breakfast is included here.

904
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:52,939
- What? Breakfast?
- Breakfast is included.

905
00:35:52,939 --> 00:35:54,450
- Yes.
- That's great.

906
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,749
I have a good feeling about this hotel.

907
00:35:55,749 --> 00:35:57,050
- Breakfast?
- Yes.

908
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,749
I'm pretty sure
this will be the best hotel...

909
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:01,120
we'll stay in Madagascar.

910
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,319
Wait.
How much are we paying for the rooms here?

911
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:05,060
The cheapest room costs 85 euros.

912
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,519
The most expensive room costs 200 euros.

913
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,330
- Gosh. The price more than doubled.
- Hey, that's way too expensive.

914
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,789
- The rooms...
- Kian84, enjoy it.

915
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,530
- Gosh. Hey.
- It's your birthday today.

916
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,530
Okay.

917
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,999
It was Kian84's birthday.

918
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,539
He's spending his birthday
in a foreign country, Madagascar.

919
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,870
Traveling is...

920
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,609
Of course, even if we have some hard days,
it's still fun and all.

921
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:25,140
But we do need some time to recharge.

922
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,140
So I booked a good hotel.

923
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,850
But when we got there,
it was much better than I expected.

924
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,649
(He successfully booked a nice hotel.)

925
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,019
What's this? We're getting welcome drinks.

926
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:33,550
What's this?

927
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:34,890
(Salivating)

928
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,319
How nice. You're getting treated well.

929
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,490
- This juice is free.
- Free?

930
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

931
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,560
- What juice is it?
- What...

932
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,060
- It has strawberries and mangoes.
- This is...

933
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
That looks tasty.

934
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,229
Strawberries and mangoes? This is tasty.

935
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:48,169
(Inhaling)

936
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:49,870
- You're enjoying that, Dex.
- Yes.

937
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:52,240
If I like it,
it means it's tasty for everyone.

938
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,870
Well, it's your birthday today.
Are you happy?

939
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:56,269
You haven't checked out your room yet.

940
00:36:56,269 --> 00:36:57,939
- Gosh. It's just another day.
- But the exterior of the hotel...

941
00:36:58,479 --> 00:36:59,939
By the way,
I want to say this to my friends.

942
00:36:59,939 --> 00:37:01,780
I want to tell them not to send me
any presents for my birthday.

943
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,950
It makes me feel bad.

944
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,950
- Here's why. I...
- Because you must get them presents too?

945
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,379
No. I forget other people's birthdays
often and fail to send presents.

946
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:09,089
Neither receive nor give presents.

947
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:10,789
I feel bad accepting presents.

948
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:12,359
Why don't you announce it
on your YouTube channel?

949
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,990
"Don't send me presents."

950
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,629
Tell them never to send you presents
for the rest of your life.

951
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,160
Tell them not to do a thing.

952
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,300
- Well, that's pretty extreme.
- They shouldn't even mention it.

953
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,370
If anyone mentions your birthday,
you'll end your friendships with them.

954
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:22,970
And he'll delete their phone numbers.

955
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,129
(Snowballing it)

956
00:37:24,229 --> 00:37:25,839
(Look at these punks.)

957
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,970
- Tell them not to mention your birthday.
- He seems hurt now.

958
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,640
- Why do you have to make it so extreme?
- No?

959
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,970
Why are you making it extreme?

960
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,339
(He's having a blast teasing Kian84.)

961
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,810
- Hey.
- "How dare you give me a present?"

962
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,010
- You guys are getting...
- "I told you never to give me presents."

963
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,120
The more I travel with you guys,
the more twisted you guys are getting.

964
00:37:40,249 --> 00:37:42,890
We keep finding ourselves
wanting to tease Kian84...

965
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:45,959
because Kian84 always plays along
with our jokes.

966
00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:48,030
- Are you ready?
- Yes, we're ready.

967
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

968
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,499
You know that those small breaks
are really fun, right?

969
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:53,660
- We do.
- Of course.

970
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:57,169
Gosh. Is this the restaurant?

971
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:00,839
This is our restaurant.

972
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:04,879
You can have your breakfast here tomorrow.

973
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:06,740
- Okay. Our breakfast will be here.
- Gosh.

974
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,379
I mean, this path...

975
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:11,419
(This high-end hotel has a trail too.)

976
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:13,819
We're going all out at this hotel today.

977
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:16,689
The more we explored, the more impressed
we were by the facility.

978
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,459
Gosh. This feels surreal
because this hotel is way too fancy.

979
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:21,629
This hotel is amazing.

980
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:23,830
(The nice gesture of the younger brothers
brings him to this luxurious room.)

981
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,229
- Right here.
- This is pretty high up.

982
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:28,269
Hey, it's way too big for one person.

983
00:38:29,629 --> 00:38:30,669
(The room makes their eyes open wide.)

984
00:38:30,669 --> 00:38:31,999
What? This is a house.

985
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:36,410
(The living room is
as spacious as a field.)

986
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,379
- It looks like Chairman Modi's house.
- This place is amazing.

987
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,350
Hello.

988
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,310
(They met Chairman Modi,
a man of fortune, in India.)

989
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,120
It'd be so cool
if he appeared like this later.

990
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,289
- He might appear.
- Maybe.

991
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:50,050
(A nice living room that makes you think
that Chairman Modi will welcome you)

992
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,289
- Nice.
- That's all.

993
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,560
It's luxurious.

994
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,859
- Gosh.
- It's super nice.

995
00:38:56,859 --> 00:38:58,629
(A super nice bathroom)

996
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:03,069
- Why does it feel...
- How do you feel about being successful?

997
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:05,569
Why does it feel uncomfortable?

998
00:39:06,669 --> 00:39:09,640
(He used to sleep in the sand bed
on the beach or a small tent.)

999
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,109
Yes. He deserves it.

1000
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:14,339
You should stay in a place like this.
It's your birthday.

1001
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,209
Birthdays aren't special.
I don't need a place as nice as this.

1002
00:39:19,249 --> 00:39:20,379
(He says he doesn't need it,
but he puts down his bag.)

1003
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:21,850
(Shy)

1004
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,890
Okay.

1005
00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:26,789
The guys booked a nice room
for my birthday.

1006
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,729
You should indeed sleep in a nice room...

1007
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:30,430
for your health.

1008
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,300
That's why Chairman Modi is healthy
even at his age.

1009
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,729
With the big diamond on this hat.

1010
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,269
It feels like he's speaking in paradise.

1011
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,740
(Is this a paradise?)

1012
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,740
It's your room, Pani Bottle.

1013
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,410
The air conditioner is on. It's cool now.

1014
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,379
It smells good.

1015
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:52,649
(It's nice.)

1016
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:54,950
The rooms are quite far apart
from one another.

1017
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,950
(It's a private hotel where the rooms
are far apart from one another.)

1018
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,419
The bathroom is here.

1019
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:59,060
(Lastly, they're looking around
the youngest's room.)

1020
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,959
- Okay. Good.
- Cool.

1021
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,530
Good.

1022
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:05,300
The hotel smelled nice.

1023
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,629
It was in a very good condition.

1024
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,069
I will search...

1025
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:11,030
- for a Korean restaurant...
- Okay.

1026
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,970
- and share it in our group chat.
- All right.

1027
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,569
- So 7:30 p.m.?
- It's cool. Okay.

1028
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:17,039
- Okay. It's 7:30 p.m.
- Let's meet at 7:30 p.m.

1029
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,379
Yes. Let's go.

1030
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:19,979
- I have a question.
- Yes?

1031
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,310
Do you know cow fighting?

1032
00:40:22,709 --> 00:40:25,080
- Sorry?
- Cow.

1033
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:27,850
(Bullfighting is on Dex's bucket list.)

1034
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:31,660
(Savika is a bullfight
where a man fights a bull.)

1035
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,260
(For the youngest
who is obsessed with the strong,)

1036
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,859
(he's been asking about Savika
everywhere he went.)

1037
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,999
(He used Pani language.)

1038
00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:41,729
He kept asking around.

1039
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:43,970
(Will we find a place
where we can see a bullfight?)

1040
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,069
(He decided to search for it
in the capital.)

1041
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,510
Do you know where they fight?

1042
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,140
- Savika?
- Savika. Yes.

1043
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,780
Yes. I heard about it.

1044
00:40:51,939 --> 00:40:54,180
She was the first one who knew it.

1045
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,080
Do you know where we can see
that festival or fight?

1046
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,589
- I'll ask someone for information.
- Okay.

1047
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:03,950
- Please tell me.
- Yes.

1048
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,089
After you get the information,
please tell me.

1049
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,620
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

1050
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,160
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1051
00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:10,530
I didn't know...

1052
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,430
that Pani Bottle...

1053
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:16,030
was asking around to collect information.
I'm thankful.

1054
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,399
I could ask people...

1055
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:20,839
who could speak some English.

1056
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:22,370
- So whenever I met someone, I asked them.
- Right.

1057
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,439
It was so hard to find it.

1058
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:27,140
I finally met someone who knew about it
in the capital.

1059
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:29,680
- Take a rest, Dex.
- Take a rest.

1060
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,109
It's hard to get information.

1061
00:41:31,879 --> 00:41:34,450
(The Madagascar Brothers
will have a short rest.)

1062
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:40,160
(Dex took a shower as soon as he came.)

1063
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,689
(When I meet you)

1064
00:41:43,689 --> 00:41:45,300
(I become innocent)

1065
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,459
You have to sing "Love, Two."

1066
00:41:47,459 --> 00:41:51,200
Hey. You were so excited
when you were not around us.

1067
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,039
The bathroom was big. So it echoed a lot.

1068
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:54,709
It's a nice place to sing.

1069
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:57,240
- It was like a paradise without us.
- He sounds so happy.

1070
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,539
It's a big relief
that he had some alone time.

1071
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:00,580
I know.

1072
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,280
(How did he spend the sweet alone time?)

1073
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:06,019
(I forgot about the other guys
for a moment)

1074
00:42:07,649 --> 00:42:10,019
(Immersed)

1075
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:12,660
- Nice.
- "Nice."

1076
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,390
- Thank you.
- "Thank you."

1077
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:16,689
- He's immersed in it.
- He looks happy.

1078
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:20,060
I took a rest in the hotel for a moment.

1079
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,700
I'm going to Kian84's birthday party
in the evening.

1080
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,970
But it's Pani Bottle's birthday...

1081
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,870
a few days later.

1082
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:33,339
So I was going to get
a traditional Madagascan sword.

1083
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,510
- What?
- Yes.

1084
00:42:36,649 --> 00:42:38,649
The alone time must've been precious,
but he went out for him.

1085
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,350
In India,

1086
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,819
I saw that he was interested...

1087
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:46,289
in traditional swords of the country.

1088
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,859
- He's a baby.
- He likes items.

1089
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:48,930
Yes.

1090
00:42:49,629 --> 00:42:51,430
I thought I should spend the time for him.

1091
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,300
So I went outside to get a sword.

1092
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,069
I already prepared a gift for Kian84.

1093
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,100
I remember...

1094
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,209
there was a small market.

1095
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:03,870
He's thoughtful.

1096
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,580
- Yes. He has a good heart.
- Yes.

1097
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:07,709
Is that why you wanted some alone time?

1098
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:08,879
- Yes.
- Right.

1099
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:10,680
That's why he insisted.

1100
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:13,050
It begins here. Yes.

1101
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,220
I can feel it.

1102
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:20,289
This is the biggest market in the city.

1103
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,729
I think they have it here.

1104
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:25,700
(Looking around)

1105
00:43:26,129 --> 00:43:27,260
A knife shop.

1106
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,129
No?

1107
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:30,930
What?

1108
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,339
It's a pity that they don't have it.

1109
00:43:34,169 --> 00:43:35,240
A knife.

1110
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,410
They don't have knives.

1111
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:39,740
A knife.

1112
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,450
He walked around so much.

1113
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,010
Doesn't it look like they would have it?

1114
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:44,879
Did you work that hard to find it?

1115
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:46,879
I didn't know.

1116
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:51,120
This is almost the end of the market.

1117
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,220
(He circled back
to the entrance of the market.)

1118
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,490
What?

1119
00:43:54,689 --> 00:43:56,260
(He found something.)

1120
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,129
It's so disappointing.

1121
00:43:59,399 --> 00:44:01,800
After walking around so much,
the things I found...

1122
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:03,229
are fruit knives.

1123
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,370
What?

1124
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,370
- Kitchen knives.
- You can't get it for him.

1125
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:08,709
- Fruit knives.
- African fruit knives.

1126
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,280
I would be happy about a fruit knife
after watching his effort.

1127
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,280
(It's a pity.)

1128
00:44:14,439 --> 00:44:15,810
It's raining.

1129
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:18,450
It doesn't seem to pour soon.

1130
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:21,490
But they are closing.

1131
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,850
I think I should hurry up.

1132
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:27,220
He could've just seen me
taking interest in swords...

1133
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,260
- and moved on,
- He caught it.

1134
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,330
but he remembered
and wanted to get it for my birthday.

1135
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:32,430
- He's thoughtful.
- You might fall in love...

1136
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,729
- with each other.
- What's going on?

1137
00:44:33,729 --> 00:44:34,970
It's so touching.

1138
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:36,870
I'm more thoughtful than I look.

1139
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,569
In Anchirabe, India,

1140
00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:41,399
- Where is Anchirabe?
- Where is Anchirabe?

1141
00:44:41,399 --> 00:44:42,669
Isn't it Anchirabe?

1142
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,339
It's Amritsar.

1143
00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:48,080
Amritsar.

1144
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,609
(How the eldest memorized Amritsar)

1145
00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:51,649
(Hanatsar?)

1146
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:52,749
(Yababisa?)

1147
00:44:52,749 --> 00:44:54,019
(Hanabasi?)

1148
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,350
(Amnippal Tsarppomppa?)

1149
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,789
(He tried to memorize
with a miraculous mnemonics.)

1150
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,859
Anchirabe? It's Amritsar.

1151
00:45:00,919 --> 00:45:02,289
(The eldest is still the same.)

1152
00:45:02,289 --> 00:45:04,189
(And the younger one learned from him.)

1153
00:45:04,729 --> 00:45:07,129
It sounds similar. It can be confusing.

1154
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,300
(They're indeed
Zero Intelligence Brothers.)

1155
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,470
It won't be easy today.

1156
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,240
It's a shame.

1157
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,970
(Pani Bottle who will receive his gift
is walking around the city as well.)

1158
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:19,180
Meanwhile, what is Pani Bottle doing?

1159
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,609
(He's searching.)

1160
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:24,310
There's a supermarket.

1161
00:45:24,879 --> 00:45:26,519
(Let's go.)

1162
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,990
I want to buy a small birthday cake...

1163
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:31,220
for Kian84.

1164
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,760
Oh, my. They were doing things
for each other.

1165
00:45:32,859 --> 00:45:35,959
It's like how we make a cake
with chocolate pies...

1166
00:45:36,089 --> 00:45:38,160
in the Korean army.

1167
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,100
I started to buy things
we needed for that.

1168
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,260
I'm thankful.

1169
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,930
Oh, my. It's so heartwarming.

1170
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,899
I washed my pants.

1171
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,939
All I have is swimwear.
I'm only wearing swimwear.

1172
00:45:48,939 --> 00:45:50,470
- Isn't it underwear?
- Is it swimwear?

1173
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:52,109
- Isn't it underwear?
- My gosh.

1174
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:53,609
It's matching the color of the flip-flop.

1175
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:55,780
It's so funny
that the pants have a matching color.

1176
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,879
- The pink is so intense.
- It must be cold.

1177
00:45:57,979 --> 00:45:59,620
The view is amazing here.

1178
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,280
I really like the atmosphere.

1179
00:46:01,919 --> 00:46:02,950
Hello.

1180
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,519
It looks like you weren't wearing pants.

1181
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:05,859
(It catches your eyes.)

1182
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,859
What? Wait. It's ice cream.

1183
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:11,930
(Pausing)

1184
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,959
I want to eat it, but let's suppress it.

1185
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:15,700
They have baguettes too.

1186
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,729
Baguettes?

1187
00:46:16,729 --> 00:46:17,769
(Licking)

1188
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:19,470
- He's licking.
- I hope he has a commercial deal.

1189
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:20,470
- I hope he does.
- For real. A Paris Baguette commercial.

1190
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,209
- I love baguettes.
- Pani Baguette.

1191
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:23,810
- I hope he endorses Paris Baguette.
- Yes.

1192
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:26,209
"Tonga Sowa."

1193
00:46:26,979 --> 00:46:29,510
The store is quite big.

1194
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:31,080
Let me see what they have.

1195
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,220
(Let me see.)

1196
00:46:33,879 --> 00:46:35,319
Balloons.

1197
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:37,149
Do they have candles?

1198
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,490
Wait.

1199
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,890
My gosh. "Birthday."

1200
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,260
They have birthday items.

1201
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:45,859
All I need is a cake.

1202
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,930
I'll get chocolate pies
that are similar to the ones in Korea.

1203
00:46:49,129 --> 00:46:50,669
That's what we need the most
to celebrate his birthday.

1204
00:46:50,669 --> 00:46:51,870
They don't have a cake.

1205
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,870
This is the most similar
to a chocolate pie.

1206
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,810
- Okay. I'll get 1, 2...
- They have a strong bond.

1207
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:58,979
- They're such good friends.
- Three.

1208
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,039
Let me get something to eat with alcohol.

1209
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:03,910
(Gasping)

1210
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,019
It smells good.

1211
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:06,050
(Sniffing)

1212
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:08,419
I'm curious about this. Let's try it.

1213
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,890
We'll eat this with alcohol.

1214
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:12,160
- Do they have pancakes too?
- I was curious about many things.

1215
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,490
- This is an alcohol accompaniment.
- So I got to buy this and that.

1216
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:15,729
- We'll have these with alcohol.
- I bought a lot of things.

1217
00:47:16,129 --> 00:47:18,229
The peach-flavored one is really good.

1218
00:47:18,229 --> 00:47:20,060
One peach, one strawberry.

1219
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,129
I lost track of time. Why is this so fun?

1220
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,339
I'll get it just in case.
It's emergency food.

1221
00:47:26,499 --> 00:47:28,269
It's for an emergency.

1222
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:29,810
(It's for an emergency where they
don't have any food to go with alcohol.)

1223
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:31,979
I bought a lot.

1224
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:33,339
- I spent so much.
- "Binge Bottle."

1225
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:34,339
(Binge Bottle is done after buying
tons of snacks to go with alcohol.)

1226
00:47:36,149 --> 00:47:38,749
(Kian84 is in the accommodation by himself
after his younger friends left.)

1227
00:47:38,749 --> 00:47:39,749
Hello.

1228
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:44,749
I got changed now.

1229
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:47,760
I happened...

1230
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,089
to wear this...

1231
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:52,530
in every season of Adventure by Accident.

1232
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,069
I think these are my favorite clothes
for the show.

1233
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:00,999
It's almost 5 p.m. now.

1234
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:05,209
I was thinking about what to do,

1235
00:48:06,109 --> 00:48:09,709
which got me wondering about
the PC cafes in Madagascar.

1236
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:12,280
But I'm not sure
if I'll be able to play games there.

1237
00:48:12,379 --> 00:48:14,419
So I might just go running.

1238
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,519
I'm still conflicted...

1239
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:19,689
between going to a PC cafe or running.

1240
00:48:19,959 --> 00:48:21,359
If I knew this,

1241
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:23,959
I would have taken everyone
to the PC cafe with me.

1242
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:25,930
- I see.
- Gosh.

1243
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,030
(He's calling someone?)

1244
00:48:30,669 --> 00:48:32,240
- Hello?
- Mom!

1245
00:48:32,899 --> 00:48:35,769
Hi, I was worried about you.

1246
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:37,370
- He's such a good son.
- I'm in Africa.

1247
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,439
Are you hanging out with Madagascans
over there too?

1248
00:48:41,439 --> 00:48:44,180
- Well, we went harpoon fishing.
- Okay.

1249
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,080
Do you know what a baobab is, Mom?

1250
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,780
Yes, I've heard a lot about it.

1251
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,550
- And lobsters are very cheap here.
- So what date are you returning to Korea?

1252
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,990
You're so affectionate...

1253
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,390
- to your mom.
- He's telling her everything.

1254
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,089
I'm good at communicating with my mother.

1255
00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:55,959
I'm sure she gets curious.

1256
00:48:56,289 --> 00:48:58,560
Are you getting along with the others?

1257
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:00,060
Yes, I am.

1258
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,470
The guys are so nice.

1259
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:05,240
- Good. I was just curious...
- Yes.

1260
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,109
if the natives really do walk around
only wearing their underwear.

1261
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:11,709
- That's understandable.
- Right. We're not acquainted with...

1262
00:49:11,709 --> 00:49:13,510
Natives these days aren't like that.

1263
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,680
They wear Nike.

1264
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,609
- Really?
- Yes.

1265
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:20,519
Be careful and
don't deviate from the group.

1266
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:21,620
- Okay.
- Yes.

1267
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:23,589
- All right.
- Sure.

1268
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:25,120
- Do your best. See you soon.
- Yes, mom.

1269
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,689
All parents worry about the same things.

1270
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:28,019
- Right.
- Right.

1271
00:49:28,629 --> 00:49:30,990
(Before he leaves, he's going over
what he's going to do by himself.)

1272
00:49:31,189 --> 00:49:32,660
It's close by. Okay.

1273
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,430
Oh, was there a PC cafe?

1274
00:49:35,669 --> 00:49:36,970
I decided to go running.

1275
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:39,399
- In the end...
- The PC cafe was a bit far away.

1276
00:49:39,399 --> 00:49:43,039
I'm going to go to the observatory,

1277
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:44,970
and then from there, I'm going to run...

1278
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:47,379
approximately 7km to the restaurant.

1279
00:49:48,339 --> 00:49:49,810
Who would have thought I'd like running?

1280
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:51,950
I'd never even imagined it.

1281
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:54,720
I used to hate running.

1282
00:49:55,789 --> 00:49:58,189
I don't think I'll be able to see clearly
when the sun goes down,

1283
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,120
so I'm just going to catch a taxi
to the observatory.

1284
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,060
Taxi? There it is.

1285
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:05,359
That's such an old car.

1286
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,660
Taxi.

1287
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:09,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

1288
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,039
- Do you know this place?
- This one?

1289
00:50:12,169 --> 00:50:13,640
It's 2.1km away. Seven minutes by car.

1290
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:15,339
Seven minutes.

1291
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:17,439
- Seven minutes?
- How much?

1292
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,140
25,000 ariaries.

1293
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:21,539
25,000 ariaries?

1294
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,050
Okay. Let's go.

1295
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:26,050
It's roughly 7 minutes away.
And it was 8 dollars.

1296
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,089
I think I'm paying him more,

1297
00:50:29,789 --> 00:50:31,120
but that's fine.

1298
00:50:33,859 --> 00:50:35,289
The driver's driving fast.

1299
00:50:37,189 --> 00:50:41,300
Everything's neat and nice.

1300
00:50:42,229 --> 00:50:43,300
Here?

1301
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,700
Okay.

1302
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:48,609
(He gets out and pays the driver.)

1303
00:50:49,709 --> 00:50:50,769
(Out of nowhere)

1304
00:50:50,769 --> 00:50:52,410
- It's vanilla.
- Sorry.

1305
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,240
- It's vanilla.
- Vanilla?

1306
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,580
- Yes, it's good vanilla.
- Vanilla?

1307
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:58,680
What? How am I supposed to eat this?

1308
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,879
Good price.

1309
00:51:00,379 --> 00:51:03,120
- I don't know how to eat this.
- Kian84's going to buy it.

1310
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,249
Wait.

1311
00:51:05,189 --> 00:51:06,760
It does smell like vanilla.

1312
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,319
- It's vanilla.
- How much?

1313
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,160
(He asks what the price is,
even though he doesn't know what it is.)

1314
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,300
- It's 60,000 ariaries?
- Good price!

1315
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,370
- That's three...
- Yes.

1316
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,470
That's 20 dollars. It's a bit expensive.

1317
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:21,539
- So it's originally 80,000 ariaries.
- Yes.

1318
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,539
- That's the original price.
- Yes.

1319
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,039
So 6 times 3 is 18. It's 18 dollars?

1320
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,339
No.

1321
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:28,879
How much?

1322
00:51:30,209 --> 00:51:31,209
50,000 ariaries?

1323
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:32,649
- It's okay.
- Okay?

1324
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:34,649
So 5 times 3 is 15. It's 15 dollars?

1325
00:51:35,419 --> 00:51:36,990
Fifteen dollars still feels like
I'm getting ripped off.

1326
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,589
I don't think they're worth 15 dollars.

1327
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:40,060
- But that's...
- Yes, well.

1328
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,160
That's 100.

1329
00:51:41,689 --> 00:51:43,359
Thank you.

1330
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:45,359
Give me change.

1331
00:51:45,899 --> 00:51:48,530
I don't have money.

1332
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,999
Wait. She said she had no change.

1333
00:51:50,999 --> 00:51:54,470
Do you want to buy 2 for 100,000 ariaries?

1334
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,039
- Exchange?
- For 100.

1335
00:51:56,269 --> 00:51:58,879
- Hey, don't buy it!
- No, don't buy it.

1336
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,010
- Can you hear us?
- That's enough.

1337
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:02,910
- Don't buy it!
- Don't buy it.

1338
00:52:03,149 --> 00:52:05,050
- No.
- All right.

1339
00:52:05,649 --> 00:52:06,919
Cancel.

1340
00:52:07,479 --> 00:52:09,220
I get that you're in
a tough situation, but...

1341
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,050
- Right.
- Don't do that.

1342
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:12,760
She said she didn't have any change,
but all of a sudden, she did.

1343
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,519
- I was upset.
- As you should.

1344
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:17,160
Gosh, it's hard to make a living.

1345
00:52:18,899 --> 00:52:22,229
Even if they approach me
while holding a baby,

1346
00:52:22,229 --> 00:52:23,830
I shouldn't buy things from them.

1347
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:25,870
(Seeing the baby she was with...)

1348
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:26,970
Is that your son?

1349
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,439
You were trying to do something nice.

1350
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:31,669
- Right.
- She brought her daughter with her.

1351
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:34,379
Gosh.

1352
00:52:34,379 --> 00:52:35,979
Kian84 keeps getting soft.

1353
00:52:35,979 --> 00:52:37,749
That's why he should always
be with the other two.

1354
00:52:37,749 --> 00:52:39,550
Right, he shouldn't be alone in the city.

1355
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,180
(Hold on.)

1356
00:52:41,379 --> 00:52:42,589
What? Isn't this it?

1357
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:44,649
No, the observatory...

1358
00:52:44,649 --> 00:52:46,419
That jerk dropped me off
at the wrong place.

1359
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,430
- He's annoyed.
- Hurry up.

1360
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,789
He's angry.

1361
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,499
- No, I'm not.
- The vanilla incident made him mad.

1362
00:52:52,499 --> 00:52:55,669
Maybe the taxi driver and the seller
are in cahoots.

1363
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,899
I specifically told the taxi driver...

1364
00:52:58,899 --> 00:53:01,769
to take me to the observatory.
But that happened.

1365
00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:03,839
(Irritated)

1366
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:08,950
(The driver didn't even get close.)

1367
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,379
Did I get ripped off
by the taxi driver too?

1368
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,649
I got ripped off twice
as soon as I left the hotel.

1369
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,589
Guys, you have to be on alert
when you travel to the capital.

1370
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:19,189
This place isn't easy.

1371
00:53:19,189 --> 00:53:20,490
(He's suddenly in a bad mood.)

1372
00:53:22,089 --> 00:53:23,089
(Amazed)

1373
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,399
- Look at the view.
- That's amazing.

1374
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,560
I'm very high up.

1375
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,769
He's on a high mountain.

1376
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:34,899
I guess this is kind of like
Mount Nam of Antananarivo.

1377
00:53:35,439 --> 00:53:36,640
Gosh.

1378
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:38,339
I've never seen that place before.

1379
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:39,539
It's so cool.

1380
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,910
But this is...

1381
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,280
- That's the best place.
- So that's the observatory.

1382
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:49,019
No.

1383
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:51,749
(Someone calls out to him.)

1384
00:53:51,749 --> 00:53:53,220
- What?
- What?

1385
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:55,390
I'm the security.

1386
00:53:55,459 --> 00:53:57,990
- He said he was the police.
- Do I have to pay?

1387
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,200
- Yes.
- How much?

1388
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,260
Yes. As much as you want.

1389
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:02,700
Okay.

1390
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,069
(I'm not going to stay here then.)

1391
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:05,640
I almost got ripped off
for the third time.

1392
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,669
He said I had to pay
if I wanted to use the observatory.

1393
00:54:08,669 --> 00:54:11,310
- Really?
- The police asked for money?

1394
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:14,979
I couldn't understand why
they would collect money for it.

1395
00:54:14,979 --> 00:54:16,749
The observatory is free, for sure, right?

1396
00:54:16,749 --> 00:54:18,149
- That place was free.
- Right.

1397
00:54:18,149 --> 00:54:19,280
- Right.
- It's free.

1398
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,050
But there are a lot of people
who impersonate the police.

1399
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,019
- You have to be careful.
- Yes. It's very common.

1400
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:25,660
He wasn't even wearing a uniform.

1401
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,120
He was wearing a T-shirt and shorts.

1402
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,330
I was so happy after seeing the baobabs,

1403
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,189
- but here,
- Right.

1404
00:54:31,189 --> 00:54:32,530
- You almost got ripped off three times.
- I was getting...

1405
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,729
- upset.
- Of course.

1406
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,200
This place is brutal.

1407
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:38,629
My heart was warm from Morondava,

1408
00:54:39,269 --> 00:54:40,899
but it's getting colder.

1409
00:54:41,899 --> 00:54:44,010
In Morondava,

1410
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:45,810
the woman who sold the mangos,

1411
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,439
the woman at the restaurant,

1412
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,780
Luffy,

1413
00:54:48,979 --> 00:54:51,780
and the girl who worked in the lobby
at the hotel in Morondava...

1414
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,550
were all wholehearted and nice.

1415
00:54:54,879 --> 00:54:57,649
- The city is desolate.
- But this city is too cold.

1416
00:54:58,419 --> 00:54:59,660
Why is that?

1417
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,229
Why is the city so desolate?

1418
00:55:02,689 --> 00:55:03,859
I hope...

1419
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,729
my heart doesn't become too cold...

1420
00:55:09,129 --> 00:55:11,569
while we're in Antananarivo.

1421
00:55:12,569 --> 00:55:14,939
I'm originally from the provinces,
and people used to say about Seoul...

1422
00:55:14,939 --> 00:55:16,439
that you could get caught
like a sitting duck there...

1423
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:18,339
- if you were not careful.
- Right. That's a common saying.

1424
00:55:18,339 --> 00:55:19,439
I think capitals are all like that.

1425
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,939
No, there are lots of good people too.
None of us were caught like ducks.

1426
00:55:21,939 --> 00:55:23,149
(None of us were caught like ducks,
right?)

1427
00:55:23,879 --> 00:55:26,319
- You never know.
- You never know.

1428
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:28,450
- Gosh, I'm scared.
- You never know when you'll get caught.

1429
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,649
That's so scary.

1430
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,660
There it is.

1431
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,390
I think I'll have a nice view over there.

1432
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,660
(This is nice.)

1433
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,760
- Everyone.
- What?

1434
00:55:39,399 --> 00:55:41,399
- This view of the landscape is free.
- This is nice too.

1435
00:55:41,399 --> 00:55:42,530
Are you seeing this?

1436
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:46,140
Since it's free, there are some trees
getting in the way.

1437
00:55:46,269 --> 00:55:49,010
The view wasn't
as great as the observatory.

1438
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,810
It's nice, with the charm of the alleyway
added to it.

1439
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:52,140
There's no one there, so it's nice.

1440
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,140
(Kian84 tries to lighten up his bad mood
by looking at the view.)

1441
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,379
And over here.

1442
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,249
Guys, can you see?

1443
00:55:58,249 --> 00:56:00,620
If you look over there,
it's raining on one side.

1444
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:04,450
You can see the dark clouds lowering.
That's rain.

1445
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:05,689
(It's raining sorrowfully
like Kian84's bitter heart.)

1446
00:56:05,689 --> 00:56:07,189
The weather's very strange.

1447
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,129
The weather's very strange.

1448
00:56:09,129 --> 00:56:10,530
- Lighting just struck.
- Lightning.

1449
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:11,589
Did you see the lightning?

1450
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,330
Lightning struck again.

1451
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,999
- There is a lot of lightning.
- It's a good place to see it.

1452
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:17,200
(Kian84 saw a bunch of lightning
the first day of the trip.)

1453
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:20,870
(The lightning continued into the night.)

1454
00:56:21,399 --> 00:56:23,339
Goodness. Madagascar is...

1455
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:25,169
really a hot spot for lightning.

1456
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,280
The city of rip-offs and lightning.

1457
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,280
(Welcome to Antananarivo.)

1458
00:56:31,209 --> 00:56:34,080
Guys, I've discovered
an even better view that's free.

1459
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:36,490
Nothing's blocking the view here.

1460
00:56:36,819 --> 00:56:37,819
(Laughing)

1461
00:56:37,819 --> 00:56:40,089
- He's feeling better.
- Finding the best view.

1462
00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:43,859
Oh, my. Look at that lightning.

1463
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,830
There are fireworks festivals
at Han River,

1464
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,970
and there are lightning festivals
in Antananarivo.

1465
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:51,100
- "Lightning festivals."
- "Lightning festivals."

1466
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:53,899
- He's enjoying himself.
- He's feeling much better.

1467
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,069
Please strike one more time.

1468
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,510
It struck over there.

1469
00:56:58,709 --> 00:56:59,780
Gosh.

1470
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,280
I haven't seen
any lightning strikes recently.

1471
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,979
I'm seeing this year's worth
of lightning strikes here, in Madagascar.

1472
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,289
Yes. Also, I don't want to
go running anymore.

1473
00:57:13,419 --> 00:57:14,789
- He's upset.
- I'm fine with walking.

1474
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:15,959
He's exasperated.

1475
00:57:16,289 --> 00:57:17,629
I thought I'd go running.

1476
00:57:17,789 --> 00:57:20,600
But when I got here, I got scammed,
which put me in a bad mood.

1477
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,330
So I decided to walk.

1478
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:24,769
This is my plan today.

1479
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:27,999
What I experienced in Antananarivo...

1480
00:57:27,999 --> 00:57:30,439
was cold people and lightning.

1481
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,439
- Gosh.
- You should work out when you want.

1482
00:57:35,439 --> 00:57:37,479
You don't have to force yourself
to do that in a situation like that.

1483
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:39,350
Now I feel...

1484
00:57:39,979 --> 00:57:42,550
relaxed again.

1485
00:57:43,819 --> 00:57:46,359
I feel at peace now.

1486
00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:47,490
Goodness, everyone.

1487
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:49,560
(Thundering)

1488
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:51,729
He likes it.

1489
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:53,660
Lightning is striking right now.

1490
00:57:54,399 --> 00:57:56,129
- Lightning is striking.
- He's excited.

1491
00:57:56,129 --> 00:57:57,669
- He's happy like a child.
- Yes.

1492
00:57:57,669 --> 00:57:58,970
I felt better.

1493
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,740
- That's good.
- The lightning made me feel better.

1494
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,339
He's so cute.

1495
00:58:02,569 --> 00:58:04,510
(He runs excitedly like a child.)

1496
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:07,539
(He sees the lightning.)

1497
00:58:07,539 --> 00:58:09,209
A lightning show is being held.

1498
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:11,749
(Thrilled)

1499
00:58:11,749 --> 00:58:14,180
- That's cool, though.
- It looks like it's over there.

1500
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:17,019
(It's thundering nonstop.)

1501
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:19,859
Should we go over there to see it better?

1502
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:23,430
We can have a better look over there.

1503
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,930
"This is it."

1504
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:26,760
"I should watch the lightning festival."

1505
00:58:26,859 --> 00:58:28,560
I was in a high place,

1506
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,870
so I thought I could see lightning well.

1507
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:33,769
I recorded the lightning with my camera.

1508
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,910
Oh, dear.

1509
00:58:37,269 --> 00:58:38,839
(Exclaiming)

1510
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:41,580
Everyone, I finally found the best spot
for the lightning.

1511
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:43,709
- It's here.
- I got excited.

1512
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:47,220
- It looks like a horror movie.
- I know.

1513
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,780
- Look at the color.
- Oh, my.

1514
00:58:49,189 --> 00:58:50,850
(Jaw-dropping)

1515
00:58:50,919 --> 00:58:52,919
The scale was overwhelming.

1516
00:58:53,089 --> 00:58:56,689
As if aliens were invading Earth
from outer space.

1517
00:58:56,689 --> 00:58:58,490
It was magnificent.

1518
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,330
- The sound...
- Like a movie.

1519
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:02,499
- made my heart race.
- As if there's a space war.

1520
00:59:02,499 --> 00:59:04,800
Adrenaline rushed out.

1521
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,069
I wondered if I could go home alive.

1522
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:07,539
(I wondered if I could go home alive.)

1523
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:09,169
I was scared.

1524
00:59:09,169 --> 00:59:10,439
It was so majestic.

1525
00:59:10,439 --> 00:59:12,609
It made me feel alive.

1526
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:17,510
- That's a little scary.
- Is it okay?

1527
00:59:18,209 --> 00:59:19,620
- It's getting closer and closer.
- Yes. It's getting closer.

1528
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,319
- Don't go there.
- It was. Do you see it?

1529
00:59:22,419 --> 00:59:24,890
- Don't go, Kian84.
- Don't go there.

1530
00:59:25,789 --> 00:59:27,959
(Impressed)

1531
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,729
(He gets excited
and walks toward the lightning.)

1532
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,899
- Don't go. It's dangerous.
- Don't get closer.

1533
00:59:33,899 --> 00:59:35,160
Gosh. Don't go.

1534
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,700
(I want to go to the lightning.
That's what I feel like doing now.)

1535
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,069
I can't resist lightning.

1536
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:42,910
The storm clouds with lightning
came over my head,

1537
00:59:43,169 --> 00:59:44,910
so it's raining in a satisfying way.

1538
00:59:45,979 --> 00:59:47,879
(My gosh!)

1539
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:49,310
Let it rain!

1540
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:51,379
Fire!

1541
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,879
- Do you feel good?
- Let the lightning strike!

1542
00:59:55,019 --> 00:59:56,089
(Oh, dear!)

1543
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:59,189
This is crazy.

1544
00:59:59,589 --> 01:00:01,560
Madagascar is crazy.

1545
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:05,859
It's raining like crazy.

1546
01:00:05,859 --> 01:00:08,359
(He fully enjoys the lightning
in a good mood.)

1547
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,899
- Goodness.
- Who is it? Oh, my.

1548
01:00:12,229 --> 01:00:14,039
- Those pants.
- It rained all of a sudden.

1549
01:00:14,439 --> 01:00:15,740
It's good that you're wearing
swimming trunks.

1550
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:17,269
- You're right.
- Yes.

1551
01:00:17,269 --> 01:00:18,569
Right. They'll get wet.

1552
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,140
Thank you.

1553
01:00:21,709 --> 01:00:22,950
It's amazing...

1554
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,080
- there's a Korean restaurant there.
- What is this?

1555
01:00:24,979 --> 01:00:26,120
Grilled hairtail.

1556
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,319
Soju and beer.

1557
01:00:27,319 --> 01:00:29,649
The atmosphere of Korean restaurants
is different in each country,

1558
01:00:29,649 --> 01:00:31,220
so it's fun to check that out.

1559
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,689
- Right.
- There's karaoke too?

1560
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,359
- It looks nice.
- Then...

1561
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:36,589
- It's the perfect place for a party.
- Why is it so nice?

1562
01:00:38,089 --> 01:00:40,060
I should make it and hide it.

1563
01:00:40,899 --> 01:00:43,530
Hold on. Then...

1564
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,240
- Candles and everything?
- I wanted to make it look good.

1565
01:00:48,339 --> 01:00:50,669
- So you're preparing it in advance.
- Yes.

1566
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:53,240
- That's cute.
- That's indeed cute.

1567
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,740
That reminds me of a cake they make...

1568
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,310
- It's like what they do in the military.
- in the military.

1569
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,319
It's only five,
so I don't know how to arrange them.

1570
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,720
Should I try this like a candle?

1571
01:01:03,419 --> 01:01:04,789
(He also works hard decorating the cake.)

1572
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:06,859
Hello.

1573
01:01:06,859 --> 01:01:09,060
- Hello.
- I joined him.

1574
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:10,959
Pani Bottle.

1575
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:12,430
I'm concentrating right now.

1576
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:14,030
- What are you doing?
- His birthday cake.

1577
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,669
I bought a few things at the supermarket.
I'm working on it.

1578
01:01:17,899 --> 01:01:20,740
I bought fireworks instead of candles,
thinking it would be more fun.

1579
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,769
- Did you buy them all?
- Yes.

1580
01:01:22,939 --> 01:01:24,569
Should we decorate it more?

1581
01:01:24,569 --> 01:01:25,810
It's too simple, right?

1582
01:01:25,939 --> 01:01:27,310
- Should we add some of this?
- That?

1583
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,580
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1584
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:30,580
- I was thinking about what to do.
- Hello.

1585
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:31,649
- No.
- Oh, dear.

1586
01:01:31,649 --> 01:01:32,649
Goodness.

1587
01:01:32,749 --> 01:01:33,850
- I was thinking about what to do.
- Hello.

1588
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:36,050
I was clueless and arrived too early.

1589
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,649
- Kian84.
- Oh, dear.

1590
01:01:37,649 --> 01:01:39,789
- Nothing is going well.
- Seriously.

1591
01:01:39,789 --> 01:01:42,060
Kian84, why don't you sit down
and stick them in together?

1592
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,890
Let's order food quickly.

1593
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,160
I'm so hungry.

1594
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,600
Kian84, will you close your eyes at least
since it's embarrassing?

1595
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,930
We were working hard on it
when you came in.

1596
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,300
- You didn't have to do this.
- By the way...

1597
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:55,200
- Should we not do it?
- Let's do it.

1598
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,240
They wrote, "Let's do it," so big.

1599
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:00,510
- He'd be sad if we stopped.
- Hey.

1600
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:02,379
I mean...

1601
01:02:02,649 --> 01:02:04,209
What is this? Wait.

1602
01:02:04,209 --> 01:02:05,819
- Hey.
- I've never seen these before.

1603
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:07,149
Pani Bottle prepared all this alone.

1604
01:02:07,149 --> 01:02:09,149
Hey, I'm 40, not 50.

1605
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:11,850
- That's true. Let's take 1 out.
- Take 1 out.

1606
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:12,919
That was close.

1607
01:02:12,919 --> 01:02:14,789
As we're in our 40s,
we're sensitive about our age.

1608
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:16,589
I'm a little sensitive about it.

1609
01:02:16,959 --> 01:02:19,129
Pani Bottle prepared lots of things.

1610
01:02:19,459 --> 01:02:22,229
From now on, Kian84 knows nothing.

1611
01:02:22,229 --> 01:02:23,499
- Okay.
- Come out, Dex.

1612
01:02:23,499 --> 01:02:26,069
- What is it?
- He's good at creating content.

1613
01:02:26,069 --> 01:02:27,339
- I don't know.
- Kian84...

1614
01:02:27,339 --> 01:02:29,470
- All right. Okay.
- is waiting here alone.

1615
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,269
- Just say this one line.
- What?

1616
01:02:31,269 --> 01:02:33,039
- "When are they coming?"
- Fine.

1617
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,140
(That detailed line gives me goosebumps.)

1618
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,580
It looks like a teen movie.

1619
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:36,780
- Do I light the candles?
- Yes.

1620
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,109
Wait.

1621
01:02:38,109 --> 01:02:39,149
All right.

1622
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,850
Where are the guys?

1623
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:45,749
Is it an old TV show?

1624
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:50,959
(How people used to talk back in the day)

1625
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:53,930
They asked me to come here.

1626
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,430
It's been over 30 minutes.

1627
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:56,800
But the corners of his mouth are lifted.

1628
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,800
What happened?

1629
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,300
It is wrong? It doesn't seem right.

1630
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,910
Isn't it like this?

1631
01:03:03,209 --> 01:03:04,310
I'm scared.

1632
01:03:04,439 --> 01:03:06,979
(Burning quickly)

1633
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:08,680
- Those are fireworks?
- Yes.

1634
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,209
The lightning man must love it.

1635
01:03:10,209 --> 01:03:13,649
(Fireworks customized for Lightning Man)

1636
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:15,479
(Going out)

1637
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,189
Those two we had left.

1638
01:03:17,189 --> 01:03:18,220
What?

1639
01:03:19,189 --> 01:03:20,390
They go out quickly.

1640
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:21,919
What is this?

1641
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:24,789
What? There are only two left.

1642
01:03:24,859 --> 01:03:26,200
Look at Dex.

1643
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,660
- I got flustered because they went out.
- Goodness.

1644
01:03:29,399 --> 01:03:30,470
What is this?

1645
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,339
(Whatever)

1646
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:36,470
- What is that?
- That's why they came.

1647
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:38,740
What is that?
It's funny they just went to him.

1648
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:39,979
- What is that?
- How awkward.

1649
01:03:39,979 --> 01:03:41,379
- I'm cracking up.
- We were so clumsy.

1650
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,410
(They proceed quickly.)

1651
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,620
(The fireworks go out in real-time.)

1652
01:03:47,419 --> 01:03:49,120
(They surprise the oldest
who had no idea.)

1653
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,019
- <i>Happy birthday to you</i>
- They brought it anyway.

1654
01:03:51,019 --> 01:03:52,419
- <i>Happy birthday, dear Kian84</i>
- Give it to him.

1655
01:03:52,419 --> 01:03:54,789
- What is this?
- <i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1656
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,160
- Still.
- Goodness.

1657
01:03:56,459 --> 01:03:57,930
They go out so quickly.

1658
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,030
Still, I feel like it's bad luck.

1659
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:01,160
- Hold on.
- We'll redo it.

1660
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,899
- Wait.
- That's bad luck. I'm not dying.

1661
01:04:02,899 --> 01:04:05,470
- Why aren't they lit up?
- I only smelled gunpowder when they came.

1662
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:08,039
I'm a little sensitive about shamanism.

1663
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:09,100
I laughed so hard.

1664
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:10,810
Again.

1665
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:15,310
(Happy birthday to you)

1666
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:18,080
- Now they're singing at a normal speed.
- <i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1667
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,319
Now we're relaxed.

1668
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,749
(The two clumsy, kind members...)

1669
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:27,189
(sing him the happy birthday song
with a lot of love.)

1670
01:04:27,189 --> 01:04:28,560
- Thank you.
- Goodness.

1671
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,260
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1672
01:04:30,689 --> 01:04:33,399
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1673
01:04:33,629 --> 01:04:36,129
We had some issues with the fireworks.

1674
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,899
They only left ashes.

1675
01:04:38,899 --> 01:04:39,939
Firework issues.

1676
01:04:39,939 --> 01:04:42,640
Isn't it special
to celebrate your birthday overseas?

1677
01:04:42,769 --> 01:04:44,510
Right. This is what it's like.

1678
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,379
I feel bad when they do a surprise for me.

1679
01:04:46,379 --> 01:04:48,510
- But when I start enjoying it,
- Right.

1680
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,109
it's the best in the world.

1681
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:52,379
(Happy)

1682
01:04:52,649 --> 01:04:54,450
When you celebrate your birthday overseas,
it really sticks in your memory.

1683
01:04:54,749 --> 01:04:57,550
I've been shooting Adventure by Accident
for two years in a row.

1684
01:04:57,649 --> 01:04:59,319
I don't remember my birthdays before.

1685
01:04:59,319 --> 01:05:01,189
- Me too.
- I only remember those two birthdays.

1686
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,220
- Really?
- I don't remember the previous birthdays.

1687
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,229
Kian84, to celebrate your birthday,

1688
01:05:04,229 --> 01:05:05,689
let's order what you want to eat.

1689
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:07,100
What do you guys eat?

1690
01:05:07,459 --> 01:05:09,970
- Order what you like.
- We'll eat what you order.

1691
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,269
We have no right to choose.

1692
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:14,970
I want rolled omelets, tofu kimchi,

1693
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:16,010
and seafood pajeon.

1694
01:05:16,269 --> 01:05:17,269
- Spicy fried chicken.
- Oh, dear.

1695
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:18,310
- Seaweed soup.
- Seaweed soup.

1696
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:19,910
Right. Since it's your birthday.

1697
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:21,209
- Do you like seaweed soup?
- I love it.

1698
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:23,609
- We should've ordered it beforehand.
- I love seaweed soup.

1699
01:05:23,609 --> 01:05:24,810
I only worked on this.

1700
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,450
- He's eating again.
- Stop eating.

1701
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,550
They make so many dishes here.

1702
01:05:30,189 --> 01:05:32,589
- Cheese ramyeon sounds good.
- They even have jjajangmyeon.

1703
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:34,620
Tteokbokki would be good too.

1704
01:05:35,319 --> 01:05:36,760
You said you had no right to choose.

1705
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:38,689
You're asking him to order them in a way.

1706
01:05:38,689 --> 01:05:39,700
(Naming dishes he wants to eat)

1707
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,330
Do they have sausage stew?

1708
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:42,359
(Smiling)

1709
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,769
Kian84, how about rabokki?

1710
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:45,069
- Let's go with rabokki.
- That sounds good.

1711
01:05:45,069 --> 01:05:46,069
I love it.

1712
01:05:46,339 --> 01:05:48,269
Pani Bottle loves tteokbokki.

1713
01:05:48,269 --> 01:05:49,709
- I love it.
- He will love this.

1714
01:05:49,709 --> 01:05:51,769
- He noticed.
- I was listening to him.

1715
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:55,609
Kian84, it's a good day.
We should have some liquor.

1716
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,310
Liquor...

1717
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:58,810
- If it's 10,000 Ariaries...
- Kian84.

1718
01:05:58,810 --> 01:05:59,819
(Putting his gift down)

1719
01:06:02,479 --> 01:06:03,550
What is this?

1720
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:05,850
- You bought this?
- This is for you.

1721
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:07,289
(You can see how happy he is
through his eyes.)

1722
01:06:07,289 --> 01:06:08,319
I bought that.

1723
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:10,430
(He buy a gift for the oldest
at the airport in Paris.)

1724
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:11,689
- He bought that at the airport in Paris.
- Yes.

1725
01:06:11,689 --> 01:06:14,399
His birthday gift is alcohol.

1726
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,930
- This one is good.
- It's not that bad.

1727
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:16,999
Yes. It's pretty good.

1728
01:06:17,669 --> 01:06:21,240
(They knew what to get for the oldest.)

1729
01:06:21,669 --> 01:06:22,700
Okay.

1730
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,709
It's 18 years old.

1731
01:06:24,709 --> 01:06:26,010
- I bought it in France.
- It's my first time...

1732
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:27,510
seeing him making that face in Madagascar.

1733
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,550
He was really happy just now.

1734
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:32,580
He had that look
when he saw soju in India.

1735
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,120
I chose this with Pani Bottle.

1736
01:06:37,189 --> 01:06:39,819
- My bag was heavy because of this.
- I see. Thank you.

1737
01:06:40,419 --> 01:06:42,589
This is the best gift for him.

1738
01:06:42,589 --> 01:06:43,629
Thank you.

1739
01:06:44,359 --> 01:06:46,760
- I'm glad to see him love the gift.
- Thank you so much.

1740
01:06:46,859 --> 01:06:48,800
He loved Dex's gift so much...

1741
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,030
that now I'm worried about mine.

1742
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,240
- I got a gift for you too.
- I'm only receiving.

1743
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,300
What is it?

1744
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,109
While we're traveling together,
I've been telling you...

1745
01:06:57,109 --> 01:06:58,339
that my wish was...

1746
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:01,339
- you...
- I'll wear them.

1747
01:07:01,339 --> 01:07:02,780
- That's why I brought them.
- I...

1748
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:05,010
I don't know how many days
I'll wear them, but I will.

1749
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,450
(He's been worried about the eldest's eyes
since they were in South America.)

1750
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:09,019
(Looking for sunglasses)

1751
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,490
(He even sincerely asked him in India.)

1752
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:14,720
Right. He's been asking him for a year
since they were in India.

1753
01:07:15,189 --> 01:07:17,589
(They also argued about sunglasses
in Madagascar as well.)

1754
01:07:18,859 --> 01:07:20,729
(The one who keeps suggesting)

1755
01:07:20,729 --> 01:07:22,870
(The one who keeps rejecting)

1756
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:24,830
He's like my eye doctor.

1757
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:25,999
I know.

1758
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:30,310
(He even wished the oldest
to wear sunglasses.)

1759
01:07:30,769 --> 01:07:32,039
Wear them when it's too bright.

1760
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:33,539
- Okay.
- It's for your eyes.

1761
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:36,149
- These.
- What is that?

1762
01:07:36,379 --> 01:07:38,249
I wore them only once.

1763
01:07:38,249 --> 01:07:40,919
- They're really nice sunglasses for real.
- Oh, my.

1764
01:07:40,919 --> 01:07:42,550
- Try them on.
- Is that so?

1765
01:07:44,019 --> 01:07:45,050
(He tries the sunglasses
that Pani Bottle used only once.)

1766
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:46,050
He used it once.

1767
01:07:47,919 --> 01:07:50,289
- They're nice sunglasses.
- He looks good.

1768
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:52,359
Goodness, you're like Daft Punk.

1769
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,830
You look like you're from the future.
Future84.

1770
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,700
I should check myself in the mirror
or on my phone.

1771
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,030
- Let me see.
- Given his reaction,

1772
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:00,569
I don't think he'll use them.

1773
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,240
- Well, it's nice.
- They block the sun well.

1774
01:08:05,609 --> 01:08:07,680
- They're not for looking good.
- Thank you.

1775
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,379
You look so different
from when you received the alcohol.

1776
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:12,709
Thank you. It's the thought that counts.

1777
01:08:12,709 --> 01:08:14,019
The thought is what counts?

1778
01:08:14,019 --> 01:08:15,979
- It's important that you thought of me.
- Kian84, just wear them once...

1779
01:08:15,979 --> 01:08:17,519
- when it's too sunny.
- Okay.

1780
01:08:17,519 --> 01:08:19,560
- I needed them.
- Pani Bottle was worried about him.

1781
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,620
- Yes.
- Right.

1782
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:22,760
Oh, my. It's too bright.

1783
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,129
The lighting is too strong.

1784
01:08:24,129 --> 01:08:26,060
- What?
- The lighting is too intense.

1785
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,430
(He brought the sunglasses
he received from his eye doctor.)

1786
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:28,760
He brought them.

1787
01:08:28,959 --> 01:08:30,200
My gosh.

1788
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,729
(Future84 is back.)

1789
01:08:32,629 --> 01:08:33,870
Honestly, they suit him, don't they?

1790
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:36,269
- Yes. He looks cool. They suit him.
- He looks great.

1791
01:08:36,269 --> 01:08:39,140
I use them a lot
when I ride my motorcycle.

1792
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:40,780
- Thank you.
- You said it was your wish.

1793
01:08:40,879 --> 01:08:42,140
I use them often.

1794
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,780
- Shall we order now?
- Let's order.

1795
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:45,780
Excuse me.

1796
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:47,749
My heart feels so warm.

1797
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:51,120
I can't forget Kian84's face
when he received the liquor.

1798
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,490
- I know.
- Okay

1799
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:54,919
I should've given him
the sunglasses first.

1800
01:08:54,919 --> 01:08:56,019
Rolled omelet, one.

1801
01:08:56,019 --> 01:08:57,859
Even if I had received them first,
I would've reacted the same way.

1802
01:08:57,859 --> 01:08:59,830
Steamed eggs, one.

1803
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,060
Spicy fried chicken.

1804
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,669
Seaweed soup, one.

1805
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,530
Should we order a drink from this country?

1806
01:09:06,069 --> 01:09:08,399
Beer or liquor like whiskey.

1807
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,209
- One bottle.
- One bottle of this.

1808
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:12,410
With ice, please.

1809
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:14,879
We didn't want to drink the liquor
that he got me there.

1810
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,680
- Is that why you ordered drinks?
- They sell alcohol.

1811
01:09:18,109 --> 01:09:19,479
(Lights going out)

1812
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,249
The power kept going out.

1813
01:09:21,249 --> 01:09:23,950
I didn't get startled anymore.
I got used to it.

1814
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,560
Actually, I thought they had
another surprise at that moment.

1815
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:27,720
For your birthday?

1816
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,019
(Getting ahead of himself)

1817
01:09:30,289 --> 01:09:31,660
Should we keep them?

1818
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:32,930
Yes. We should eat first.

1819
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:34,200
- It was so good.
- Goodness.

1820
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,930
(They're delighted to see familiar
Korean side dishes in Madagascar.)

1821
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:38,369
- They have everything.
- They have kimchi too.

1822
01:09:38,369 --> 01:09:39,640
That looks good.

1823
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:40,999
- They had a variety of side dishes.
- They have everything.

1824
01:09:40,999 --> 01:09:42,940
(He goes for kimchi as if it's instinct.)

1825
01:09:43,339 --> 01:09:44,839
(Humming)

1826
01:09:45,369 --> 01:09:46,779
The kimchi is so good.

1827
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:49,539
You can't resist African kimchi.

1828
01:09:49,539 --> 01:09:51,079
One dish, please.

1829
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:55,879
They make good kimchi in Africa.

1830
01:09:55,879 --> 01:09:57,749
The kimchi is so good. Gosh.

1831
01:09:57,789 --> 01:09:58,949
Was the kimchi in Africa...

1832
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:00,289
- It was delicious.
- better than the kimchi here?

1833
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:02,760
- The kimchi is so tasty.
- One dish, please.

1834
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,329
- Seriously.
- There's even lightning...

1835
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:05,589
inside a building.

1836
01:10:05,629 --> 01:10:07,760
How do they make delicious kimchi
in Africa?

1837
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,400
I know. It's so good.

1838
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:10,900
How about we buy this?

1839
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,369
- It's 7,000 Ariaries.
- Is it that good?

1840
01:10:12,369 --> 01:10:14,699
- It's so good.
- How much would that be?

1841
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:16,909
- We must buy this.
- That's about two dollars?

1842
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:18,510
Yes. It'd be around that.

1843
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:20,579
I must buy this on the way out.

1844
01:10:20,709 --> 01:10:22,279
I loved yesterday,
but I love today even more.

1845
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:23,409
- Really?
- Yes.

1846
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,350
- By the way.
- You're loving each day more and more.

1847
01:10:25,379 --> 01:10:27,220
I roughly put together...

1848
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:29,320
- our trip schedule.
- Okay.

1849
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:32,050
You know I'd been doing research
on bullfighting.

1850
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,220
I got a hold of them,
so I asked where it was held.

1851
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,459
- He finally found it.
- Yes.

1852
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,959
They introduced me to the guide.

1853
01:10:37,959 --> 01:10:39,699
(He contacted the guide
through a hotel staff member.)

1854
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:43,930
(He arranged the time and place to meet.)

1855
01:10:45,629 --> 01:10:49,570
(He proceeded quickly
as he was an experienced traveler.)

1856
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:52,039
We got ourselves a tour guide.

1857
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:53,680
We're going the day after tomorrow.

1858
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,779
- The day after tomorrow?
- Yes.

1859
01:10:54,779 --> 01:10:58,579
We need to go south from here...

1860
01:10:58,579 --> 01:11:00,279
to go to Antsirabe.

1861
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:03,249
It takes about four hours by car.

1862
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:05,550
- Four hours by car?
- That takes a long time.

1863
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:06,589
It takes quite some time.

1864
01:11:06,789 --> 01:11:07,989
Here it comes.

1865
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:10,529
(Local alcohol is served first.)

1866
01:11:10,529 --> 01:11:11,730
What is that? Vodka?

1867
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,800
- It's rum.
- I see.

1868
01:11:14,699 --> 01:11:16,499
Thank you.

1869
01:11:16,499 --> 01:11:17,730
Thanks.

1870
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:20,300
(He pours drinks for the members
while thanking them.)

1871
01:11:20,539 --> 01:11:22,539
- Happy birthday, Kian84.
- Thanks.

1872
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:24,970
Let's stay safe until we leave.

1873
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:28,680
Let's make unforgettable memories
in Madagascar.

1874
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:32,209
Whether we like it or not,
let's be honest with our feelings.

1875
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:34,350
- That's our style.
- Yes.

1876
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:36,520
- Our style.
- Yes. That works for me.

1877
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,020
- To us!
- To us!

1878
01:11:39,419 --> 01:11:41,190
- Kian84 gave a good speech.
- Yes.

1879
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:42,959
(They have their drinks
after giving a great toast.)

1880
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:44,589
It tastes like vanilla.

1881
01:11:44,589 --> 01:11:45,760
It's softer than I thought...

1882
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,129
- even though it's 40 proof.
- It's sweet.

1883
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:51,369
Madagascar is the largest producer
of vanilla.

1884
01:11:51,369 --> 01:11:53,270
- Madagascar is famous for its vanilla.
- For its vanilla?

1885
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:54,869
I don't know
if it's actually a vanilla flavor.

1886
01:11:54,869 --> 01:11:57,739
There's some overpriced vanilla
that I bought.

1887
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:59,980
(He paid as much as 15 dollars.)

1888
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,709
- I was curious about that.
- That put him in a bad mood.

1889
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:04,249
- What is this?
- Smell this.

1890
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:06,379
- Is that vanilla?
- It cost...

1891
01:12:06,379 --> 01:12:07,879
- Thank you.
- fifteen dollars.

1892
01:12:07,879 --> 01:12:08,980
(Then the Korean owner appears.)

1893
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,890
- It's so good to see him.
- The owner was Korean.

1894
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:12,650
Sir, what is this?

1895
01:12:12,919 --> 01:12:14,720
Those are vanilla beans.

1896
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,260
- They're vanilla beans.
- He recognized them right away.

1897
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,360
It's good that you saw him.

1898
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,159
I paid around 15 dollars for this.
Is that a reasonable price?

1899
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:22,829
They're not in good condition.

1900
01:12:23,029 --> 01:12:24,270
- They're not?
- No.

1901
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:27,369
His tone is very nice,
but he throws facts at him.

1902
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:29,570
- Well...
- How much do you usually pay for them?

1903
01:12:29,839 --> 01:12:31,440
- Why...
- They have no value.

1904
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,440
- Stop.
- You don't put a price on them?

1905
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,839
- He says they have no value.
- They do.

1906
01:12:34,839 --> 01:12:36,110
- He says they're free.
- They're free.

1907
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:37,949
Sir.

1908
01:12:38,879 --> 01:12:40,180
Can we have more kimchi?

1909
01:12:40,419 --> 01:12:42,720
- Can we take away some kimchi?
- It's okay.

1910
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,820
You can buy some.

1911
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:44,989
- I'll buy some later.
- This...

1912
01:12:44,989 --> 01:12:46,020
(He made a reservation to buy kimchi.)

1913
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:48,789
(Staring)

1914
01:12:49,489 --> 01:12:51,789
What? They're in here.

1915
01:12:52,089 --> 01:12:53,860
- What is that?
- They're in the bottle.

1916
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:55,860
That's why it tasted like vanilla.

1917
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:56,869
(Now they see the vanilla beans
in the bottle with the lights on.)

1918
01:12:57,930 --> 01:13:01,699
When they're put in alcohol,
the flavor of vanilla is brought out.

1919
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:03,640
They look better.

1920
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,470
Kian84's beans are smaller.

1921
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:07,440
- I'm starting to feel bad again.
- Because of the vanilla beans.

1922
01:13:07,579 --> 01:13:09,510
- No.
- I felt good...

1923
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,879
having my birthday party.

1924
01:13:11,209 --> 01:13:12,909
I'm starting to feel down again.

1925
01:13:13,879 --> 01:13:16,220
He bought worthless vanilla beans.

1926
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:18,220
I was feeling a lot better.

1927
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:20,190
We have Pani Bottle's birthday
in four days.

1928
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:23,989
Let me tell you that I hate
this kind of thing. Don't do it for me.

1929
01:13:23,989 --> 01:13:25,890
- For real.
- Okay. We won't for real.

1930
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,930
- We promise.
- Say happy birthday, though.

1931
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:29,829
- We'll do that.
- You can do that at least.

1932
01:13:29,829 --> 01:13:31,129
- It doesn't cost money.
- But...

1933
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,270
let's celebrate it a little.

1934
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:35,839
- I love celebrating birthdays like this.
- Right.

1935
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:38,140
- Thank you.
- That looks good.

1936
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,339
- Oh, my.
- How nice.

1937
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:40,980
- We...
- Fried chicken.

1938
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:42,940
- Oh, dear.
- That looks delicious.

1939
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:45,310
- The fried chicken.
- My gosh.

1940
01:13:45,409 --> 01:13:46,720
- Oh, my.
- Kimchi.

1941
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:47,949
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1942
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:49,989
Thank you.

1943
01:13:49,989 --> 01:13:51,390
- Enjoy.
- Goodness.

1944
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:54,390
- Even seaweed soup.
- Thanks.

1945
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,930
(Birthday84 tries it first.)

1946
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,560
Gosh, the seaweed soup.

1947
01:13:59,489 --> 01:14:03,669
(Inhaling his soup)

1948
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:05,730
- That looks good.
- Oh, dear.

1949
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:07,470
- It still looks good.
- It's tasty.

1950
01:14:07,839 --> 01:14:10,610
- It's delicious.
- It's so filling.

1951
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:12,739
(Slurping)

1952
01:14:13,779 --> 01:14:14,779
(Picky Eater Little Dex tries
spicy fried chicken first.)

1953
01:14:14,779 --> 01:14:15,980
I wonder how that tastes.

1954
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,249
(Humming)

1955
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:18,980
- He loves fried chicken.
- It must be good.

1956
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:21,150
I love all dishes
when it comes to Korean food.

1957
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:22,180
(He's not a picky eater
when he eats Korean food.)

1958
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:24,619
(He also added rice to the soup.)

1959
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:26,690
(Dex is satisfied.)

1960
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:30,060
I'm going crazy about the kimchi.

1961
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,190
- How many times is he mentioning kimchi?
- I know.

1962
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:33,499
He moved on from baguette to kimchi.

1963
01:14:33,499 --> 01:14:35,300
- He's really enjoying it.
- Yes.

1964
01:14:35,529 --> 01:14:36,999
(Trying some tofu)

1965
01:14:37,369 --> 01:14:38,600
(Eating some kimchi)

1966
01:14:38,669 --> 01:14:41,300
(Taking a big bite)

1967
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:43,409
It does look like a birthday meal.

1968
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,869
- You have friends over,
- Yes.

1969
01:14:44,869 --> 01:14:46,310
and your mom cooks all of this.

1970
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:47,810
- And fried chicken is a must.
- Yes.

1971
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:49,140
- There are snacks like that too...
- Yes.

1972
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:50,409
- even though you're having a meal.
- Yes.

1973
01:14:50,879 --> 01:14:52,579
You always have snacks like that
on the table.

1974
01:14:52,579 --> 01:14:53,949
- It's a little trace.
- Yes.

1975
01:14:53,949 --> 01:14:55,350
A reminder that we had a birthday party.

1976
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:57,789
It's so good. It's crazy.

1977
01:14:59,089 --> 01:15:01,789
I was going to lose weight,

1978
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:04,060
- but this trip ruined it.
- What are the clips flashing behind me?

1979
01:15:04,489 --> 01:15:06,829
You seem to gain weight
whenever we film Adventure by Accident.

1980
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,900
(Adventure by Accident suits him.)

1981
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,300
- What is that?
- You gain weight.

1982
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,999
Anyway, it takes four hours...

1983
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:14,600
to get to our next destination
for the bullfight?

1984
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,010
The guide said
we should be in Antsirabe...

1985
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:19,770
by tomorrow evening or night.

1986
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:21,610
He suggested we should sleep in Antsirabe.

1987
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:23,850
Today it rained,

1988
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:26,209
so the road conditions are bad,
and there's a lot of traffic.

1989
01:15:26,209 --> 01:15:28,980
- So the guide asked us...
- To sleep there.

1990
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:30,619
to come the day before just in case.

1991
01:15:30,619 --> 01:15:32,390
- That was his suggestion.
- Right.

1992
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:34,459
What else can we see
other than the bullfight?

1993
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:35,760
Is there any event...

1994
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,629
like the funeral ceremony we saw
on the way?

1995
01:15:39,529 --> 01:15:40,930
Why would you go to a funeral?

1996
01:15:41,129 --> 01:15:42,800
We dance at a stranger's funeral?

1997
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,999
You were curious about it, though.

1998
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,169
I am.

1999
01:15:45,169 --> 01:15:47,970
(He tries some jeon using his hand first.)

2000
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:51,339
Wouldn't it be a little odd
if strangers came to dance?

2001
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,579
- What?
- There was a festive vibe.

2002
01:15:54,379 --> 01:15:56,680
- Here it is.
- Sir, may I ask something?

2003
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,449
- On the way here from the airport,
- Yes?

2004
01:15:58,879 --> 01:16:00,919
I saw people holding
a deceased person's photo on the street.

2005
01:16:00,919 --> 01:16:03,789
When I asked if it was a festival,
they said it was a funeral.

2006
01:16:03,789 --> 01:16:07,489
- That's a funeral ceremony in Madagascar.
- Yes?

2007
01:16:07,489 --> 01:16:08,959
It's called Famadihana.

2008
01:16:08,959 --> 01:16:10,029
(The owner is familiar with Famadihana,
the traditional funeral rite.)

2009
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:11,890
I saw one a couple of days ago too.

2010
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:13,430
- Oh, really?
- On the street.

2011
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:14,829
Yes, it's very interesting.

2012
01:16:14,829 --> 01:16:16,770
Is there someplace we can go to see that?

2013
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:19,930
They're holding them
quite often these days.

2014
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,739
- Is that so?
- I'll ask my employee...

2015
01:16:21,739 --> 01:16:24,510
where they might hold them
or are currently holding them.

2016
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:25,640
- Let me ask.
- Thank you.

2017
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:26,739
The owner was so friendly.

2018
01:16:26,739 --> 01:16:29,510
How long have you lived here?

2019
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:31,510
It's been eight years since I got here.

2020
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:33,419
Was there a reason
why you chose this place?

2021
01:16:33,419 --> 01:16:34,680
There are lots of foreign countries
to choose from.

2022
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,919
I wanted to take on a new challenge.

2023
01:16:36,919 --> 01:16:38,449
- It sounds hard.
- That's not an easy choice to make.

2024
01:16:38,449 --> 01:16:39,789
- Right.
- Of course not.

2025
01:16:39,789 --> 01:16:42,320
You must be living
the second chapter of your life here.

2026
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,459
You're so cool.

2027
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:45,989
- Gosh, thank you.
- It really is the second chapter of life.

2028
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:47,760
He even put these decorations here.

2029
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,900
- It feels like we're home after a while.
- Yes.

2030
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,100
Gosh, thank you.

2031
01:16:51,499 --> 01:16:53,640
He's asking for information
right on the spot.

2032
01:16:53,869 --> 01:16:56,169
All of the employees are locals.

2033
01:16:56,470 --> 01:17:00,779
This was as big a cultural event
as the ship launching ceremony.

2034
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:02,779
- He's going to...
- My employee says...

2035
01:17:02,779 --> 01:17:06,379
that his family already had
a funeral ceremony last month.

2036
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:09,449
But he says he'll ask his friend for you.

2037
01:17:09,449 --> 01:17:11,390
- Thank you. He's even asking around.
- Thank you.

2038
01:17:11,789 --> 01:17:12,919
Thank you.

2039
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:17,459
- To his friend?
- So, is it impolite if we go there?

2040
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:18,760
It won't be impolite.

2041
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,199
If you get the chance and have the time,

2042
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:23,430
you could take
a few bottles of liquor with you.

2043
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,699
- They would like that.
- It'd be impolite to go empty-handed.

2044
01:17:25,699 --> 01:17:27,770
- That should be fine.
- I understand.

2045
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:29,440
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

2046
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,209
The owner has such a kind face.

2047
01:17:32,709 --> 01:17:34,239
I'm going to leave after I watch that.

2048
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:36,379
By yourself?

2049
01:17:37,879 --> 01:17:39,749
I am curious about the funeral culture.

2050
01:17:40,779 --> 01:17:43,119
(He saw
the Varanasi cremation site in India.)

2051
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:46,690
Things related to death usually leave
a strong impression.

2052
01:17:48,459 --> 01:17:51,390
(Also, the Famadihana they saw
in the taxi earlier...)

2053
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:53,699
That's pretty impressive.

2054
01:17:53,699 --> 01:17:54,900
- That's right.
- I was surprised.

2055
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,770
When I saw it once in India,

2056
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:58,300
it left a big impression.

2057
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,169
Since the culture is so different
from Korea.

2058
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:04,010
Half of my international travels from now
will be to see funerals.

2059
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:07,079
- A funeral tour?
- "A funeral tour?"

2060
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,339
He could become a model...

2061
01:18:08,339 --> 01:18:09,480
- for a funeral service provider.
- I could.

2062
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,480
How could there be such a person?

2063
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,180
- You should think about it.
- I'll see.

2064
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:13,379
You can come with me if you want to.

2065
01:18:13,379 --> 01:18:16,350
It'd be great if I could see a funeral...

2066
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:18,320
on our way to Antsirabe.

2067
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,050
This is a suggestion.

2068
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:23,629
I wonder what it would be like
if we try traveling separately...

2069
01:18:24,029 --> 01:18:25,959
until we meet back up
at the lodging in Antsirabe.

2070
01:18:25,959 --> 01:18:27,230
This is just a suggestion.

2071
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:29,230
We could just get a taste
of traveling alone for a while.

2072
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:31,230
- I thought that could be good.
- Pani Bottle made a good call.

2073
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:33,369
You mean we'll split up
after we finish eating here?

2074
01:18:34,739 --> 01:18:37,110
We're going to meet back up
tomorrow evening in Antsirabe.

2075
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:39,339
- At the lodging?
- Hey, then why not...

2076
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:41,409
just meet up at the airport to go home?

2077
01:18:41,739 --> 01:18:42,839
(He must be disappointed
now that he considers going alone.)

2078
01:18:42,839 --> 01:18:44,949
- Why are you so disappointed suddenly?
- He's very disappointed.

2079
01:18:44,949 --> 01:18:46,110
No, it's not like that.

2080
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:47,749
We should try being apart for once...

2081
01:18:47,749 --> 01:18:50,249
to realize how happy we are
when we are together.

2082
01:18:50,249 --> 01:18:52,449
- It helps you see the opposite side.
- That is true.

2083
01:18:53,289 --> 01:18:56,760
Then let's say that we'll do
our own things.

2084
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,730
- Going separately for a day.
- I'll have to see what there is to do.

2085
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:01,029
But there might be someone
who doesn't want to go with me.

2086
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:02,560
- Of course.
- I didn't want to drag people along.

2087
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,570
A funeral is...

2088
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:06,699
Rather than going as a group
and chatting at a funeral...

2089
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:08,570
- That's right.
- It was something you wanted to see.

2090
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:10,570
I thought it'd be nice for you to go
and see it on your own.

2091
01:19:10,669 --> 01:19:11,940
- Well...
- But let's decide on...

2092
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:13,369
an evening roll call time.

2093
01:19:13,369 --> 01:19:15,879
- Roll call?
- Let's meet back up by 10 p.m. at least.

2094
01:19:15,879 --> 01:19:17,449
Let's make it 11 p.m. You never know.

2095
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:19,150
We can't predict anything at this point.

2096
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,619
Okay, then at 11 p.m.

2097
01:19:20,619 --> 01:19:23,350
- We'll meet up at 11 p.m.
- Of course, you can come earlier.

2098
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:24,390
I'll try.

2099
01:19:27,919 --> 01:19:29,360
Is this a karaoke machine?

2100
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,589
Yes, it's been here since earlier.

2101
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,489
I've never seen Dex sing.

2102
01:19:33,489 --> 01:19:35,459
He was on "The King of Mask Singer."

2103
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:36,970
That's right.

2104
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,699
Right, Dex is a pretty good singer.

2105
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:40,400
What did you sing
on "The King of Mask Singer?"

2106
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:42,270
"Forbidden Love" by Yada.

2107
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,470
You like ballads too, don't you?

2108
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:46,409
- What's that?
- Hey, look.

2109
01:19:46,409 --> 01:19:47,680
(Video footage)

2110
01:19:50,209 --> 01:19:52,779
- Look at those white gloves.
- You're the youngest son of MBC, indeed.

2111
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:55,619
Hey, how far did you get
on "The King of Mask Singer?"

2112
01:19:56,279 --> 01:19:57,550
I got eliminated in the first round.

2113
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:58,989
(Eliminated in the 1st round)

2114
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:00,919
(Awkward)

2115
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,720
- Right.
- It feels awkward.

2116
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:03,760
- I see.
- "Right."

2117
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,260
Since there's a karaoke machine here,

2118
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,529
I'll try to entertain you, brothers.

2119
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,270
- There should be a birthday event.
- Gosh, thank you.

2120
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:13,329
- It's hard to sing on the spot.
- You'll see later.

2121
01:20:13,329 --> 01:20:15,199
- The youngest should step up for this.
- That's right.

2122
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:17,339
- Right, let's get the mood fired up.
- The mood is...

2123
01:20:17,369 --> 01:20:18,709
- Sir.
- Sir.

2124
01:20:18,869 --> 01:20:21,879
- Can we use the karaoke machine?
- Yes, of course.

2125
01:20:21,879 --> 01:20:24,480
But are there
no other customers right now?

2126
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,709
Would it be okay if we sang?

2127
01:20:25,709 --> 01:20:27,180
- Of course.
- Oh, is it okay?

2128
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,419
At the time,
we were the only ones in the restaurant.

2129
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:31,989
Gosh. Hang on. What should I sing?

2130
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:34,289
Is there a good echo on this mic?

2131
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:35,320
(Deep in thought)

2132
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:36,720
Kian84, can you grab the tambourine?

2133
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:39,060
<i>Goodnight, have a good</i>

2134
01:20:39,289 --> 01:20:40,499
Oh, he's thinking about what to sing.

2135
01:20:40,499 --> 01:20:42,159
He's thinking about
his song choice right now.

2136
01:20:42,459 --> 01:20:44,699
I mean, there was no song book.

2137
01:20:45,129 --> 01:20:46,400
You know how it is when you go to karaoke.

2138
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,400
Rather than minding
what others are singing,

2139
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,970
- you think about what you want to sing.
- That's right.

2140
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,209
- Which song shall I sing?
- You have to practice.

2141
01:20:51,209 --> 01:20:52,770
You have to practice it once too.

2142
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:54,640
You have to check
how high you can sing today.

2143
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,379
- Warm up your voice.
- That's right.

2144
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:00,480
(Discreetly checking
his vocal cord condition)

2145
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:02,850
Kian84, can you grab the tambourine?

2146
01:21:04,619 --> 01:21:06,720
(While the eldest is coming to his senses)

2147
01:21:06,919 --> 01:21:09,360
One. Could you add a bit more echo?

2148
01:21:09,459 --> 01:21:10,959
Echo.

2149
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:13,390
Could you reduce it slightly?

2150
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:14,600
Isn't he a goat?

2151
01:21:14,699 --> 01:21:16,329
More.

2152
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:18,529
Oh, that's good. This is perfect.

2153
01:21:18,529 --> 01:21:19,600
That's perfect.

2154
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,169
The echo is very important.

2155
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:22,570
(The talent show begins.)

2156
01:21:23,369 --> 01:21:26,239
To wish Kian84 a happy birthday,

2157
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,579
your younger brother will sing you a song.

2158
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:32,510
Live long and be healthy!

2159
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:35,419
- You're doing well, Dex!
- Good job!

2160
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:39,449
("Here We Are," by Dex)

2161
01:21:39,749 --> 01:21:42,619
- The lyrics tug at your heartstrings.
- Shake it.

2162
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,760
It's 29-year-old Dex.

2163
01:21:45,129 --> 01:21:47,060
(It's 37-year-old Pani Bottle.)

2164
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:51,129
(What I wanted to say to you)

2165
01:21:51,129 --> 01:21:54,699
(Thank you and I'm sorry)

2166
01:21:54,699 --> 01:21:58,640
(I could do it because I was with you)

2167
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,940
(I can smile)

2168
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:02,409
You're a good singer!

2169
01:22:02,539 --> 01:22:06,350
(Because I'm always smiling)

2170
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:09,249
(You must think I'm a joke)

2171
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,619
<i>But I will keep smiling</i>

2172
01:22:13,289 --> 01:22:15,360
"Because I keep smiling,
you must think I'm a joke."

2173
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,260
I think I got a bit teary-eyed
when I sang that part.

2174
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:19,860
- Oh, why?
- It was because that part sounded...

2175
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,230
like Kian84 a bit.

2176
01:22:21,629 --> 01:22:23,800
Kian84 never gets angry,

2177
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,230
says okay to everything,
and says everything is fine.

2178
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:29,270
But I'm sure there are things
that are hard for him too.

2179
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:33,270
I thought people didn't really know that
about him.

2180
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:35,680
That part made me tear up a bit.

2181
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,050
Gosh, you even thought of that?

2182
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:39,279
There was a deep meaning.

2183
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:43,820
(When it sounds sad)

2184
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:45,550
(Like a meaningless greeting)

2185
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:47,820
Oh, my. What is this, a drama?

2186
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:48,919
(You can come to me)

2187
01:22:48,919 --> 01:22:49,989
All together!

2188
01:22:49,989 --> 01:22:52,690
(Yes, it's okay)

2189
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:54,860
You could play this video
on the screens at karaoke.

2190
01:22:54,999 --> 01:22:56,060
I know, right?

2191
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:58,600
(You've done well)

2192
01:22:59,369 --> 01:23:02,640
(You endured a hard day)

2193
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,409
(And you lived through it)

2194
01:23:07,239 --> 01:23:10,039
(Don't lose)

2195
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,579
Is today the last episode?

2196
01:23:11,579 --> 01:23:13,610
Gosh, let's stop watching me
get beaten up.

2197
01:23:14,919 --> 01:23:21,190
(This won't be all of it
The day will come when you smile)

2198
01:23:21,459 --> 01:23:23,520
One more time! What was that?

2199
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:28,060
(It's okay)

2200
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,199
(You've done well)

2201
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:31,629
(Watching them proudly)

2202
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:35,999
(Today, where you were lost on the way
will become a trace)

2203
01:23:35,999 --> 01:23:40,169
(Today, where you were lost on the way
will become a trace)

2204
01:23:40,169 --> 01:23:45,850
(When a cool breeze blows)

2205
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:47,650
- Oh, my.
- This song is nice.

2206
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:56,119
(The youngest's "Here We Are"
with love for his big brother)

2207
01:23:56,890 --> 01:23:59,089
- Happy birthday.
- You did so well. Gosh, this is nice.

2208
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,300
Why do you have such great stage manners?

2209
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:05,169
This song feels like a condensed version
of this show.

2210
01:24:05,169 --> 01:24:06,900
- I know. The lyrics are so...
- Thank you.

2211
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,199
- Gosh, this is nice.
- The mood is getting sentimental.

2212
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:11,640
- All right.
- Gosh, I feel great.

2213
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:13,879
I think
the owner has gotten sentimental too.

2214
01:24:13,879 --> 01:24:15,539
Hearing a Korean song
for the first time in a while...

2215
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:17,079
I think it has made him sentimental.

2216
01:24:17,209 --> 01:24:18,779
My gosh.

2217
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:21,150
(Scratching his head)

2218
01:24:21,949 --> 01:24:24,089
Pani Bottle should go next.

2219
01:24:24,089 --> 01:24:25,850
The second eldest should go.

2220
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:28,089
I mean... Seriously, though.

2221
01:24:28,089 --> 01:24:29,760
I have a really bad stage fright.

2222
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,529
- This isn't a stage.
- I never sing.

2223
01:24:32,529 --> 01:24:34,499
- This is a stage to me.
- There aren't...

2224
01:24:34,499 --> 01:24:35,730
- that many people there.
- It's a huge stage.

2225
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:37,430
Kian84, I'll sing while I'm seated.

2226
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:39,129
- Okay.
- Which song do you want to sing?

2227
01:24:39,129 --> 01:24:41,270
- "Do You Want to Walk With Me."
- "Do You Want to Walk With Me?"

2228
01:24:41,499 --> 01:24:43,839
- This is my first time hearing Tle sing.
- "Do You Want to Walk With Me."

2229
01:24:43,869 --> 01:24:48,779
By the way, Tle was such a good singer.

2230
01:24:48,839 --> 01:24:50,480
- Why are you calling me Tle too?
- Oh, right.

2231
01:24:50,949 --> 01:24:52,949
I mean, Pani Bottle is such a good singer.

2232
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:54,320
- He's a great singer.
- I'm looking forward to this.

2233
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,779
I think he'll be good
since he chose Lee Juck's song.

2234
01:24:57,690 --> 01:25:00,220
(A performance by the second eldest
who has stage fright)

2235
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:04,890
(There were times we were lost)

2236
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:06,060
Pani.

2237
01:25:07,529 --> 01:25:08,560
Bottle.

2238
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:12,100
(There were times we were down)

2239
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:13,600
Pani Bottle!

2240
01:25:14,839 --> 01:25:20,010
(Every time, we approached each other)

2241
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:21,279
- He has a good voice.
- Okay.

2242
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:23,110
- Gosh.
- He can sing high notes well.

2243
01:25:25,949 --> 01:25:28,150
- Hey, you're good.
- You're good.

2244
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:29,650
(Going up a high mountain)

2245
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:30,749
What is this?

2246
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,720
(And crossing a rough river)

2247
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,619
They won't let us focus on the song.

2248
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:37,459
(Crossing a valley)

2249
01:25:37,789 --> 01:25:39,959
(To the place)

2250
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,400
(Where the end of life will reach)

2251
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,100
- He sings passionately.
- You can really sing the high notes.

2252
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,770
- He's good.
- He's so good.

2253
01:25:46,999 --> 01:25:49,770
("Do You Want to Walk With Me"
by the songbird with stage fright)

2254
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:51,470
I can't sing the low notes.

2255
01:25:51,739 --> 01:25:52,770
Gosh, that was great.

2256
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:54,739
Why is a guy with stage fright
so good at singing?

2257
01:25:54,739 --> 01:25:55,839
I don't think you have stage fright.

2258
01:25:55,839 --> 01:25:57,110
I usually never sing,

2259
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,449
- but I sang just for Kian84's birthday.
- That's right.

2260
01:25:58,550 --> 01:25:59,879
Both Dex and I...

2261
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,520
- You're good.
- What was that?

2262
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,820
No, but I'm not trying to make excuses.

2263
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:08,289
I lost my voice because I was cheering
so much during the boxing match.

2264
01:26:09,619 --> 01:26:11,159
That really looks like you played
the footage on the screen.

2265
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:12,890
(The cheer captain worked really hard.)

2266
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:14,329
Pani Bottle, you sing really well.

2267
01:26:14,329 --> 01:26:16,360
Plus, I really do have stage fright.

2268
01:26:16,699 --> 01:26:17,829
I'm sweating so much right now.

2269
01:26:18,369 --> 01:26:21,169
Gosh, I love that we can sing songs.

2270
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:04,770
One more?

2271
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:05,840
- One more!
- Hey.

2272
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,409
- One more?
- You said you had stage fright earlier.

2273
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:09,369
- He's excited now.
- What should I sing?

2274
01:29:09,369 --> 01:29:11,140
- What will you sing?
- <i>Eight-forty bitter</i>

2275
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:12,310
Do you want to sing a NewJeans song?

2276
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:14,380
- But what were the lyrics?
- "Hype Boy?"

2277
01:29:14,710 --> 01:29:16,319
- Hang on.
- How did "Hype Boy" go?

2278
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:18,020
- Wasn't it like this?
- Oh, my.

2279
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,850
- "Hype Boy?"
- <i>Hype boy</i>

2280
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:22,050
- <i>In the mirror</i>
- Wait.

2281
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:24,420
- That's "Super Shy!"
- I got them mixed up.

2282
01:29:25,489 --> 01:29:27,390
(The original song)

2283
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,399
(The new song)

2284
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:31,430
What was that song?

2285
01:29:31,829 --> 01:29:33,399
But I don't know this song very well.

2286
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:34,869
"Hype Boy?"

2287
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:40,970
(A refreshing dance song
by the girl group NewJeans)

2288
01:29:42,609 --> 01:29:44,039
Everyone.

2289
01:29:44,939 --> 01:29:46,949
How do you get to Madagascar?

2290
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:50,520
- What?
- He doesn't know.

2291
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,250
Come on.

2292
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:56,050
- I'm too old. I didn't know.
- Pani Bottle, I can't hang out with you!

2293
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:59,560
(When the eldest brother
was traveling in India...)

2294
01:30:00,329 --> 01:30:01,560
(How do you get to Hongdae?)

2295
01:30:02,329 --> 01:30:03,399
(I'd get turned down entry
at Hongdae clubs.)

2296
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:04,600
(It's "Hype Boy" by NewJeans, Kian84.)

2297
01:30:05,829 --> 01:30:07,069
(The eldest learned about this meme
from the youngest too.)

2298
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:09,369
- I wasn't there back then.
- What? Is there such a thing?

2299
01:30:10,569 --> 01:30:12,239
- Everyone.
- Yes?

2300
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,039
How do you get to Madagascar?

2301
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:16,239
With "Hype Boy" by NewJeans!

2302
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:17,279
Yes.

2303
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,449
What was that sound?

2304
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:22,680
Gosh, I love that.

2305
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,819
- Yes.
- Yes.

2306
01:30:23,819 --> 01:30:25,579
Why do I sound so weird?

2307
01:30:25,579 --> 01:30:26,619
Yes.

2308
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:28,920
(Checking the rhythm
as if he's getting a taste)

2309
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:30,489
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

2310
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:32,159
(Baby)

2311
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,529
(Got me looking so crazy)

2312
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:36,829
(I fall into a daydream)

2313
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,100
(His rap skills are befitting
of a celebrity represented by AOMG.)

2314
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,800
"His rap skills are befitting
of a celebrity represented by AOMG."

2315
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,829
(Feeling embarrassed on his behalf)

2316
01:30:41,829 --> 01:30:43,039
(He even adds hip gestures.)

2317
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:44,670
- You must be proud.
- Indeed.

2318
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,840
(I just want you to
call my phone right now)

2319
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:50,439
Everyone. How do you get to Madagascar?

2320
01:30:51,909 --> 01:30:52,979
<i>Hype boy</i>

2321
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:55,550
(Vocalizing)

2322
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:58,050
(Chemical hype boy)

2323
01:30:58,819 --> 01:31:01,020
(My past days)

2324
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:02,449
(Are just dreams you forget as you wake)

2325
01:31:02,989 --> 01:31:03,989
(Vocalizing)

2326
01:31:04,489 --> 01:31:06,989
(He smoothly transitions to falsetto.)

2327
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:11,460
(Screaming)

2328
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,630
(Screaming)

2329
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:16,800
(He suddenly starts screaming.)

2330
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,640
(The refreshing
and sweet original song...)

2331
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,170
Yes, this is the original song.

2332
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:24,710
(Screaming)

2333
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:26,079
This is new.

2334
01:31:27,979 --> 01:31:30,119
(It has been reborn as a song of madness.)

2335
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:31,819
(Totally immersed)

2336
01:31:32,449 --> 01:31:34,020
(Screaming)

2337
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:37,520
(You hype boy)

2338
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,489
- Are you at the dentist's?
- "The dentist's."

2339
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:41,659
- Gosh, I'm so tired.
- "The dentist's."

2340
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:42,829
You must be able to do that much...

2341
01:31:42,829 --> 01:31:44,060
- to get into AOMG.
- I know, right?

2342
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,829
Of course. I'm in AOMG.

2343
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,529
Yoon Do Hyun's "Love, Two?"

2344
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:52,439
- Let's sing it together.
- Nice.

2345
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,569
You can't hold back on Yoon Do Hyun.

2346
01:31:54,569 --> 01:31:57,479
Yoon Do Hyun is a must.

2347
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,880
Of course not.
You can't hold back on Yoon Do Hyun.

2348
01:32:03,449 --> 01:32:10,119
(At first, I thought we were just friends)

2349
01:32:10,119 --> 01:32:15,930
(Without any colors,
I hope it goes on forever)

2350
01:32:16,329 --> 01:32:18,159
- You need this kind of mood at karaoke.
- Of course.

2351
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:19,359
You sing a nice ballad together.

2352
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:20,529
A song like "Around 30."

2353
01:32:20,630 --> 01:32:22,930
I like this kind of stuff.
Singing together.

2354
01:32:24,899 --> 01:32:29,979
(The three brothers are immersed
in the sentimental rock ballad.)

2355
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,010
All together!

2356
01:32:33,779 --> 01:32:36,949
(Vocalizing)

2357
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:40,319
(We can't hold back
on Yoon Do Hyun either.)

2358
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:44,159
(When I meet you, even if we don't speak)

2359
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:50,500
(I feel comfortable
as if you are another me)

2360
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,069
(Along with the eldest brother
who is drunk on emotions,)

2361
01:32:58,470 --> 01:33:03,380
(their blood sentimentality levels
are rising.)

2362
01:33:05,109 --> 01:33:07,279
(You are so precious to me)

2363
01:33:07,279 --> 01:33:09,649
(Puzzled)

2364
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:17,119
(You are)

2365
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:19,090
(Fully cured of his stage fright)

2366
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:21,729
(You are such a joy to me)

2367
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:23,529
- Oh, nice.
- That was great.

2368
01:33:23,529 --> 01:33:24,829
(The night in Madagascar grows deeper
with the three brothers' song.)

2369
01:33:24,829 --> 01:33:26,600
- That night was great.
- Yes.

2370
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:29,130
(I'll see you down there.
Have a safe trip.)

2371
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,640
(They leave as soon as I sit down!)

2372
01:33:30,869 --> 01:33:32,800
(The solo trip to Antsirabe starts.)

2373
01:33:33,409 --> 01:33:36,239
(The germ-busting youngest
appears at a Madagascan laundry place.)

2374
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,810
(Die!)

2375
01:33:38,909 --> 01:33:39,979
(Proud)

2376
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:42,210
(And the youngest captures
the hearts of women.)

2377
01:33:42,210 --> 01:33:43,920
(Shy)

2378
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:47,050
(While the youngest is laughing it up
with the girls of Madagascar...)

2379
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:48,789
(I have to eat too!)

2380
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:49,789
Me!

2381
01:33:49,989 --> 01:33:51,560
(Charismatic Pani
is being robbed in real-time.)

2382
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,590
(This is mine.)

2383
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:54,560
(He becomes super popular
with the merchants who heard the rumor.)

2384
01:33:55,289 --> 01:33:57,659
(The seat is cramped too.)

2385
01:33:57,659 --> 01:33:59,229
(If I were his age,
I would be crying right now too.)

2386
01:34:00,069 --> 01:34:01,500
(King of Dancing84 has become immersed
in the Madagascan funeral culture?)

2387
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,270
(Ancestors' swag!)

2388
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:05,069
(You're such a great dancer.)

2389
01:34:05,069 --> 01:34:08,239
(A high-energy funeral,
only in Madagascar)

2390
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:10,380
(I'm in the lead.)

2391
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:12,939
(Right when he was
getting used to the mood...)

2392
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:16,720
(They're crying.)

2393
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:19,220
(In a cheerful mood,)

2394
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:20,850
(someone is crying.)

2395
01:34:21,619 --> 01:34:23,590
(They laugh to console their sadness...)

2396
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:25,859
(and express their longing.)

2397
01:34:26,529 --> 01:34:28,960
(In their own way,)

2398
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,760
(people say farewell.)

2399
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:33,829
(I'm getting a mix of emotions.)

2400
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:36,369
(Adventure by Accident)
