1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,309
We can finally see
the baobab trees today, right?

2
00:00:03,309 --> 00:00:04,609
- That's right.
- Yes, that's correct.

3
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:06,139
I'm really pushed for this.

4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,380
- We had to go see the baobab trees.
- Of course.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,520
Also, camping under the baobab trees...

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,180
- was on my bucket list.
- Right.

7
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:13,819
We're going to the baobab trees today.

8
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,749
Before we got there, we really enjoyed...

9
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:18,260
eating lobster last week, right?

10
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,620
- Yes.
- So...

11
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,589
- Did you bring lobster...
- So you can eat while watching...

12
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:22,629
- You brought lobster?
- Oh, lobster?

13
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,729
- Not lobster, but I prepared something.
- I see.

14
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:25,859
(The owner of the house
prepared some snacks.)

15
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,830
- Oh, right. This is Pani Bottle's house.
- Oh, my.

16
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,039
He's really good
at taking care of people like that.

17
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,100
Oh, my!

18
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,640
What is this? Is it toast?

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,870
- Oh, my!
- What is this?

20
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,040
- Oh, my goodness.
- I can't say no to this!

21
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,580
- This is amazing.
- I have to eat this.

22
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,610
Right.

23
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:42,479
(The toast is full of amazing things,
just like Adventure by Accident.)

24
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,680
I'm going to dig in.

25
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,120
- It smells like chicken.
- Thank you for the food.

26
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,750
- Thank you for the food.
- Oh, my.

27
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,120
(His mouth fills with heartiness.)

28
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,729
- It's good.
- The sauce is tasty.

29
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:55,629
Since it's a big portion,

30
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:58,099
this chicken toast is enough
to fill you up.

31
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,659
It tastes like yangnyeom chicken...

32
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,669
- from back in the day.
- You're right.

33
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,169
- This chicken toast is so hearty.
- It's so good.

34
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:04,200
Nice.

35
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,399
The sauce is good.

36
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,009
- It is.
- I really like it.

37
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,369
- Everyone.
- Yes?

38
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:10,909
- You watch the show when it airs, right?
- Of course.

39
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,950
Are you aware
our show is available for streaming?

40
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,250
- Of course.
- It's been available on one of the OTTs.

41
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,580
- Right.
- But this time,

42
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,879
- it's also being offered on other OTTs.
- Right.

43
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,420
(Congratulations. Adventure by Accident
is streaming on two different OTTs.)

44
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,950
- That is insane.
- Are you serious?

45
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,759
This will be my first time on the new OTT.

46
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:26,830
- It's the first time for me too.
- You're right. Same for me.

47
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,030
- Right.
- That is insane.

48
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,830
Dex has been on the new OTT...

49
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,500
- He's our senior.
- Right.

50
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,369
- Senior Dex.
- Oh, my.

51
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:34,670
(That's right.)

52
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,539
(Our Madagascar trip
with Senior Dex starts now!)

53
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:56,070
(Day 5 of the Madagascar Trip)

54
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:59,480
(Kian84 woke up first.)

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,380
(Rummaging through his things)

56
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,150
My favorite T-shirt fell.

57
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,960
- Oh, no.
- What should I do? Can I reach that?

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,889
I've grown attached to it
from wearing it often on this show.

59
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,400
That's your official uniform
for Adventure by Accident.

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,859
Were you able to grab it?

61
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:21,700
I went down, placed a chair,

62
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,329
stepped on the chair, and grabbed it.

63
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,000
- That's good.
- You were able to reach it, I see.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,169
- That's good news.
- Good job.

65
00:03:26,369 --> 00:03:27,410
Okay.

66
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,639
Shall we get going?
Do we have all of our equipment?

67
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,639
For now,

68
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,139
- we'll leave our camping stuff here.
- Okay.

69
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,609
We need to buy food
and other things for camping,

70
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:36,910
like slippers.

71
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,950
- So we should come back once...
- Yes. Let's come back here.

72
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:41,619
- Let's just go to the market now.
- Okay.

73
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,220
- We need to eat too.
- I'm hungry.

74
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,260
- Is that all you packed for camping?
- Yes.

75
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:47,760
You gave me this, right?

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,829
- That's the tent...
- Just the tent? That's it?

77
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,530
(Even the tent
was a gift from Pani Bottle.)

78
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,269
- I figured he wouldn't have a tent.
- Oh, my.

79
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,899
- So I brought one for him.
- That's so nice of you.

80
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,470
We can buy
toothbrushes and toothpaste there.

81
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,739
Kian84 style. Let's go.

82
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,239
- This is Kian84.
- Let's go to the market.

83
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:01,440
Wait. I gave you that, right?

84
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,440
- Of course. You gave this to me.
- Oh, the gift.

85
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,139
- It's so useful.
- It's nice, right?

86
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,850
- That must've made you happy.
- I felt grateful.

87
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,079
(Pani Bottle is wearing the chest rig
that Dex gave him.)

88
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,679
- Oh, that is cool.
- Right.

89
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:13,280
(Kian84 is wearing the bag
that Porfi gave him.)

90
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,750
- You're wearing each other's gifts.
- You're right.

91
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,720
- You gave each other gifts.
- How heartwarming.

92
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
That's nice to see.

93
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,160
- Let's go.
- You grew even closer in Africa.

94
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,790
The weather is always nice.

95
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
Is this it?

96
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,660
I see it over there.

97
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,899
(What is this?)

98
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:29,929
Tuk-tuk?

99
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,600
- Pousse-pousse?
- Pousse-pousse?

100
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,839
(Pousse-pousse, a rickshaw with 2 seats,
the most common form of transportation)

101
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,269
Let's negotiate the price first.

102
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:39,880
Market. Supermarket.

103
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,010
- Market?
- Yes.

104
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,209
How much?

105
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,019
- It's 50,000 ariaries?
- It's 50,000 ariaries? How much is that?

106
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,820
- Around ten dollars?
- That's a bit expensive.

107
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:48,619
It's 10 minutes by walk.
He's charging 10 dollars?

108
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,049
- That's ridiculous.
- What?

109
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:51,989
- That won't work.
- No. That's not right.

110
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:53,389
(Even Kian84, the open wallet,
cannot accept this price.)

111
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,690
- No. It's too expensive.
- No.

112
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,500
- No.
- Lower? Good?

113
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,660
- One, two.
- I think we have to split it.

114
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,700
For 30,000 ariaries.

115
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,829
- Okay.
- Okay?

116
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,440
- We can do this.
- Hold on.

117
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,839
That's a bit expensive too.

118
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,440
- Total.
- For 20,000 ariaries.

119
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:10,609
- A total of 20,000 ariaries. Understand?
- It's 2.

120
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:12,109
- You mean 20,000 ariaries?
- Yes.

121
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,079
Oh, that was cool.

122
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,750
- Yes.
- Total.

123
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,750
- Total.
- Okay.

124
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,619
- Okay.
- Kian84 has changed a bit, right?

125
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,649
He seemed like a pro.

126
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,089
Actually, Dex stopped haggling.

127
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,359
- You two switched.
- Because you're doing it for him.

128
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,560
I learned something from Kian84,

129
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,760
- and he learned something from me.
- I see.

130
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,860
So we kind of switched.

131
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,860
- You're right.
- We're meeting somewhere in the middle.

132
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,630
- You're influencing each other.
- Exactly.

133
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,099
- Like mirror therapy.
- You totally changed.

134
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,570
- Okay. Go.
- Okay.

135
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,599
- Go?
- Go.

136
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:40,539
(The rickshaw driver is pedaling hard.)

137
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:41,539
We should check the map.

138
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:43,339
Our driver is totally Uhm Bok Dong.

139
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:44,510
- Gosh.
- Uhm Bok Dong style.

140
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,380
How about eating first when we arrive?

141
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,779
I was thinking the same thing.

142
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,610
- Since we didn't eat breakfast...
- I'm starving.

143
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,420
Also, we shouldn't shop when we're hungry.

144
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,479
- He's right. You get to buy everything.
- We need to be full...

145
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,389
so we only buy the food we need.

146
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,620
We don't want leftovers.

147
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,860
- I don't leave leftovers.
- You eat everything?

148
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,190
I even freeze sashimi and eat it later.

149
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,500
(While thrifty Kian84
and Pani Bottle chat...)

150
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,829
First of all, it's so peaceful here.

151
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:09,829
There's not much noise either.

152
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:11,700
I really like it.

153
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,870
I can smell barbecue a lot
going on the road.

154
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,680
I like that a lot too.

155
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:22,680
I can feel myself liking this country
more and more.

156
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,950
The market is over there.

157
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,719
(They're getting closer
to the market entrance.)

158
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:29,289
- Over there.
- I like local things.

159
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,589
It's the market.

160
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,789
(The center of Morondava's economy)

161
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,190
Right. Going to the market is always fun.

162
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,229
Everything may be on the ground,

163
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,029
but they had everything we needed.

164
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,829
- Oh, my.
- A food court, kitchenware,

165
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,570
- home appliances, and electronics.
- Oh, my!

166
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,729
They had everything.

167
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:45,269
That looks like a fun market.

168
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:46,839
- There are so many things to see.
- What a variety.

169
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,170
It had a peaceful atmosphere.

170
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,880
They don't have supermarkets,
but the markets are always open.

171
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,380
It was kind of like that.

172
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,279
(They arrived at Bazar Be Market.)

173
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,649
- Here.
- Stop.

174
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,079
Oh, I see slippers right there.

175
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:02,120
- We lost our slippers.
- Oh, right.

176
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:04,860
- Right.
- Will you stay there?

177
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,060
We will come back here.

178
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,529
- And you too.
- Okay.

179
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:10,800
Okay. See you.

180
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,700
(They smartly reserved
their pousse-pousse.)

181
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:14,930
- Slippers.
- Yes.

182
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,000
- Let's buy the slippers...
- Wait. What's up with these slippers?

183
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,070
- Let's eat before we continue shopping.
- Okay.

184
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,539
- He's firm when he talks about eating.
- Sounds good.

185
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:22,209
- We need to have food.
- Let's buy slippers...

186
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,670
Let's buy slippers first.

187
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,380
Nike. Fila.

188
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,539
There are many well-known brands.

189
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:29,649
Those green slippers remind me
of Korea's Unbeatable Slippers.

190
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,279
The slippers that they use in the military
that never rip.

191
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,320
You're right.

192
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,349
Wait. I didn't think
these were flip-flops, but they are.

193
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,420
- What?
- What is this?

194
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,289
- Just cut it.
- You just have to cut that.

195
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:39,860
- Okay.
- I want these.

196
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,360
- Okay. I'll get these. They're cute.
- Good.

197
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,990
We all bought slippers
at the first store we went to.

198
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,130
How much?

199
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:47,769
- How much will she ask for?
- Let's see.

200
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,930
- It's 20,000 ariaries?
- It's 20,000 ariaries?

201
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,200
Is 20,000 ariaries 5 dollars?
That seems a bit expensive.

202
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,670
(Kian84 pays right away.)

203
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:56,209
It's 6 dollars. So 2 dollars for a pair.

204
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,440
For all of it?

205
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,380
- I see.
- You ruthless guy.

206
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,380
- Okay.
- For all of it?

207
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,310
She's trying to sell them
for two dollars a pair.

208
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,810
You're so evil.

209
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:04,979
Let's go.

210
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,789
Let's go.

211
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,490
You have to pay 40,000 ariaries more.

212
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,019
- She said no.
- What?

213
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,490
- I was right. It's 20,000 ariaries each.
- It's 20,000 ariaries for a pair?

214
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,760
- Yes.
- Oh, it's 20,000 ariaries for a pair?

215
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,229
- Oh, for a pair?
- It's 20,000 ariaries for a pair.

216
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,829
- You're the evil one.
- No. Half.

217
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:20,360
- You tried to leave without paying.
- That.

218
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,670
(Haggling for 15,000 ariaries a pair)

219
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,700
We're buying three pairs.

220
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,870
- For one?
- Yes. Okay?

221
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,510
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you.

222
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,269
- Here is 5,000 ariaries.
- Nice.

223
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,570
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay. Thank you.

224
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,339
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

225
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:35,550
- How many times are you asking to eat?
- But Pani Bottle...

226
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,649
Let's just eat.

227
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:40,479
- Yes. Please let him eat.
- Exactly. I'm asking so many times.

228
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,450
I saw a restaurant on the way here.

229
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:44,690
There were a lot of people.

230
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,089
- Over there?
- Yes.

231
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,060
Local food. Will you be okay?

232
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,560
- We can try...
- Let's go.

233
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,760
There's another restaurant in there.

234
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,800
(Pani Bottle spotted
a close local restaurant.)

235
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,130
- That place looks cleaner.
- Should we go there, then?

236
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,300
(They head to the local restaurant
across the street without hesitation.)

237
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,440
Look at the baguettes. That looks good.

238
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,209
- Is this not a restaurant?
- We have to go in there, it seems.

239
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:04,110
This. Baguette.

240
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,010
They have baguettes.

241
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,209
But I want rice, not bread.

242
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,380
(They head into a restaurant
with a mountain of baguettes.)

243
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:11,719
- Food?
- Yes.

244
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,990
- What is this?
- Oh, my. It's street food.

245
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,990
That looks good.

246
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:19,019
(A charismatic owner)

247
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,029
(Move, fly!)

248
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,889
- She was killing the flies.
- Oh, my.

249
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:26,060
- It's for table turnover.
- She chased them away for us.

250
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,300
She's getting rid of the flies
to seat new customers.

251
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:30,570
(Thinking)

252
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,440
- Dex.
- Baguette. Okay.

253
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,110
Be honest.
Let us know if you can't eat here.

254
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,139
Hurry.

255
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,209
- Dex can...
- I'll eat bread.

256
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,979
- Yes. Eat bread.
- Right.

257
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,250
- Let's sit.
- Okay.

258
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,110
(They take a seat
after Dex reassures them.)

259
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:46,879
Why are there spider webs on the bread?

260
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,259
- Menu.
- Menu.

261
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,589
I don't think they have a menu here.

262
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,930
- You should eat bread.
- Baguette.

263
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,530
- Baguette.
- I'll have rice.

264
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,829
- Rice.
- Rice.

265
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:00,129
How do I serve myself?

266
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:02,530
Can I serve myself?

267
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,770
"Jeopsi."

268
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,640
- "Jeopsi."
- "Jeopsi."

269
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,670
(Items ordered, baguette, 2 bowls of rice)

270
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,109
You kind of serve yourself.

271
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,040
- It's kind of like a buffet.
- Right.

272
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,609
- "Gogi."
- "Gogi."

273
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:15,609
(Items ordered, baguette, 2 bowls of rice,
a basket of fritters, braised fish)

274
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:17,680
- "Gogi."
- She's very friendly.

275
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,619
- This won't make you sick.
- I see...

276
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,920
Hold on. Let's see.

277
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:25,520
(Pani Bottle tries the baguette first.)

278
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,320
It looks good. The sound is nice.

279
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
(Crunch)

280
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,290
Gosh. That baguette...

281
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,099
The baguette is delicious. Oh, my.

282
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:36,030
Crispy on the outside,
moist on the inside.

283
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:38,969
Goodness. The baguette is very soft.

284
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:43,839
(Happily nodding)

285
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,280
This baguette isn't bad.

286
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,579
Is there something else? Is there soup?

287
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,479
- Soup.
- Soup?

288
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,180
- Soup. Yes.
- Soup?

289
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:54,849
Kian84. Let's bring out our secret weapon.

290
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:56,020
What? Gochujang?

291
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:57,759
Kimchi.

292
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,290
(Puffed up)

293
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,759
- It's so puffy.
- You brought kimchi?

294
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,089
We can't eat this.

295
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:03,660
We'll die if we eat this.

296
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,530
It fermented.

297
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,129
This has gone bad.

298
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,629
Let me smell it at least.

299
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,270
(While Kian84 and Pani Bottle bicker
right next to him,)

300
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:17,170
(Dex quietly continues to eat
the baguette.)

301
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,609
(Do you want to try it?)

302
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:22,209
- What is that?
- What is that? Sausage?

303
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:23,879
- Fritters?
- The fritters...

304
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,280
were similar to Korean ones.

305
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,050
(Trying the kimchi)

306
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:31,359
Oh, my. The kimchi fermented well.

307
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,890
Should I eat my baguette with kimchi?

308
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,729
Baguette with kimchi? A kimchi baguette?

309
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,660
- It's ripe kimchi.
- It's fermented kimchi.

310
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,430
- Is it okay?
- I love it!

311
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,469
- It was totally ripe kimchi.
- Oh, baguette with kimchi.

312
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:44,170
(Trying baguette and kimchi together)

313
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,709
(Taking a big bite)

314
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,009
- Very delicious.
- Yes.

315
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,209
That is an even weirder food combination.

316
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,209
It's not as bad as you'd think.

317
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,150
- Eating bread with kimchi?
- It's unexpectedly good...

318
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,349
because a baguette on its own
doesn't have much of a taste.

319
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:01,950
Right. It's like rice.

320
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,849
- It's having carbs with kimchi.
- Is it really okay?

321
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,560
- It's good.
- Really?

322
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,420
- Okay. The fish?
- How does the fish smell?

323
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:08,890
- This...
- The smell isn't bad.

324
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,200
- It's kind of like...
- This is Madagascar ramen.

325
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,430
I love it.

326
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,300
- The noodles are like janchi guksu.
- They are.

327
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:19,570
It tastes like alcohol.

328
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,999
The noodles are good.

329
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,770
Try this. It's good.

330
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:27,979
The fish is good.

331
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,450
- What?
- It's good, right?

332
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,579
It's good.

333
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:31,950
How can I say it? It's like...

334
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,020
It tastes like seolleongtang
with cilantro inside.

335
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,020
- Right?
- Yes.

336
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,759
I guess Madagascar has good soup.

337
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:39,820
Did it have lots of spices?

338
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,489
All Korean people can eat that
if they're okay with cilantro.

339
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:43,629
That looks good.

340
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,200
I don't know what fish it is.

341
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:49,670
- You eat so well.
- You two seem to like it.

342
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,300
- You eat so well.
- They're loving it.

343
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:53,869
- It tastes like meatball jeon.
- Goodness.

344
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:55,540
Who knew we'd find Korean food in Africa?

345
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,009
This is just Korean food.

346
00:12:58,109 --> 00:12:59,640
How do they say, "It's delicious,"
in India again?

347
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,009
Isn't it "Shanti?" That's what I remember.

348
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:04,820
(Shanti means peace.)

349
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:06,349
Shanti.

350
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,950
- Suddenly like that?
- Beef bone soup.

351
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,690
It's like Korean food
with less artificial seasoning.

352
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:13,820
I thought it would be very different
in Africa,

353
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,759
but I was more so surprised
that it was close to Korean food.

354
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:20,629
- Nice.
- What does that taste like?

355
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:23,430
Okay. I'm going to eat baguette
topped with kimchi.

356
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,869
Thank goodness you had kimchi.

357
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:26,670
Gosh. The way you're eating
is so unappetizing.

358
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:30,239
Dex. Try a spoonful of soup.

359
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:31,640
- Well...
- Try some.

360
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,709
(Thanks to Kian84,
Dex tries a spoon of soup.)

361
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:34,910
He's actually trying it.

362
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,879
Be careful of cilantro
There's a bit of cilantro in there.

363
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,150
(Thinking)

364
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,150
He doesn't like it.

365
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,820
Oh, my. That's pretty intense.

366
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,219
- Oh, my.
- That's pretty intense.

367
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:45,619
I wonder what kind of fish this is.

368
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,930
(A bite of the braised fish)

369
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,660
This is like that seolleongtang ramyeon.

370
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,959
- Shanti.
- Beef bone soup?

371
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:55,770
- What does the fish taste like?
- Shanti. It's good.

372
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,570
It tastes like Korean braised pollack.

373
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,770
- Pollack?
- Pollack? What is it called?

374
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,770
(Trying a bit of sauce with the fork)

375
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,969
Oh, you're right.

376
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,609
Try one of these.

377
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,079
Try one. It's meat.

378
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:08,609
(Dex also tries a meatball.)

379
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:09,650
Try one. It's meat.

380
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,520
(Chewing with a weird face)

381
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:14,520
Your mom is going to scold you.

382
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,690
Look at him!

383
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,759
You look like a mischievous kid.

384
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:19,759
You brat.

385
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,359
(Picky Little Dex)

386
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:23,790
Oh, the texture is...

387
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,629
The texture of the meat...

388
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,829
- was mushy.
- Look at his hands.

389
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:29,670
Goodness!

390
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:31,499
The taste isn't bad.

391
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,969
- Okay.
- He's lying.

392
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,009
Well...

393
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:43,579
Did you rent out a whole restaurant
for your interview?

394
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:45,219
Are you at a wedding venue or something?

395
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,979
Someone might think I'm some epicure.

396
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:49,420
It wasn't about the cleanliness
or the taste.

397
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,660
We had a lot left of the trip,

398
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,160
so I had to be careful
to make sure I didn't get sick.

399
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,900
Eating bread and kimchi is pretty good.

400
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:59,099
The bread was really good.

401
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:03,900
What fish?

402
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,440
Fish name?

403
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,640
I don't know what they're saying.
Do they want something more?

404
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:13,109
Pani Bottle. Kian84. Dex.

405
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:15,749
I see.

406
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,079
(Communication failure)

407
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,479
He tried.

408
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:20,050
- The idea was good.
- Yes.

409
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,690
Pani? Tari?

410
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,020
Pari? Tari?

411
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,489
Caffe.

412
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,119
Rice.

413
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:29,589
Poisson.

414
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,499
- Poisson?
- Poisson.

415
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:34,900
- Fish.
- Oh, poisson.

416
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,499
Oh, it's a French dish.

417
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:37,829
This fish is called Koisson.

418
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,300
That was sea bream.

419
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,670
- Yes, sea bream.
- Sea bream is delicious.

420
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,770
Let's get some fritters to go.

421
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,879
We might get hungry again. These.

422
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,180
- I'm going to get some baguettes to go.
- Okay.

423
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,910
I ate a whole baguette.

424
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,450
You ate a whole baguette.

425
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:53,719
Should we take 5 or 6 baguettes to go?

426
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,749
Wouldn't three baguettes be enough?

427
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:57,390
- I'll eat any leftovers.
- Hey, but...

428
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,320
If it's a national park,

429
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,759
- we might not be able to light a fire.
- Right.

430
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,959
We do need to take food...

431
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,660
- we can eat without doing a barbecue.
- Right.

432
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:06,660
Gosh.

433
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,070
This soup. Gosh.

434
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,800
This chef would be very successful
if she were to open a seolleongtang place.

435
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,369
- This. Take out.
- What?

436
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,310
Take away.

437
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:21,349
(We want to take...)

438
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:22,680
(the leftover food.)

439
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,180
(Thumbs up)

440
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,079
(That was impressive.)

441
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,219
Gosh. You really are...

442
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:31,190
He really is the king of communication.

443
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:33,119
Travel YouTubers are just different.

444
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,030
- It's not always about words.
- You just have to communicate somehow.

445
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,329
I guess
that's why experience is important.

446
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,530
A master traveler.

447
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,700
How much is it total?

448
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,099
She seems nice,
but she could really rip us off.

449
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,270
How much will she ask for?

450
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,770
It's 270 dollars.

451
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:53,379
It's 12,400 ariaries.

452
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,879
- It's 4 dollars? That's insane.
- It's 4 dollars.

453
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,379
- That's so cheap.
- That's insane.

454
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:57,479
It's cheap.

455
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:58,650
Ask about the price of the bread.

456
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:00,180
I'm curious
how much five pieces of bread cost.

457
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,520
- Rice.
- Baguette.

458
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,989
(Getting 5 additional baguettes to go)

459
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,650
(5 baguettes, 4,000 ariaries,
about 1 dollar and 20 cents)

460
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,920
It's 16,400 ariaries.

461
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,020
- In total?
- Yes.

462
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,530
- Gosh.
- Gosh. That's cheap.

463
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,060
(He happily pays.)

464
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,729
(The owner is looking for change.)

465
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:13,999
No.

466
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,229
(No change)

467
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:18,200
- It's not much.
- Okay.

468
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Thank you.

469
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:22,509
It's good to spend
in situations like that.

470
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:23,969
She was so kind.

471
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,509
- How nice.
- It's nice for everyone.

472
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,509
How cheap.

473
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,579
We bought slippers.

474
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,780
Wet tissues, snacks, and things like that.

475
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,050
Is there a supermarket?

476
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,920
- I think it's somewhere here.
- Shopping for camping trips is fun.

477
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
- Right.
- Totally.

478
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,089
It's even more fun to shop
for camping trips in foreign countries.

479
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,060
- Yes.
- Totally.

480
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,660
- Hello.
- Hello.

481
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,229
- Jam?
- Jam?

482
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:46,430
To eat with the baguette?

483
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,459
(This?)

484
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:48,869
I don't think that's jam.

485
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,670
Let's try one... Hold on.

486
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,369
Should we try one?

487
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,670
We usually eat this with bread.

488
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,469
- Where's the place famous for salmon?
- That Sta...

489
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:57,570
- Norway.
- Right.

490
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,310
- From Norway. Let's eat it together.
- Norway?

491
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,180
Is that butter?

492
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,910
No. I'm not sure what that is.

493
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,749
Don't you think
we could eat this with bread?

494
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:06,550
Let's try something new.

495
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,879
Let's not always take the safe path.

496
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:09,690
- Mayonnaise.
- Mayonnaise.

497
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,719
And the...

498
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,160
- Tomato.
- Tomato.

499
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,489
Okay. Tomato. One.

500
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,530
- In times like this...
- Tomato.

501
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,390
- And...
- He stepped up there.

502
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,529
(Ready for a challenge)

503
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,330
Tomato paste. Yes!

504
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,200
- This looks good. Let's get a few more...
- You're right.

505
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,670
Five of these.

506
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,769
- Five?
- Five.

507
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:27,539
- What is "paste?"
- Isn't it like tomato sauce?

508
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:28,910
The baguette is so good.

509
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,069
(Crunch)

510
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,779
You're continuously eating, Tle.

511
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,910
It's dessert.

512
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,549
I really like baguettes.

513
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:36,779
This is a real baguette.

514
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,450
- "Pani Baguette."
- "Pani Baguette."

515
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,650
(He finished it.)

516
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,190
Well...

517
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,259
The baguette was really so...

518
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,459
He gained weight.

519
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:52,459
His face became round...

520
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:54,100
and kind of red. How cute.

521
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,299
The outside was bitter and crunchy.

522
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,100
The inside was soft.

523
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,370
It was the best baguette.

524
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,039
I didn't randomly become ravenous.

525
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,670
Madagascar just has good food.

526
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:08,180
It's 20,000? Okay.

527
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,479
It's six dollars?

528
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,080
We did buy many things.

529
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:12,620
How do you eat so well?

530
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,319
I like that they don't haggle here.

531
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,690
- He's just sitting and continuously...
- He's still eating.

532
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:19,920
Did you not get enough food earlier?
You're really enjoying that bread.

533
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:21,489
Look at me eating
with my forward head posture.

534
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,559
I guess
he has a separate stomach for bread.

535
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,630
It looks like my neck is about to pop out.

536
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,630
Okay.

537
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,459
(Preciously holding his baguette...)

538
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,799
Oh, caps.

539
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,870
Oh, hats.

540
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:32,870
We needed hats. The sun was so strong.

541
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,509
I should buy one of these.

542
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,340
Is there a hat with a wide brim?

543
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,410
They are for ladies.

544
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,150
Is this for men?

545
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,319
(He picks one up and tries it on.)

546
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,190
Why do I have such a big head?

547
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,289
- "The baguette gag."
- Come on.

548
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:53,890
- Darn it.
- He walked around with that in his mouth.

549
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:58,330
Sorry. My head is too big,
so these hats are too small for me. Wait.

550
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,130
- I see. They are too small for you.
- They are small for you.

551
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,529
(A women's hat)

552
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,299
I see. That hat fits you.

553
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,539
How come women's hats are larger
than men's?

554
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,640
This women's hat fits me.

555
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:12,479
(Chuckling)

556
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,049
- Do I look okay?
- You look adorable. You look pretty.

557
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:17,180
- It looked good on him, though.
- It goes well with his shirt.

558
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,249
How elegant.

559
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,719
You look pretty.

560
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,350
(StrawHat84)

561
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,190
(This is how
Kian84's character came about.)

562
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,590
- It looks good on him.
- Yes.

563
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,219
It matches his shirt too.

564
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:28,489
Other hats cover my head
only up to this point.

565
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:29,890
- It looks great on you.
- This hat comes down to this point.

566
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:32,400
- That's a great way to shield your face.
- Yes.

567
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,229
What if I end up with
fair and smooth skin like babies...

568
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:36,799
because I blocked out the sun efficiently?

569
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,340
I sort of want that kind of hat too now.

570
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:41,400
Hey, Kim Du Han
might have worn something like that.

571
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,670
<i>I will be a wild man</i>

572
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,840
The Umigwan-style hat.

573
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,080
(Is this Kim Du Han,
trying to make his skin fair and smooth?)

574
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,910
His head is small, so it fits him nicely.

575
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,620
First of all, let me make a complete turn
to see how it is.

576
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,190
Is the sun hitting my face?

577
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,719
(Turning)

578
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:58,890
Your mouth is in the sun.

579
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,019
- My mouth?
- Yes.

580
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,420
It's okay if your mouth gets a tan.

581
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,459
- It's okay if his mouth gets a tan.
- Why is that okay, though?

582
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:04,090
How much are these hats?

583
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:05,759
It's 15,000 ariaries per hat. Okay.

584
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,959
(Their 2 hats are equivalent
to 10 dollars.)

585
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:08,999
Okay.

586
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,830
- Are we done once we buy mangoes?
- Mangoes.

587
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,870
We can go over there.

588
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,400
- Go straight. We'll find a fruit shop.
- Okay.

589
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,769
By the way, Madagascar doesn't have
a unique smell or anything.

590
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:18,479
It's very quiet here.

591
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:20,680
There's beauty
behind the slow pace of things.

592
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,180
Things you notice when you slow down.

593
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,150
These must be apple mangoes.

594
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,279
- Apple mangoes.
- What?

595
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,420
Hello.

596
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,950
I'm curious about fruits from Africa.

597
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,950
I'll pick some fruits.

598
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,190
(Suit yourself.)

599
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,759
This one seems nicely ripe.

600
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,090
When we were there,
mangoes were in season.

601
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,360
A lot of stalls sold mangoes.

602
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:38,059
The colors are all different slightly.

603
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:41,229
He's had mangoes from South America
and India. Now, he'll try some...

604
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:42,430
from Africa too. Right?

605
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,130
(Put them in this bag.)

606
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,539
It's 4,000 ariaries so far.

607
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,670
(8 mangoes come out to 2.1 dollars.)

608
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,670
Take this.

609
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,140
Shall we go?

610
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,239
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

611
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,940
The guys from earlier are waiting for us.

612
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,239
I see.

613
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,249
- Yes.
- This one.

614
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,680
(Why is he suddenly jabbing?)

615
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
- Yes. Okay. Let's go.
- He recognized you.

616
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:00,549
- What? He recognized Dex.
- Did he recognize Dex?

617
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:01,549
- No way.
- He was your fan.

618
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:02,590
- Moraingy.
- Right.

619
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,690
- Okay. Let's go.
- He recognized you.

620
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,519
- Yes. Boxing.
- I see. Boxing.

621
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:09,289
(Dex ruled the moraingy scene
with his punches.)

622
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:10,860
(He left a strong impression
on the people.)

623
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,400
(He's pretty good.)

624
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,630
(Another man also participated
in the moraingy match.)

625
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:17,769
(In tatters)

626
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:19,739
- I bet he left an impression on them.
- Boxing.

627
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:20,969
They were the only foreigners.

628
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,170
- I'm the one who lost.
- He's gotten famous already.

629
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,969
But the match was tied for him. Yes.

630
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,840
- Hey, brother.
- I only had one match, but I lost.

631
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,910
- Great.
- You seem a bit bitter.

632
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:30,880
- He had a match, and it was tied.
- It was tied.

633
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,120
- I had a match and lost.
- You lost.

634
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:34,279
- He had 1 match, and it was tied.
- He had 1 match, and it was tied.

635
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,690
That's fascinating.

636
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,590
(The surprise meet-and-greet is over.)

637
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,590
Dex and I...

638
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:41,959
became celebrities in Morondava.

639
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,559
- Right. Everyone knows you guys.
- So...

640
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,999
Dex had a match, and it was tied.

641
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,430
I had a match, but I lost.
People recognized us from the matches.

642
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,299
- Going to the launching ceremony first...
- Yes.

643
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:54,170
and then going to boxing matches
the next day was a nice itinerary.

644
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,440
Everyone in the village showed up there.

645
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,509
- Right.
- Yes.

646
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:57,539
Thank you.

647
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,640
Thank you.

648
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,779
- Thank you. Gosh.
- Thank you.

649
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,110
(Copying his moraingy moves)

650
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,350
Jab.

651
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,549
(Jabbing one last time)

652
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:07,620
You're a fighter.

653
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,420
Thank you!

654
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
- Dex.
- Yes.

655
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,259
We're pretty famous in this village now.

656
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:14,160
- Right. I'm a popular guy now.
- Yes.

657
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,660
It's definitely a small village.

658
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,059
- When there are family occasions,
- "Family occasions?"

659
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,799
- everyone somehow finds out.
- Yes.

660
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,229
- Okay. Let's go upstairs and pack up.
- Let's go upstairs.

661
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:28,910
(They come back to the lodging
with shopping bags.)

662
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:31,539
(Taking it off)

663
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,910
(Exhaling)

664
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:37,049
Is it possible
to loosen the circumference?

665
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,950
- Hey, you'll rip it.
- What are you doing?

666
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,950
(Clenching his teeth)

667
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,590
- What are you doing?
- That was small for me.

668
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,690
I wanted to stretch it.

669
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:47,420
(He's stretching the hat
with his facial muscles.)

670
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:49,489
- What's that?
- Isn't that his mouth?

671
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:50,630
The hat wants you to spare it.

672
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,930
(The merciless hat-stretching attacker)

673
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:55,799
(However, the hat doesn't get stretched.)

674
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:58,539
(Sniffling)

675
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:00,700
(The brother who's sad
to have a big head leaves.)

676
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,840
"The brother who's sad
to have a big head leaves."

677
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,110
But Kian84 doesn't have a big head
or anything.

678
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,440
- It's just my skull.
- It's not big at all.

679
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,009
- This side is big.
- No.

680
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:10,549
- It's not that you have a big head.
- Maybe, his brain is too big.

681
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,709
- The other guys have small heads.
- Right.

682
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,880
- Your face looks small on the screen.
- Yes.

683
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,690
You're one of the celebrities
who look much better in person.

684
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,319
- Right.
- Gosh, come on. Stop that.

685
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:20,920
- He likes it.
- Gosh, Seung Hoon.

686
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,360
He likes it. He's happy to hear that.

687
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,559
- He looks much better in person.
- Well, he's not wrong.

688
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,029
(Well, he's not wrong.)

689
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,729
You should be on the run because
people will try to see you in person.

690
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:31,969
(He ought to maintain
his mysterious image.)

691
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:35,840
(Meanwhile, the second-eldest brother
seems to be in a good mood.)

692
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,479
Gosh.

693
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:41,979
- Gosh.
- He's eating again?

694
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:43,549
- He's eating again?
- Wasn't the food enough?

695
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,610
(He's already eating
some of their camping food.)

696
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,249
Is this an eating show?
He keeps on eating.

697
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,950
Seriously. I didn't know I was doing that.
I ate it unknowingly.

698
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,420
Isn't that just fake hunger?

699
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,559
- Seriously.
- I didn't know I was eating that.

700
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,789
I have no recollection of eating that.

701
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,860
(Oh, no!)

702
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:59,229
(Munching on the crumbs)

703
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:00,330
That's just crazy.

704
00:25:00,729 --> 00:25:01,799
- "Pani Baguette."
- "Pani Baguette."

705
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,999
(Pani Baguette is tenacious.)

706
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:06,769
<i>Get the ointment for the legs,</i>
<i>I'll let him go</i>

707
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:08,200
- "The ointment for the legs?"
- "The ointment for the legs?"

708
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,670
That's a unique way
of revising the lyrics.

709
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,209
Dex, you're excited to be going camping.

710
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,209
I am. Today is my day.

711
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,610
(Actually, even before the trip...)

712
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,049
Gosh. What is this?

713
00:25:17,709 --> 00:25:18,979
- Look at the shape of the trees.
- How fascinating.

714
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:20,019
The baobab trees.

715
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,090
Weren't these trees in the story,
"The Little Prince?"

716
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,590
- Right.
- They were, right?

717
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,660
- They do look quite mystical.
- Yes.

718
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,289
(That's how the baobab trees ended up
on his bucket list.)

719
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:34,930
(It's camping under the baobab trees.)

720
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:38,670
(Under the star-filled Milky Way,)

721
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,069
(we can start a bonfire.)

722
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:42,969
(We can also grill meat.)

723
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:44,309
(We can do ganggangsullae together.)

724
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,610
(I thought it was really romantic.)

725
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,380
(Camping next to the baobab trees
was 1st on his bucket list.)

726
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,380
Let's only take the stuff
we need for camping.

727
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,289
We can come back tomorrow to get
the rest of our stuff after camping.

728
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,319
We had to wash up after camping
before we set out the next day.

729
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,360
We booked one more night at the lodging.

730
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:01,789
Even though you didn't sleep there.

731
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:03,930
- Should we go down now?
- Yes.

732
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,759
I'm ready.

733
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:07,299
Yes, sir.

734
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,769
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

735
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:10,670
Did Kian84 already go down?

736
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,299
- Already?
- I think he did.

737
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,769
He should have talked to us
and gone down with us.

738
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,670
Seriously. He's unstoppable.

739
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,140
(Seriously. He's unstoppable.)

740
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,709
(The unstoppable Kian84 is spotted.)

741
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:23,910
Let me tell you what happened.
So I bought this hat.

742
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:26,319
There were two strings
around the hat initially.

743
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,450
I wanted to pull them out
and put them around here.

744
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,660
- When a strand popped here,
- Hey, you ripped it.

745
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,160
- everything around it popped too.
- Right. It's a domino effect.

746
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,630
So here's what I'm going to do.

747
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,029
- I'll use this...
- Will you perform the emergency surgery?

748
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:40,459
for the emergency surgery.

749
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:42,130
Gosh. Where did you get that?

750
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,930
- I borrowed it from the reception.
- Okay.

751
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,400
They had a needle.

752
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,769
- It will work.
- Well, you know what?

753
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:49,469
I tried to look nice on this camping trip.

754
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:51,440
Kian84 is unstoppable.

755
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,380
Kian84 is sewing his hat now.

756
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,479
(Kian84 is sewing his hat now.)

757
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,350
You're quite thorough.

758
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,120
- I like sewing.
- I see.

759
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,850
That relaxes you too.

760
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,819
- So you know. Right?
- Yes.

761
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,489
I get more attached to my belongings...

762
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:06,719
- when I fix them up.
- Right.

763
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:08,729
When you fix them up, you use them longer.

764
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:10,289
- He has his own philosophy.
- You feel attached.

765
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:11,630
- You feel attached.
- Right.

766
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:14,799
This just shows that people live
in an abundance of things.

767
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:19,370
I bet everyone knows that
you don't live in an abundance of things.

768
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,340
I saw you wear this shirt in India.

769
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,910
The colors on his shirt got faded.

770
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,239
- It's been in the sun way too much.
- Gosh.

771
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,039
- The black part is fading away.
- Right.

772
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,950
In the end, I only wear the same outfits.

773
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,650
That's his favorite shirt.

774
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,120
Do you wear that
when you don't go on trips?

775
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,850
- I only wear it on trips.
- It's a shirt for traveling?

776
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,150
- That's only for traveling?
- I only wear it on important occasions.

777
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:44,059
(Every day has been important for him.)

778
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,830
(Today is important too.)

779
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:48,999
By the way, everyone in Korea...

780
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,700
ought to be a bit more like Kian84.

781
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,999
- Gosh, you make me sound so grand.
- It's just my personal opinion.

782
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:56,370
- My personal opinion.
- If you say that...

783
00:27:56,469 --> 00:27:57,640
Like the mindset of the era?

784
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,279
Back then, people used to
fix things and use them again.

785
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,279
Remember the recycling campaign?

786
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,249
Pani Bottle suddenly made
an important statement.

787
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:03,680
- This mood is getting to this.
- Yes.

788
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
Play some music.

789
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,080
The music is playing now.

790
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,279
- Well, the thing is...
<i>- Honey</i>

791
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,489
- we have...
- Dex is doing that.

792
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:11,019
<i>- Honey</i>
- everything we need.

793
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:13,559
<i>- When time passes by</i>
- But we keep wanting more things.

794
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,890
The background music is way too loud.

795
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,789
We can't be satisfied with what we have.

796
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:17,989
We can't be like this.

797
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:19,600
- The three of us are acting weird.
- All of us...

798
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,100
Were you at a high-altitude mountain?

799
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,430
(The altitude in Morondava was 0m.)

800
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:24,299
- Their chemistry definitely got deeper...
- It did.

801
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,269
- compared to before.
- They get along so well.

802
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:28,100
It feels like I'm watching a sitcom.

803
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,910
Taking a page from Kian84
once in a while...

804
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,509
<i>- Honey</i>
- isn't so bad.

805
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,880
- He must be drunk.
- That's just my personal opinion.

806
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,479
This is it.

807
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,309
<i>- Wait</i>
- Thank you.

808
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:40,279
<i>Why don't we</i>

809
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,450
<i>Try it out?</i>

810
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:44,590
<i>- Let us share some love</i>
<i>- Let us share some love</i>

811
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,890
(Let us share some love)

812
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,989
Wait. Is that song from MBC?

813
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:48,989
- It is.
- Yes.

814
00:28:48,989 --> 00:28:49,989
(It is indeed a campaign song
from MBC Radio.)

815
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:53,660
<i>Come over to my house</i>

816
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,330
- "Come over to my house."
- What's that?

817
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,729
- So...
- What kind of campaign is that?

818
00:28:56,729 --> 00:28:59,299
<i>- Come over and let us share some love</i>
- I see. So...

819
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
- What? Kian84!
- What a dirty mind!

820
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
(Hold on a second.)

821
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,469
- Why is that dirty?
- What a dirty mind!

822
00:29:04,469 --> 00:29:05,809
No. That didn't sound right.

823
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,039
You guys are living in a loveless world.

824
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,910
(Please don't get the wrong idea.)

825
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,950
Kian84 is unstoppable.

826
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,479
(Anyway, Kian84 is unstoppable.)

827
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,390
(Even when they leave
the unstoppable brother...)

828
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,860
- Gosh. Right.
- It's not easy.

829
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,860
I bet the shape keeps collapsing.

830
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,059
They waited for me to finish sewing,
though.

831
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,229
Right. This place is great.

832
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:27,529
- You don't feel the need to rush.
- Exactly.

833
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,200
Once he sets his mind to something,
he goes all the way.

834
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,239
I think I did that for 30 minutes.

835
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,269
(He's hyper-focused for 30 minutes.)

836
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,539
Gosh. Let's see.

837
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:37,870
Ta-da.

838
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,110
- Gosh.
- You're good at sewing.

839
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:41,239
- Your sewing is quite thorough.
- You were thorough with that.

840
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:43,650
- Gosh. StrawHat84.
- He has dexterous hands.

841
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,279
- Okay. Good.
- Now, you have a favorite hat.

842
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,279
(StrawHat84 is back.)

843
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:51,289
By the way, you can't go anywhere
without that pair of sunglasses.

844
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,390
You know what's crazy, though?

845
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:54,819
These are different sunglasses
from our trip to India.

846
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:56,590
- Really?
- But...

847
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,529
I only buy similar-looking sunglasses.

848
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:00,430
I used to wear this style of sunglasses
when I was in the military.

849
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,100
- Is that a common style in the military?
- Yes.

850
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,299
I like similar styles of sunglasses.

851
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:05,999
That style suits you well.

852
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:07,069
I'm glad to hear that.

853
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:08,640
- You got everything, right?
- Yes.

854
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Okay.

855
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,709
(Everyone takes their favorite item.)

856
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,739
Pani Bottle took baguettes.

857
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,580
- Let's go now.
- Okay.

858
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,479
Yes. Let's go before the sun goes down.

859
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,110
You buy this?

860
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,380
- Well...
- One?

861
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,380
Wait.

862
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,420
What's going on?

863
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,450
- Wait.
- It's 20 ariaries.

864
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,019
- It's 20 ariaries? Okay.
- What will you use that for?

865
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:24,319
We were distracted for a second.

866
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,489
She came over
and tried to sell him some stuff.

867
00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:27,890
- He's so softhearted.
- Gosh.

868
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:28,989
He's got a big heart.

869
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:30,930
- It's 20 ariaries? Okay.
- What will you use that for?

870
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,759
- To use it as a blanket.
- This is no.

871
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,160
- I see. As a blanket...
- This is...

872
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,999
I wasn't going to buy it.
But she has her daughter with her.

873
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,729
I think that's just a random kid.

874
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,499
No. I think she's the lady's daughter.

875
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
One?

876
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,969
- They do look alike.
- They look alike.

877
00:30:42,969 --> 00:30:44,440
- Right. That's her daughter.
- Yes.

878
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:45,979
- Okay? One.
- Just one?

879
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,340
Thank you very much.

880
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,479
How much was it?

881
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,709
It was 5 to 6 dollars per blanket.

882
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:52,479
- That's not a bad price.
- It was a good price.

883
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,049
(Thank you.)

884
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:56,150
- Sorry. Finished.
- So cute.

885
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:58,049
(Shy)

886
00:30:58,049 --> 00:30:59,059
A photo.

887
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,789
Make a pose. They're taking a picture.

888
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,390
- So cute.
- Wait.

889
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,759
- Right.
- Hello.

890
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,029
- Hey, where are our mangoes?
- Hello.

891
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:09,100
I should give them a mango.

892
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,299
- Wait.
- You want to give them a mango too?

893
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,729
That's our food.

894
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:13,299
"That's our food."

895
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:16,170
He wants to give some food to a kid.

896
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,840
We're kids at heart too!

897
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,209
We're still young at heart.

898
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:21,580
Well, okay. One is okay.

899
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,680
Have a mango.

900
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,950
He's kind.

901
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,680
If you eat the mango...

902
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,390
- Another merchant showed up.
- No.

903
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,450
- If you eat the mango...
- Okay.

904
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,620
That's a new design.

905
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,519
Kian84. This is enough.
Let's buy them later.

906
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:35,959
No.

907
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:38,190
- How much?
- It's 30,000.

908
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:39,830
- Twenty?
- He's asking how much it is.

909
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,029
- Kian84 is unstoppable.
- Twenty-five? That one is expensive.

910
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:44,370
Everyone in the village heard about him.

911
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:46,170
"Hey, go to this hotel."

912
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:47,940
"Show him your stuff,
and he'll buy everything."

913
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,309
Word got around already.

914
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,670
They all came to greet the big spender.

915
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:55,309
Kian84. Don't buy a lot.

916
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,850
- Okay.
- Control yourself.

917
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,779
- You won't listen to me anyway, though.
- Twenty-five.

918
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,019
Yes.

919
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:01,479
- Blue.
- For you.

920
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,489
Seriously. Kian84 is unstoppable.

921
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,749
Gosh.

922
00:32:04,749 --> 00:32:07,090
- Gosh, a sailboat merchant came too.
- Goodness. Word really got around.

923
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,989
- Gosh, a sailboat merchant came too. No.
- Goodness. Word really got around.

924
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:11,660
- No.
- Gosh. Look at this.

925
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,759
What's that now?

926
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,160
You don't need a model sailboat.

927
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,430
- A sailboat.
- Wait.

928
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,600
- You don't need that for camping.
- Please don't buy it.

929
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,769
I thought about floating the sailboat.

930
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:23,640
- Kian84. Please don't buy it.
- He's softhearted.

931
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,410
- Don't buy that.
- Don't buy it, Hee Min!

932
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,709
- Can you hear us?
- Can you hear us?

933
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:28,809
- Don't buy that!
- Don't buy that!

934
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:31,680
(Answer us, you generous spender.)

935
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,680
- Don't buy that!
- Don't buy that!

936
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,489
(Are you the guy I've been hearing about?)

937
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,719
(Don't you need a sailboat, sir?)

938
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,190
(The VIP is thinking about it.)

939
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,529
- No. Not the sailboat.
- Gosh, sorry.

940
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:46,759
(Gosh, sorry.)

941
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,029
(His ears must be burning.)

942
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:49,069
- Don't buy...
- He didn't buy it.

943
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,729
- He must have heard us.
- He heard you guys.

944
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:54,400
- We should speak loudly from now on.
- Yes. We should.

945
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,940
(Thanks for that.)

946
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,640
They should get going,

947
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,009
so they can sell more of their stuff
to other people.

948
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,450
- Sorry. Finished. Okay.
- Okay.

949
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,110
- We must be firm.
- We should be on our way now.

950
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,319
Firm Bottle.

951
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,450
- Bye.
- Bye.

952
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,590
- Bye.
- Go home.

953
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:11,719
(They finally set out
on their camping trip.)

954
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,360
To take the rickshaw...

955
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,719
- I looked up the location on the map.
- Okay.

956
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,890
- We should take the auto-rickshaw.
- Okay.

957
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:18,459
- The auto-rickshaw.
- The auto-rickshaw.

958
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:19,529
Hello.

959
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:21,999
- Baobab Avenue?
- Baobab Avenue.

960
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,029
Baobab Avenue.

961
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:24,670
It was quite far. So we couldn't take...

962
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,840
- the regular rickshaws.
- Right.

963
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,940
- You needed a car.
- We got an auto-rickshaw instead.

964
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,539
- It takes an hour.
- Really?

965
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,610
Will you go with this price?

966
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,110
(He offers 100,000 ariaries.)

967
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,979
- Yes.
- Okay? So you'll go for 100,000 ariaries?

968
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:37,709
- That's about 30 dollars.
- Okay.

969
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:38,709
That's a good price.

970
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,880
We want to come back here
tomorrow morning.

971
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:44,819
- Okay.
- Okay.

972
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:47,360
- Okay. Let's go now.
- He doesn't miss a thing.

973
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:49,360
- Good.
- Okay. Ready.

974
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,459
Charismatic Pani.

975
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,959
Gosh, this is nice.

976
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,930
Let's go.

977
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,100
- You're finally on your way...
- Let's go.

978
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,999
- to see the baobab trees.
- Yes. We're on our way at last.

979
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,870
By the way, I'm quite curious
about the baobab trees.

980
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,209
I'm looking forward to it.

981
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,209
Come to think of it,

982
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,610
this is our first tourist spot
in Madagascar.

983
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,650
Right.

984
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,910
We're finally acting like tourists.

985
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:14,150
- Right. We're tourists now.
- We're tourists now.

986
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,650
Right. It's rare to see you guys
visit a tourist spot on our show.

987
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,090
- It's their first time.
- Right.

988
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,289
- It was our 1st tourist spot.
- It was our 1st time.

989
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:20,989
But I'm sure it will be different...

990
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,489
- when the three of you guys go.
- Right.

991
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,529
Our first tourist spot.

992
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,200
(They're going to a famous tourist spot
on Day 5 of their trip.)

993
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,069
It takes an hour on an auto-rickshaw.

994
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,600
- An hour? This is nice.
- Yes.

995
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,400
It's 21km away.

996
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,640
(The road to the Baobab Avenue)

997
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,670
(Cars)

998
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,809
(Cycle rickshaws,
also known as pousse-pousse,)

999
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:38,809
- Some people go there on cycle rickshaws.
- Gosh, on cycle rickshaws?

1000
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,739
There's a variety of ways to get there.

1001
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,880
Even when people go to the same spot,
different things appeal to them.

1002
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,019
- Of course. It depends on the travelers.
- Yes.

1003
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,479
See? It's not that fast.

1004
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,350
The speed is capped
at 20 to 30km per hour.

1005
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,390
It's nicer this way.
We get some fresh air.

1006
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,920
- Yes. This is nice.
- It's nice and cool.

1007
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:56,430
This is actually better.

1008
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,959
I see. We just passed the market.
This is the village.

1009
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:02,160
(They enter the neighboring village
past the market.)

1010
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,330
Hey, that's an ox cart.

1011
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:07,069
- It has two oxen.
- Gosh.

1012
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:08,969
- No, there are 4 oxen.
- There are 4 oxen.

1013
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,370
Gosh, look at the horns.

1014
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,680
That's crazy.

1015
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:14,410
(The oxen seem very strong
based on the humongous horns.)

1016
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,910
- The horns.
- They look so cool.

1017
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,110
Gosh, the oxen here look interesting.

1018
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:20,219
I wonder if that's a unique species
to Madagascar.

1019
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:24,219
They are known
as the symbol of Madagascar.

1020
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,120
- The name of their species is zebu.
- Zebu.

1021
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,759
The big horns and humps on their backs
are their distinctive features.

1022
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:30,890
They are found in all over Asia
and Africa.

1023
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,399
They are easily spotted
especially in Madagascar.

1024
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,660
As rice is the staple in Madagascar,

1025
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,370
they are used for farming...

1026
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:41,000
and as a means of transportation
to move people and heavy items.

1027
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,370
They play a vital role
in the day-to-day lives of the locals.

1028
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:45,609
Zebu.

1029
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,410
The horns are really cool.

1030
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,480
(They pass by the zebu cart.)

1031
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:51,779
(They're going out
of the city center now.)

1032
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:55,120
It feels like we're going into nature now.
Into the jungle.

1033
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:59,660
Gosh. At last.
It's the symbol of Madagascar,

1034
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:00,989
the baobab trees.

1035
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,660
We're on our way to see the trees.

1036
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,089
(Feeling uncomfortable)

1037
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:05,759
At this rate, you might end up kissing...

1038
00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:06,899
the viewers.

1039
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,399
Together...

1040
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,640
If you do that, they'll only see...

1041
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,770
- your nose.
- What?

1042
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,169
(They'll only see your nose.)

1043
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,640
I wanted you to get some sleep.

1044
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,839
I thought if I talked loudly,
you wouldn't be able to sleep.

1045
00:36:18,939 --> 00:36:21,180
- How sweet of you.
- So sweet.

1046
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,009
You weren't considerate of the viewers,
though.

1047
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:24,480
(You weren't considerate of the viewers,
though.)

1048
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,580
- You only thought about these two guys.
- That's a new way of seeing it.

1049
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,450
- You chose them over the viewers.
- I couldn't be considerate of everyone.

1050
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:31,520
- Right.
- "Just watch it."

1051
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,560
(Doing his impression)

1052
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,460
I shoved up my mouth
to the viewers all over Korea.

1053
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,330
I guess it starts here.

1054
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,100
- What do you see?
- The sign for baobab trees.

1055
00:36:42,529 --> 00:36:44,330
- There was a sign.
- There was a sign.

1056
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,569
We have reached the three-fifths mark.

1057
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,500
The three-fifths mark.

1058
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:51,609
(Reaching)

1059
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,140
- Oh, no. Is it uncomfortable?
- What's wrong?

1060
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,080
Gosh. The path isn't paved.

1061
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:58,480
The path here is pretty bumpy.

1062
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,549
That unpaved path
was the only way to get there.

1063
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,890
(Getting closer
to the scenery of Mother Nature)

1064
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,020
- Gosh. What a view.
- That's a great view.

1065
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,259
- Gosh.
- I love the view.

1066
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,460
Gosh. Look at the kids. They're swimming.

1067
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,460
(Diving into the embrace
of the wilderness)

1068
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,930
When we were kids, we used to
swim in the streams like that too.

1069
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,930
Right.

1070
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:16,299
Look at the cultivator.

1071
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,299
Is this "Mad Max?"

1072
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,439
By default, they load as much as they can.

1073
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,540
(Even the cultivator seems wild.)

1074
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,109
Wait. There must be a place
related to Korea or something.

1075
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,439
- What?
- What's that?

1076
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,810
- What? It's our national flag.
- What's that?

1077
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,549
- I saw our national flag there.
- Is that an embassy? What is it?

1078
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:31,810
"Dreaming Library."

1079
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,450
(Dreaming Library)

1080
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:37,120
I guess someone from Korea
must have built a library here.

1081
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,919
- Gosh. It's so nice to see that.
- That's incredible.

1082
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:41,919
(They're happy to see Korean
on the other side of the world.)

1083
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,330
I see a herd of cows.

1084
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,960
Gosh. Dex, it's a herd of cows.

1085
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,700
Gosh, the way they're walking toward us...

1086
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,569
reminds me of the movie
that's set in Busan. What is it called?

1087
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,270
In Busan?

1088
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,969
<i>- I heard it through the grapevine</i>
<i>- I heard it through the grapevine</i>

1089
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:55,569
- That's the movie. Yes.
- "Nameless Gangster."

1090
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:56,969
"Nameless Gangster."

1091
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,140
Gosh. The soundtrack is playing.

1092
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,210
- We should muster up our confidence too.
- "Nameless Cows."

1093
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,210
- "Nameless Cows."
- "Nameless Cows."

1094
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:03,879
Let's go.

1095
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:05,350
Let's go.

1096
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,819
But if you upset them...

1097
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,819
If the cow gets upset, we're doomed.

1098
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:13,560
(Singing)

1099
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,560
Woo? My goodness.

1100
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:17,660
Make a way.

1101
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,200
Make a way.

1102
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,430
I'm glad the cows are kind.

1103
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,700
- He's kind.
- Yes.

1104
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,410
- The calf is cute.
- Oh, a baby.

1105
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:34,580
(Patting)

1106
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,980
- Goodness.
- A touch.

1107
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,509
(A nice pat for making a way)

1108
00:38:38,509 --> 00:38:41,379
It's like a wild safari.

1109
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:48,189
(Going into the wild
after saying bye to cattle)

1110
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,430
Oh, look.

1111
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,160
It's baobab.

1112
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,759
- Do you see it?
- Already?

1113
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,000
- Do you see it?
- The biggest one.

1114
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,770
It's the biggest tree.

1115
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,600
How can a tree look like that?

1116
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,939
(The baobab tree finally reveals itself.)

1117
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:04,770
That was the first baobab tree.

1118
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,969
It's plump.

1119
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:07,680
That fractal structure.

1120
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:08,879
It really is big.

1121
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:10,779
My goodness.

1122
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:14,350
Even if a strong cyclone comes,

1123
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,549
that would never get rooted out.

1124
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:17,620
What's that?

1125
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,259
Hey. My goodness.

1126
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:22,489
My goodness.

1127
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,629
You said you didn't like
tourist attractions.

1128
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:26,259
You said you wouldn't go to famous places.

1129
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:27,960
- You're a natural tourist.
- I know.

1130
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,270
It was a tourist attraction for a reason.

1131
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:32,270
- There was a reason.
- There was a reason.

1132
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,870
The whole world goes there to see it.

1133
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,700
- Yes.
- You should go to tourist attractions.

1134
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,770
(After traveling 3 times)

1135
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:38,739
- Look at him.
- Look at his face. He's amazed.

1136
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:40,210
- He's so happy.
- Yes.

1137
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,180
He's like a human that found
the fire for the first time.

1138
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,980
Oh, my gosh. It's so big.

1139
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,419
It's huge.

1140
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:50,290
The deeper we go in, the bigger they get.

1141
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,790
My goodness.

1142
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,620
It looks heavy. My gosh.

1143
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,629
It looks like a radish.

1144
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,960
It also looks like a pine mushroom.

1145
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:01,759
Average baobab tree stems...

1146
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:04,000
contains approximately 100,000L of water.

1147
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:06,299
(It's also called a bottle tree.)

1148
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:07,669
- Bottle tree?
- I didn't know that.

1149
00:40:07,669 --> 00:40:10,169
- Pani Bottle's in everything.
- I know.

1150
00:40:10,669 --> 00:40:11,870
Amazing.

1151
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:15,180
I was curious since the plane...

1152
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,279
because even high in the air,

1153
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,549
they were different from other trees.

1154
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:22,620
They looked like buildings.

1155
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:25,149
They looked magnificent.

1156
00:40:25,149 --> 00:40:27,890
(They look even more
magnificent close up.)

1157
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:32,560
They'd look pretty on the streets
in Korea.

1158
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,200
- No.
- Amazing.

1159
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,299
The branches pointing toward the sky...

1160
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:41,370
look like roots
that people called baobab trees...

1161
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:45,009
trees that the deity planted
upside down by mistake.

1162
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:48,810
They live between 1,500 years
to 3,000 years.

1163
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:53,080
They outlive most of the organisms
on earth.

1164
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:55,480
That's wonderful.
They must be a few hundred years old.

1165
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,520
I know.

1166
00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:01,290
Is it Sengui Baekdaeri?

1167
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,660
- Saint-Exupery.
- Saint-Exupery.

1168
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,730
Sengui Baekdaeri?

1169
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,529
(Saint-Exupery:
Author of "The Little Prince")

1170
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:08,500
- Sengui Baekdaeri?
- Sengui Baekdaeri?

1171
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,399
- Yes.
- Baekdaeri.

1172
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,169
Baekdaeri that looks like a mouse.

1173
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,540
They're two different things.

1174
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,299
- In his...
- Baekdaeri.

1175
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:16,910
- Sengui battery.
- world famous novel.

1176
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,339
It's the tree from "The Little Prince."

1177
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:20,640
(He wanted to join the conversation
on baobab trees.)

1178
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,239
I'm jealous of his brain.

1179
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:25,009
- Me too.
- How did you come up with that?

1180
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:28,549
Because this country's
staple food is rice,

1181
00:41:28,549 --> 00:41:30,950
- it's all rice farms.
- Yes.

1182
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,319
I see cows.

1183
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,989
(Farms, cows...)

1184
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:35,089
(and baobab trees)

1185
00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:37,089
This is really amazing.

1186
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:39,529
- We're familiar with it.
- Yes.

1187
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:40,859
- That scene.
- It looks like countryside.

1188
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:42,660
Yet, it's exotic.

1189
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,370
Hello.

1190
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:48,500
- Ola. Salama.
- Salama.

1191
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,069
Salama.

1192
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,169
- I'm Korea.
- Goodness.

1193
00:41:52,169 --> 00:41:53,810
- I'm Korea.
- "I'm Korea."

1194
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,839
The man who built the library.

1195
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,109
I'm from the same country.

1196
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,020
You're speaking Korean
in a foreign accent.

1197
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:05,750
- The goats are cute.
- Goodness.

1198
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,290
That goat is pooping.

1199
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,660
A pooping goat.

1200
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,029
(Mingling with nature)

1201
00:42:14,029 --> 00:42:17,770
They'd have a lot of tourists,
but the road wasn't paved.

1202
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,029
(The touch of a straight unpaved road)

1203
00:42:19,669 --> 00:42:22,469
It's amazing enough to watch it.

1204
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:23,669
- I'd be so happy to camp there.
- It'd be so nice.

1205
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,839
Ola.

1206
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:27,879
- Salama.
- Salama.

1207
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,779
- Salama.
- Salama.

1208
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:31,350
(They may not be fluent,
yet they still say hi.)

1209
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,379
They're cute.

1210
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,120
They all said hi back at us.

1211
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:37,250
- Yes, and they always look happy.
- Yes.

1212
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,560
(The road to Baobab Avenue is exciting.)

1213
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:41,790
Gosh.

1214
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,189
I'm surprised to see the baobab trees.

1215
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:46,660
- I was overwhelmed.
- He's finally down to earth.

1216
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,430
We need to...

1217
00:42:48,629 --> 00:42:50,430
- Keep going.
- Yes, to the place...

1218
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,669
like Garosu-gil.

1219
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,200
Don't be surprised yet.

1220
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,739
(You may look forward to it.)

1221
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:59,239
(Looking forward)

1222
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:02,339
They're big. The twins.

1223
00:43:03,379 --> 00:43:04,910
(Twin baobab trees)

1224
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,450
They're overwhelming.

1225
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:09,149
There are two.

1226
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:11,120
Oh, it's 1 split into 2.

1227
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,149
(Two baobab trees growing
from the same root)

1228
00:43:12,149 --> 00:43:13,859
- It's split into two. They're twins.
- They split.

1229
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:16,759
They all looked different.

1230
00:43:17,189 --> 00:43:20,299
It's as wide as a building.

1231
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,200
Baobab trees...

1232
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,799
grow up to 98ft which is 30m.

1233
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:28,439
- I see.
- That's as high as 11th floor.

1234
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,410
There are leaves...

1235
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,980
Wait, is that a leaf or a bird's nest?

1236
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,210
Are those leaves enough...

1237
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,609
to photosynthesize this size?

1238
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,080
Baobab trees can photosynthesize...

1239
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,419
with stems instead of leaves.

1240
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,850
(Surprised)

1241
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,689
(He can't take his eyes off.)

1242
00:43:46,689 --> 00:43:48,759
You love baobab trees, don't you?

1243
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,259
That looks like a cow carriage.

1244
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:54,930
(Pani Bottle spots a cow carriage ahead.)

1245
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,500
There are no horses here.

1246
00:43:56,669 --> 00:43:58,200
Right. I haven't seen horses.

1247
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Do you want to ride the cow carriage?

1248
00:44:00,299 --> 00:44:01,399
- The cow carriage?
- Yes.

1249
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:04,609
- Can we?
- I want to try.

1250
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:06,879
We were almost there.

1251
00:44:06,879 --> 00:44:08,910
- It's slow, but I still wanted to try it.
- Yes.

1252
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,950
After seeing the locals riding it.

1253
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,980
(The travel expert has to try everything
that amazes him.)

1254
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,180
- I'll go ask if we can ride it.
- Sure.

1255
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,819
- There are children on it.
- Wait.

1256
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:18,020
Okay. Stop here.

1257
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:21,859
(They hop off from the tuk-tuk.)

1258
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,290
- Pay for it. I'll go ask them.
- Stay.

1259
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,759
- Salama.
- Salama.

1260
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:28,799
(Amazed)

1261
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,870
Is there enough space?

1262
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,129
Can you give us a ride to Baobab Avenue?

1263
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,069
Three people?

1264
00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:35,899
It's 10,000.

1265
00:44:35,899 --> 00:44:37,210
- It's 10,000?
- Yes.

1266
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,839
They give a ride to tourists.

1267
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:40,910
Nice.

1268
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,250
Okay. One moment.

1269
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,250
- Let's ride it.
- How much is it?

1270
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,520
It's 10,000.

1271
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:49,020
- Sure.
- Let's pay him.

1272
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,919
- Tomorrow at 7 a.m. in the morning.
- At 7 a.m.?

1273
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,759
In the morning on Baobab Avenue.

1274
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:55,259
Baobab Avenue. Okay.

1275
00:44:57,189 --> 00:44:59,460
The cows.

1276
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,230
Kian84 loves cows.

1277
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,469
Gosh.

1278
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,270
(Rummaging)

1279
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:08,399
(The mango he bought earlier)

1280
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:10,969
- Do cows eat this?
- For the cow?

1281
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:12,009
Do you want to try it?

1282
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,609
They have no pleasure in life.
I should at least give him that.

1283
00:45:14,609 --> 00:45:15,609
"Pleasure in life."

1284
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,879
(Licking)

1285
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:20,750
(Good boy)

1286
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,319
- Kian84 is so nice to animals.
- Right.

1287
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:24,850
He feeds every animal he sees.

1288
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,020
(He shared fruits with the elephant
in India.)

1289
00:45:26,919 --> 00:45:29,259
(Warmhearted84)

1290
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,230
Bite.

1291
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:32,529
You don't want it?

1292
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:33,859
(His love landed in Madagascar too.)

1293
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:35,859
Do you want it?

1294
00:45:38,629 --> 00:45:39,700
Mango.

1295
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,339
Let's go. He's feeding them a mango.

1296
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:46,069
They won't eat.

1297
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:47,910
They won't eat with the skin on.

1298
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,779
You're shy, aren't you?

1299
00:45:50,609 --> 00:45:53,319
(Disappointed)

1300
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,819
Wait. What did you do with the mango?

1301
00:45:55,149 --> 00:45:56,620
That one? We ate it.

1302
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,819
I cleaned it.

1303
00:46:00,259 --> 00:46:01,290
How did you clean...

1304
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,660
I'll clean it before eating.

1305
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,930
(I'll clean it before eating.)

1306
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:06,330
(He finally learns the truth.)

1307
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,529
- Do you call that cleaning?
- But...

1308
00:46:08,529 --> 00:46:10,770
I don't know who ate it.

1309
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:12,799
- I don't know who ate it.
- You look angry.

1310
00:46:12,799 --> 00:46:14,200
You should've told me.

1311
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:16,000
- If I told you, you wouldn't eat it.
- Why...

1312
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,140
Why do you make me check
through the video?

1313
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,810
(Kian84 was being considerate
to keep Pani Bottle's appetite.)

1314
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:21,080
Why did you put sand on food?

1315
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,680
I had to wipe the spit.

1316
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,080
That's hilarious.

1317
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,149
(Wipe the spit on the mango with sand.)

1318
00:46:26,149 --> 00:46:28,580
I guess they prefer chaff.
They won't eat it.

1319
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,680
(Back in the bag)

1320
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,020
- He kept it.
- I had no idea.

1321
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:34,960
(Without a clue,
they get on the cow carriage.)

1322
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,160
This is just a carriage.

1323
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,230
- Hello. Salama.
- Salama.

1324
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,600
(Shy)

1325
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,200
(After cleaning the mango,)

1326
00:46:45,629 --> 00:46:48,140
(he communes with the cow again.)

1327
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,469
(Thinking)

1328
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,609
We're ready.

1329
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:53,779
- Okay. Let's go.
- You should sit in front.

1330
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:55,580
I'll run.

1331
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:56,750
- What?
- Why?

1332
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,009
I think it'll be the same as walking.

1333
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,450
They were as slow as walking.
I wanted to walk.

1334
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,089
- Suit yourself.
- Let's go.

1335
00:47:04,149 --> 00:47:05,719
- I think running will be faster.
- Right.

1336
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,759
Okay. Let's go.

1337
00:47:08,919 --> 00:47:10,529
(Off they go.)

1338
00:47:13,259 --> 00:47:14,629
I feel a bit bad for them.

1339
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,069
Sorry. I'm sorry...

1340
00:47:17,529 --> 00:47:19,500
- for taking up space.
- Gosh, she's pretty.

1341
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,600
She's smiling.

1342
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:22,969
She's smiling.

1343
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:25,339
(With her silent permission,
they start off in a friendly atmosphere.)

1344
00:47:26,169 --> 00:47:28,540
(They ride in silence
just in case the kids get scared.)

1345
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,279
(Touching)

1346
00:47:30,279 --> 00:47:31,750
She's amazed.

1347
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,620
You're hurt.

1348
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:35,879
You have a wound here.

1349
00:47:35,879 --> 00:47:37,120
Mr. Popular is back at it again.

1350
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:39,890
- He's getting started.
- Gosh, he's popular there too.

1351
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:43,089
Men and women of all ages
smile widely like that...

1352
00:47:43,089 --> 00:47:45,390
when they see Dex. Even little kids.

1353
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:47,129
She's so adorable.

1354
00:47:47,129 --> 00:47:48,830
She's so cute. Look at her smile.

1355
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,700
- Camera.
- Camera.

1356
00:47:55,399 --> 00:47:56,500
(Cheese)

1357
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,969
- They're adorable.
- Camera.

1358
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,710
(Meanwhile,
Kian84 was going to walk but...)

1359
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:06,279
(There is a crowd.)

1360
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,020
- Hi.
- "Hi."

1361
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,649
- Hi.
- "Hi."

1362
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,419
How are you?

1363
00:48:12,419 --> 00:48:14,120
"How are you?" Fine. I'm fine.

1364
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,759
I'm fine. Thank you.

1365
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:18,589
They were trying to catch birds
with slingshots.

1366
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,930
- I'm.
- "I'm."

1367
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,560
- From Korea.
- "Korea."

1368
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,600
(Korea?)

1369
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,669
That library.

1370
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:25,799
"That library."

1371
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:26,939
That library.

1372
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,140
"That library."

1373
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,140
They're so good at imitating you.

1374
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,109
- I'm from.
- "I'm from."

1375
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,069
- The country.
- "The country."

1376
00:48:33,069 --> 00:48:35,080
- That built it.
- "That built it."

1377
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,680
- Yesterday,
- "Yesterday,"

1378
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,810
- I fought.
- "I fought."

1379
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:40,520
- And lost.
- "And lost."

1380
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,549
(Laughing)

1381
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,989
Why did you tell them that?

1382
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:46,989
It was still on your mind.

1383
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:48,359
- Yes.
- Right.

1384
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:51,390
(The aftertaste of defeat still lingers.)

1385
00:48:52,189 --> 00:48:54,230
(Forget about it.)

1386
00:48:54,529 --> 00:48:56,160
Adventure by Accident.

1387
00:48:57,299 --> 00:48:58,469
Adventure by.

1388
00:48:58,469 --> 00:48:59,939
- "Adventure by."
- "Adventure by."

1389
00:48:59,939 --> 00:49:01,200
Accident.

1390
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,600
- "Accident."
- "Accident."

1391
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:04,310
(This student is particularly excited.)

1392
00:49:04,669 --> 00:49:05,939
Watch the original broadcast.

1393
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,339
- "Watch the original broadcast."
- "Watch the original broadcast."

1394
00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:08,480
They're imitating him well.

1395
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,379
Please.

1396
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:11,850
- "Please."
- "Please."

1397
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,680
He's excited.

1398
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,879
MBC.

1399
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,450
- "MBC."
- "MBC."

1400
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:19,719
- FM. No, wait.
- "FM."

1401
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:21,660
- That's the radio.
- "That's the radio."

1402
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,560
MBC cul...

1403
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,390
- "MBC cul..."
- "MBC cul..."

1404
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,259
- Ture broadcasting.
- "Ture broadcasting."

1405
00:49:29,529 --> 00:49:31,669
(Make some noise.)

1406
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,899
(Adventure by)

1407
00:49:33,899 --> 00:49:35,000
(Adventure by Accident)

1408
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,239
(Adventure by Accident,
Watch the original broadcast.)

1409
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,310
(The creation of such an innocent
promotional video)

1410
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,509
This was such an innocent way
to promote the show.

1411
00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:44,080
- Right.
- Bye-bye.

1412
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,879
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1413
00:49:46,879 --> 00:49:48,680
Say goodbye.

1414
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,919
Bye. Thumbs up.

1415
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:53,020
(The first son of MBC
leaves in satisfaction.)

1416
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,290
"The son of MBC."

1417
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,589
(Returning in glory)

1418
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,930
The man...

1419
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:07,169
treasures his cow.

1420
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,899
Do you see? He touches it affectionately.

1421
00:50:09,899 --> 00:50:10,939
(Petting)

1422
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,879
(I feel good.)

1423
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:16,879
Goodness, the cow is...

1424
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,680
- Good grief!
- What happened?

1425
00:50:18,879 --> 00:50:20,549
- Good grief!
- Again?

1426
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,980
Gosh, I got spattered with dung.

1427
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,919
The cow excreted while it was walking,
and it got on its tail...

1428
00:50:27,919 --> 00:50:28,960
Oh, my gosh.

1429
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,960
<i>The connection between you and dung</i>

1430
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:36,830
Gosh. The cow pooped. Look.

1431
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,899
When I was in India,
I stepped on cow dung.

1432
00:50:40,899 --> 00:50:42,899
But this time, it directly got on my skin.

1433
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,410
It's getting closer to you each time.

1434
00:50:44,739 --> 00:50:46,839
But rather than feeling gross,

1435
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:50,509
it feels like a unique experience.

1436
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,319
(He cleans the cow dung off with soil
like he cleaned the mango.)

1437
00:50:57,089 --> 00:50:59,819
Life is hard for both cows and humans.

1438
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,930
I thought we were almost there,
but it's actually quite far away.

1439
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:08,399
(Thinking)

1440
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,569
I'm going to peel a mango
for the kids to eat.

1441
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:12,129
(Mango?)

1442
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:15,270
The apple mango is nice and ripe.

1443
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,140
Do you like it?

1444
00:51:18,169 --> 00:51:19,169
Mango?

1445
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,739
That was a clean one.

1446
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,509
Gosh, it's ripe.

1447
00:51:23,509 --> 00:51:24,609
(The ripeness of the mango
is mouth-watering.)

1448
00:51:24,609 --> 00:51:25,910
That looks so delicious.

1449
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,049
(Licking his lips)

1450
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,290
(Cutting it up into bite-sized pieces)

1451
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:33,819
(Here you go.)

1452
00:51:39,089 --> 00:51:42,000
(Let's share.)

1453
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,270
Gosh, the kids are sharing it.

1454
00:51:45,129 --> 00:51:47,000
- They're so nice.
- It's not like we told them to,

1455
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,969
but they split it in half on their own.

1456
00:51:50,469 --> 00:51:52,040
She shared exactly half.

1457
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:54,140
(With her tiny hands...)

1458
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,379
(Eating)

1459
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:56,379
She's adorable.

1460
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:57,450
(Laughing)

1461
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,149
She's so cute.

1462
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:00,950
How are they so nice?

1463
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,689
I'm glad they're enjoying it.

1464
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:06,589
(He's sharing mangos
with the front cart too.)

1465
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:08,319
Driver, do you want one?

1466
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:09,759
(Thank you.)

1467
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:10,790
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1468
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,489
You?

1469
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,200
Do you want one?

1470
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,299
That one's sleeping.

1471
00:52:16,899 --> 00:52:19,029
Here.

1472
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,899
(Wake up.)

1473
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:22,399
He's nice.

1474
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:23,810
He wants to sleep.

1475
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,339
Have one each.

1476
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,980
(A heartwarming scene
of mangos being shared)

1477
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,580
- He shared all the mangos.
- Right.

1478
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:33,620
She enjoyed it a lot.
She's already finished with it.

1479
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,149
(She's even sucking on the peel.)

1480
00:52:36,149 --> 00:52:37,149
She's so cute.

1481
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:40,759
She gave her the peel.

1482
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:42,819
(The peel's delicious too.)

1483
00:52:42,819 --> 00:52:43,930
For her to suck on.

1484
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:48,029
There is beauty in going slow.

1485
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,169
(Uncle Dex is trying to cut up
the remaining mango for them.)

1486
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:53,739
Cutting it up on this moving cart
won't be easy.

1487
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,370
He's fully focused on it.

1488
00:52:57,609 --> 00:52:58,939
(This time,
he even cut the peel nicely too)

1489
00:52:58,939 --> 00:53:00,710
You cut the peel for them too?

1490
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,180
- Gosh.
- That was sweet of you.

1491
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,750
He did it because the kids lick the peel.

1492
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,379
Share that too.

1493
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,020
(Taking a big bite)

1494
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,919
Grab onto the whole thing and take a bite
out of it as if you're eating ribs.

1495
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:16,560
That's how you should eat it. That's it.

1496
00:53:17,259 --> 00:53:18,259
(Here!)

1497
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:19,890
- They're each taking a bite.
- They're each taking a bite.

1498
00:53:20,899 --> 00:53:22,500
(This time they're each taking a bite
and passing it to the other to be fair.)

1499
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,529
I'm pretty sure that
mangos aren't rare here.

1500
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:26,600
(This time they're each taking a bite
and passing it to the other to be fair.)

1501
00:53:27,399 --> 00:53:28,799
They're really taking a bite each.

1502
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:30,509
- Right.
- They're so adorable.

1503
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:32,239
They were so nice that
I wanted to do more for them.

1504
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:33,640
- One bite each.
- This makes me feel good.

1505
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,040
- How cute.
- Right.

1506
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:36,580
They're so cute.

1507
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,009
We would've fought for more
back in our day.

1508
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:41,520
- Right.
- That video's such a rare moment.

1509
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,149
- They're so nice.
- Yes.

1510
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:44,549
That's not easy to do.

1511
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:45,589
(He can't help but smile.)

1512
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:46,890
They're enjoying it so much.

1513
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,960
(He can't help but smile.)

1514
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:49,489
Gosh, did they finish an entire mango?

1515
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,689
Yes, they liked it a lot.

1516
00:53:51,689 --> 00:53:52,689
(Laughing)

1517
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,299
Come here. Let's wipe your mouth.

1518
00:53:55,629 --> 00:53:57,299
They finished it.
They didn't even make any mess.

1519
00:53:57,299 --> 00:53:58,330
Goodness.

1520
00:53:58,330 --> 00:53:59,770
He's so kind.

1521
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:02,839
It's beautiful.

1522
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,439
Give me your hand.

1523
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,480
Watching them eat...

1524
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,980
made me hungry.

1525
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:11,450
Oh, dear.

1526
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:13,080
(Again?)

1527
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,450
- Already?
- Here we go again.

1528
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:18,020
He has a reason now. "Watching them eat."

1529
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,919
I needed an excuse.

1530
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:22,189
Didn't you already have three baguettes?

1531
00:54:22,189 --> 00:54:23,359
That must not have been enough.

1532
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,560
I'm going to have to get off quickly...

1533
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,859
and eat those baguettes in my bag.

1534
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:32,169
He has to have a baguette in his mouth.

1535
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:34,939
Go ahead. Okay.

1536
00:54:37,939 --> 00:54:40,169
- Are you okay with running?
- Yes, it's worth walking.

1537
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:42,980
Riding in the cart is...

1538
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,049
Is it nice?

1539
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:45,779
No.

1540
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:47,419
Your butt must have hurt.

1541
00:54:47,419 --> 00:54:49,779
I could feel the state of the ground
as it is.

1542
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:53,149
We're going slowly
since they're not horses.

1543
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:55,060
It's not bad.

1544
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,460
(While going at a slow pace,)

1545
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:02,029
(they get to see the scenery.)

1546
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:07,640
Gosh, this is...

1547
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,770
Don't talk about Yeoju.

1548
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,969
exactly like my relative's house.

1549
00:55:12,339 --> 00:55:14,239
(He brought up Yeoju again.)

1550
00:55:15,339 --> 00:55:19,279
(That's how simple but friendly
their lives seem.)

1551
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,649
(Hi.)

1552
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:28,689
Hello.

1553
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,089
- Salama.
- Salama.

1554
00:55:31,089 --> 00:55:32,230
- Salama.
- Salama.

1555
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,529
The purpose of traveling...

1556
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,000
isn't about getting somewhere quickly.

1557
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,969
(He spoke some wise words.)

1558
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:42,140
- Salama.
- Salama.

1559
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:44,609
(Welcome, stranger.)

1560
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:45,739
They're all so welcoming.

1561
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,839
People and soil,

1562
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,480
animals, trees.

1563
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,319
It's like Earth itself.

1564
00:55:57,689 --> 00:56:00,219
Our way there was interesting.

1565
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,919
There were cars full of people,

1566
00:56:02,919 --> 00:56:06,460
and it felt like the locals lived...

1567
00:56:07,129 --> 00:56:08,600
in a different world from me.

1568
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,430
That's what we travel for.

1569
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:14,069
Not the same things
we experience every day.

1570
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,469
I really like seeing how the locals live.

1571
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:19,910
Life is an adventure.

1572
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,980
(As always, life is an adventure.)

1573
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,250
Getting somewhere quickly
isn't the purpose of traveling.

1574
00:56:24,609 --> 00:56:27,480
We can see this
because we're walking slowly.

1575
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,850
(They think about the meaning of travel
while going slowly.)

1576
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,419
What?

1577
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:33,219
That must be it.

1578
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,620
Are they there?

1579
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,660
(Their destination starts
to come into view.)

1580
00:56:36,589 --> 00:56:39,759
It started to look
like an alley of baobab trees.

1581
00:56:39,989 --> 00:56:41,560
(Let me see.)

1582
00:56:42,029 --> 00:56:43,129
I see them now.

1583
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:45,029
- Finally.
- That's Baobab Avenue.

1584
00:56:45,029 --> 00:56:46,799
- Goodness.
- At last.

1585
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:47,799
(We're here.)

1586
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:49,140
(Wake up.)

1587
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:50,410
We're here now.

1588
00:56:54,509 --> 00:56:55,540
Oh, dear.

1589
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:05,219
(The best baobab tree place...)

1590
00:57:06,219 --> 00:57:09,460
(finally starts to come into sight.)

1591
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,930
- Gosh.
- They're lining the road.

1592
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,100
- Oh, dear. Look at the size.
- Oh, my.

1593
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:20,669
(The world's largest sanctuary
of baobabs...)

1594
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:24,969
(preserving the passage
of thousands of years)

1595
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,049
(This is...)

1596
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,750
(where the ever-changing beauty
of nature unfolds.)

1597
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:42,419
(Baobab Avenue)

1598
00:57:42,419 --> 00:57:44,730
They're not buildings or trees.

1599
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:45,790
It looks surreal.

1600
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:48,000
Even though they're there,
they wouldn't believe it.

1601
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,060
(Exclaiming)

1602
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:53,870
Oh, my.

1603
00:57:55,799 --> 00:57:57,310
(Always buzzing with tourists)

1604
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,339
That's amazing.

1605
00:57:59,439 --> 00:58:02,580
(The pride and symbol of Madagascar)

1606
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,379
Here it comes.

1607
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,419
- It's cool.
- Oh, dear.

1608
00:58:11,419 --> 00:58:13,250
(They can do nothing but exclaim.)

1609
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,989
- My gosh.
- This is it.

1610
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:18,629
Seeing those baobab trees all lined up...

1611
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:20,160
gave me an overwhelming feeling.

1612
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:23,460
It looks so cool.

1613
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,469
(They can't take their eyes
off the magnificence.)

1614
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:25,770
It looks stunning.

1615
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,870
The trees can easily be 30 to 40m.

1616
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:32,310
- Oh, dear.
- Goodness.

1617
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,239
It's a tourist attraction for a reason.

1618
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,609
It's impressive.

1619
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,680
This must be the place
where the most baobab trees have gathered.

1620
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,020
- Here?
- Yes.

1621
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,350
- It looked like a different planet.
- Right.

1622
00:58:46,919 --> 00:58:49,460
There are nine species of baobab trees,

1623
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,460
but six of them are so rare
they can only be found in Madagascar.

1624
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,899
That's why tourists gather here
from all around the world.

1625
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:57,600
- All tourists go there to see them.
- Yes.

1626
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,770
(He's one of them.)

1627
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:00,469
- Goodness. They're huge.
- Pani Bottle.

1628
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:02,270
This looks like the main spot.

1629
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,310
- Here? Okay. Stop.
- Yes. You should get off.

1630
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,540
(They get off on Baobab Avenue.)

1631
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,310
(It's time to say goodbye to the kids.)

1632
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,379
(I get off here.)

1633
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,750
How much is it?

1634
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,919
- It's 10,000 ariaries each.
- It's 10,000?

1635
00:59:16,919 --> 00:59:19,020
(Zebu cart, 20,000 ariaries in total,
about 7 dollars)

1636
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,219
- Bye.
- Bye.

1637
00:59:21,319 --> 00:59:23,060
- Bye.
- Bye.

1638
00:59:24,129 --> 00:59:25,189
Stay healthy.

1639
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:27,730
Right. This is where it starts.

1640
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,200
(Oh, dear)

1641
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,600
This is it.

1642
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,000
This is exactly what I saw.

1643
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,600
- This view?
- Yes.

1644
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,770
(The baobab trees are towering
majestically.)

1645
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:39,239
- They're indeed huge.
- This is incredible.

1646
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:43,609
This is exactly the view I saw
on the internet.

1647
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:46,379
As soon as I arrived on Baobab Avenue,

1648
00:59:46,379 --> 00:59:49,219
the view opened up like magic.

1649
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,819
(They guard the vast plains
of Madagascar.)

1650
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:52,149
It looks so cool.

1651
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,359
It must be amazing to be there
in the forest.

1652
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,560
Even the pond looks nice.

1653
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,890
Seeing a cute lake...

1654
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,660
and the baobab trees,

1655
01:00:00,859 --> 01:00:03,600
I thought, "This is what I wanted."

1656
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,629
- Gosh. It looks gorgeous.
- It's cool.

1657
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:08,640
This is the baobab zone.

1658
01:00:08,899 --> 01:00:11,169
This place feels surreal.

1659
01:00:11,169 --> 01:00:12,569
It's amazing.

1660
01:00:12,569 --> 01:00:14,910
As the land separated,

1661
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:18,009
they have lived here
for hundreds of millions of years, right?

1662
01:00:18,109 --> 01:00:19,250
- For how long could it have been?
- Well, several thousand years?

1663
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:20,980
It would have been thousands of years.

1664
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:23,919
Right. Look at that.

1665
01:00:23,919 --> 01:00:25,890
There are lots of foreigners here.

1666
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:29,859
This is where we see the most tourists.

1667
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,290
Everyone comes to see this.

1668
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:33,060
How old are these trees?

1669
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,399
(Let me see.)

1670
01:00:37,029 --> 01:00:38,730
- It's indeed big.
- Yes.

1671
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:39,930
- It looks bigger up close.
- I know.

1672
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:43,169
(He carefully puts his hand on the tree.)

1673
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:47,810
What? What is he doing?

1674
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:49,439
Are you interacting with the tree?

1675
01:00:49,439 --> 01:00:50,980
(He interacts with the tree
with his whole body.)

1676
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,549
I wondered if I could hear something
from the inside.

1677
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:55,750
Is it filled inside?

1678
01:00:56,149 --> 01:01:00,189
As far as I've heard,
they contain a lot of water inside.

1679
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,390
I looked it up later.

1680
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,259
Some people say they're 2,000 years old.

1681
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,060
Some say they're 5,000 years old.

1682
01:01:07,259 --> 01:01:09,299
They looked so exotic...

1683
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:10,770
because I'd never seen them before.

1684
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:12,469
- They looked magnificent.
- Goodness.

1685
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:14,069
It looked majestic,

1686
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:16,569
and I felt like I was
in a different world.

1687
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:19,410
Now that we're here,
shall we take photos first?

1688
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,540
- Photos? Yes. We haven't taken any.
- I...

1689
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:22,910
I brought a Polaroid camera.

1690
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,410
It would look good...

1691
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:25,710
- with the avenue behind us.
- Right.

1692
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:26,879
- With the horizon.
- Yes.

1693
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:28,980
We went into tourist mode.

1694
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,180
It's a must.

1695
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,219
(Kian84 takes off his hat.)

1696
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:33,489
Like that?

1697
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,319
- I formed the shape of the baobab tree.
- One, two, three.

1698
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,859
- A baobab pose.
- Baobab.

1699
01:01:38,859 --> 01:01:40,290
- A 40-year-old baobab tree.
- That's cute.

1700
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:41,399
I want a photo like this.

1701
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,230
(Hugging)

1702
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:45,500
- I like that pose too.
- Here we go. One, two, three.

1703
01:01:45,629 --> 01:01:47,169
They're in tourist mode now.

1704
01:01:47,169 --> 01:01:48,339
I look like an old man.

1705
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:49,969
Should I use this as the background?

1706
01:01:49,969 --> 01:01:51,370
- That sounds good.
- Yes.

1707
01:01:51,569 --> 01:01:52,609
Capture all the way over there.

1708
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,279
One, two, three.

1709
01:01:54,779 --> 01:01:56,040
(Bottle Tree with Pani Bottle)

1710
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

1711
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,450
If he uploaded that on Instagram,
that would get fewer than ten likes.

1712
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:02,379
(9 likes)

1713
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,520
The three of us should take a photo
with this in the background.

1714
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,589
- A good photo.
- A photo?

1715
01:02:05,649 --> 01:02:08,319
- Let's ask them for a photo.
- He looks like a photographer.

1716
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:10,089
Excuse me.

1717
01:02:10,089 --> 01:02:12,730
Could you please help us take a photo?

1718
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,700
- And gather.
- Baobab.

1719
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,430
- Baobab.
- Baobab. Okay.

1720
01:02:16,529 --> 01:02:18,299
All right.

1721
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:19,899
In 3, 2, 1.

1722
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:23,140
If you're going to see baobab trees,
you should take photos with that pose.

1723
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,770
Shall we copy them?

1724
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:26,810
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

1725
01:02:27,779 --> 01:02:30,239
(A baobab group)

1726
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:34,450
I don't think we can camp here.

1727
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,850
No. We should go further.

1728
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:37,520
- This area is...
- It's a touristy place.

1729
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,549
Where are you going to camp?

1730
01:02:38,549 --> 01:02:40,960
- The sun is about to set.
- Yes.

1731
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,219
- Why don't you look around?
- Okay.

1732
01:02:43,219 --> 01:02:44,930
- I'll ask where we can camp.
- All right.

1733
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,259
- We don't have to go together.
- Okay.

1734
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,759
Where should I ask?

1735
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:51,569
- Hello.
- Hello.

1736
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:53,669
Do you speak French or English?

1737
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,469
Spanish?

1738
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:57,270
- Malagasy.
- Malagasy?

1739
01:02:57,969 --> 01:02:58,969
(What do I do?)

1740
01:02:58,969 --> 01:03:00,370
That's not good. Hold on.

1741
01:03:00,879 --> 01:03:03,310
Can I camp here?

1742
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,810
(Over there.)

1743
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,950
We can't camp on the avenue?

1744
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:10,319
- No.
- No?

1745
01:03:11,419 --> 01:03:13,450
(He double-checks with a translator app.)

1746
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,660
(It's over there.)

1747
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,660
Where?

1748
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:18,629
(The local shows him the way.)

1749
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:19,859
What's there over there?

1750
01:03:21,759 --> 01:03:22,799
There's a field.

1751
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,069
I see. There?

1752
01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:26,669
- Yes.
- Okay.

1753
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,839
There are many people here.

1754
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,540
They're looking in one direction.

1755
01:03:32,069 --> 01:03:33,939
- What is it?
- There must be a reason.

1756
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,739
What is it?

1757
01:03:35,739 --> 01:03:38,009
- I glanced back just now.
- Yes.

1758
01:03:38,009 --> 01:03:39,310
It looks nice.

1759
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,620
- I got it. Right?
- It's got a vibe.

1760
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,520
That's it, right?

1761
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,589
It looks cool.

1762
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,689
- Oh, dear.
- Shall we look?

1763
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,189
One, two, three.

1764
01:03:49,189 --> 01:03:50,520
(Laughing)

1765
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,160
- This is it.
- You can see the view at a glance.

1766
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,399
- That's stunning.
- It's awesome.

1767
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,759
It looks so beautiful.

1768
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,830
Dex, where's your camera?
Let me take a photo of you.

1769
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:01,299
Let's take a photo with backlighting.

1770
01:04:01,299 --> 01:04:03,270
- With backlighting?
- Okay.

1771
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:04,839
Okay.

1772
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:07,469
This was our first time being tourists.

1773
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:08,839
(The best sunset spot)

1774
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:11,109
I'll wrap it up with the baobab pose.

1775
01:04:11,109 --> 01:04:13,279
- The baobab pose.
- One, two, three.

1776
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,219
It's good. I love it.

1777
01:04:15,819 --> 01:04:16,879
Okay.

1778
01:04:17,219 --> 01:04:18,689
- Let me take a few of you.
- Here.

1779
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:19,850
Oh, my.

1780
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:21,520
(Getting ready)

1781
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:23,160
One, two, three.

1782
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,189
(Baobab84 is good
at coming up with poses.)

1783
01:04:24,189 --> 01:04:26,230
- Okay.
- Okay. Done.

1784
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,129
(They take a break
with the sunset behind them.)

1785
01:04:28,529 --> 01:04:29,600
It's good.

1786
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,069
(Chuckling)

1787
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,230
As a whole?

1788
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:34,899
(He eats a whole mango
without peeling it.)

1789
01:04:35,439 --> 01:04:38,370
(He savors the fresh mango
straight from its source.)

1790
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:40,469
(He turns his head
while eating the mango.)

1791
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:44,649
(The sun is setting slowly.)

1792
01:04:44,649 --> 01:04:46,410
- Do you want one?
- No. Later.

1793
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:48,580
We only have two mangos left.

1794
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:49,620
(They savor the beautiful view
under the baobab trees.)

1795
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,319
The kids loved them.

1796
01:04:51,419 --> 01:04:52,689
- They were so cute.
- Right.

1797
01:04:54,859 --> 01:04:56,219
Lots of photographers come here.

1798
01:04:56,219 --> 01:04:58,230
The sun is setting now.

1799
01:04:58,460 --> 01:04:59,660
I see.

1800
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:02,960
I see why everyone is standing there.
I should get out quickly.

1801
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,129
- Wait.
- They're taking pictures.

1802
01:05:05,129 --> 01:05:07,399
- He has good manners.
- I just walked here without knowing that.

1803
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:08,669
Is it a good sunset spot?

1804
01:05:08,669 --> 01:05:11,140
That's the best spot
for sunrise and sunset.

1805
01:05:11,509 --> 01:05:14,239
People gather around that time
to take photos.

1806
01:05:14,839 --> 01:05:15,839
Oh, dear.

1807
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,850
- What did they say?
- Can we camp?

1808
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,950
They said we couldn't camp on this road.

1809
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,149
- I expected that.
- Then where?

1810
01:05:23,149 --> 01:05:25,589
- Since this is the main area.
- There's a town over there.

1811
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,919
They told me to camp
behind the houses there.

1812
01:05:27,919 --> 01:05:29,319
- There?
- There's a small town there.

1813
01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:32,390
Shall we go camping when the sun sets?

1814
01:05:32,859 --> 01:05:35,000
- I'll enjoy the sunset there.
- Okay.

1815
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,799
(The Baobab Avenue became more radiant.)

1816
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,230
This spot is amazing.

1817
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,169
This place is so nice.

1818
01:05:42,169 --> 01:05:43,200
(The red sunset illuminates
the majestic baobab trees.)

1819
01:05:44,469 --> 01:05:45,509
I should take a photo.

1820
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:46,739
(Pani Bottle also captures
the sunset view.)

1821
01:05:46,969 --> 01:05:49,040
Pani Bottle,
I'll take a photo of you alone.

1822
01:05:49,609 --> 01:05:51,450
I think the three of us
should take one together.

1823
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:54,549
- Shall we take a picture together?
- Yes. Let's take one.

1824
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:56,750
- Excuse me.
- Can you take a picture of us?

1825
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:58,120
Kian84, in the middle.

1826
01:06:00,149 --> 01:06:02,219
Move to the right.
It's because of the light.

1827
01:06:02,219 --> 01:06:03,859
- This way?
- Yes.

1828
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,290
- Okay. This way.
- This way?

1829
01:06:07,189 --> 01:06:09,259
(The three Baobab Brothers and the sunset)

1830
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,430
(They fell in love
with the view and the people.)

1831
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:15,069
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1832
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,739
Can you take one more picture?

1833
01:06:17,739 --> 01:06:19,669
- The three of us.
- The last photo.

1834
01:06:19,669 --> 01:06:21,379
(They want to capture the sunset
of the Baobab Avenue again.)

1835
01:06:22,609 --> 01:06:23,810
(We hope to remember this moment
for a long time.)

1836
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:25,080
- I like that.
- That one is good.

1837
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,149
- That's the photo in the poster.
- That's the poster.

1838
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,620
- That's the poster.
- Yes.

1839
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:31,049
(Adventure by Accident 3)

1840
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,189
It looks cool. I love it.

1841
01:06:36,819 --> 01:06:38,060
It's gorgeous.

1842
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:41,560
This view and the cows there
can be a postcard.

1843
01:06:42,759 --> 01:06:44,060
It made me sentimental.

1844
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:45,529
(That landscape is filled
with a calm and peaceful atmosphere.)

1845
01:06:45,529 --> 01:06:47,000
How peaceful this is.

1846
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:48,399
It was so peaceful there.

1847
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:50,969
You can't see baobab trees like these...

1848
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:53,109
anywhere but in Madagascar.

1849
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,540
This place makes me realize I'm in Africa.

1850
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:57,850
- It does look like Africa now.
- Yes.

1851
01:06:58,750 --> 01:06:59,750
How nice.

1852
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:01,350
The color of the sunset is beautiful.

1853
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,020
It's a little pink.

1854
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:06,149
The sky had the kind of color we imagine
when we think about Africa.

1855
01:07:06,149 --> 01:07:07,489
Right. Look at the clouds.

1856
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:11,189
- This is exactly the view we imagined.
- Right.

1857
01:07:11,759 --> 01:07:14,259
For the first time,

1858
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:17,160
seeing that serene moment of the sunset,

1859
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,430
I realized it.

1860
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:24,969
The view before my eyes made me realize
for the first time...

1861
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:27,980
that I was really in Africa, Madagascar.

1862
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,080
Right.

1863
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,080
(He wants to enjoy the view
without the sunglasses.)

1864
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,210
This is so nice.

1865
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:37,549
It was amazing...

1866
01:07:37,549 --> 01:07:41,219
to imagine what I would look like...

1867
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:46,259
to those trees
that were 2,000 to 5,000 years old.

1868
01:07:48,399 --> 01:07:50,230
They would see me
as an insignificant creature.

1869
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:51,870
I'm just part of a passing moment to them.

1870
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:56,200
Life seemed vain.

1871
01:07:57,299 --> 01:07:58,939
Seeing those trees,

1872
01:07:58,939 --> 01:08:02,239
I found myself thinking about those things
more than their beauty.

1873
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,580
How short human life is.

1874
01:08:08,049 --> 01:08:09,149
That's philosophical.

1875
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:13,850
It's so short.

1876
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:15,189
- Right. It's short.
- Human life...

1877
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,790
If I lied on my back here,
I'd fall asleep right away.

1878
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:22,259
It would be so nice if we could camp here.

1879
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,230
Shall we get going?

1880
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,830
- Let's go.
- We should set up our tent...

1881
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:27,939
before it gets dark.

1882
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:29,899
- Let's go.
- I'm hungry.

1883
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,270
What time is it now?

1884
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:33,810
The sun sets exactly at 6 p.m.

1885
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:35,540
- Is that so? What time is it?
- At 6 p.m.

1886
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:39,149
- It's 5:12 p.m. now.
- The sun will be gone in 30 minutes.

1887
01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:40,680
Where can we go in?

1888
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,649
- The place we can camp is...
- There?

1889
01:08:42,649 --> 01:08:45,049
- Do you see the town there?
- Yes.

1890
01:08:45,049 --> 01:08:47,290
- They said we could camp behind that.
- Is that so?

1891
01:08:48,089 --> 01:08:49,089
(They follow Pani Bottle
to the camping spot.)

1892
01:08:49,089 --> 01:08:51,230
- Where can we camp here? Hello.
- Hello.

1893
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,029
Hello.

1894
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:56,029
Can we camp here?

1895
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,230
(Using body language)

1896
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,629
He makes sure.

1897
01:08:59,629 --> 01:09:00,669
(Nodding)

1898
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,739
Okay?

1899
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:04,669
Tent.

1900
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:06,569
Can we sleep here?

1901
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:08,009
He asked in Korean.

1902
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,540
(He got the residents' permission.)

1903
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,180
I keep speaking Korean
since we can't communicate.

1904
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:14,879
So, the townspeople said
we could set up our tent here?

1905
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,980
They said we could do it in the back.
That must be it.

1906
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:19,850
(The spot
the store owner mentioned earlier)

1907
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:21,160
- That looks like a soccer field...
- It's there.

1908
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,160
- over there.
- Is that so?

1909
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,219
A playground is good.

1910
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:25,859
This place is nice.

1911
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:28,029
- Hello.
- Hello.

1912
01:09:28,029 --> 01:09:29,230
(The residents are enjoying the evening.)

1913
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:31,500
It's the kid who you gave mangos.

1914
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,899
- Hello.
- She lives here?

1915
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:35,800
- Hello.
- It's her.

1916
01:09:36,769 --> 01:09:38,170
Did she forget us already?

1917
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:39,670
- Those two.
- She didn't recognize us.

1918
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:40,670
She must recognize you.

1919
01:09:41,139 --> 01:09:42,380
It's difficult to understand kids.

1920
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,450
What is that?

1921
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:47,880
Is it a soccer field?

1922
01:09:48,849 --> 01:09:51,149
- It's a vacant lot.
- It's vast.

1923
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:52,349
The view is stunning.

1924
01:09:53,149 --> 01:09:55,489
- It looks like a painting like that.
- I know.

1925
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,489
However you see it, it looks picturesque.

1926
01:09:57,489 --> 01:09:59,229
There's no better camping spot than this.

1927
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:01,090
It looks like a painting...

1928
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:02,099
- wherever you are.
- Gosh.

1929
01:10:02,099 --> 01:10:04,970
(Camping in a dreamlike setting
with a stunning view)

1930
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,939
- This place looks perfect.
- Shall we set up our own tents, then?

1931
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:10,670
Our own tents? That sounds good.

1932
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:12,639
Let's set up the tents a bit apart
from each other like baobab trees.

1933
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:14,510
You'll have separate rooms now.

1934
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,410
Let's put up our own tents.

1935
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:17,439
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

1936
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:18,649
We don't have much time.

1937
01:10:19,149 --> 01:10:20,210
Hurry.

1938
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:23,380
I had such a hard time
in the alpine regions there.

1939
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,050
Right. You always set up tents
at high altitudes.

1940
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:26,090
It was our first time camping
in a flatland.

1941
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,519
- It's like paradise.
- Yes. It's your first time.

1942
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:29,120
You could even set it up
with your eyes closed.

1943
01:10:31,729 --> 01:10:35,200
(The younger members are setting up
their tents with no problem.)

1944
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:38,170
(On the other hand, the oldest is...)

1945
01:10:40,899 --> 01:10:43,000
I've never seen a tent like this
in my life.

1946
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,410
- What is that?
- It's a one-person tent.

1947
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:46,840
- What's that?
- It looked interesting.

1948
01:10:48,639 --> 01:10:51,179
(He digs the ground for no reason.)

1949
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:52,250
Gosh.

1950
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,550
(The other tents are taking shape.)

1951
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,620
Those two are doing okay.

1952
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:01,489
(But the oldest hasn't made any progress
with his tent.)

1953
01:11:01,819 --> 01:11:03,290
- It's getting dark so quickly.
- Yes.

1954
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,330
(The day is slowly turning into night.)

1955
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,660
- Why?
- He hasn't done anything.

1956
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:14,870
Shall we get close to the walls
since it's windy?

1957
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:15,970
- We're in the middle of nowhere.
- Over there?

1958
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:17,239
Let's move closer to that.

1959
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:18,510
There?

1960
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:22,239
We were in the middle of the open field,
so we moved to the edges.

1961
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:24,479
(Dragging)

1962
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:27,149
Shall we set up 1 here and 1 there?

1963
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:30,420
I'll ask the locals
if we could camp here again.

1964
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,889
He's meticulous.

1965
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,420
Is it okay if we camp here?

1966
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,819
He checked so many times.

1967
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:37,160
They might snap.

1968
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,359
- "Yes, camp!"
- "Just camp!"

1969
01:11:39,059 --> 01:11:40,729
- "Okay!"
- "Yes, you can!"

1970
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,099
- "You can camp here!"
- "You can camp."

1971
01:11:42,099 --> 01:11:43,200
"How many times did I tell you?"

1972
01:11:45,429 --> 01:11:47,099
(He's getting permission
over a hundred times.)

1973
01:11:47,099 --> 01:11:48,300
(Snoring)

1974
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,300
- Okay?
- Okay.

1975
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,510
Okay. That's good.

1976
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,870
(Fist bump)

1977
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,410
They're okay with it.

1978
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,939
- Okay.
- All right.

1979
01:11:57,109 --> 01:11:58,679
Okay.

1980
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:01,210
Smoothly.

1981
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,979
- He's got good gear.
- He's prepared.

1982
01:12:03,979 --> 01:12:06,220
- I upgraded my gear.
- I can see that.

1983
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:09,660
I prepared a mattress,
just like the India trip.

1984
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:12,130
That mattress was bulky,

1985
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:13,529
so it was so heavy and difficult to carry.

1986
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,260
But this one is half the weight.

1987
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,130
It's a much lighter mattress.

1988
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,529
I also prepared a pillow,

1989
01:12:19,529 --> 01:12:21,029
dental floss, cotton swabs,

1990
01:12:21,029 --> 01:12:23,370
cleansing tissues, facial masks,

1991
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:25,639
- serum, and everything.
- Even a camping chair.

1992
01:12:27,939 --> 01:12:29,010
This is nice.

1993
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:32,109
(They're almost done with the tents.)

1994
01:12:32,109 --> 01:12:33,210
(They are not.)

1995
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:34,250
What did he do?

1996
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:35,979
- He hasn't done anything.
- Is he fishing or what?

1997
01:12:35,979 --> 01:12:38,620
- Is that a flag?
- I've never seen that type of tent.

1998
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:42,059
(He tries to fix the tent.)

1999
01:12:42,059 --> 01:12:43,819
That is not a tent.

2000
01:12:43,889 --> 01:12:45,429
How can you sleep in there?

2001
01:12:45,429 --> 01:12:47,260
(Thud)

2002
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,660
My shoes are so weird
that I can't stomp well.

2003
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,470
It's getting dark, so he should hurry.

2004
01:12:53,729 --> 01:12:55,540
- Is it done?
- Yes. That's what it looks like.

2005
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:58,040
- Really? That's so flat.
- I see.

2006
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:01,510
(He goes in while holding something.)

2007
01:13:02,109 --> 01:13:03,410
How do I go in?

2008
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:04,439
You want to use it as a blanket?

2009
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:06,109
He can only sleep in there.

2010
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,620
(Wiggling)

2011
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,950
- What is he doing?
- Like this?

2012
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,790
- Like this!
- It was cozy.

2013
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:15,019
It indeed fits only one person.

2014
01:13:15,019 --> 01:13:16,389
I'll use this as a pillow.

2015
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,790
(Is he done?)

2016
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:20,760
(Satisfied)

2017
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:23,200
Dex.

2018
01:13:24,029 --> 01:13:25,800
- Yes.
- Are you finished?

2019
01:13:26,229 --> 01:13:27,870
- Kian84.
- Do you want to come over?

2020
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,170
Come here.

2021
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:32,269
- Was it hit by a typhoon?
- You're my first guest.

2022
01:13:32,269 --> 01:13:33,269
Was it hit by a typhoon?

2023
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:35,679
- Come on in.
- I wasn't sure if that was really done.

2024
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:37,210
- Come in.
- I couldn't tell.

2025
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:39,880
- Goodness. Excuse me.
- No. Keep your shoes on.

2026
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,319
- Why would I keep them on?
- This is the American way.

2027
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,019
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

2028
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:46,120
Oh, dear.

2029
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,720
- The tent is about to collapse.
- Oh, my.

2030
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,120
- Come in and turn around.
- His butt.

2031
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,389
- My butt got stuck.
- Okay.

2032
01:13:52,389 --> 01:13:53,660
(Excuse me.)

2033
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:56,729
(While he's having a housewarming party)

2034
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:58,700
- What?
- Bread again?

2035
01:13:58,929 --> 01:14:00,470
- Pani Baguette.
- Pani Baguette.

2036
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,540
Hey, you're my first guest.

2037
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:03,670
What do I do?

2038
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:07,710
Don't you want some baguette?

2039
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,210
(Laughing)

2040
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:12,349
- He's a baguette promoter.
- He's been eating that all day.

2041
01:14:12,349 --> 01:14:13,779
It must've been delicious.

2042
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,179
Don't you want some baguette?

2043
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:17,319
Baguette?

2044
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:18,950
- Baguette?
- Baguette.

2045
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:20,849
- Kian84.
- Let's go out.

2046
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:22,720
- Gosh.
- Hey.

2047
01:14:22,819 --> 01:14:25,160
You should come out and stand up.
Otherwise, it will come loose.

2048
01:14:25,729 --> 01:14:26,729
What do we do about dinner?

2049
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:28,260
(Dinner?)

2050
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,359
Shall we buy some meat and beer?

2051
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:32,870
And we eat here?

2052
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:34,970
Let's go grocery shopping and look around.

2053
01:14:35,069 --> 01:14:36,870
- Let's buy meat, beer, and other things.
- Okay.

2054
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,670
I brought some food...

2055
01:14:38,769 --> 01:14:40,470
- for you guys.
- My gosh.

2056
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:41,739
Oh, dear.

2057
01:14:41,739 --> 01:14:43,639
Right. You need ramyeon when camping.

2058
01:14:43,639 --> 01:14:45,109
- We don't have hot water.
- Let's do it this way.

2059
01:14:45,109 --> 01:14:48,179
- I'll buy some meat and beer.
- Okay.

2060
01:14:48,279 --> 01:14:49,920
- Let's go together.
- Okay.

2061
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,649
- Okay.
- Dex, you can do this.

2062
01:14:51,649 --> 01:14:52,689
- Okay.
- I'll do this.

2063
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:54,720
- Then, let's go.
- Let's go.

2064
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,260
I'll see you after you get back.

2065
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:57,460
Let's go.

2066
01:14:58,889 --> 01:15:00,929
It's so dark at night.

2067
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:04,300
Gosh, this place has some light.

2068
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:07,670
Should we ask them
if we can have some hot water?

2069
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,040
Thank you.

2070
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:15,040
(He goes to ask them
if he can have some hot water.)

2071
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,010
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

2072
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:20,349
(Have a good dinner.)

2073
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,179
Gosh, they're having dinner.

2074
01:15:22,179 --> 01:15:23,380
I should go somewhere else.

2075
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:25,590
It's dinnertime right now,

2076
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:27,319
so they're in the middle of their meals.

2077
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,389
(He goes to the house next door.)

2078
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:34,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

2079
01:15:34,859 --> 01:15:36,859
Hello.

2080
01:15:37,059 --> 01:15:38,599
Oh, you've already eaten.

2081
01:15:38,599 --> 01:15:40,769
They were finished with their meal
and doing the dishes.

2082
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:41,800
(The family next door has already used
all of their hot water.)

2083
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,170
Oh, you've already eaten.

2084
01:15:45,939 --> 01:15:48,170
Yes. Hello.

2085
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:50,109
Babies love Dex so much.

2086
01:15:50,109 --> 01:15:52,450
(Dex received attention from kids
all day long.)

2087
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:54,109
(Giggling)

2088
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:56,819
(I like that.)

2089
01:15:57,149 --> 01:15:58,689
Thank you. I'll be going.

2090
01:15:58,689 --> 01:16:00,420
Have a good evening.

2091
01:16:00,819 --> 01:16:02,460
Thank you.

2092
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,960
Everyone has already eaten,
so it's not easy to get water.

2093
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,790
It seems so hard to find water.

2094
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:09,099
Gosh, you worked so hard.

2095
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:10,700
(He tries going to another house.)

2096
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,229
- Hello.
- Hello.

2097
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,300
- You're the driver from earlier.
- Oh, really?

2098
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,639
(The driver who drove the ox cart)

2099
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:22,880
- Hello.
- It was already past dinnertime,

2100
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,050
but this family
seemed to be preparing dinner.

2101
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:28,179
It's nice to run into him like this.

2102
01:16:28,649 --> 01:16:30,950
What is this?

2103
01:16:31,889 --> 01:16:33,849
(Rice)

2104
01:16:33,849 --> 01:16:35,189
- Oh, this is...
- It looks good.

2105
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:38,960
I need water. Hot water.

2106
01:16:39,859 --> 01:16:42,130
(Hot water)

2107
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:44,029
(In here!)

2108
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:45,300
Three.

2109
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,569
(Please give me some water.)

2110
01:16:47,529 --> 01:16:49,599
- Lucky.
- He said it was okay.

2111
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:52,170
(He got hot water after three tries.)

2112
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:54,979
If you hadn't run into him,
you would've had uncooked ramyeon.

2113
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,410
(Careful)

2114
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:58,580
A little bit more.

2115
01:16:58,580 --> 01:16:59,779
(Meanwhile, the older brothers...)

2116
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:01,819
(are looking for the store they saw
on their way back.)

2117
01:17:01,819 --> 01:17:03,519
- It was there earlier.
- Yes.

2118
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,050
(Zooming)

2119
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:07,849
- What? They closed everything up.
- A car is coming.

2120
01:17:08,559 --> 01:17:10,920
(Coming through.)

2121
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,260
What's up with this guy? What is this?

2122
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:15,929
- What's up with this guy? What is this?
- Why?

2123
01:17:15,929 --> 01:17:16,960
What is this?

2124
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:19,269
- What is this?
- He's hanging off of the back.

2125
01:17:19,269 --> 01:17:21,330
(Dangling)

2126
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,470
- Why is he doing that?
- Gosh, I want to try it.

2127
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:25,639
- Hang on. What on earth...
- This is so...

2128
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:27,210
He's getting a free ride.

2129
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:30,210
(They go to a street-side stall.)

2130
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:32,179
- Hello.
- Hello.

2131
01:17:32,179 --> 01:17:33,179
Food?

2132
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:34,979
- Yes, food.
- Beef?

2133
01:17:36,349 --> 01:17:38,179
- Oh, it's meat.
- They are selling it.

2134
01:17:38,179 --> 01:17:39,489
- What kind of meat is it?
- Is it fish?

2135
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:41,689
- What? Cow?
- There's fur.

2136
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:43,189
- Isn't that an eye?
- Fur is a bit too much.

2137
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:44,359
- Gosh, what is it?
- Is it pork?

2138
01:17:44,859 --> 01:17:45,929
This fur...

2139
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:47,760
- Hang on.
- I feel bad about the fur.

2140
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,529
- Gosh, that's like in the wild.
- I'll use the ultimate tool.

2141
01:17:49,729 --> 01:17:50,760
Go ahead and buy some.

2142
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,700
I feel sorry because of the fur.
It made me feel bad.

2143
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,200
(Seeing the fur was a greater shock
than they thought.)

2144
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,139
Okay, how much? This...

2145
01:17:56,269 --> 01:17:58,340
- Let me use the ultimate tool.
- Okay.

2146
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:01,840
How much is it total?

2147
01:18:02,179 --> 01:18:03,510
This and this.

2148
01:18:04,809 --> 01:18:06,010
- Three?
- Three?

2149
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:07,849
- Three?
- Okay.

2150
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,349
- Okay.
- Oh, it's goat.

2151
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:10,679
Okay.

2152
01:18:11,649 --> 01:18:13,050
(Takeout)

2153
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:14,090
- Takeout?
- Can you do that?

2154
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:16,960
- Wait. Okay.
- Hang on. Okay.

2155
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:19,059
Hey, I'll go look at some beer and water
over there.

2156
01:18:19,059 --> 01:18:20,130
- Beer?
- Yes.

2157
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,359
(Wrapping up the meat himself)

2158
01:18:23,529 --> 01:18:24,529
Okay.

2159
01:18:24,529 --> 01:18:27,000
Still, you got some good food.

2160
01:18:27,099 --> 01:18:29,540
- It's not easy to find things nearby.
- How much is it?

2161
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:30,569
- That's right.
- It's a relief that you did.

2162
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:31,870
(They return to their campsite
with their arms full.)

2163
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:34,069
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2164
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:40,050
With this much water,
it might be enough for us to drink...

2165
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,109
- and have some leftover to wash up.
- Right.

2166
01:18:41,819 --> 01:18:42,849
Is Dex back?

2167
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,120
Oh, he's not back yet.

2168
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,189
- Where did Dex go?
- Dex...

2169
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:47,349
But how do we eat this?

2170
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:48,989
- What?
- We don't have spoons.

2171
01:18:48,989 --> 01:18:51,090
- What will you do without chopsticks?
- Wooden chopsticks.

2172
01:18:51,559 --> 01:18:53,960
We can do it like we did in India.

2173
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,160
- You burned them. I worked hard on them.
- Right.

2174
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,170
That's right.
After you made chopsticks in India...

2175
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:01,229
(He made wooden chopsticks
while overcoming altitude sickness.)

2176
01:19:01,229 --> 01:19:03,069
- Right.
- After working so hard on them...

2177
01:19:03,069 --> 01:19:04,670
Hey, let's use these as firewood.

2178
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:06,410
- What are you doing?
- They burned really well.

2179
01:19:07,139 --> 01:19:09,279
- I worked so hard to make them.
- Oh, no.

2180
01:19:10,179 --> 01:19:12,809
This time, even if I find utensils,
I'll eat with what you made.

2181
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:14,950
I don't want to disappoint you.

2182
01:19:15,319 --> 01:19:16,319
(In that case)

2183
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:17,849
All right. Let's see.

2184
01:19:19,389 --> 01:19:20,819
(The chopstick craftsman
sets off in search of raw material.)

2185
01:19:20,819 --> 01:19:21,819
That won't work.

2186
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:23,420
Why do the trees look so brutal here?

2187
01:19:24,489 --> 01:19:27,290
(Helping the craftsman with his search)

2188
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,099
I don't see anything that would work...

2189
01:19:29,099 --> 01:19:31,500
- There wasn't much as it was dry there.
- Right.

2190
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,769
It should be a bit firm.

2191
01:19:34,029 --> 01:19:36,340
(The two brothers
busily search for material.)

2192
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:38,540
Oh, this looks good.

2193
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:41,910
We have enough for one person.

2194
01:19:41,979 --> 01:19:44,179
Will you carve those and use them
as chopsticks?

2195
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:46,849
There's fun in using tools
that you find off the ground.

2196
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:48,679
You get everything from your surroundings.

2197
01:19:48,679 --> 01:19:50,279
(Camping in the wilderness
where you get everything from nearby)

2198
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,519
(Breaking)

2199
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:55,559
I'll just wash these in some water
and eat with them.

2200
01:19:56,389 --> 01:19:59,160
(Meanwhile, the younger brother
works hard on making chopsticks.)

2201
01:20:00,489 --> 01:20:02,559
(Carving)

2202
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,500
Gosh, you bought beer.

2203
01:20:05,899 --> 01:20:07,800
- Of course.
- Dex, where did you get the hot water?

2204
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:11,139
I walked around the neighbors' houses...

2205
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,609
- and got some hot water.
- No way.

2206
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:15,069
- Are you making chopsticks?
- Yes.

2207
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,609
I think it'd be hard to get them
totally clean.

2208
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,210
I'll just wash them after carving them
a little bit.

2209
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:21,679
Oh, I have a bad feeling.

2210
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,179
Say that you don't have any.

2211
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,819
You're making chopsticks, right?

2212
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:27,819
What should I do?

2213
01:20:27,819 --> 01:20:29,489
(What should I do?)

2214
01:20:29,689 --> 01:20:31,590
Of course I brought some.

2215
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:33,760
- I know.
- I have everything in my bag.

2216
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,529
- What should I do?
- No, I told him.

2217
01:20:35,559 --> 01:20:38,099
No, we can't disappoint Pani Bottle.
Put them away.

2218
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:39,470
Throw these away!

2219
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:42,769
- I'll eat with the one I'm making.
- Throw these away!

2220
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,340
- Throw them away!
- I'll use these.

2221
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,370
We don't have chopsticks.

2222
01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:49,910
No. The two of you can eat
with the chopsticks you brought.

2223
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:53,279
No, I want to try eating
with the ones we made.

2224
01:20:54,179 --> 01:20:55,880
Kian84, you don't have to try so hard.

2225
01:20:57,950 --> 01:21:00,590
(He gets back to work
after being consoled.)

2226
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:03,260
- Look at that.
- The man carving wood.

2227
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:06,229
(The shining tip of the chopstick
that he carved with a passion)

2228
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:08,189
- That's awesome.
- You did a great job.

2229
01:21:08,189 --> 01:21:09,500
(He finished carving the wooden chopsticks
with the cheers from his brothers.)

2230
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,200
I'm all set to eat.

2231
01:21:12,769 --> 01:21:14,599
(Looking around)

2232
01:21:14,599 --> 01:21:16,069
- What about mine?
- Why?

2233
01:21:16,069 --> 01:21:17,099
What's wrong?

2234
01:21:17,569 --> 01:21:19,239
Where did my chopsticks go?

2235
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:21,910
Where did you put yours?

2236
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:24,580
My chopsticks
just look like pieces of wood.

2237
01:21:24,939 --> 01:21:27,109
- Gosh.
- You get them from nearby right away.

2238
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:28,479
- I mean...
- You can make them right away.

2239
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:30,149
There's no need to carve them.

2240
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,550
Wild84.

2241
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:35,120
(3-minute cooking? No.
3-second chopsticks? Yes.)

2242
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:38,160
I'll be in charge of the field rations.

2243
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,830
Without those, Dex can't...

2244
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:41,189
I can't go on with the trip.

2245
01:21:42,529 --> 01:21:43,830
This is crazy.

2246
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:45,059
Are those stars for real?

2247
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,670
They're not CGI?

2248
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,000
(They start camping
under the shower of stars.)

2249
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,739
Gosh, what a feast.

2250
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:54,739
(A luxurious meal)

2251
01:21:54,739 --> 01:21:56,109
This is a luxury.

2252
01:21:56,979 --> 01:21:58,010
We have so much food.

2253
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,750
- This is more than enough.
- Yes.

2254
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,580
Gosh, the ramyeon looks good.

2255
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,319
The ramyeon smells great. Gosh.

2256
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:05,889
Let's take a bite of the ramyeon first.

2257
01:22:05,889 --> 01:22:07,889
- You guys worked hard.
- Great work. Cheers.

2258
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,319
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

2259
01:22:09,319 --> 01:22:10,819
That must've tasted amazing.

2260
01:22:10,819 --> 01:22:13,160
- Ramyeon on camping trips is the best.
- It tastes the best.

2261
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,830
(The guy who brought wooden chopsticks)

2262
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:17,830
(The guy who made wooden chopsticks)

2263
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:18,970
(And the guy who picked them up
off the ground)

2264
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:22,040
In the end,
I couldn't let go of modern civilization.

2265
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,370
(Laughing)

2266
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:25,370
Dex. Try this.

2267
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:27,210
Beef.

2268
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:28,210
(The eldest brother hands him
a piece of meat they bought earlier.)

2269
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,109
You too, Pani Bottle.

2270
01:22:31,109 --> 01:22:32,479
Eat some,
even it's just because you feel bad.

2271
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:35,109
- It's good.
- Isn't it good?

2272
01:22:35,109 --> 01:22:36,819
- Didn't it have a gamey smell?
- It didn't have any bad smells.

2273
01:22:36,819 --> 01:22:39,250
It didn't have a gamey smell,
but it was a bit tough.

2274
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:40,920
But it was grilled really well.

2275
01:22:41,989 --> 01:22:43,189
The meat tastes good.

2276
01:22:43,189 --> 01:22:44,620
- It's good, isn't it?
- Yes.

2277
01:22:45,529 --> 01:22:48,290
(Pulling it over)

2278
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:50,399
Isn't that the mango?

2279
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,599
This mango isn't ripe.

2280
01:22:52,769 --> 01:22:53,769
- Oh, really?
- Let me see.

2281
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:55,899
- I gave it to a cow, but it wouldn't eat.
- But this...

2282
01:22:55,899 --> 01:22:57,569
- smells fresh.
- This one.

2283
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,540
I washed it.

2284
01:23:01,670 --> 01:23:02,739
Washed what?

2285
01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:04,439
It's a mystery.

2286
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:06,279
- So, I gave it to a cow.
- Yes.

2287
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:07,809
The cow sniffed it,

2288
01:23:07,809 --> 01:23:09,679
and it licked this about three times.

2289
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:12,550
(The mango that a cow licked three times)

2290
01:23:12,649 --> 01:23:13,790
This mango was licked by a cow?

2291
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:15,660
But I washed it.

2292
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:17,389
Oh, okay.

2293
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:18,859
Gosh, what's wrong with this?

2294
01:23:18,859 --> 01:23:19,929
(It's okay to consume
since it has been washed.)

2295
01:23:19,929 --> 01:23:21,630
(Biting)

2296
01:23:22,099 --> 01:23:23,429
(Gulping)

2297
01:23:23,429 --> 01:23:25,200
His body is responding.

2298
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,370
(He just finds it funny.)

2299
01:23:28,769 --> 01:23:31,370
If we had been in India,
I would've been appalled.

2300
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:33,069
But I've gathered data now.

2301
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:37,479
And what's even worse is this.
In order to wash off the cow's saliva,

2302
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:40,010
he rolled it around in dirt
instead of wiping it with a wet wipe.

2303
01:23:40,179 --> 01:23:41,510
It looked like a piece of injeolmi.

2304
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:44,649
He rolled it in the dirt, wiped it off,
and then he ate it.

2305
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:47,420
I thought,
"He cared about hygiene in his own way."

2306
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:49,489
"This is Kian84's style."

2307
01:23:50,019 --> 01:23:51,019
- That's what I thought.
- Oh, no.

2308
01:23:51,019 --> 01:23:52,529
- Is this a sitcom or something?
- It was all soft.

2309
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:53,760
- Oh, my stomach hurts.
- What kind of mango...

2310
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,760
(His sense of hygiene is beyond
anyone's imagination.)

2311
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,899
Hey, but do people normally eat
mangoes that aren't ripe?

2312
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:00,170
- Is it good?
- I don't think I had any.

2313
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:01,830
- It has this texture. Try it.
- It was good.

2314
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,170
They eat it like this in the Philippines.

2315
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:07,069
Hey, I don't eat stuff
that a cow licked either.

2316
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:09,410
I'm human too, punk.

2317
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:11,910
Oh, I did eat it.

2318
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:13,979
(Laughing)

2319
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,319
- It was bitter, wasn't it?
- It tastes like an unripe apple.

2320
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,550
I don't think I can eat this.

2321
01:24:21,649 --> 01:24:23,120
Try it.

2322
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,790
I said I couldn't eat it.
Why are you giving it to me?

2323
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:26,290
No, try it. It's not bad.

2324
01:24:28,389 --> 01:24:30,529
We have some beer, but...

2325
01:24:32,029 --> 01:24:33,830
Gosh, there's something I've prepared.

2326
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:36,300
But it's a shame since we have beer.

2327
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:39,170
Are they side dishes?

2328
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:43,080
This liquor is popular these days.

2329
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,109
(A new kind of soju)

2330
01:24:44,309 --> 01:24:45,380
What's this?

2331
01:24:45,979 --> 01:24:47,679
- Indeed.
- How great would that taste?

2332
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,120
- It must taste amazing.
- No way.

2333
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:51,720
(When they first met in India)

2334
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,250
(I have prepared soju.)

2335
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:56,689
I don't even drink soju,
but I'm just glad to see it.

2336
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:59,660
(Give that here.)

2337
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:02,399
- I'll open it.
- Zero sugar is in these days, you know?

2338
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:03,399
That's right.

2339
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:05,630
Also... Gosh.

2340
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:08,130
This is a special something
that I brought from Korea.

2341
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:10,170
- My mom gave me this.
- Gosh.

2342
01:25:10,269 --> 01:25:12,970
My mom gave me this. This is a cup.

2343
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:15,540
(A cute cup that his mom gave him)

2344
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,739
- Isn't it cute?
- Oh, my. It's so cute.

2345
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:19,550
I'll pour you a glass, Kian84.

2346
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:20,849
Gosh, thank you.

2347
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,349
- There.
- Thank you.

2348
01:25:22,349 --> 01:25:23,880
(Give and take)

2349
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:24,920
- Here.
- A huge cup.

2350
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,950
- Goodness, thank you.
- There you go.

2351
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,760
Kian84, why don't you give a toast
as our leader?

2352
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,830
Actually, we still have a long way to go
on our trip.

2353
01:25:34,859 --> 01:25:36,059
Let's not get hurt,

2354
01:25:36,859 --> 01:25:39,970
and I hope we can make memories
that we won't forget.

2355
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:42,069
I say that because you guys are so busy
and successful these days.

2356
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:43,840
Really.

2357
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,000
(Feeling shy)

2358
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:48,510
But I hope Adventure by Accident
will be number one in your hearts.

2359
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,109
- Gosh.
- Gosh. Okay.

2360
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:01,590
Actually,

2361
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:04,489
Kian84 usually doesn't like
saying cheesy things.

2362
01:26:04,689 --> 01:26:07,160
I think Kian84 considers this trip...

2363
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:09,130
one that will become
a long-lasting memory.

2364
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:11,099
I think all of us feel that way...

2365
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,300
instinctively
and without having to say it.

2366
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:17,470
I think it's great that
all of us feel the same way.

2367
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:22,580
(Last summer, in India)

2368
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:26,479
(The three brothers met by accident.)

2369
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:29,580
(Being together when they were sick...)

2370
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:31,880
(and when they were happy,)

2371
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:35,590
(they threw themselves into
their third destination, Madagascar.)

2372
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:39,389
(As they overcame their physical limits,)

2373
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,059
(the 3 brothers became number 1
in each other's hearts.)

2374
01:26:44,729 --> 01:26:47,170
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

2375
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:48,399
(Hoping for an unforgettable trip,
they say "cheers.")

2376
01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:50,870
(Groaning)

2377
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:52,340
Gosh, that must've been nice.

2378
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:54,510
Gosh, it's so smooth.

2379
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:55,939
Isn't it amazing?

2380
01:26:57,179 --> 01:27:00,609
This reminds me
of when we were in India, Dex.

2381
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,880
(They bring up memories of their past trip
with the help of alcohol.)

2382
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:03,979
I know, right?

2383
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:07,019
- This is...
- Actually, back then...

2384
01:27:07,519 --> 01:27:09,920
- That was before we grew closer.
- It was a bit awkward.

2385
01:27:10,489 --> 01:27:11,790
And I feel a bit sorry.

2386
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,260
I wasn't that happy to see him
when I first saw him.

2387
01:27:14,689 --> 01:27:17,300
But when I saw soju,
I was so happy that I felt a bit sorry.

2388
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,630
I did feel a little hurt back then.
I can only say this now.

2389
01:27:20,099 --> 01:27:21,970
Is this time to say things
we couldn't say before?

2390
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:23,639
- Because...
- I love that idea.

2391
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:26,040
when we first heard that you were coming,

2392
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:29,910
he said, "Hey, Dex is too handsome.
He's no good."

2393
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:31,040
I was very much against it.

2394
01:27:31,639 --> 01:27:34,250
(Before the India trip,
when they only knew Dex's name)

2395
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,620
(You know a guy named Dex, right?)

2396
01:27:36,019 --> 01:27:37,019
(No way)

2397
01:27:37,019 --> 01:27:38,120
(Why not?)

2398
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,220
(If he's good-looking, it's a bit...)

2399
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:40,620
(Then, am I going
because I'm not good-looking?)

2400
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:41,849
(That's a misunderstanding.)

2401
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,760
(I'm not taking you
so that I can stand out.)

2402
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,260
But if he says it that way,
what does that make me?

2403
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:49,000
- I get it, but...
- Why are you okay?

2404
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,130
I know!

2405
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:51,929
He didn't say anything when I joined.

2406
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,029
(All I can do is laugh.)

2407
01:27:54,029 --> 01:27:55,569
Gosh, I should just drink some alcohol.

2408
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,000
This world is so unfair.

2409
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,139
That's a smooth drink.

2410
01:27:59,569 --> 01:28:01,170
People might think you're a heavy drinker.

2411
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:04,840
Tomorrow... Hang on.

2412
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:07,649
Tomorrow, we'll go to Antananarivo.

2413
01:28:08,309 --> 01:28:10,750
- And isn't tomorrow the 22nd?
- Yes.

2414
01:28:12,989 --> 01:28:14,950
- It's his birthday.
- Come on. Wait.

2415
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:17,120
So, it is my birthday...

2416
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:19,189
Then, it's your birthday
on the day we go to Antananarivo.

2417
01:28:19,189 --> 01:28:20,630
- Yes.
- Gosh, you celebrated your birthday here?

2418
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:23,500
- This guy named Lee Si Eon made me...
- Yes?

2419
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:25,000
- seaweed soup in Peru.
- Right.

2420
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,130
- That's right.
- Kian84.

2421
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:27,929
(He had a birthday dinner
in Peru last year.)

2422
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,569
(Seaweed soup made by Si Eon
in a faraway land)

2423
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,769
(Gosh, Si Eon)

2424
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:36,109
(Taking a big bite)

2425
01:28:36,109 --> 01:28:37,609
- This was exactly a year ago, right?
- It was so touching.

2426
01:28:37,609 --> 01:28:38,679
- That's right.
- Right.

2427
01:28:38,779 --> 01:28:40,809
- Look here, Kian84. There's even beef.
- Gosh.

2428
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:42,620
I did feel grateful.

2429
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:44,050
(Even when he looks back now,
he felt grateful in that moment.)

2430
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:46,149
- Since it's your birthday tomorrow,
- Yes?

2431
01:28:46,349 --> 01:28:47,450
how about we go to a Korean restaurant?

2432
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:49,189
- Tomorrow evening?
- Yes.

2433
01:28:49,189 --> 01:28:50,189
Okay, let's go.

2434
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:51,590
We'll have soju...

2435
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,059
and Korean food.

2436
01:28:53,559 --> 01:28:54,660
We'll have a party there.

2437
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:57,760
- Okay. For dinner, we'll eat Korean food?
- Yes.

2438
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:00,830
Kian84, did you really look forward
to Madagascar?

2439
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,500
To be honest, for Madagascar...
Rather than looking forward to it...

2440
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:05,939
Were you worried?

2441
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:08,769
Actually, I still don't know.

2442
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:10,910
- Really?
- So...

2443
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:14,309
We've only seen Morondava in Madagascar.

2444
01:29:14,309 --> 01:29:16,380
- Right, we haven't seen a lot yet.
- Right.

2445
01:29:16,649 --> 01:29:18,979
- I can't predict anything.
- You can't predict it?

2446
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:20,649
- That's the gem of traveling.
- Right.

2447
01:29:20,649 --> 01:29:23,760
I know.
And that's what makes me feel excited.

2448
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,859
For me, up to this point,

2449
01:29:25,859 --> 01:29:27,960
- the people have been so great.
- Right.

2450
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:31,500
And I love how the little kids smile.

2451
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,229
I just feel happy to see them.

2452
01:29:34,269 --> 01:29:37,800
For me, Madagascar is better
than what I expected.

2453
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,939
- I love it.
- I can see that you like it a lot.

2454
01:29:39,939 --> 01:29:42,010
- Right. His energy level is different.
- I really love it.

2455
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:43,040
It's fun.

2456
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,679
- I...
- I just hope it stays this way.

2457
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:45,679
Me too.

2458
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:47,950
Seeing how Dex is enjoying himself,

2459
01:29:48,109 --> 01:29:49,550
- Oh, really?
- I'm glad too.

2460
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:50,580
(Pani Bottle is satisfied with just that.)

2461
01:29:50,779 --> 01:29:52,149
Also, today...

2462
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:54,750
The baobab trees are one thing,

2463
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:57,160
but try looking up right now.

2464
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:00,590
Now, this is the main event.

2465
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:04,399
Being able to see the shower of stars
that look like the Milky Way...

2466
01:30:05,429 --> 01:30:07,099
(The baobab trees seem to be reaching
their hands to the Milky Way.)

2467
01:30:07,099 --> 01:30:08,200
It's so beautiful.

2468
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:09,899
- You can see the Milky Way?
- That's amazing.

2469
01:30:09,899 --> 01:30:11,700
- Yes.
- That's it, right there.

2470
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:15,069
(You can't help
but look at the night sky in awe.)

2471
01:30:15,069 --> 01:30:17,880
- I'm jealous.
- I seriously want to see that Milky Way.

2472
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:24,580
- Gosh.
- I'll take a picture of this.

2473
01:30:24,649 --> 01:30:26,489
- Which phone takes good pictures?
- That one.

2474
01:30:29,019 --> 01:30:31,090
Underneath the night sky,

2475
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:33,859
it was so dark that I had to take
a photo with long exposure.

2476
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:36,559
It looked surreal...

2477
01:30:36,559 --> 01:30:38,660
as if we took photos on a set.

2478
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,200
That's the best photo I've ever taken
in my entire life.

2479
01:30:45,569 --> 01:30:47,510
That was the kind of romance
that I wanted.

2480
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:49,609
In that situation,
where you can't see anything,

2481
01:30:49,609 --> 01:30:52,309
there isn't a single ray of light.
But when we took photos,

2482
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:54,649
they turned out so great.

2483
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:57,849
From then on, all three of us were
immersed in taking photos.

2484
01:30:57,849 --> 01:30:59,319
(The three of them were busy
recording the night sky.)

2485
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:04,359
Unexpectedly, we could see
so many stars in that place.

2486
01:31:04,689 --> 01:31:06,660
You have to see it with your own eyes.

2487
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:09,960
You'd only be able to feel that
by going there in person.

2488
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,260
That's why you have to travel.

2489
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:13,370
I know. You have to travel.

2490
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:15,529
What time is it?

2491
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:17,069
- Now?
- It's 8:50 p.m.

2492
01:31:17,069 --> 01:31:18,569
- It's time for bed.
- Yes.

2493
01:31:18,939 --> 01:31:21,069
- Hey, I'm going to bed.
- Goodnight. Gosh.

2494
01:31:21,069 --> 01:31:23,080
- Get some rest.
- I'm going to bed. Goodnight.

2495
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:25,040
(The three guys feel sad to leave
as they head to bed.)

2496
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,410
You worked hard today.

2497
01:31:29,319 --> 01:31:32,889
(Goodnight, have myself)

2498
01:31:32,889 --> 01:31:34,290
You were talking in your sleep,
weren't you?

2499
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,090
(He hums a melody
as it's a shame to head to bed already.)

2500
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:38,290
(Flicking his fingers)

2501
01:31:39,019 --> 01:31:42,389
(The youngest tosses and turns
as the star-drunk eldest hums a tune.)

2502
01:31:42,899 --> 01:31:46,029
(Peaceful)

2503
01:31:47,069 --> 01:31:49,200
(I'm floating around)

2504
01:31:49,599 --> 01:31:53,510
(Don't stop me now)

2505
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:03,279
(The night grows deeper
with the three guys' memories.)

2506
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:14,260
(When they wake up, Baobab Avenue
is empty except for the three brothers.)

2507
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:18,029
(The morning view is more vast
than they imagined.)

2508
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,929
(Leaving that brilliance behind,)

2509
01:32:21,529 --> 01:32:23,269
(they head to the center of Madagascar!)

2510
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:24,970
(The capital city, Antananarivo)

2511
01:32:25,399 --> 01:32:27,040
(Unlike his lonely first visit...)

2512
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:28,939
(Wife Bottle, Son Dex)

2513
01:32:29,239 --> 01:32:31,210
(The three Madagascar Brothers
arrive together!)

2514
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:32,809
(Let's not act like we know each other
even if our eyes meet.)

2515
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:34,779
(They spontaneously get to have...)

2516
01:32:34,779 --> 01:32:36,349
(some free time!)

2517
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:39,050
(Is Kian84 faced with...)

2518
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:40,090
(another lightning party?)

2519
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,149
(As the eldest brother becomes one
with the lightning...)

2520
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:45,220
(The second and youngest brothers are
busy preparing a surprise birthday party.)

2521
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:48,429
(The eldest brother's second birthday
on Adventure by Accident)

2522
01:32:48,429 --> 01:32:49,460
(Cheers!)

2523
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,359
(The Madagascar Brothers go crazy
as they eat Korean food for his birthday.)

2524
01:32:52,569 --> 01:32:55,269
(Passionate Singer Bottle)

2525
01:32:55,269 --> 01:32:56,569
(Next up, the younger brothers serenade
Kian84 to congratulate his birthday.)

2526
01:32:56,569 --> 01:32:57,700
(I love you, Brother.)

2527
01:32:58,470 --> 01:33:00,670
(Everyone, how do you get to Madagascar?)

2528
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:02,439
(With NewJeans' "Hype Boy!")

2529
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:04,040
(Vocalizing)

2530
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,779
(Madagascar's karaoke is open
late into the night.)

2531
01:33:07,109 --> 01:33:09,080
(Into the scene
of the insane birthday party)

2532
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:10,580
(Adventure by Accident)
