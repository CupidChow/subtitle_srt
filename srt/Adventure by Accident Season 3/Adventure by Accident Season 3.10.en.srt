1
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,670
(Day 11 of the Madagascar Trip)

2
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,869
Oh, it's Day 11.

3
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,339
(A small island of Madagascar, Nosy Be)

4
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:35,350
(Nosy Be)

5
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,780
(Starting the morning in Nosy Be)

6
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,580
(Someone is washing up
with lots of ferocity.)

7
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,789
What? Is that me?

8
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,590
I thought that was Si Eon.

9
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,120
Oh, because that's my shirt.

10
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:46,660
Oh, you lent him your long-sleeve shirt.

11
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,660
And even his underwear.

12
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,460
Right. What would you have done
without him?

13
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,230
(He was able to borrow clothes
from Si Eon,)

14
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,169
(but since he doesn't have his bag,
he also doesn't have his mirror.)

15
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,340
Gosh. There's nothing to pack
because I don't have anything.

16
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:02,370
Normally, I would've taken the longest
to pack.

17
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,540
Since I didn't have anything to pack,

18
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,879
- Since I don't have anything...
- I could be very quick.

19
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,109
What a minimalist.

20
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,279
(In the next room, Kian84 and Pani Bottle
are getting ready to check out.)

21
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,679
(He only has a camera to pack...)

22
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,150
(Putting on the same clothes as yesterday)

23
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,190
This is the last time
I'll be wearing this shirt.

24
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,620
(Very familiar)

25
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,889
(Puffy face)

26
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,230
We're going to check out soon.

27
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:27,830
Then we'll head to an uninhabited island
on a boat.

28
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,529
(When they were in Antananarivo...)

29
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,299
You can light a fire on top.

30
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:33,499
(Pani Bottle looked into a boat
on which you can cook.)

31
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:35,439
- There's a boat like that?
- It's like a boat from "One Piece."

32
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,279
We haven't seen
such a beautiful ocean yet.

33
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:40,439
- That emerald color...
- Right. It wasn't emerald-colored.

34
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,809
How much is it for a day?

35
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,409
For 2 days and 1 night,
it's 1,000 dollars.

36
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:45,820
- It's 1,000 dollars?
- It's 1,000 dollars?

37
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,079
- It's 1,000 dollars?
- Since it's the last part of our trip,

38
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,689
- we can each pay 250 dollars.
- Right.

39
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,120
(The four brothers decide to rent a boat
for the last part of their trip.)

40
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,829
I had made a promise.

41
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,730
- Right.
- I promised Kian84...

42
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,260
in season two...

43
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,600
that I'd give him 1,000 dollars...

44
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,329
- if I got another nosebleed.
- Right.

45
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,529
(Everyone was struggling
with altitude sickness in India.)

46
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,969
(I have to get up to about 5,000m
to feel altitude sickness.)

47
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:06,969
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,070
(Stop acting tough.)

49
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:09,510
(If I get a nosebleed,)

50
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,510
(I'll give you 1,000 dollars.)

51
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,210
(And a few days later
on the way back to Korea...)

52
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,010
(Minus 1,000 dollars)

53
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,279
(He unbelievably got a nosebleed.)

54
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,419
(Tell me your bank account number.)

55
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,290
- So I was going to give it to him.
- Right.

56
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,219
But he wouldn't accept it.

57
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,260
So instead of giving him
the 1,000 dollars,

58
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,159
I paid for the boat.

59
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,059
- That's your payment for the nosebleed?
- He paid for the whole boat.

60
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:32,930
- So I paid for it myself.
- Oh, my.

61
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,329
I paid for it.

62
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:36,000
Hi, everyone.

63
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,570
Did you sleep well?

64
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,399
You're looking worse every day.

65
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,139
Did you get some sleep?

66
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,940
- I fell asleep late.
- What?

67
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,510
- I fell asleep late.
- Why? What were you doing?

68
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,049
We were chatting.

69
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,350
What?

70
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,980
- Dex and I talked all night.
- We were talking.

71
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,679
- Since you were in the same room?
- I see.

72
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:55,519
- On the same bed?
- Yes.

73
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,190
Let's hurry.
We don't have much time, right?

74
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,989
- Let's go.
- We need to take the tent.

75
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:02,660
Do we need a tent?

76
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,530
- Just in case.
- Just in case?

77
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,260
- To be honest, the mud hut...
- Is this it?

78
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,100
Gosh. That's so uncool.

79
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,470
I've never seen Si Eon say
he didn't need a tent.

80
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,970
We promised to build a house.

81
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,970
I came back to my senses the next day.

82
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,910
- Did the owner lend us this?
- Yes.

83
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,310
Let's go.

84
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,380
(Heading out to get on the boat!)

85
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,510
(Heading over to a big road
where they can find a tuk-tuk)

86
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,549
Hello.

87
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,820
Are we riding a tuk-tuk today?

88
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,919
That's right.

89
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,119
- We'll ride this.
- Okay.

90
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:32,290
We are going to the harbor.

91
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,889
- Okay?
- We promised to meet our guide...

92
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:35,089
at the harbor at 8 a.m.

93
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:37,130
- Nice.
- Let's split up and go in these two.

94
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,200
- Okay.
- Okay.

95
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,200
(Heading to the harbor!)

96
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,899
- Oh, my.
- Oh, what is that?

97
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,799
We wouldn't see this last night
because it was dark.

98
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:48,339
Oh, you're right.

99
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:51,339
Since we arrived in the evening yesterday.

100
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,750
At night, we couldn't see much
because there were no streetlights.

101
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,850
(When you pass through the small town
that is living in harmony with nature...)

102
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,989
- Oh, I can smell the ocean.
- Oh, my.

103
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,859
Gosh. Look at those yachts.

104
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:07,019
They're not just wooden boats.

105
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,989
This is a big harbor.

106
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,459
There are yachts over there,
and over here...

107
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:13,200
Our boat should be here somewhere.

108
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,600
- Wait...
- Oh, I think I just saw our boat.

109
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,470
- Yes. Isn't it the brown one?
- It's the same one we saw yesterday.

110
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,500
Right.

111
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,600
Is this it?

112
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,010
(Arriving at the harbor feeling excited!)

113
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,609
Oh, my. There are so many.

114
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,980
- Here is 70,000 ariaries.
- Service.

115
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,049
Thank you.

116
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,780
- Let's go.
- Shall we get going?

117
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,450
- Yes.
- Let's go.

118
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,250
On the way to the harbor,
we stopped by a supermarket...

119
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,690
- and did some grocery shopping.
- I see.

120
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,190
- We brought a lot of stuff.
- Since we were going camping.

121
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,089
Pani Bottle. There's no boat.

122
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,290
- Right. Why isn't the boat...
- Let's wait a bit.

123
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,800
Isn't it the brown sailboat
from yesterday?

124
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,029
What kind of fish is this?

125
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,930
Why isn't anyone here?

126
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,740
- What is that?
- Is this the boat rental?

127
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,399
- Oh, this is what we're going on?
- Hey, this is 1,000 dollars?

128
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,539
- Yes. We have a booking.
- What is that?

129
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,979
- What?
- Only the color is the same.

130
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,349
I'm sure that's not it.

131
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,550
Hello. Nice to meet you. Yes.

132
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,920
- So this is the small boat today.
- Okay.

133
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,219
Oh, we're riding this.

134
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:09,620
- Okay.
- Okay? So you guys come inside.

135
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

136
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,560
- And the big boat is just over there.
- I see.

137
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,120
- Oh, it's a means of transportation.
- Okay.

138
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,060
- Since the big boat can't anchor down.
- Okay. Give me your bag.

139
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,159
Thank you.

140
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,200
(Getting on the small boat
feeling relieved)

141
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
- Slow down.
- Slow down.

142
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:23,000
- Okay. Can I help you?
- Yes. Thank you very much.

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,769
- Be careful.
- What's your name?

144
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,000
- Ash.
- Ash? Okay.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,570
Ash. Nice to meet you.

146
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,510
Are you the captain?

147
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:32,339
- Captain?
- No.

148
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,750
- The captain is there.
- Okay.

149
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,180
Let's go!

150
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:38,079
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, yes!

151
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,779
Are you ready for the adventure?

152
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:40,849
- Yes!
- Yes. Sure.

153
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,320
- Okay, good.
- Adventure.

154
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,889
So, how is the weather today?

155
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,519
- Good. It's a good day for snorkeling.
- It's good to swim. Yes.

156
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,029
- Oh, really? Good condition?
- Yes.

157
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,229
- Good condition.
- Nice.

158
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,500
That must be it. Over there.

159
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
(Oh, my!)

160
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:58,700
- Oh, my!
- Guys.

161
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:00,670
(They can see it in the distance.)

162
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,539
- Oh, that's it.
- Oh, my.

163
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,610
- It's so cool.
- It was very cool.

164
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,680
(This sailboat has a cool, classic style.)

165
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,039
What a cool boat.

166
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,110
So cool.

167
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,550
(Oh, my!)

168
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,279
The boat Yerpe was building
when we first got here.

169
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:18,560
(Yerpe was building a big boat.)

170
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,860
(And Florant said it was his dream
to have a big boat.)

171
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,599
Also, there was the boat we pulled
onto the water at the ceremony, right?

172
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,459
(And the boat they pulled
at the launching ceremony...)

173
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,329
I think it's a boat like that.
A wooden vessel.

174
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,969
A middle-sized boat
in "Pirates of the Caribbean."

175
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,610
It was very romantic.

176
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,279
That wooden vessel
was more romantic than I expected.

177
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,680
Seeing that reminds me
of Yerpe and Florant.

178
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,680
(How cool...)

179
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,180
- Yes!
- Nopi Be.

180
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,019
- Luffy Be?
- Yes.

181
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:47,180
The name is Luffy Be?

182
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:48,719
- Luffy Be.
- Luffy Be?

183
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,219
You were talking about "One Piece."

184
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,389
Do you know what Nopi Be means in English?

185
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,959
I don't know. Just "One Piece?"

186
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,529
- No. It means a big dream.
- Big dream.

187
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,899
So "One Piece" today is going to be us.

188
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,959
- What a nice thing to say.
- Hello.

189
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,500
I think he's the captain.

190
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,000
- Captain. Hello.
- Captain.

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

192
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,800
- This is Frat. The big boss.
- Hello.

193
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,269
- So he's the captain.
- The big boss.

194
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:11,010
- Oh, he's kind of like...
- Captain.

195
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,479
"Pirates of the Caribbean."

196
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,610
- Hello.
- Hello.

197
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,380
Oh, I guess we climb up from here.

198
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,519
(Getting on carefully, one at a time)

199
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,490
This boat is very stable.

200
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:25,089
This is nice.

201
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,620
The boat doesn't shake much.

202
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,019
This is nice.

203
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,360
- Oh, a bedroom. Amazing.
- Let me...

204
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:33,829
Oh, there's a room here.

205
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,170
So fascinating.

206
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,969
Oh, this is nice.

207
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,839
Unbelievable.

208
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:41,639
Hey, this is crazy.

209
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,709
- You all seem satisfied.
- Right.

210
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,180
(Everyone loves the wooden boat.)

211
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,839
The boat itself was very beautiful.

212
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,979
Also, we could sail with the wind.

213
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,219
In the back, there was room for steering.

214
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,389
There were cooking tools as well.

215
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:56,450
It's so nice.

216
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:59,560
The bed was very romantic as well.

217
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,120
(A normal deck was transformed
into a romantic resting area.)

218
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,829
Oh, my. There's even a bedroom inside.

219
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,529
There were 6 or 8 rooms...

220
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:06,360
set up like dorms underneath.

221
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,029
Since it's our last trip,

222
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:10,969
I picked a boat
that we wouldn't be able to forget.

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,899
(Totally satisfied)

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,399
Today,

225
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:18,539
we'd like to visit
some good, beautiful island...

226
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:19,579
- for camping.
- Yes.

227
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,810
Snorkeling and diving.

228
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,110
- And camping?
- Yes.

229
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,180
(Out of the many islands
surrounding Nosy Be...)

230
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,920
Oh, you don't have a destination yet?

231
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,789
We hadn't decided which island to go to.

232
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,860
So I asked him to suggest a nice place.

233
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,329
So for all of that,
I recommend to you Nosy Iranja.

234
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,599
- Iranja? Nosy Iranja?
- Nosy Iranja?

235
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:42,599
- Nosy Iranja is a beautiful place.
- Okay.

236
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:46,570
- Yes? The sea is very sparkly. Okay?
- Okay.

237
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,510
That means it's good for everything.

238
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,909
- Snorkeling and diving. It's perfect.
- It's nice.

239
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:53,279
He was also a snorkeling expert.

240
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,610
- How long?
- How far is it from here?

241
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,209
From here to there,

242
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:58,320
- it'll take us about 5 to 6 hours.
- Iranja.

243
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,849
- About 5 to 6 hours?
- Oh, that takes quite long.

244
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,349
Since we were on a sailboat
powered by the wind,

245
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:04,719
we had to sail slowly
for about 5 to 6 hours.

246
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,060
Jack Sparrow!

247
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,989
Captain Jack Sparrow.

248
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,560
Men. Put the sail up.

249
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:14,129
(Getting ready to go by opening the sail)

250
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:15,499
They're not doing so
because I told them to.

251
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:17,829
(Impressed)

252
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:19,599
(Fascinated)

253
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,339
(Working hard)

254
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,670
- I feel like I'm watching a movie.
- A sailboat.

255
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,280
Gosh. This is totally
like "Pirates of the Caribbean."

256
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,040
(The sail is going up slowly.)

257
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,280
Oh, look at that. Gosh.

258
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,879
Gosh. Good!

259
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,249
Oh, my. They push it up so high.

260
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:36,050
This can't be done by one person.

261
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,119
Look at that. Gosh.

262
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,719
- That's how you do it.
- Speed up.

263
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,959
(Spreading all of the sails
and speeding up!)

264
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,129
- Oh, my.
- So cool.

265
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,599
Going on a sailboat is so romantic.

266
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,999
It would be a lot faster
to go by motorboat,

267
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,969
- but it's not our goal to be fast.
- Right.

268
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,040
(Controlling the direction)

269
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,170
I've never seen a boat like this.

270
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,280
(Sailing a bit slowly,
but with lots of romance)

271
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,280
My men. Open the sails!

272
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,650
(Trusting the wind
and heading off to Nosy Iranja)

273
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,420
Oh, dolphin!

274
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,119
- Where?
- Dolphin!

275
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,650
- Dolphin.
- Dolphin?

276
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,820
- Where?
- Where?

277
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,820
- Over there.
- Oh, my!

278
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,020
(Over there)

279
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,890
- Dolphin?
- Where?

280
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,030
(A wild dolphin appeared!)

281
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,959
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

282
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:21,560
You saw a dolphin
as soon as you headed out?

283
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:24,200
We didn't just see one.
We saw a group of them.

284
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,770
(The dolphins came to greet
our four brothers.)

285
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,739
- How pretty.
- I saw them.

286
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,540
Cute dolphin.

287
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:34,940
We're really heading out on a boat.

288
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,849
(Feeling great)

289
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:38,820
- You must feel so happy.
- How cool.

290
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,950
I like it.

291
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,420
- What a beautiful shot.
- Yes.

292
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,820
- It's like "The Old Man and the Sea."
- "The Old Man and the Sea."

293
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:46,459
There are not many chances
to ride a boat like that nowadays.

294
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,560
Hey, look at that boat.

295
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,759
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

296
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,859
- Oh, what is that?
- Oh, my.

297
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,869
- Oh, what is that?
- What is this?

298
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:58,440
They're transporting something.

299
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,570
There are so many islands here.

300
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,599
(We can get a glimpse into the lives
of the locals through these boats.)

301
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,109
It's so beautiful.

302
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:06,579
I think it's even cooler
that it's a wooden boat.

303
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:09,249
- I think so.
- Right.

304
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:13,050
I think I like wood
more than stainless steel.

305
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,520
We all imagine what it'd be like
to sail across the ocean...

306
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,089
in the boat that looks like it's out
or a movie or animation...

307
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:24,160
with some romance added.

308
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:27,959
It was so romantic. It reminded me...

309
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,369
of the Age of Exploration.

310
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,070
It's like something from a dream.

311
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,040
Going into the open sea.

312
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,469
The water looks totally like CGI.

313
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:38,140
How is the ocean so blue?

314
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,479
Gosh. There's no end.

315
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:43,249
My heart feels so majestic.

316
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,849
It really felt
like we were going on an adventure.

317
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,550
So now we're coming up to the beast mode.

318
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:52,660
- Good!
- Perfect.

319
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,890
Gosh. The color of the ocean.

320
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,489
- The weather was so nice.
- Yes.

321
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:59,359
(Nice and cool)

322
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,229
My friend. Picture?

323
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,670
One second.

324
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,469
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

325
00:13:05,469 --> 00:13:06,700
(Taking off his pants first)

326
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,300
Why does he keep doing that
since yesterday?

327
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:09,869
(He keeps showing off
his processed meat body since yesterday.)

328
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:12,209
Everyone knows
the color of his underwear now.

329
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:14,410
- It's my swimsuit.
- I'm afraid.

330
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,379
Don't worry.

331
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,709
Dex.

332
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:18,879
(Dex joins in.)

333
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:20,849
(Holding Pani Bottle)

334
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,249
(Pure, unprocessed smiles)

335
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,660
Okay.

336
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:28,089
One, two, three.

337
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,660
- It looks like the Yellow Sea.
- Isn't that Incheon?

338
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,060
(Madagascar, not the Yellow Sea)

339
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,959
Firstly, I think the weather is very nice.

340
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,499
- Gosh.
- Gosh. The sun is getting hotter.

341
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,170
(Taking something out)

342
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,280
(Putting on sunglasses)

343
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,109
(Pani Bottle's gift,
Oh, this is comfortable!)

344
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:49,709
- It's comfortable.
- Nice.

345
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:51,349
- Oh, you put on the sunglasses.
- Yes.

346
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,249
(Pani Bottle desperately prayed
for Kian84 to wear sunglasses.)

347
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,589
It's Tle's wish.

348
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,119
(He even gave it to Kian84
as a birthday present...)

349
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:02,089
(A lukewarm response)

350
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,089
(From his reaction,)

351
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:05,859
(I don't think he's going to use it.)

352
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,930
(He had only accepted
the thought behind the gift.)

353
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,070
Oh, sunglasses are nice.

354
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,499
- Those are nice ones.
- Yes.

355
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:13,839
You're finally experiencing civilization.

356
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,170
How did I live until now
without wearing sunglasses?

357
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,270
It's so comfortable.

358
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,979
Kian84 got a taste of civilization.

359
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:20,140
My eyes are so comfortable.

360
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,579
(Feeling proud)

361
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,979
I was very worried. Kian84...

362
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:25,820
- What is this?
- What is this?

363
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,079
- What is this dog?
- What is this?

364
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,249
I was doing my interview,

365
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:30,589
- and this dog kept coming.
- What is this camera angle?

366
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,759
I didn't think he'd use the sunglasses.

367
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,989
As someone who likes Kian84...

368
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:37,290
(What is this?)

369
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:39,499
What is this?

370
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:40,530
(They've never seen
a dog taking up the whole shot before.)

371
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,430
- So cute.
- You make us laugh with anything.

372
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,999
- Gosh. My stomach hurts. What is that?
- Gosh. So funny.

373
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,099
- That dog is stealing your spotlight.
- He didn't seem to want to wear it,

374
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:49,609
but when we got on the boat,
he wore it a lot...

375
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,469
and said this.

376
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,509
"Gosh. I'm so late
to using something so nice."

377
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:55,209
Just him saying that...

378
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,150
felt like the best feedback
Kian84 can give about something.

379
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,219
Proud Bottle.

380
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:02,349
I was so moved and felt so proud.

381
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:04,589
- Gosh.
- My eyeballs feel comfortable.

382
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:05,959
- And those sunglasses suit him.
- Yes.

383
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,320
- Thanks, Pani Bottle.
- He looks so happy.

384
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,290
You kept caring about that.

385
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:12,160
How about painting on the boat?

386
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,259
Okay.

387
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:17,170
First, we need to paint on the flag.

388
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,170
(They decide to paint on the flag
on their way to the island.)

389
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,300
Si Eon. Bring me that.

390
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,940
(We need to paint on the flag at the end.)

391
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,070
(That's our tradition
on Adventure by Accident.)

392
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,339
We need to continue our tradition.

393
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,209
Let's do it.

394
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:32,020
Oh, no.

395
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:33,379
(Si Eon brought out something
from his bag.)

396
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:34,650
- What is it?
- What?

397
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,550
We didn't have anything to draw on.

398
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:40,089
I brought the towel...

399
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,959
I used on the South America trip.

400
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:44,660
We ended up painting
on the back of that towel.

401
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,959
They weren't selling any flags.

402
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:48,700
- Oh, it was a towel.
- A sports towel.

403
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:51,670
Oh, that would look cool
to make it into a long flag.

404
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,940
- Si Eon.
- Yes?

405
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,509
Write "by Accident" here.

406
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,609
"by Accident 3."

407
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,339
Adventure... I always get confused.

408
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:04,150
- It starts with an E, right?
- A. Gosh.

409
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:06,849
- I always get confused with spelling.
- It starts with an A.

410
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,050
I just can't remember
how things are spelled.

411
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,020
(From the day he drew the first logo
about a year ago...)

412
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,390
- I wrote it with an E at first.
- What?

413
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,660
(Ed...)

414
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:18,459
(He was also confused by the spelling
in South America.)

415
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:20,499
- How can you forget that?
- Does adventure start with an A?

416
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:22,329
(It should just be called
Edventure by Accident now.)

417
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:24,030
A?

418
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,869
- A.
- A.

419
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,770
- Goodness.
- I like that he's always the same.

420
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,270
He feels like a nephew
in elementary school.

421
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,609
Gosh. This is almost as good as canvas.

422
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:35,079
(Singing)

423
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:36,979
Oh, how fun.

424
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:40,749
We were on the boat for quite a long time.

425
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,589
- Right.
- It was fun.

426
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:45,660
Gosh. Painting on a boat. How cool.

427
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:47,560
Let's each sing a song.

428
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,890
Something that suits this boat.

429
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:51,390
"Prince of the Sea."

430
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,259
(Nice song choice.)

431
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,800
Oh, he's still painting.

432
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,530
<i>Prince of the sea</i>

433
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,570
All of a sudden?

434
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,400
<i>To the sea</i>

435
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,109
I think
they're all singing different songs.

436
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,640
That's "Woman on the Beach" by COOL.

437
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:07,579
(Woman on the beach)

438
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,349
(Just humming for now)

439
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,849
(Sudden going wild)

440
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,650
- <i>Everything inside</i>
- Sir.

441
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,089
- <i>Throw it away</i>
- It's a tour bus.

442
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,489
- Sir.
- Sir. Go home and go to bed.

443
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:20,060
- He drank too much.
- You drank too much, sir.

444
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,589
It looks like they all had a drink.

445
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,959
(To the sea)

446
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,660
Do you know the "One Piece" song?

447
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,900
"One Piece?"

448
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:30,200
(This is it, right?)

449
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,170
(By chance when I was a child)

450
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,599
This is the most famous song
in this category.

451
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,009
Everyone born in the 90s knows this.

452
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:40,440
I don't. I just know Jong Min sang it.

453
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,379
(I heard something unforgettable)

454
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,890
Sailing reminded me
of the animation series "One Piece."

455
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:52,820
We kind of each had our own roles.

456
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,660
I assisted other people...

457
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,759
and made reservations.

458
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,930
(His singing skills were extra.)

459
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,300
Dex fought with the locals,

460
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,700
for sport, of course.

461
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:04,670
Si Eon was like a mom.

462
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,300
- He took care of us and cooked for us.
- Totally.

463
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,640
Kian84 was our leader.

464
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,969
- Put the sail up.
- You all had unique roles.

465
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,640
Since we each had our roles,

466
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,180
it felt like we've become...

467
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,810
main characters of "One Piece"
when we were sailing.

468
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,280
- Right.
- Right.

469
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,119
You have a good system
for deciding who does what.

470
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:25,089
(The song of adventure dreamers sing)

471
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,190
(Dancing,
even though he doesn't know the song)

472
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,729
(Be brave you can do it)

473
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,660
It's time for Shinji.

474
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,269
(Time passes by without rest)

475
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,830
(Paji is here.)

476
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,299
Paji.

477
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,940
(What is that sound?)

478
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,670
(We can't let it go like this)

479
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,180
- Oh, my!
- Paji.

480
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,309
- He's good.
<i>- Together</i>

481
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:49,350
(What a nice voice.)

482
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,450
"What a nice voice."

483
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,150
(Drum, dancer)

484
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,519
- Yes.
<i>- Let's go</i>

485
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,249
(Getting to the climax
with the dancing and beat supporting him)

486
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,350
- Oh, you're so good.
- Yes!

487
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,519
Everyone!

488
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:04,690
(The fierce wind and strong waves)

489
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:07,200
<i>- Even if they get in our way</i>
<i>- Even if they get in our way</i>

490
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,430
(Sneaking in some harmony)

491
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,670
(We are not afraid)

492
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,370
(Throughout the endless ocean...)

493
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:18,539
(rings the joyful songs
of our 4 unique adventurers.)

494
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,080
(This is for a bright tomorrow)

495
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,650
- One Piece!
- One Piece!

496
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,049
- Nice.
- That's right.

497
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:29,420
- You have to sing "One Piece" on a boat.
- Nice harmony.

498
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,650
(Our dancing machine isn't stopping.)

499
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:32,289
(Dex joins in.)

500
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:33,660
The party isn't stopping.

501
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,959
Sir. Mister. Please go downstairs
and go to bed.

502
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,330
He's dancing with his father. Oh, Son.

503
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:43,830
That was the first time on this show
I had fun while heading somewhere.

504
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,430
Let's go!

505
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,840
Can we do some fishing while on the boat?

506
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,140
- I saw fishing poles.
- Yes. There are fishing poles.

507
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:51,209
- Ash?
- Yes.

508
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,809
- Fishing?
- Oh, yes. It's already on there.

509
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:55,950
Oh, okay.

510
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,249
You can even fish?

511
00:19:57,249 --> 00:19:58,479
There's everything on this boat.

512
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,850
I'm Korean sashimi.

513
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:03,650
"I'm sashimi."

514
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:05,590
(You're not a person?)

515
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,660
- You're sashimi?
- Yes.

516
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,890
Yes. Sashimi.

517
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,489
Oh, yes. Good. Sashimi.

518
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:13,259
Let's catch some tuna.

519
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:14,759
If so,

520
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,269
I'll try my hand at fishing...
Oh, it's hot!

521
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,469
Hold on. Oh, it's hot.

522
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:23,569
The deck was so hot. It got heated.
Oh, it’s hot. Gosh.

523
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,539
The floor is like a pit of fire.

524
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:28,809
Okay. I'll let it out a lot.

525
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:30,350
So it can go far.

526
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:32,279
Around this much.

527
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,479
(Holding the fishing pole
over the open sea)

528
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:34,580
It's pretty long.

529
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,950
Fishing from a moving boat...

530
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,559
is for catching big fish.

531
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:41,190
- I see.
- I was excited about that.

532
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,590
- Are they going to catch a big one?
- Right?

533
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,789
- Let's catch something big...
- Something big.

534
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:46,630
Like tuna or swordfish.

535
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,059
(Spinning, a hard-working fisherman)

536
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:51,269
(While Kian84 is busy painting...)

537
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:54,200
(These 2 don't have much to do.)

538
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,539
Should we try breaking this papaya?

539
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,380
Oh, the papaya you bought
when you went grocery shopping?

540
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,309
(Peeling the papaya
since they don't have anything to do)

541
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:02,509
It goes in easily.

542
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:05,150
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

543
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:06,380
(Opening wide)

544
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,950
- I've had this before.
- Oh, my.

545
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,590
(Meanwhile, Pani Bottle
is waiting for a big fish.)

546
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:11,920
(Oh, my)

547
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,489
- I've had this before.
- Oh, my.

548
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:16,759
(Running right over
at the mention of food)

549
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:18,660
As soon as he heard
something about food, Pani Bottle...

550
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,200
(Happy)

551
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:21,559
What is this?

552
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,400
(Eating a bite right away)

553
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
(Satisfied)

554
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:28,799
Kian84.

555
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:30,670
Oh, give me a big one...

556
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,680
A big one?

557
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,709
- It's like a melon, right?
- It's totally like a melon.

558
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:40,450
(Taking a big bite)

559
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,120
- Gosh. That looks so ripe.
- Nice.

560
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,719
- Was it tasty?
- It tasted like melon.

561
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,420
It did have a strong melon taste.

562
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,459
(Eating papaya very well)

563
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:50,430
There's so much to eat.

564
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,729
(While the four brothers eat papaya...)

565
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,100
(Taut)

566
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,269
- Oh, something bit.
- Oh, my.

567
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,370
- That's crazy.
- No way.

568
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,870
(Checking with his touch)

569
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,910
- This is so delicious.
- Hey.

570
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:05,469
This is really good.

571
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:06,509
Hey.

572
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,380
- What?
- Hey. Hurry up.

573
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,110
- Hurry up. Get the fishing rod.
- What?

574
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,680
- We got one? Really?
- The fish!

575
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,120
- Gosh. He's a YouTuber indeed.
- He's a YouTuber indeed.

576
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,819
- He's a YouTuber indeed.
- That's important. I must bring a camera.

577
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,559
(Did we get a fish?)

578
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,890
I'm curious. Let's see.

579
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,499
- Right now?
- Okay.

580
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:29,170
- Reel it in.
- Reel it in.

581
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,100
(The eldest brother reels in the line.)

582
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
- Where is it?
- It's hot. Gosh.

583
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:36,870
- It's huge!
- Can you see it?

584
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,440
- It's huge!
- Really?

585
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,779
(Screaming)

586
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,009
(Where is it?)

587
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,979
- Gosh.
- It's this big.

588
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,650
- It's a tuna!
- Are you serious?

589
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,680
- It's a tuna?
- It's this big.

590
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,350
- Hey, that's a huge catch.
- What?

591
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,850
You finally got a huge fish!

592
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,559
- The feeling of reeling in that fish...
- Gosh.

593
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:55,420
The size of the fish was...

594
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,759
- How big is it?
- Gosh.

595
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,360
(The tuna slowly gets close.)

596
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,830
- Bring a landing net!
- What in the world...

597
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,640
- It's a monster!
- Gosh.

598
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,940
(The fish looks big even at a glance.)

599
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:11,610
(Hello. Who are you?)

600
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,640
(Even a crewman helps them
reel in the line.)

601
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,380
- Is this a big catch? What is that?
- I mean...

602
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,450
(Here it is!)

603
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:21,680
Gosh. Is this a mackerel?

604
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,989
(Welcome)

605
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,860
(Is it a tuna?)

606
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,529
(What a big fish!)

607
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,400
- Gosh. That's huge.
- Gosh.

608
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,569
- Gosh.
- What?

609
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,100
That's a huge fish.

610
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:43,209
(Amazed)

611
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,170
(Hello, guys.)

612
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,509
- What? Gosh.
- Hey.

613
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:47,680
This looks like a mackerel.

614
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,779
They said it was a type of mackerel.

615
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:51,279
Gosh. They're so tasty.

616
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,319
- They don't have a lot of bones.
- Gosh. That's amazing.

617
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,519
Hey, this will be enough for us.

618
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,850
- We don't need another fish.
- Right.

619
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,620
Doesn't it look like
it's 50cm long at a glance?

620
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,789
(The fish is big enough
to feed the four brothers.)

621
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,420
(Impressed)

622
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,489
(I'll enjoy the fish.)

623
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,759
This is the biggest fish
of all the fish I caught so far.

624
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:07,759
It's huge.

625
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:11,930
There are activities
middle-aged people ought to enjoy.

626
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:15,269
There's some kind of entertainment.
Anyway, that's what people say.

627
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:17,870
While sailing through the Pacific Ocean,

628
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:21,580
we reeled in that monster-like fish
with a fishing rod.

629
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:24,910
To me, this was the best form
of entertainment I wanted to experience...

630
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,350
as a middle-aged man.

631
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,819
It was a dream of mine
I had been saving up...

632
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:32,559
until I became a middle-aged man.
And I got to try it for the first time.

633
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,690
Gosh. It was the best.

634
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:38,330
- The ship was full.
- It was full for us.

635
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,229
You guys didn't even plan to fish.

636
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,799
Si Eon.
Can you slice the fish for sashimi?

637
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,870
No.

638
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:45,769
(He doesn't know how to slice the fish.)

639
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,039
- Let's grill it.
- That fish...

640
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,640
- Then let me slice it for sashimi.
- Okay.

641
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:51,610
Dex, have you done that before?

642
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,239
- Gosh. It's not that hard.
- All right.

643
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:55,209
Okay. Let's go and slice it for sashimi.

644
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:56,880
Yes. Sashimi? Nice.

645
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,209
You can do this.

646
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,150
- It was so fresh.
- Right.

647
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,249
It was a waste to grill the fish.

648
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,989
Of course. It would be a waste.
You ought to try it.

649
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:05,690
(The chef stands
in front of the cutting board.)

650
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,660
(Slicing)

651
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,489
(He slices it without any hesitation.)

652
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:10,729
- Dex is good.
- Gosh.

653
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:12,459
Have you sliced a fish for sashimi
before that?

654
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,830
Actually, it was my first time too.

655
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,999
- Really?
- But you were so good.

656
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:16,729
- You were so good.
- You didn't even hesitate.

657
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:18,900
- Kian84 loves sashimi.
- Right.

658
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,140
So I gave it a try.

659
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:23,340
Can I have clean water?

660
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,110
(Sure.)

661
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:29,779
Wait. Hold on. Is that clean water?

662
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:30,779
It's seawater.

663
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,620
Thank you. Saltwater?

664
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,819
I see. They use seawater like this.

665
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,920
Well, that was their way of life.

666
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,019
It will season the fish.

667
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:42,489
Right.
You won't have to dip it in soy sauce.

668
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,930
(After cleaning the fish strips,)

669
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:49,200
(the chef cuts them into thick slices.)

670
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,670
Gosh. That looks pretty good.

671
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,739
(Meanwhile, the guy nicknamed
the Korean Sashimi...)

672
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:57,539
I had brought gochujang from home.

673
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:58,569
Awesome.

674
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,680
- He was making chogochujang.
- I made it.

675
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,019
- Gosh. That's amazing.
- Everyone had their own roles.

676
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:08,150
One of us sliced the fish.
One of us made the sauce.

677
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,120
- One of us... Right.
- There was always a way.

678
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,390
(Cooking, drawing,)

679
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,390
(and so on...)

680
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,860
(The roles are
somewhat divided systematically.)

681
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:17,559
All done.

682
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,729
This is good enough.

683
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,860
- Gosh. That looks amazing. Look at that.
- That looks tasty.

684
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,130
- Gosh.
- On the open ocean in Africa.

685
00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:26,269
Ash. Sashimi.

686
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:28,200
- I see.
- Korean-style sashimi.

687
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:30,469
(He generously dips the fish
in chogochujang.)

688
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,580
Yes. Try it, Ash.

689
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,150
(It's tasty.)

690
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,709
It can be spicier.

691
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:40,049
Spicier? No.

692
00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:43,289
(The captain has a slice too.)

693
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:44,749
The captain tried it too.

694
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:45,959
- Good?
- It's a party.

695
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:48,259
- Yes. Very nice.
- Very nice?

696
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,430
(The third-eldest brother
quickly has a slice.)

697
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,930
The sashimi is melting in my mouth.
Seriously.

698
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,630
Gosh. It was so good.

699
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,870
I bet it was so good.

700
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,340
(The eldest brother gives a slice
to the youngest who cut the fish.)

701
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:04,009
(Humming)

702
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:05,110
This is it.

703
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,180
(The second-eldest hasn't tried it
as he was busy drawing.)

704
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,880
It looks a bit crunchy.

705
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:16,120
Yes. This is it. This is the texture.

706
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,420
It was crunchy.

707
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,860
Gosh. Everything tastes good
on the ship like that.

708
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,930
I'm glad that sashimi is popular.

709
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,660
The captain loves it too.

710
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,029
Dex, you must be proud.

711
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,900
(Happy)

712
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:34,370
(Pani Bottle happily whistles
as he's full.)

713
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,900
Everyone is feeling good right now.

714
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,039
Right. Everyone is excited.

715
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,039
(Let's use our excitement as fuel
to head to Nosy Iranja.)

716
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,440
Gosh, this is nice.

717
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,279
I'm Korean Coffee.

718
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,420
- I'll mix some Korean coffee.
- Korean Coffee?

719
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,219
Yes. You can taste it.

720
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,450
- Okay.
- Wait.

721
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,090
- This is Korean coffee. This is for you.
- Okay.

722
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,890
- So...
- How do you say, "Thank you," in Korean?

723
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,160
"Thank you."

724
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,900
- "Thank you."
- "Thank you."

725
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,059
Do you want hot water?

726
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,330
Ice.

727
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,600
- Ice cubes.
- Ice cubes.

728
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:08,069
(Wait a moment.)

729
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,110
Some hot water. And...

730
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,140
What is it?

731
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,680
- Sorry. I don't have ice cubes.
- Gosh.

732
00:28:13,979 --> 00:28:15,880
- Is this okay? Okay.
- Thank you.

733
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,309
- Perfect.
- Dex, let's break it and add it.

734
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,910
I see. He froze water bottles.

735
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,219
They practically live on the ship.

736
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:22,279
Right.

737
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,219
(Smashing)

738
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,660
Gosh, Dex.

739
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,819
(He smashes it
to break it into pieces of ice.)

740
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:28,989
He's good at everything.

741
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,130
Two each.

742
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,489
(He generously prepares
to add 2 sticks each.)

743
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:35,330
- Hot water. Okay.
- Pour it for me, Dex.

744
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,670
Hot water. And cold water.

745
00:28:39,229 --> 00:28:40,870
(The captain gets a cup first.)

746
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,969
- For you.
- For you.

747
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:45,739
(Whistling)

748
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,279
(His reaction is unusual.)

749
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,479
(Impressed)

750
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:49,749
His reaction was cool.

751
00:28:49,749 --> 00:28:50,809
Hey, Pani Bottle.

752
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:53,880
- Have a cup of coffee.
- Thank you.

753
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,450
- I can't say no to iced coffee.
- Cheers!

754
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,789
"I can't say no."

755
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:00,319
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

756
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,529
- This is really good.
- Right?

757
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,690
It's really rich and smooth.

758
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:08,400
- Gosh. It's sweet.
- Oh, yes.

759
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,799
It's tastier on the ship.

760
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,969
I'm in a good mood.

761
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,870
We're almost done with the drawing.

762
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,410
(Drawing)

763
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,539
All done. I finished it.

764
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,279
Gosh. Drawing was the only thing
I did on this ship.

765
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:22,479
Good work.

766
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:24,610
- I drew for over two hours.
- Gosh.

767
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:27,049
I think Kian84 is such a good artist.

768
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:28,719
Gosh. That looks amazing.

769
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:29,950
(The masterpiece is complete
after many hours.)

770
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,249
- You draw really quickly.
- Yes!

771
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,160
I think that's the best flag
we've had so far.

772
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,590
This is our flag.

773
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:39,029
This flag has the highest quality
of all the other flags.

774
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,059
Right.

775
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:42,400
- It's Dex who won over all the women.
- Okay.

776
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:45,569
(Thanks to his bright smile,)

777
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:47,640
(he was popular everywhere he went.)

778
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:50,009
(The cute youngest brother, Dex)

779
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,640
And this is Pani Bottle.

780
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,809
- He's always smiling.
- Yes.

781
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:55,180
(He's always smiling.)

782
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,680
- Let's go!
- He's always smiling.

783
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,850
- And that's me with the floral hat.
- Okay.

784
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,650
I'm always pouting. Look at my lips.

785
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,950
- You look good with that on.
- The hat looks great on you.

786
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,289
(The beautiful floral hat
and his pouting lips)

787
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,489
(The proud leader of the group, Kian84)

788
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,489
- And...
- There's Bob Marley.

789
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:12,900
- Bob Marley.
- He suddenly joined us.

790
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:18,299
(He surprised everyone
with his sudden appearance.)

791
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:20,769
(The reliable eldest brother, Lee Si Eon)

792
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,069
- The symbol of Madagascar, baobab trees.
- Gosh.

793
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:26,640
- Pani Bottle drew them.
- He's good at drawing too.

794
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,580
Pani Bottle is good
at depicting the contrast.

795
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,180
I think he also drew in the sunset.

796
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,180
- Yes.
- Right.

797
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,580
- He's indeed an art major.
- Right.

798
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:37,489
(They were in awe of the baobab trees that
had been around for thousands of years.)

799
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:41,420
As for the number three here,
that's the tail of a leaf monkey.

800
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,660
- You used the tail? Gosh.
- It's the tail.

801
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:46,630
- Gosh. He's so clever.
- Goodness.

802
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,459
(He had finally met ring-tailed lemurs
and fulfilled his long-awaited wish.)

803
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:54,100
I used the colors
from the flag of Madagascar in the tail.

804
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,769
- It's a meaningful decision.
- This is amazing.

805
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,340
You included everything in the flag.

806
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,340
(He drew Madagascar in one flag.)

807
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,640
Why don't we hoist the flag?

808
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,380
- Sounds good.
- Okay!

809
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:04,850
I was looking forward to that.

810
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,380
I was wondering
if it would flutter or not.

811
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:10,690
We got the approval from the captain
and hung it up.

812
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,690
- Yes. Let's do it together.
- Yes.

813
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,319
- Come here.
- Let's do it together.

814
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,390
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

815
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,630
(The hoisting ceremony was a bit sloppy,
but they did it on each other's count.)

816
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,229
- Slowly.
- Slowly.

817
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,900
- Pull it. Nice.
- Thank you.

818
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,400
(Snapping)

819
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:30,509
- What?
- It's still there.

820
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:31,870
- No!
- We got it.

821
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,380
It could've been really bad.

822
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,180
- It could've flown away.
- It's still hanging there.

823
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:37,779
- Gosh. Our dream...
- No.

824
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,279
- What?
- Our dream...

825
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,249
(He climbs up barefoot.)

826
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,489
- Oh, my gosh.
- Gosh.

827
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,519
- His toes are so strong.
- Gosh.

828
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,860
I've only seen this in movies.

829
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,390
He climbed up by using his toes.

830
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:50,930
(He dangerously approaches the flag.)

831
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,160
He's like a soldier in the special forces.

832
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,259
- Gosh. He's almost there.
- That's dangerous.

833
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:57,430
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

834
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,640
People who have been sailing
for a long time...

835
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,969
(Showing their respect)

836
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:03,269
A round of applause with respect.

837
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,880
(He relies on his toes
and carefully climbs down.)

838
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,539
Gosh. That was no joke.

839
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,249
How can he do that?

840
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:13,180
I have so much respect for him.

841
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
(Thanks to the crewman,
they retrieve the flag.)

842
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:17,690
They are true crewmen.
They're so resourceful.

843
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,690
When we hoist the flag this time,
let's do this count.

844
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,219
One, two, three. One.

845
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:24,160
- Okay.
- We must do it slowly.

846
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,459
Start.

847
00:32:25,489 --> 00:32:27,799
- One, two, three. One.
- One, two, three. One.

848
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:31,430
(They slowly hoist the flag
on the count of the eldest brother.)

849
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,340
- One, two, three. One.
- One.

850
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,039
- One, two, three. One.
- One.

851
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,309
- One.
- One.

852
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:37,809
- I think it's working.
- One.

853
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:39,779
- One. Stop.
- Hey. That's...

854
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:40,940
- Hey.
- Hold on.

855
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,509
- Okay.
- We got it.

856
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:43,680
A bit higher.

857
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,209
- Pull it.
- Okay. One.

858
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,420
- Okay. It went over now.
- Gosh.

859
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,690
Pull it now. One, two.

860
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,289
(The flag goes up high
as they pull it together.)

861
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:54,489
Gosh. Look at that teamwork.

862
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:00,160
(We did it!)

863
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:01,259
Nice.

864
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,729
Gosh. That's cool.

865
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:05,569
It's fluttering.

866
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,039
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

867
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,769
Gosh. That's a real flag.

868
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,410
- I feel so proud.
- Gosh.

869
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,239
- It's fluttering a lot...
- I feel so proud.

870
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:13,610
- now that it's up.
- Yes.

871
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:15,410
The flag went up nicely.

872
00:33:15,709 --> 00:33:16,950
Gosh. Look at the fluttering flag.

873
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,519
(The flag of the four brothers
freely flutters away.)

874
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,120
Doesn't it feel like we're putting an end
to our trip with the flag?

875
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:26,660
When the flag fluttered away in the wind,

876
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,190
it felt like our story was complete.

877
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,789
Dex, Pani Bottle, Si Eon, and me.

878
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:35,259
It felt like we were a complete group now.

879
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:36,900
Adventure by...

880
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,330
- Accident!
- Accident!

881
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:45,610
(A new memory of the four brothers
on this adventure by accident)

882
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,840
What a thrill.

883
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,440
(A new memory of the four brothers
on this adventure by accident)

884
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,549
This is refreshing.

885
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,150
Renting this ship was a great decision.

886
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,920
- Yes.
- It was.

887
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,319
(Adventure by Accident 3)

888
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,390
That's so cool.

889
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,559
(Our moment will be remembered
with full of youth.)

890
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,890
Gosh. This is nice.

891
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,529
It's bringing back my memories now.

892
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:08,529
- Right?
- Watching the footage like this...

893
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,830
Forty-one. Forty-two. Who wants them?

894
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,969
I'll take either 39 or 40.

895
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,370
I see. You'll go snorkeling.

896
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,170
My stuff didn't arrive at the airport.

897
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,739
I had to rent the gear from them.

898
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,809
Will they lower anchor here?

899
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,080
(They're close to their destination
in no time.)

900
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,110
Have you arrived?

901
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:28,950
- Let's get ready and get off.
- Okay.

902
00:34:29,549 --> 00:34:30,789
- A big ship like this...
- Please help me with this.

903
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:32,420
- can't go near the island.
- Okay.

904
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,660
- We had to switch to a small boat.
- You just go down. We'll give it to you.

905
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:37,630
(They take the most precious item,
the flag, first.)

906
00:34:38,729 --> 00:34:41,299
(Then they take the snorkeling gears
and tents too.)

907
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:43,330
- The shoes are under the chair.
- Under the chair.

908
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,400
Nice.

909
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,400
Gosh.

910
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,870
- It's an emerald-colored ocean now.
- Look at the color of the ocean.

911
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,370
Right? The colors of the ocean changed.

912
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,239
(Since their departure,)

913
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,410
(the colors slowly changed
until their flag-hoisting ceremony.)

914
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:01,680
The colors changed.

915
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,350
(The ocean gives off
the color of pure emerald green.)

916
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,090
I saw a scenery I had never seen before...

917
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,690
- the closer we got to the island.
- Gosh.

918
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:08,390
This is crazy. Gosh.

919
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,430
Goodness. This is incredible.

920
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:11,860
Gosh. You can see through everything.

921
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,029
(They cut through the clear water
to their destination.)

922
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,830
(Nosy Iranja)

923
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,069
"Iranja."

924
00:35:19,269 --> 00:35:22,039
It's known as the best vacation spot
in the Archipelago of Nosy Be.

925
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,569
Here's some information about Nosy Iranja.

926
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,779
It has a beautiful ocean
which turns into a shade of cobalt.

927
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:28,680
What stands out about the island
is a small island...

928
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,049
named Iranja Kelly which is connected
to Nosy Iranja through a sandy beach.

929
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,779
The 2km-long sandy path emerges
during low tides.

930
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:36,520
That place should be called the paradise.

931
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,719
It's the first time we're seeing
such a beautiful vacation spot.

932
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:42,589
Right. I must enjoy it vicariously
through the footage.

933
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,460
(They arrive at Iranja
after 6 hours of sailing.)

934
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,000
We were laughing and having fun.
So time just flew by.

935
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,830
What time is it?
The sun might go down soon.

936
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,100
- Should we go snorkeling first?
- Sure. I'm neutral.

937
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,469
- Are you okay with that?
- Yes.

938
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:56,469
Okay.

939
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,669
- Let's put our stuff down first.
- Okay.

940
00:35:58,669 --> 00:36:00,509
If you want to play in the water,
go ahead.

941
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,910
Right. You can't go into the water.

942
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,609
- Or...
- I need a swim tube.

943
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,649
Or we'll go and play in the water.
You can set up the tents.

944
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:09,890
(You can set up the tents.)

945
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:12,750
I love doing water activities.
But I had surgery done on my ear.

946
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,560
- Right.
- They told me not to go into the water.

947
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,560
I actually brought my own swim tube
because I wanted to go into the water.

948
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,189
(Chuckling)

949
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,259
First of all, now that we've landed...

950
00:36:22,259 --> 00:36:24,169
- I should put it in here.
- To celebrate our landing...

951
00:36:24,169 --> 00:36:25,870
(Sticking in the flag
to celebrate their landing)

952
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,270
(Doing his best)

953
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:32,669
(Feigned laughter)

954
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:34,910
(The eldest brother
is inflating the swim tube.)

955
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,180
We should...

956
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,180
(He's just spacing out.)

957
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,379
Dex isn't talking.

958
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:42,549
Gosh. I don't have any of my stuff.
So I don't have anything to do.

959
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,620
I should be the busiest one here.

960
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:48,620
Right. He should be taking stuff out
from his backpack right about now.

961
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,620
- Right.
- You know?

962
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,489
(He took out a pull-up bar
as soon as he unloaded his backpack.)

963
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:54,230
(Amazed)

964
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,200
(He's used to customize his setup
with his fancy equipment.)

965
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,569
(Comfortable)

966
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,770
I've never had
this kind of experience before.

967
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,879
I always started before the others.

968
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:08,939
And I was always the last one to finish.

969
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:11,609
But I had to watch other people
for the first time.

970
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,520
Then I was observing the other guys.
"What are they doing?"

971
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,689
He had nothing to do
because he didn't have his stuff.

972
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:17,989
- I've never seen him...
- He didn't have anything.

973
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:19,020
- stand up absent-mindedly like that.
- Right.

974
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,319
Then it made me think in their shoes.
All this time,

975
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:23,589
the other guys must have been
so frustrated while watching me.

976
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,259
You won't be carrying a lot of stuff now.

977
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,060
I should still carry some stuff.

978
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,930
Dex. Pani Bottle.

979
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,399
- What happened with your bags then?
- Yes.

980
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,299
- Right.
- Luckily,

981
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:35,439
when we were on this island,

982
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:37,210
our stuff arrived
at the airport on Nosy Be.

983
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:38,969
After our trip, we collected our bags...

984
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:40,879
at the airport on our way back.

985
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:41,879
That's a relief.

986
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,379
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

987
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:45,580
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

988
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:48,350
- Let's go. The sun is blinding.
- The sun is blinding.

989
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,379
(They set out to go snorkeling.)

990
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:52,319
Gosh, my eyes sting. Darn it.

991
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:53,919
(Groaning)

992
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,359
It's bearable for me
because I've been training my eyes.

993
00:37:57,489 --> 00:37:58,730
Indeed. The trained eyes are different.

994
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,259
- He doesn't avoid the sun.
- Right.

995
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:03,270
I should have trained my eyes too.
I'm regretting it.

996
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,500
Train his eyes?

997
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,069
- That's nonsense.
- My eyes hurt.

998
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:08,239
(At ease)

999
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:11,370
(He's not at ease.)

1000
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:14,310
It's the emerald-colored ocean
I only dreamed of seeing.

1001
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,980
The weather was great
given it had rained the night before.

1002
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,950
The weather was amazing.

1003
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:20,419
It's incredible. Seriously.

1004
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,419
Pani Bottle, should we go in there?

1005
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:24,020
- This way? Okay.
- Yes.

1006
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:26,689
Let's go that way and toward the tree.

1007
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,620
You must have been excited at this moment.

1008
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,859
I was excited.

1009
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,299
- Gosh. Nice.
- Gosh.

1010
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,529
- It's cool.
- How nice.

1011
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:38,029
(Going under)

1012
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:39,969
(Silky hair)

1013
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:42,600
- He's coming up now. Gosh. Right.
- Gosh. There's the slow-motion effect.

1014
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:46,140
- Whenever he goes into the water,
- The slow-motion effect.

1015
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,439
the video plays slowly.

1016
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:54,049
(This irresistible man has dominated
the ocean of Iranja now.)

1017
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:56,620
(You just wait!)

1018
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,250
(Here we come!)

1019
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,120
- He's rushing in.
- There's the frilled lizard.

1020
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,259
That's his signature move.

1021
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:06,960
(He started from the Ganges
and passed through Morondava.)

1022
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,500
Only the location has changed.

1023
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,799
(He dives into the water
in the never-changing pose.)

1024
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,169
(The four of them dive into the ocean!)

1025
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:17,339
We can see the bottom of the ocean
through the water.

1026
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,739
(The four of them dive into the ocean!)

1027
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:22,509
(He thoroughly puts on
the snorkeling gear.)

1028
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,379
(Seal84 smoothly swims through the ocean.)

1029
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:26,850
Let's go, Seal84!

1030
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,020
(Kian84 dives into the water.)

1031
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,689
(Pani Bottle dives into the water
as well.)

1032
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,290
(The youngest is also ready.)

1033
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:39,390
We're going to
where the water level is deep.

1034
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,100
Gosh. Look at the color.

1035
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,200
Isn't this amazing?

1036
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,069
(Then the eldest brother
is lagging behind.)

1037
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:48,239
- Oh, no. He's cast away.
- It was tough.

1038
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,669
- Someone should've taken care of him.
- Gosh, Si Eon.

1039
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,580
(Spotting the eldest brother)

1040
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,109
(Looking deserted)

1041
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,609
(He turns around right away.)

1042
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:02,419
(Dex swims toward the eldest brother.)

1043
00:40:02,419 --> 00:40:04,489
- He's fast.
- "Here I come, Si Eon."

1044
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:07,189
I ought to take care of him.
Who else is going to do that?

1045
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:09,189
(Grabbing)

1046
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,660
(Dex!)

1047
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,259
(Rescuing)

1048
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:16,029
Dex Turbo!

1049
00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:17,129
(Dex Engine is on.)

1050
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,930
Dex Turbo. Yes!

1051
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,069
Dex. Let's be friends forever.

1052
00:40:26,669 --> 00:40:28,379
(Grabbing tightly)

1053
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,939
Gosh, this is nice.

1054
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,149
We were at the ocean together.

1055
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,819
I wanted Si Eon to enjoy this moment...

1056
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:39,219
at the same pace as us.
That's what I wanted the most.

1057
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,120
Gosh. Dex is so sweet.

1058
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,390
(He swims away after rescuing Si Eon.)

1059
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,390
(The snorkeling brothers
are together again.)

1060
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:49,399
(They start snorkeling in earnest!)

1061
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:51,100
The water was really clean.

1062
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,569
We've never seen this kind of view before.

1063
00:40:52,569 --> 00:40:53,600
- Right.
- You know?

1064
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,040
It's such a stunning view.

1065
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,210
I could see everything
because the water was so clear.

1066
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,439
(They excitedly explore
the underwater world.)

1067
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:02,339
The water is so clear.

1068
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:04,080
It's clear.

1069
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,250
(The water is as transparent
as it can get.)

1070
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:11,219
We haven't seen...
I mean, I thought we'd see some fish.

1071
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,489
- I don't see any fish.
- There was no fish.

1072
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:16,790
Kian84. Are there any fish?

1073
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,100
We need to go farther, Si Eon.

1074
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,430
- Let's go.
- We had to go in deeper.

1075
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,839
(They go deeper into the ocean.)

1076
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:30,000
Gosh. The guys kept going without
any hesitation even if the water was deep.

1077
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,540
(Screaming)

1078
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,350
- He must have seen something.
- What is it?

1079
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:38,549
(Spotting something)

1080
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:39,549
What did he see?

1081
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:41,819
Right here. There's a school of fish here!

1082
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:44,989
(Right here.
There's a school of fish here!)

1083
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,930
- At last.
- Gosh.

1084
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,060
(An unrealistic view unfolds
under their feet.)

1085
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,969
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1086
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,939
I remember that.

1087
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,939
- Gosh. That's it.
- Goodness.

1088
00:42:06,939 --> 00:42:08,310
- Gosh.
- That's a lot of fish.

1089
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,339
(Excited)

1090
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:10,850
Over here.

1091
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:13,310
(I saw them too!)

1092
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,919
I was having a blast.

1093
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,290
It was the highlight of our trip
in Madagascar.

1094
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,919
I personally love swimming in the ocean.

1095
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,520
(Diving Bottle is indeed in his element.)

1096
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,460
Right. It was on his bucket list.

1097
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:30,129
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1098
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:33,100
- Look at the blue fish. Goodness.
- Gosh. Check them out.

1099
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:37,169
(He's unable to look away
at the sheer beauty.)

1100
00:42:37,169 --> 00:42:38,439
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

1101
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,969
It was incredible.

1102
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:42,710
I see a lot of fish.

1103
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:44,980
- I see a lot of fish.
- Yes.

1104
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,450
(The youngest also dives in
as if he was waiting for it.)

1105
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,580
He looks so free in the water.

1106
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:52,520
It was the exact ocean I had imagined.

1107
00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:55,689
The turquoise...

1108
00:42:56,189 --> 00:42:57,460
warm water.

1109
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,129
Under the water,
there were so many kinds of fish.

1110
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:04,200
The water was so warm.

1111
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,469
It was a perfect sea for snorkeling.

1112
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,669
Oh, my goodness.

1113
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,540
It was just so beautiful.

1114
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,509
I like going underwater.

1115
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,750
I thought I should look at the sea
properly this time.

1116
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,180
He has a nice posture.

1117
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,080
It's hard to dive in like him.

1118
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,719
I know. He's very good.

1119
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:28,660
Gosh. Look at the coral.

1120
00:43:29,259 --> 00:43:30,489
Look at the color.

1121
00:43:33,129 --> 00:43:35,930
- He looks like a merman.
- That's cool.

1122
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,529
- Merman Bottle.
- Gosh.

1123
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,730
I saw striped beakfish.

1124
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,839
(Excited)

1125
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:44,040
Gosh.

1126
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,879
- Did you see the school of fish?
- Yes.

1127
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,339
Weren't they striped beakfish?

1128
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,649
(They thoroughly enjoyed the sea,
which is a gift of nature.)

1129
00:43:51,649 --> 00:43:53,109
It was just...

1130
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:54,419
Your wish was granted.

1131
00:43:54,419 --> 00:43:56,520
(He's still feeling it.)

1132
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:58,819
(There are lingering feelings
in his nose as well.)

1133
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:00,189
(Squeaking)

1134
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:01,719
Are you okay, Kian84?

1135
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,330
I'm good.

1136
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,660
(He's catching his breath for a moment.)

1137
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,399
(The youngest doesn't want
to come out of the water.)

1138
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:11,600
It seems like he's from the sea.

1139
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,100
(The youngest doesn't want
to come out of the water.)

1140
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,569
(The eldest one dives in again.)

1141
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:22,480
- My gosh!
- What is it?

1142
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:24,879
My gosh!

1143
00:44:24,879 --> 00:44:25,910
What is it?

1144
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,620
(The camera is shaking all of a sudden.)

1145
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,919
- What is it?
- Oh, my.

1146
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,750
What's going on?

1147
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:35,259
Wait. Did it bite him?

1148
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:36,890
- No.
- What? Is it a shark?

1149
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,730
My gosh!

1150
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:40,060
It's a sea turtle.

1151
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,669
(In front of his eyes,)

1152
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:47,299
(there's a sea turtle.)

1153
00:44:47,299 --> 00:44:49,770
- It's big.
- It might be 100 years old.

1154
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:53,140
It got me surprised.

1155
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:56,939
(It's just amazing.)

1156
00:44:56,939 --> 00:44:58,180
Was he that close?

1157
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,210
Gosh, it's so big.

1158
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,680
(Pani Bottle goes underwater in a rush.)

1159
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,219
It was so...

1160
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:04,419
Did you see a fish?

1161
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,120
(What is it?)

1162
00:45:08,989 --> 00:45:10,589
(Shouting)

1163
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,529
I've seen a turtle in the water.

1164
00:45:12,529 --> 00:45:14,500
But I've never seen a turtle
as big as that one. It was huge.

1165
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:20,569
(Making an eye contact)

1166
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:22,140
- It's cute.
- It's eating.

1167
00:45:22,669 --> 00:45:26,469
(A thrilling eye contact
with the sea turtle)

1168
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:30,080
(This is amazing!)

1169
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,850
Pani Bottle recorded it.

1170
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,049
(Director Pani Bottle's super close shot)

1171
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:35,180
Gosh.

1172
00:45:36,049 --> 00:45:38,189
(Breathing heavily)

1173
00:45:38,189 --> 00:45:39,489
It's this big!

1174
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:41,589
(It's this big!)

1175
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,430
Si Eon is coming too.

1176
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:47,560
(Wait for me.)

1177
00:45:48,029 --> 00:45:49,629
I think there's something over there, Dex.

1178
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,529
(Let's go see the sea turtle too!)

1179
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:53,330
I would've not seen the sea turtle
if it weren't for Dex.

1180
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:55,399
Dex, come on.

1181
00:45:55,799 --> 00:45:58,339
(In a hurry)

1182
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,009
No matter how much I look at it...

1183
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,279
It's as big as me.

1184
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:04,580
- Its face is...
- So cute.

1185
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,710
It's so cute.

1186
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,649
(Si Eon has finally come.)

1187
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:15,890
(A moment of mystery and wonder)

1188
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:17,529
That's incredible.

1189
00:46:17,629 --> 00:46:19,430
It's beautiful...

1190
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,899
that they were swimming together.

1191
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,200
It's really big.

1192
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,430
- It's so big.
- It's fascinating.

1193
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,669
My gosh.

1194
00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:30,239
(He dives in again with excitement.)

1195
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,669
(Amazed)

1196
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:35,609
(Impressed)

1197
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:38,509
It wasn't just one.

1198
00:46:38,509 --> 00:46:39,750
- Really?
- There were many turtles.

1199
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,919
There were so many of them.

1200
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:43,819
Turtles.

1201
00:46:45,149 --> 00:46:47,319
(One turtle, two turtles!)

1202
00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:49,189
- There were many of them.
- They're a couple.

1203
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,430
- It's awesome.
- They're cute.

1204
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,100
- It's mind-blowing.
- The way it moves is so beautiful.

1205
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,799
The way their flippers move is beautiful.

1206
00:46:56,129 --> 00:46:57,930
- It looks like it's flying in the sky.
- It looks like a bird. Yes.

1207
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,439
Do you see dark spots?

1208
00:47:02,439 --> 00:47:05,009
The dark spots that are moving
are turtles.

1209
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:07,279
There are three turtles just in this spot.

1210
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,180
Turtles...

1211
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:17,649
were my favorite animals
when I was little.

1212
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:22,419
It was amazing to watch them in person.

1213
00:47:23,419 --> 00:47:25,330
They looked like mystical creatures.
Is it the right word?

1214
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,960
They looked like mystical creatures.

1215
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,629
When people see a big fish in the water,

1216
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:32,730
they say it's from the underwater palace
of the Dragon King.

1217
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,270
It did look like a mystical creature
from the underwater palace.

1218
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:35,339
It's marvelous.

1219
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:37,000
They must be very old.

1220
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,910
They must be much older than me.

1221
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:40,680
On the other hand,

1222
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,640
I also hoped they would live long.

1223
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,810
- Right.
- I hope they don't get trapped...

1224
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,609
in fishing nets,

1225
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:49,549
resulting in a population decrease.

1226
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,689
Because they're beautiful creatures.

1227
00:47:51,689 --> 00:47:53,219
They look so beautiful.

1228
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:57,859
They were much cuter
than the turtles I saw on TV.

1229
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,589
It was fascinating.

1230
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:04,000
I'll start calling them Golden Retrievers
in the water from today.

1231
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,799
I'm not going to lie.
It was this big for real.

1232
00:48:07,799 --> 00:48:11,040
Divers get happy when they see turtles.

1233
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,640
They kind of symbolize luck.

1234
00:48:13,669 --> 00:48:15,779
It made me think...

1235
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:19,149
that things would go well.

1236
00:48:23,419 --> 00:48:25,489
(It made him feel
that something good might happen.)

1237
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:26,850
- Look at its tail. I've never seen it.
- Look at its tail.

1238
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:28,359
- He kind of looks like a dinosaur too.
- The tail makes it look like a dinosaur.

1239
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:30,489
- They look like different species.
- I know.

1240
00:48:34,129 --> 00:48:36,399
They say things will go well
if you see a turtle on a show.

1241
00:48:36,399 --> 00:48:38,529
- Right.
- That's why you received the Grand Award.

1242
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:40,370
- Right.
- He saw it up close too.

1243
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,469
- Thank you.
- I know.

1244
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:44,509
You brought good luck with you.

1245
00:48:44,509 --> 00:48:45,669
The number of awards we received
might be the same...

1246
00:48:45,669 --> 00:48:47,140
as the number of turtles we saw.

1247
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:48,540
Maybe.

1248
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,480
That's the Grand Award.
And that's the Rookie Award.

1249
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,549
(The Grand Award, the Rookie Award,
the Excellence Award)

1250
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:54,319
- The Screenwriter of the Year.
- The Screenwriter of the Year.

1251
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,779
(The Screenwriter of the Year)

1252
00:48:55,879 --> 00:48:57,350
- Best Program Award.
- Best Program.

1253
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:59,020
- They represent all the awards.
- Right.

1254
00:49:01,259 --> 00:49:02,819
There are many turtles.

1255
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,330
They're huge.

1256
00:49:06,589 --> 00:49:08,799
- It's no joke.
- In the water,

1257
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,000
I already saw three turtles.

1258
00:49:11,969 --> 00:49:14,100
(They can't calm down easily.)

1259
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,870
I saw turtles too.

1260
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,370
(In this vast sea)

1261
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,439
They received a lot of good energy
from the sea.

1262
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,080
It's just the four of them.

1263
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,379
It was just us there.

1264
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,080
(They didn't feel the passage of time
while swimming.)

1265
00:49:28,819 --> 00:49:30,020
Dex.

1266
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,919
Dex. Come here.

1267
00:49:33,689 --> 00:49:34,689
Coming.

1268
00:49:34,689 --> 00:49:35,989
(I'm coming.)

1269
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,189
Pani Bottle. Dex.

1270
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:42,160
- Prepare a 4-cylinder engine.
- Prepare a 4-cylinder engine.

1271
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,160
"A four-cylinder engine."

1272
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,370
- Prepare a 4-cylinder engine.
- Prepare a 4-cylinder engine.

1273
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,540
It's completed.

1274
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,739
(The four excited brothers are together.)

1275
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:51,810
It's ready. We're ready to go.

1276
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:54,009
- Lie back.
- Here we go!

1277
00:49:54,009 --> 00:49:55,040
Let's go!

1278
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,910
(The swim ring with a 4-cylinder engine
is departing.)

1279
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:00,980
It's fast.

1280
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:04,390
(I'm excited.)

1281
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:06,950
It was just the four of us.

1282
00:50:07,189 --> 00:50:09,419
- That's the most fun part.
- They're excited like children.

1283
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:11,529
It felt like we rented the entire sea.

1284
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:15,299
Sideboard, stop. Portside, row.

1285
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,669
What? Where is the sideboard?

1286
00:50:19,469 --> 00:50:21,000
- That side.
- What is he talking about?

1287
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,600
They need to do a post-recording.
I don't understand.

1288
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,509
- It's working now.
- Get closer.

1289
00:50:25,509 --> 00:50:27,210
(They're making a fuss,
but they're sticking together.)

1290
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,379
(- They look so happy.
- I know.)

1291
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:33,009
- The turtles...
- The turtles were there until the end.

1292
00:50:33,009 --> 00:50:34,779
- were behind us.
- They were sending them off.

1293
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,689
(The sea turtles sent them off
until the end!)

1294
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,189
It was fun.

1295
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:42,819
(They're just having fun.)

1296
00:50:43,419 --> 00:50:45,830
(Staring)

1297
00:50:46,529 --> 00:50:48,460
The sky is so high.

1298
00:50:50,399 --> 00:50:51,669
Because nothing was blocking the view.

1299
00:50:51,669 --> 00:50:53,669
(Looking at the blue scenery
they're going to miss,)

1300
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,200
(they came back to the land.)

1301
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,410
- This way.
- Hang in there just a little bit more.

1302
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,910
We did it.
My feet are touching the ground.

1303
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,609
(Exhausted)

1304
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:07,919
But I used so much energy. I was tired.

1305
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,319
(Flopping)

1306
00:51:13,219 --> 00:51:14,359
Captain!

1307
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,120
Captain!

1308
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,219
(The captain fainted.)

1309
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:18,589
They know how to have fun.

1310
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,930
(The sailors
who tried to save the captain...)

1311
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:25,969
(passed out as well in the end.)

1312
00:51:26,969 --> 00:51:28,870
Everything was so good.

1313
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:31,040
The four of us...

1314
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:36,040
spending the time together.
Everything about it was great.

1315
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:40,379
The time the four of us spent together
touched my heart.

1316
00:51:41,379 --> 00:51:43,680
(It became their trip now.)

1317
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,120
- Adventure by Accident!
- Adventure by Accident!

1318
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:50,359
No other place would be more perfect
to be our last destination.

1319
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,730
It was a good choice.

1320
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,330
(No other place would be more perfect
to be our last destination!)

1321
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:56,259
Seeing so many sea turtles...

1322
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:59,169
I hope they live a long life.

1323
00:51:59,169 --> 00:52:00,200
(They're done with swimming.)

1324
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:01,939
So look.

1325
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,109
We decided to make a mud hut.

1326
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:06,910
(It's time to make a mud hut and eat.)

1327
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,810
I want to check in at a hotel.

1328
00:52:11,649 --> 00:52:13,049
I'll go check in.

1329
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,980
You guys make a mud hut
and sleep together.

1330
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,319
(You guys make a mud hut
and sleep together without me.)

1331
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,919
He became a city boy.

1332
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:20,390
(The captain became a city boy.)

1333
00:52:20,689 --> 00:52:21,919
Let's try it at least.

1334
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:24,989
- Let's try to imitate it.
- If we can't make a mud hut,

1335
00:52:24,989 --> 00:52:27,259
let's find a place to sleep separately
and meet tomorrow morning.

1336
00:52:27,259 --> 00:52:29,060
Two people to cook
and two people to make a mud hut?

1337
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,160
Two people to make a mud hut.

1338
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:31,870
I'll make a mud hut then.

1339
00:52:31,969 --> 00:52:33,299
I'll cook with Si Eon then.

1340
00:52:33,299 --> 00:52:35,040
Because Dex should make a mud hut.

1341
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,669
- You're right.
- Yes.

1342
00:52:37,169 --> 00:52:38,270
We're Team Mud Hut.

1343
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,669
Let's move now.

1344
00:52:40,669 --> 00:52:43,439
(Let's move!)

1345
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:46,649
(There's a sunset glow on the beach.)

1346
00:52:46,649 --> 00:52:48,219
This is a paradise.

1347
00:52:48,219 --> 00:52:49,850
- Let's take pictures. Bring the camera.
- Look at the sunset.

1348
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,219
It's pretty.

1349
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:53,649
It's the last sun
in Adventure by Accident.

1350
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,520
- It's the last night.
- The last sunset...

1351
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,689
in Adventure by Accident.

1352
00:52:56,689 --> 00:52:59,589
- Night is approaching.
- It's the final sunset.

1353
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,230
Gosh, 15 days have passed yet again.

1354
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,330
- Time flies.
- It does, and it's too fast.

1355
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:07,029
It flew too quickly this time.

1356
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,899
Where should we build the house?

1357
00:53:11,069 --> 00:53:12,270
My goodness.

1358
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:15,680
Stand there, everyone.

1359
00:53:16,009 --> 00:53:18,009
It's backlit, but it's pretty,
so I'll just take a photo.

1360
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:20,450
- Just look at that side.
- Oh, look there?

1361
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,919
(Taking a photo
with the sea in the background)

1362
00:53:22,779 --> 00:53:24,850
You should hold the jacket
over your shoulders like this.

1363
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:28,819
I learned that I must bring
a camera for a trip.

1364
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:29,919
I see.

1365
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,189
Look at the boat floating there.
My goodness.

1366
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,359
(It's like a picture.)

1367
00:53:34,359 --> 00:53:37,430
Why does this place look like
the Eddy stage of Tekken 3?

1368
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:39,669
- Oh, that.
- I get your point.

1369
00:53:39,669 --> 00:53:41,669
- I know.
- Right? Let me show you.

1370
00:53:42,339 --> 00:53:43,799
- Si Eon
- One hundred dollars.

1371
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:46,140
- Do you want to play Tekken 3?
- Here?

1372
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,239
Which character do you want? I'll be Eddy.

1373
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:50,779
- I'll be Hwoarang.
- Hwoarang? Okay.

1374
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:54,419
(They battled at Uyuni Salt Flat
a year ago.)

1375
00:53:54,419 --> 00:53:55,819
(Kian84, Lee Si Eon)

1376
00:53:55,819 --> 00:53:57,020
I'm tired.

1377
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,250
He's full of energy.

1378
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:00,450
(Si Eon won the battle.)

1379
00:54:03,759 --> 00:54:05,930
- I'm going to win!
- There are people watching them.

1380
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,529
His posture is good.

1381
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:08,899
(Fancy kick)

1382
00:54:08,899 --> 00:54:11,000
- Attack!
- He's good.

1383
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,040
(Lee Si Eon, Kian84)

1384
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,299
(Take this!)

1385
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,609
What was that?

1386
00:54:20,609 --> 00:54:21,609
(Eddy84 uses fancy techniques.)

1387
00:54:21,939 --> 00:54:24,180
(Chaotic)

1388
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:27,480
Put your guards on.

1389
00:54:31,089 --> 00:54:34,859
Thank you, MBC for using money
on this meaningless battle.

1390
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:36,790
I'm sorry!

1391
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:37,830
(He's very satisfied although he says so.)

1392
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:39,330
Si Eon.

1393
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:41,299
- Are you going to cook?
- Of course.

1394
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,960
Shall I ask if we can camp here?

1395
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,330
- I'll ask on my way.
- Okay.

1396
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,669
- Let's see.
- Also, we need charcoals.

1397
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:51,310
- Let's go, Bottle.
- Yes.

1398
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:54,509
How shall we build the house?

1399
00:54:56,009 --> 00:54:57,509
It's a pop-up tent.

1400
00:54:59,279 --> 00:55:00,980
- This is...
- Oh, it requires one touch.

1401
00:55:03,549 --> 00:55:04,689
Are you done?

1402
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:06,890
This is so convenient.

1403
00:55:07,989 --> 00:55:09,790
- We'll get going.
- Okay.

1404
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,390
- Thanks for your efforts.
- Goodbye.

1405
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,129
Shall we have the entrances
facing each other?

1406
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,560
- The wind is blowing from the back.
- Yes.

1407
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,899
- I think it's better to face here.
- Okay.

1408
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,000
(They completed setting up...)

1409
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,140
(the tents together.)

1410
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,410
Pop-up tents are convenient.

1411
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,169
(Let's see.)

1412
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,239
One of the tents is smaller.

1413
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:31,310
Is it small?

1414
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:33,879
- One was for two, and one was for one.
- It's small.

1415
00:55:33,879 --> 00:55:35,149
I don't think it'll fit two people.

1416
00:55:35,319 --> 00:55:36,450
Look. It's small.

1417
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,189
- Where would one sleep?
- Why is it so small?

1418
00:55:38,189 --> 00:55:39,219
We need to play rock-paper-scissors.

1419
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,489
I don't think we all can sleep here.

1420
00:55:41,919 --> 00:55:43,859
Someone needs to sleep in a sleeping bag.

1421
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,730
I think I need to build...

1422
00:55:47,029 --> 00:55:48,930
- a hut.
- Seriously?

1423
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,700
- I don't think we can all fit here.
- We can't.

1424
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,730
- I said I'll sleep outside...
- Here...

1425
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:55,500
- the tent while eating dinner last night.
- Yes.

1426
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:59,040
So I wanted to build a hut
even though it might be flimsy.

1427
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:02,410
(Searching for the building materials
for his hut)

1428
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,509
Any branches to use.

1429
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:06,850
Would there be any?

1430
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,520
I really wanted to try to build a hut.

1431
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:14,689
I read "Robinson Crusoe"
with great interest when I was young.

1432
00:56:14,689 --> 00:56:17,020
I think I read it ten times.

1433
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:19,859
While reading, I imagined it in my brain.

1434
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:22,660
Oh, he's doing like this and that.

1435
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,629
If I were ever to experience drifting,

1436
00:56:24,629 --> 00:56:26,899
I would like to build a cabin
and try creating something.

1437
00:56:26,899 --> 00:56:29,939
I had this dream since I was young.

1438
00:56:29,939 --> 00:56:31,939
I thought I must try this here.

1439
00:56:32,009 --> 00:56:33,669
Although this isn't a deserted island,

1440
00:56:33,669 --> 00:56:36,540
I had the thought of
"If not now, then when?"

1441
00:56:37,779 --> 00:56:40,210
(Selecting the materials carefully)

1442
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:41,779
(Picking up)

1443
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,520
(Picking up again)

1444
00:56:46,149 --> 00:56:47,149
(Picking up the third time)

1445
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:50,189
(He's full of passion.)

1446
00:56:50,189 --> 00:56:51,529
Where are you bringing those from?

1447
00:56:51,529 --> 00:56:53,859
You're like a magpie building its nest.

1448
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,430
He kept picking things up.

1449
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,029
- Like a magpie.
- Yes.

1450
00:56:58,029 --> 00:57:00,129
(Magpie Dex dreams of
building his own house.)

1451
00:57:01,939 --> 00:57:02,969
You're amazing.

1452
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:07,739
(My goodness)

1453
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:09,279
This is a rare item.

1454
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,379
(He gains an item.)

1455
00:57:11,379 --> 00:57:12,480
- Oh, my.
- That's important.

1456
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,180
- For the roof.
- He needs to put it on the floor.

1457
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,589
- What?
- He continuously picks things up.

1458
00:57:18,589 --> 00:57:19,689
My goodness.

1459
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:23,160
(Carrying)

1460
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,660
(Struggling)

1461
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,899
- It was very heavy.
- It looks very heavy.

1462
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:33,669
(My goodness)

1463
00:57:34,939 --> 00:57:37,169
I wanted to keep my promise.

1464
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,310
Hey.

1465
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,879
He brought all the trash near us.

1466
00:57:43,879 --> 00:57:45,149
Stop.

1467
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:47,779
How many kilos is that? Isn't it heavy?

1468
00:57:47,779 --> 00:57:49,279
It's heavier than the last time.

1469
00:57:49,279 --> 00:57:51,589
- It's much bigger.
- It was about 50kg.

1470
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,520
Let me set the location.
The wind is blowing this side.

1471
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,160
- Yes.
- So I should block here.

1472
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,830
- Then, I need to...
- Yes.

1473
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,660
plant a long tree trunk here.

1474
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,859
- Then?
- Here.

1475
00:58:02,859 --> 00:58:04,359
There's a long tree trunk.

1476
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:05,899
- Yes.
- Once I plant it here,

1477
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:08,100
it makes a space for me to enter.

1478
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:10,299
(Oh, I see!)

1479
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:13,339
I may be a genius.

1480
00:58:13,439 --> 00:58:14,580
My idea bulb lightened.

1481
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,640
- Is he going to make it?
- Will he make it?

1482
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:19,850
What? It's temporary.

1483
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:21,480
Like this?

1484
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,020
No!

1485
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,290
I already made the framework.

1486
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,620
What is this?

1487
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,689
(What is that?)

1488
00:58:27,819 --> 00:58:29,819
That's enough. How much do you want?

1489
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:31,230
You're right.

1490
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:33,660
(Building on this energy)

1491
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,960
- Kian84!
- Yes?

1492
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,399
- I found a roof.
- Where's the roof?

1493
00:58:38,569 --> 00:58:39,930
Where did you pick that up?

1494
00:58:41,069 --> 00:58:42,870
- A roof.
- Dex.

1495
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,000
What is it?

1496
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,540
- I think lightning did strike him.
- Did lightning strike him?

1497
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,640
He did get struck.

1498
00:58:47,169 --> 00:58:48,980
- It'll block the wind.
- Yes.

1499
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,750
- How about like this?
- You can lie it here.

1500
00:58:53,149 --> 00:58:55,580
The neighbors must've liked his idea
since he gathered all the trash.

1501
00:58:57,049 --> 00:58:58,549
Easier to throw them away at once.

1502
00:58:58,549 --> 00:59:00,319
(Thoughtful environmental worker
at Nosy Iranja)

1503
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:01,859
Go in between.

1504
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:03,919
(Shall I try to lie down?)

1505
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,830
His neck...

1506
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,060
- doesn't seem right.
- What's the meaning of this?

1507
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,330
You're just homeless.

1508
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:14,200
My house is so fancy, right?

1509
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:16,169
I'm not done yet.

1510
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,770
- We need to hurry.
- Yes.

1511
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:18,839
We don't have much time left.

1512
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:20,439
I'll just sleep in the tent.

1513
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,180
He said it'll block the wind,
but nothing was covering above.

1514
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,250
He's strong.

1515
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:29,680
He has no sense of...

1516
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,989
architectural design or aesthetics.

1517
00:59:32,419 --> 00:59:34,960
He has good hardware,

1518
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,189
- but not a good software.
- I cover everything with my physicality.

1519
00:59:39,089 --> 00:59:41,500
(But Kian84 tries to help the youngest.)

1520
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,500
He tries his best to make it functional.

1521
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,600
He was determined to sleep outside today.

1522
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,299
(He owns all the materials.)

1523
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,100
What are you doing?

1524
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:53,069
- Dex, how does this look?
- Yes.

1525
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:55,109
One pillar and two.

1526
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,080
Then, we will put slates.

1527
00:59:58,310 --> 00:59:59,310
Slate?

1528
00:59:59,609 --> 01:00:00,879
Plant one here.

1529
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,919
- My goodness.
- What?

1530
01:00:04,589 --> 01:00:05,719
(He digs out of nowhere.)

1531
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:07,489
I won't be sleeping here.

1532
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:09,919
- But Dex needs to.
- Yes.

1533
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:10,989
So you're helping him.

1534
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,629
What's the structure?

1535
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:15,060
Like this...

1536
01:00:15,399 --> 01:00:17,930
We can make all four to be
on the same level and put the roof on top.

1537
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,299
- After making all four on the same level?
- Yes.

1538
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,669
You want to put the roof on top of them?

1539
01:00:22,839 --> 01:00:24,239
- Yes.
- I see.

1540
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:27,839
(They try putting the roof on top
following Kian84's advice.)

1541
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,939
The balance is important.

1542
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:32,580
(There's a height difference.)

1543
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,609
Make it right.

1544
01:00:34,919 --> 01:00:36,180
(Hitting hard)

1545
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:37,750
(It breaks.)

1546
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,020
- What are you doing?
- Be careful.

1547
01:00:40,489 --> 01:00:42,120
- Why are you knocking it down?
- It's broken.

1548
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,259
- Why is it breaking?
- He broke it.

1549
01:00:44,489 --> 01:00:46,529
I might break my nose while sleeping.

1550
01:00:46,589 --> 01:00:47,790
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?

1551
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:50,129
- Oh, my gosh.
- Do you speak English?

1552
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,100
There's a bar.

1553
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,169
My goodness.

1554
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:56,000
We're travelers, a group of four.

1555
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,009
We're going to stay on this island today.

1556
01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:04,279
Can we camp near the beach?

1557
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,350
There were actual traces of someone
lighting a fire...

1558
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,180
on the beach.

1559
01:01:10,279 --> 01:01:11,919
How much is it in total?

1560
01:01:12,819 --> 01:01:13,850
Thank you.

1561
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:14,859
(Returning after completing his mission)

1562
01:01:16,919 --> 01:01:17,919
What's that?

1563
01:01:17,919 --> 01:01:20,060
- What's that? Is that a hut?
- My gosh.

1564
01:01:20,859 --> 01:01:22,200
- Welcome.
- Are you done?

1565
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,330
We borrowed everything.

1566
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,629
One of the tents is small.

1567
01:01:26,969 --> 01:01:28,399
So Dex is building a house.

1568
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:30,370
(He didn't give up
having his own house yet.)

1569
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:31,870
He was digging.

1570
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:33,969
Where shall we start the fire?

1571
01:01:34,509 --> 01:01:35,509
Here, in front.

1572
01:01:35,509 --> 01:01:37,540
Shall we dig up here and start the fire?

1573
01:01:38,009 --> 01:01:40,509
Let's start the fire first.

1574
01:01:40,649 --> 01:01:42,750
- A sparkler.
- This one?

1575
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:45,120
- It's hard without a sparkler.
- Prevent it going out.

1576
01:01:45,149 --> 01:01:47,120
- Oh, I have that.
- What?

1577
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,359
A copy of my passport.

1578
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:49,890
- For a burning material?
- Yes, it's a paper.

1579
01:01:50,489 --> 01:01:51,660
(Amazed)

1580
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:53,989
Bottle traveled a lot overseas
so he will know better.

1581
01:01:53,989 --> 01:01:55,060
(Professional traveler's sparkler
is different.)

1582
01:01:56,259 --> 01:01:57,629
(He looks comfortable.)

1583
01:01:57,629 --> 01:01:58,830
Use the paper.

1584
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:00,629
- Here's the paper.
- Where's the paper?

1585
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:02,899
(A copy of his passport
became a sparkler.)

1586
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,410
(Burn brightly.)

1587
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:09,009
Isn't that a mannequin?

1588
01:02:09,009 --> 01:02:10,580
Let's allow him to rest.

1589
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,049
- Wait.
- It burns well.

1590
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,580
- I think we're good.
- It's good.

1591
01:02:15,919 --> 01:02:17,350
Okay.

1592
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:18,890
Why did they do that?

1593
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:20,689
- It's sad.
- It's cool.

1594
01:02:23,419 --> 01:02:24,589
- Dex.
- Yes?

1595
01:02:24,759 --> 01:02:25,759
Are you okay?

1596
01:02:25,759 --> 01:02:26,960
(Smiling)

1597
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,029
If it falls, I'll break my nose.

1598
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,359
- What is it?
- Where will you sleep?

1599
01:02:30,359 --> 01:02:32,000
Is that a house?

1600
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:34,069
- My house is complete.
- How's the smell?

1601
01:02:34,569 --> 01:02:36,100
- Excuse me?
- No one's interested.

1602
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,569
My house is complete.

1603
01:02:37,569 --> 01:02:39,540
- It's good.
- "It's good."

1604
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:41,939
No, you need to react properly.

1605
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,980
I was speechless seeing that.

1606
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,710
(Introducing Dex's house)

1607
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:47,779
It's like a picture.

1608
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,350
(A hut that was pitiful...)

1609
01:02:51,689 --> 01:02:53,189
- Having your own house...
- It looks good.

1610
01:02:53,189 --> 01:02:54,649
It changed like that?

1611
01:02:56,089 --> 01:02:57,390
It's 1.5m².

1612
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,460
- Right. You used the space well.
- Yes.

1613
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,129
There is quite a bit of storage space.

1614
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,029
My first house that I own.

1615
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,100
(Dex's first house
with a beautiful sunset view)

1616
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:07,370
(Move-in inquiries are welcome
from tomorrow.)

1617
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,569
Dex, have a celebratory drink.
A welcome drink.

1618
01:03:10,899 --> 01:03:12,609
- Shanti, shanti.
- Shanti?

1619
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:15,609
(It's delicious.)

1620
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,779
(I feel good.)

1621
01:03:17,779 --> 01:03:19,250
- You feel good?
- It's delicious.

1622
01:03:19,279 --> 01:03:20,649
Let me give it a little taste.

1623
01:03:20,649 --> 01:03:22,149
(Pani Bottle tries some
since it's their last night.)

1624
01:03:22,149 --> 01:03:23,180
Chopsticks.

1625
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:27,290
- Was it strong?
- It was a little strong.

1626
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:29,660
- Disinfect it?
- Put the charcoal over the flame.

1627
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,529
- Let me do it now.
- I'll do this.

1628
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,230
There you go. Okay.

1629
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,029
Where did Dex go?

1630
01:03:36,029 --> 01:03:37,100
Where is he?

1631
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:38,899
- Where is Dex?
- This guy.

1632
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:40,569
He built his house and disappeared.

1633
01:03:40,569 --> 01:03:41,839
Did he go to check in at the hotel?

1634
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:45,870
I wish he did that instead.

1635
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:48,480
(While the youngest was gone,
the sun set on their last day.)

1636
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:53,910
(Night fell on Nosy Iranja.)

1637
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,350
- What is that?
- What's that?

1638
01:04:00,819 --> 01:04:02,620
- Dex?
- That's Dex.

1639
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:05,560
My whole body was covered in sand.

1640
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,399
(Dex finally let go of everything...)

1641
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:12,029
(and became one with nature.)

1642
01:04:12,029 --> 01:04:14,569
- But seriously.
- But you'll lie on the sand again.

1643
01:04:15,399 --> 01:04:16,700
He should go into the water again.

1644
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:20,040
Where did you go?

1645
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,310
- I washed off the sand.
- Did you check in?

1646
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:24,339
- Washed off the sand?
- Yes.

1647
01:04:24,439 --> 01:04:26,310
(It's refreshing.)

1648
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:28,649
What did you buy so much?

1649
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:30,680
It's full of things like meat and bread.

1650
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,250
- There's bread?
- There is.

1651
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,859
I didn't know we had bread.

1652
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,759
<i>Pani Baguette</i>

1653
01:04:39,029 --> 01:04:40,390
- Dex, let me give you chopsticks.
- Yes?

1654
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:42,230
Do we have chopsticks?

1655
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:43,859
- You're making a pair again?
- Yes.

1656
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:45,330
It's fun to make them.

1657
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:46,669
(The fun of camping in the wild is
whipping up things.)

1658
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:48,540
Okay.

1659
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,969
Let me put it on the grill.

1660
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,469
(They start grilling.)

1661
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:55,140
(They went grocery shopping
this morning...)

1662
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,210
(and bought pork belly from Madagascar.)

1663
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:57,609
You went grocery shopping.

1664
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,279
- Gosh. It's unbelievable.
- Oh, dear.

1665
01:05:00,279 --> 01:05:02,850
- The pork.
- It looks good.

1666
01:05:02,919 --> 01:05:04,680
- Salt.
- Add some salt.

1667
01:05:05,189 --> 01:05:06,589
It's unbelievable.

1668
01:05:06,589 --> 01:05:08,219
Flip. One, two, three.

1669
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:11,859
One, two, three.

1670
01:05:11,859 --> 01:05:13,089
Oh, my.

1671
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:15,629
- All right. The meat.
- Let's see.

1672
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:18,160
- That looks good.
- Gosh.

1673
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:20,230
It smells so good.

1674
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,870
(Drooling)

1675
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:23,370
I'll give it a taste.

1676
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,109
Okay. It's done.

1677
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:26,410
(Pani Bottle tries it first.)

1678
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:27,839
What?

1679
01:05:28,939 --> 01:05:30,810
(Kian84 also tries a piece.)

1680
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,049
- Does the pork...
- It's so good.

1681
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:35,750
taste similar to Korean pork belly?

1682
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:36,819
It's good.

1683
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:39,790
(Little Dex also munches.)

1684
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,989
- It was a little tough.
- Yes, a little tough.

1685
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,460
I feel like I'm chewing gum.

1686
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:48,960
The pig must have worked out hard.

1687
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:50,100
It's good, though.

1688
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:51,259
It tastes like the pork you eat
at your grandma's.

1689
01:05:52,129 --> 01:05:53,469
Do we have plates?

1690
01:05:53,629 --> 01:05:54,939
(Looking around)

1691
01:05:55,969 --> 01:05:56,969
(He spots something.)

1692
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,640
(Fiddling)

1693
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:01,680
(Plucking)

1694
01:06:02,379 --> 01:06:03,540
It's South American style.

1695
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,080
(He quickly made a plate with a leaf.)

1696
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,180
Put a piece on your leaf.

1697
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:07,549
Here.

1698
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:09,180
(Feeding Si Eon)

1699
01:06:11,319 --> 01:06:12,350
They're enjoying it.

1700
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:14,419
- The food tastes better after swimming.
- They're loving it.

1701
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:17,620
- I'm looking forward to the spaghetti.
- Let's eat spaghetti first...

1702
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,830
- and then corn.
- Yes.

1703
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:21,230
- We can't miss that.
- Oh, my.

1704
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:25,569
- What are these things floating?
- What is that?

1705
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,370
Guys, let me take these out.

1706
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,799
Yes. We can't waste the water.

1707
01:06:31,169 --> 01:06:33,169
Can you stop putting your hand in?

1708
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,009
- "Excuse me."
- He cares about that?

1709
01:06:35,009 --> 01:06:36,339
- I can't believe it.
- That bothers him?

1710
01:06:36,339 --> 01:06:37,410
I know. That's unlike him.

1711
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,250
Would he rather eat the ash?

1712
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:42,379
Si Eon, I'm a neat freak,
so I can't eat something like that.

1713
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,750
- Are you even in a position to say that?
- I'm germaphobic.

1714
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:47,950
I can't eat unhygienic things.

1715
01:06:48,989 --> 01:06:50,290
(Laughing)

1716
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,189
(The spaghetti is being made,)

1717
01:06:54,189 --> 01:06:56,930
(following his hygiene guidelines.)

1718
01:06:57,629 --> 01:06:59,330
Let me give it a mix and put it back.

1719
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:00,899
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

1720
01:07:00,899 --> 01:07:02,339
- Look at the color.
- My gosh.

1721
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,540
- Dex, try some.
- Okay.

1722
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:08,009
(Trying the spaghetti on his leaf plate)

1723
01:07:08,009 --> 01:07:10,410
- That must be good.
- He's enjoying it.

1724
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,350
The foods you've already tried
are the best.

1725
01:07:13,049 --> 01:07:15,779
(The younger brothers
are trying the spaghetti.)

1726
01:07:15,779 --> 01:07:16,779
(Humming)

1727
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:19,049
- His spaghetti is good.
- It's not that bad.

1728
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,219
It's delicious.

1729
01:07:21,049 --> 01:07:23,419
It tasted even better...

1730
01:07:23,419 --> 01:07:24,989
since we were eating
in front of the ocean.

1731
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:27,129
(Proud)

1732
01:07:27,129 --> 01:07:29,200
(A piece of meat)

1733
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,299
(Dropping)

1734
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:34,000
- No, Kian84.
- No.

1735
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,169
(Blowing)

1736
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:37,000
You can't eat that.

1737
01:07:37,069 --> 01:07:38,640
(Blowing the sand off the meat)

1738
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,169
- It died because of us.
- This is...

1739
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:42,140
I'm a neat freak,
so I can't eat something like that.

1740
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,580
(The full moon looks clear
just like Germaphobic Kian84.)

1741
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:44,879
We have a full moon today.

1742
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:48,049
It was a perfect crescent moon
during the ship launching party.

1743
01:07:48,049 --> 01:07:50,620
- Right.
- What is that party about?

1744
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,919
- They launched a ship that day.
- It changed after 15 days.

1745
01:07:51,919 --> 01:07:54,319
- Mr. Jin Soo?
- The ship launching party.

1746
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:55,489
Mr. Jin Soo?

1747
01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:56,759
- A ship launching party.
- A ship launching party?

1748
01:07:56,759 --> 01:07:58,319
- I see.
- A ship launching party.

1749
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,430
- It's where they just drag a ship.
- They drag a ship?

1750
01:08:02,129 --> 01:08:04,330
You sound like
I shouldn't be interested in that.

1751
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:06,529
- Is Dex tired?
- He didn't even make eye contact.

1752
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,169
He seems too lazy to explain.

1753
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,200
Si Eon, I told you
Dex would stop reacting well.

1754
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,739
He would have explained it to me
if it had been at the start.

1755
01:08:13,739 --> 01:08:15,580
- Right.
- Now he doesn't care if you understand.

1756
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:16,739
- "There's this thing."
- "It's a thing."

1757
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:19,109
If he asks something more,
he might get in trouble.

1758
01:08:19,649 --> 01:08:20,750
I'll be good to you.

1759
01:08:21,879 --> 01:08:24,049
(He gets tired while explaining.)

1760
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,450
You sound like I shouldn't
be interested in that.

1761
01:08:27,049 --> 01:08:29,259
It sounded like that to me a little.

1762
01:08:29,259 --> 01:08:32,259
That's how Dex reacts for real.

1763
01:08:33,589 --> 01:08:35,629
- It can't be helped.
- He did his best...

1764
01:08:35,629 --> 01:08:37,029
to please you for two days.

1765
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:39,270
- I felt a little bad.
- I'm sorry, Dex.

1766
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:41,000
I thought we actually liked each other.

1767
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,770
I do like you.

1768
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,270
I guess I got a lot
more comfortable with Si Eon.

1769
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:52,080
The campfire is amazing.

1770
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,850
(Looking at the flame,
the brothers become emotional.)

1771
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:56,450
I feel thankful for some reason.

1772
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:58,350
If it hadn't been for this show,

1773
01:08:59,089 --> 01:09:00,549
I wouldn't be in Africa.

1774
01:09:00,549 --> 01:09:02,689
- Of course.
- I wouldn't have been to South America.

1775
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:05,330
When else am I going to a place like that
if it hadn't been for the show?

1776
01:09:06,089 --> 01:09:08,529
- We wouldn't have been to India.
- I wouldn't have been to India either.

1777
01:09:08,529 --> 01:09:10,330
Honestly, I feel a little bad.

1778
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,629
I know you went through a lot,

1779
01:09:13,629 --> 01:09:16,770
and I just joined you to take credit
at the end of the trip.

1780
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:18,270
- You had to join us late, though.
- That's not true.

1781
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:21,410
I don't think you were taking credit.

1782
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:23,910
When we were the most tired...

1783
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,680
- That's true.
- and exhausted,

1784
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,879
- you showed up.
- He changed the mood.

1785
01:09:27,879 --> 01:09:29,750
We could wrap up our trip well,
thanks to you.

1786
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,379
What is your mother like?

1787
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:33,290
(Acting cute)

1788
01:09:33,589 --> 01:09:35,660
How did she raise such a good son?

1789
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,219
- How did she do it?
- It looks like it.

1790
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:38,830
He's right about that, though.

1791
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:41,660
- We were all weary.
- Si Eon cheered us up by joining us.

1792
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,029
I'm sure we all felt that way.

1793
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:47,099
I always travel alone...

1794
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:49,069
- and feel lonely all the time.
- I see.

1795
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,470
As Si Eon joined us,

1796
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,910
I felt like we were traveling
as a complete team.

1797
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:56,779
A complete team of Season 1 to 3.

1798
01:09:56,779 --> 01:10:00,050
- It's nice.
- I think it means the most...

1799
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:02,019
that the four of us finished
the trip together.

1800
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:05,250
Si Eon, do you want to see
the sunrise tomorrow?

1801
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:06,950
- We should see the sunrise.
- We must see the sunrise.

1802
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:08,689
We have to see it
since we've come all the way here.

1803
01:10:08,989 --> 01:10:11,859
Let's wake up at 5 a.m.
and see the sunrise.

1804
01:10:11,989 --> 01:10:13,290
And let's make a wish.

1805
01:10:13,429 --> 01:10:14,859
- That sounds good.
- Okay.

1806
01:10:14,889 --> 01:10:17,160
- Dex, can you really sleep there?
- Should I try nestling?

1807
01:10:17,229 --> 01:10:19,269
- Dex, if it's hard, come into our tent.
- Yes?

1808
01:10:19,269 --> 01:10:21,029
- If it's too hard, I'll go in.
- If it's hard, come in.

1809
01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:22,569
- Dex, when you're sleeping alone...
- How are you going to sleep? Lie down.

1810
01:10:22,569 --> 01:10:24,639
- Is he going to be okay?
- I should keep my word.

1811
01:10:24,769 --> 01:10:27,670
This is my house now.

1812
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:29,179
I'm in my house.

1813
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:32,979
(He already nestled into his sand bed.)

1814
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:35,880
Is Dex going to be all right?

1815
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:39,120
Well, it's because
you haven't lied down here,

1816
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:41,720
- but it's pretty good.
- I felt so comfortable.

1817
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,960
It looks cozy.

1818
01:10:44,019 --> 01:10:48,189
(Kian84 used to sleep well
on sandy floors.)

1819
01:10:49,059 --> 01:10:51,660
(The youngest became like him.)

1820
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:52,769
They became like him.

1821
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:54,069
They're the same.

1822
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,899
Cover yourself with this at least.

1823
01:10:56,899 --> 01:10:59,269
- Here.
- Thanks.

1824
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:02,109
(Just as Florant covered him,)

1825
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,939
(Kian84 also gives him a blanket.)

1826
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:08,179
I'll gratefully accept the supplies
you give me.

1827
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:09,819
Is that the small one?

1828
01:11:10,149 --> 01:11:11,720
- That's the small one.
- We should split into groups of 2 and 1.

1829
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,620
- Can I sleep here?
- Why don't you sleep with me?

1830
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,689
- With you?
- Yes.

1831
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:15,889
I've done it many times.

1832
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:18,729
Let me sleep alone.

1833
01:11:18,729 --> 01:11:20,330
We always slept together.
I never slept alone.

1834
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:21,660
Pani Bottle, sleep with me, then.

1835
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,029
Okay. I don't mind.

1836
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:24,660
Should we put out the fire?

1837
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,670
- Please put it out.
- I will.

1838
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,970
- I'm putting out the fire.
- Okay.

1839
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:31,099
(Kian84 goes into the tent first.)

1840
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,639
It's so cool in here.

1841
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:38,139
It was breezy,
and there were no mosquitoes.

1842
01:11:38,139 --> 01:11:39,179
It must have been nice.

1843
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:40,750
We don't have mosquitoes here.

1844
01:11:41,809 --> 01:11:44,149
Even the ants went to sleep,
so they're not here at this hour.

1845
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:45,920
Our difference is just the tarp.

1846
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,489
Yes, it's just that.

1847
01:11:47,489 --> 01:11:48,590
- There's not much difference.
- It depends on your mindset.

1848
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:51,519
(Peaceful)

1849
01:11:52,189 --> 01:11:55,599
(He looks comfortable...)

1850
01:11:55,599 --> 01:11:58,630
(as if he's in a hotel bed.)

1851
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:02,239
- Thanks.
- Do you want to cover your face with it?

1852
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:03,269
Should I?

1853
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:06,109
The eldest brother takes good care
of the youngest.

1854
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:08,170
He really took good care of me.

1855
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:09,939
Gosh.

1856
01:12:10,179 --> 01:12:11,580
It's nice.

1857
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:12,950
Is it nice?

1858
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:14,050
(The eldest brother loves his tent.)

1859
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:16,720
(Pani Bottle comes to bed
after organizing.)

1860
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,989
My goodness.

1861
01:12:19,349 --> 01:12:20,620
(Banging his feet together)

1862
01:12:21,019 --> 01:12:22,489
(Pani Bottle is clean.)

1863
01:12:22,489 --> 01:12:24,720
It's really nice, though.

1864
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:26,760
I'm not lying. It's so nice.

1865
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,389
If you're happy, I'm happy too.

1866
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,429
Good work.

1867
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,000
- Have a good night.
- Have a good night.

1868
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
(They're ending their day
in complete satisfaction.)

1869
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:41,410
(Their last day in Madagascar
is peaceful.)

1870
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,779
(Snoring)

1871
01:12:43,779 --> 01:12:45,580
He's sleeping so well.

1872
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:47,080
- Someone is sleeping well.
- I'm jealous. Don't you?

1873
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:52,149
(While they're falling asleep,
hearing the sound of snoring)

1874
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:56,189
- It's after midnight.
- Everyone is asleep.

1875
01:12:56,189 --> 01:12:57,720
How can it change all of a sudden?

1876
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,460
(Kian84 and Pani Bottle's tent
is flapping.)

1877
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,729
(Pani Bottle wakes up.)

1878
01:13:00,729 --> 01:13:01,760
The wind...

1879
01:13:02,899 --> 01:13:04,599
- Pani Bottle.
- Yes.

1880
01:13:04,599 --> 01:13:07,130
Look on the right.
It looks like a tornado.

1881
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,569
- Really?
- A tornado.

1882
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:09,970
- A tornado?
- Yes.

1883
01:13:10,569 --> 01:13:11,939
This is not right.

1884
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:14,170
Don't you think it's too windy?

1885
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,809
It's okay. This is common.

1886
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:17,410
Is that so?

1887
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:19,910
(For an ordinary breeze,
the tent is shaking too much.)

1888
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:21,880
Wait. It might fly away.

1889
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,319
Dex is just sleeping outside.
What about him?

1890
01:13:24,819 --> 01:13:25,849
Hold on.

1891
01:13:25,849 --> 01:13:26,889
(Pani Bottle sensed something unusual
and turned on the light.)

1892
01:13:26,889 --> 01:13:28,050
The tent is collapsing.

1893
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:30,460
This feels wrong for real. Seriously.

1894
01:13:31,019 --> 01:13:32,290
It starts to rain too.

1895
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:35,029
- It's raining.
- Dex!

1896
01:13:35,029 --> 01:13:37,000
- Oh, dear.
- Dex is outside.

1897
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,399
- Dex.
- What if he was blown away?

1898
01:13:38,429 --> 01:13:40,569
I didn't know
if it was raining or windy...

1899
01:13:40,569 --> 01:13:42,500
because I fell right asleep.

1900
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:44,170
Dex, come in.

1901
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:45,200
Dex, are you sleeping?

1902
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,739
Hang on. We're in trouble.

1903
01:13:46,739 --> 01:13:48,470
- It's too windy.
- Come on in.

1904
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:51,080
- Don't sleep.
- Dex!

1905
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:52,679
Yes?

1906
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:54,050
We'll be blown away!

1907
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:55,679
- This isn't right.
- What is this noise?

1908
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:56,849
Wake him up now.

1909
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,479
Dex, come on in.

1910
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:00,120
- Dex.
- Come in.

1911
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,120
Hold it.

1912
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:04,489
- Come in.
- He came into my tent as I said.

1913
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:07,189
When I woke up, I thought there was a war.

1914
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:08,229
What's happening?

1915
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,500
The thing outside.

1916
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,970
(Si Eon and Dex's tent)

1917
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:14,029
Done!

1918
01:14:14,029 --> 01:14:15,800
Gosh. The zipper broke.

1919
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:17,870
(Screaming)

1920
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,309
What is this?

1921
01:14:19,309 --> 01:14:22,679
(They managed to close the door
while screaming.)

1922
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:24,679
- What should they do?
- The wind...

1923
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:25,950
was so strong.

1924
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:28,149
- It looks like a disaster movie.
- Seriously.

1925
01:14:29,149 --> 01:14:30,679
Oh, my gosh!

1926
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:32,290
(The rain is also leaking
into the other tent.)

1927
01:14:33,019 --> 01:14:34,519
It didn't matter
if we closed the door or not...

1928
01:14:34,519 --> 01:14:36,660
- since we had a hole in the top.
- Here.

1929
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,590
- The rain came through that?
- Yes. The rain came in like that.

1930
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:40,529
Let me block this. Wait!

1931
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:42,500
(Is Kian84 suddenly going out?)

1932
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,700
Are you going outside?

1933
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:47,000
(Why is he going outside?)

1934
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:50,170
(Shouting)

1935
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:51,239
Here we go again.

1936
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:53,040
- Bring it on!
- He's fighting with the wind.

1937
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:55,139
You already came yesterday!

1938
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,410
What is wrong with the weather?

1939
01:14:58,410 --> 01:14:59,679
(Scolding the weather)

1940
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,109
It gives us a hard time
on the last day as well.

1941
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:04,420
The weather is unpredictable.

1942
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:07,090
Let me sleep.

1943
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:09,760
(Si Eon and Dex's tent)

1944
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,090
World, just kill me!

1945
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,559
There's nothing I can do!

1946
01:15:16,529 --> 01:15:17,559
(As they shout,
the storm becomes stronger.)

1947
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:19,800
- My goodness.
- Gosh!

1948
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,370
The wind was getting
stronger and stronger.

1949
01:15:21,529 --> 01:15:23,040
Let's sleep.

1950
01:15:23,099 --> 01:15:25,000
- How can you sleep?
- I can't sleep, Kian84.

1951
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,210
- Why not?
- How can you sleep like this?

1952
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:29,479
- We can sleep here.
- Wait.

1953
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:32,279
- Let me lie down.
- Okay.

1954
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,550
No, Kian84! The tent ripped!

1955
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:36,179
It ripped.

1956
01:15:36,649 --> 01:15:37,720
It ripped?

1957
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:40,649
We have a hole in the top of the tent,

1958
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:42,090
- so it can't block the rain.
- Is that so?

1959
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:43,189
- Yes.
- Okay.

1960
01:15:45,689 --> 01:15:46,760
Hold on.

1961
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:50,200
You can sleep. It's not that bad.

1962
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:51,960
- He will sleep?
- "You can sleep."

1963
01:15:52,059 --> 01:15:53,269
You will sleep here now?

1964
01:15:53,599 --> 01:15:55,939
Where else do we sleep, then?

1965
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,970
- I mean...
- Peaceful84.

1966
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:00,510
Where else can we sleep?

1967
01:16:01,109 --> 01:16:02,739
It's a little damp outside.

1968
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:05,510
The rain is coming in.

1969
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:09,580
(Kian84 can do nothing but laugh.)

1970
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:10,620
What is this?

1971
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:15,090
(He couldn't keep his thoughts
to himself.)

1972
01:16:15,689 --> 01:16:17,160
Both of them are only in underwear.

1973
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:18,889
What is this?

1974
01:16:18,889 --> 01:16:20,660
I know. What's this?

1975
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:24,760
(Losing his mind)

1976
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,769
It's so noisy.

1977
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,029
- I'll sleep.
- At first, I was stunned.

1978
01:16:28,029 --> 01:16:30,170
The wind was blowing like crazy,

1979
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,200
and the tent was going like this.

1980
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,939
It felt like someone was shaking the tent.

1981
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:35,840
Then Kian84...

1982
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,580
(Thinking about it,
he gets speechless again.)

1983
01:16:37,809 --> 01:16:39,880
It was absurd how he lied down...

1984
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,010
and asked me to sleep.

1985
01:16:41,109 --> 01:16:43,179
- I was so dumbfounded I kept laughing.
- That's impressive.

1986
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:46,750
Seriously, he's the only person in Korea
who can do something like that.

1987
01:16:47,349 --> 01:16:50,559
The thunder was roaring,
and I was so overwhelmed by the fact...

1988
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:53,559
that I was spending
the last night of the trip with him.

1989
01:16:53,559 --> 01:16:55,429
How could he try to sleep in that weather?

1990
01:16:56,399 --> 01:16:57,960
Guys, are you okay?

1991
01:16:58,899 --> 01:17:00,929
We can't close our tent.

1992
01:17:01,429 --> 01:17:03,239
- Our tent ripped here.
- Oh, dear.

1993
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:04,540
It collapsed here too.

1994
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,910
- My goodness.
- Well...

1995
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:09,410
Done.

1996
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:10,510
(It's better with the door closed.)

1997
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:11,580
Wait.

1998
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:14,649
Why does it have a hole?

1999
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,979
This is quite exciting.

2000
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:20,489
- This is not exciting.
- He looks so comfortable.

2001
01:17:20,489 --> 01:17:22,220
He couldn't be more positive.

2002
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:23,559
Why is he so relaxed?

2003
01:17:23,819 --> 01:17:25,989
(The younger brother is struggling alone.)

2004
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:27,889
It will pass.

2005
01:17:27,889 --> 01:17:29,529
- What is this?
- Pani Bottle, it will pass.

2006
01:17:29,529 --> 01:17:30,599
He's the only one at peace.

2007
01:17:30,599 --> 01:17:33,269
Africa isn't always hot.

2008
01:17:33,269 --> 01:17:34,800
(It's good
that Africa isn't hot all the time.)

2009
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:37,069
- Are you talking in your sleep?
- Is he drunk?

2010
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:38,769
- Aren't you drunk?
- Are you sleeping?

2011
01:17:38,769 --> 01:17:40,040
I was so tired.

2012
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,340
We were indeed tired
from spending time in the water...

2013
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:43,580
and being on the ship for a while.

2014
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,010
Yes. I had been swimming
for hours with turtles.

2015
01:17:46,179 --> 01:17:48,410
I can't keep blocking it with my hands.

2016
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:49,920
- I should do this.
- Just sleep.

2017
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:52,790
Let's see the tent as a blanket and sleep.

2018
01:17:52,819 --> 01:17:54,950
"Don't make a fuss and just sleep."

2019
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:56,989
- Yes. Since it will pass.
- It sounds like he's sleep talking.

2020
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:00,260
- I should block the ceiling.
- The hole is quite big.

2021
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,290
As if a toad is blocking a crack
in the river bank.

2022
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:03,529
- Yes.
- He's sparing himself.

2023
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:05,559
I've got a toad-like body too.

2024
01:18:05,559 --> 01:18:07,330
(Dissing himself)

2025
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:09,399
Just lie down.

2026
01:18:09,399 --> 01:18:11,639
If I lie down,
the tent will be blown away.

2027
01:18:11,639 --> 01:18:12,870
If both of us lie down...

2028
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:14,040
You can lie down alone.

2029
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,540
I'll take care of this here!

2030
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,210
- Hey.
- You should sleep at least.

2031
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:20,349
- If you're okay...
- This is it for me!

2032
01:18:20,349 --> 01:18:22,380
Oh, dear. It makes me tear up.

2033
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,580
I had fun in this darn harsh world!

2034
01:18:24,779 --> 01:18:28,090
(Crying out to the world)

2035
01:18:28,189 --> 01:18:29,920
- That's his will.
- I'm cold.

2036
01:18:30,689 --> 01:18:33,429
(Pani Bottle is protecting him
with his whole body.)

2037
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:37,529
(The waters of the East Sea
and Mount Baekdu)

2038
01:18:37,529 --> 01:18:39,300
- They've gone crazy.
- Are you all right?

2039
01:18:39,429 --> 01:18:41,229
<i>Until that day when it dries</i>

2040
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:42,670
There are only crazy people on this trip.

2041
01:18:43,069 --> 01:18:44,269
None of us were normal.

2042
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,239
First of all, it's so cold.

2043
01:18:47,309 --> 01:18:48,569
I feel like I'm going to catch a cold.

2044
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:51,279
It already poured yesterday.
Why is it raining again?

2045
01:18:52,309 --> 01:18:54,210
I can't sleep for now.

2046
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:56,080
- Is he trying to sleep again?
- Please stop trying to sleep now.

2047
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:58,920
The rain is coming in this much.

2048
01:18:59,149 --> 01:19:00,450
Is he trying to sleep?

2049
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:03,460
But there's no lightning,
so I can still sleep.

2050
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:04,760
What is he talking about?

2051
01:19:05,059 --> 01:19:06,489
If lightning strikes, we'll die.

2052
01:19:06,489 --> 01:19:08,460
There's no lightning, so it's okay.

2053
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:10,399
It's only rainy and windy.

2054
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:12,059
- No.
- You can't sleep.

2055
01:19:12,059 --> 01:19:14,370
- Don't sleep. Wake up.
- Wake up!

2056
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:15,470
Open your eyes.

2057
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:17,540
- Goodness.
- I was so sleepy.

2058
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:19,540
I can sleep like this.

2059
01:19:21,139 --> 01:19:23,279
I'm going to sleep.

2060
01:19:23,739 --> 01:19:25,750
- What?
- I'll sleep.

2061
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,809
- What?
- I'm going to sleep!

2062
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:30,080
(Laughing)

2063
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:34,450
(Singing loudly)

2064
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:37,359
- Goodness. What will they do?
- He's so loud.

2065
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:39,590
Do you know I'm having so much fun?

2066
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:42,189
- Me too.
- This is our last day,

2067
01:19:42,189 --> 01:19:44,359
and this is a fitting end to our show.

2068
01:19:44,359 --> 01:19:46,130
It was so much fun, though.

2069
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,470
Adventure by Accident 3 gives us
a hard time even on the last day.

2070
01:19:48,529 --> 01:19:50,970
I feel adrenaline releasing from my body.

2071
01:19:51,099 --> 01:19:52,470
I'm so excited now.

2072
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:53,910
Everyone is slowly going crazy.

2073
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:55,010
Why is it so funny?

2074
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:57,010
Now that I get used to it,
it's not that bad.

2075
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:58,109
I'll hold out.

2076
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:00,550
- I think I can sleep like this.
- I know.

2077
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:02,950
- It's just good, right?
- Everyone got struck by lightning.

2078
01:20:03,519 --> 01:20:04,580
I'm 100 percent sure.

2079
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:06,189
You need to move.

2080
01:20:06,349 --> 01:20:07,519
- Move?
- Yes.

2081
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:09,460
Is it dangerous?

2082
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:10,760
Yes. You need to move.

2083
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,059
Please move.

2084
01:20:12,059 --> 01:20:13,489
The production crew came.

2085
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:14,559
Let's move.

2086
01:20:14,729 --> 01:20:16,800
They told us to withdraw...

2087
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:18,000
and come up.

2088
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,069
How could they say
something so weak like that?

2089
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:23,370
No. I can stay like this all day.

2090
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:24,840
Me too!

2091
01:20:24,939 --> 01:20:26,410
You're insane.

2092
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,340
No.

2093
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:31,010
- You should survive.
- Are you a general or what?

2094
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:32,210
I was sane at that time.

2095
01:20:33,109 --> 01:20:34,809
It's impossible to sleep here.

2096
01:20:34,809 --> 01:20:36,420
Okay. Let's go.

2097
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:38,479
Pack your things and the flag.

2098
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:40,420
We will seek shelter
in a place with a roof.

2099
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:43,389
- Let's go.
- We should evacuate,

2100
01:20:43,389 --> 01:20:45,260
- so pack your things.
- Let's evacuate.

2101
01:20:45,559 --> 01:20:47,830
- Take the flag.
- They didn't forget the flag.

2102
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:49,359
The dugout hut is still intact.

2103
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:50,960
It didn't collapse.

2104
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,870
- It's still intact.
- I did a good job.

2105
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:54,229
When our tents collapsed.

2106
01:20:54,729 --> 01:20:56,399
There was thunder and lightning nonstop
for two weeks.

2107
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:01,840
(Si Eon and Dex also got out
of their tent.)

2108
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,910
Let's just take our things.

2109
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:07,679
- When you travel, lots of things happen.
- Right.

2110
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:10,479
While we were sleeping on our last day,

2111
01:21:10,519 --> 01:21:12,279
a storm and lightning hit.

2112
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:13,950
So we came here to seek refuge.

2113
01:21:13,989 --> 01:21:16,519
That's where the production crew
was sleeping.

2114
01:21:16,559 --> 01:21:19,559
Were they sleeping
in a shabby place like that too?

2115
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:22,630
- It breaks my heart.
- It's so sad.

2116
01:21:22,899 --> 01:21:25,729
If the sun doesn't come up,

2117
01:21:25,729 --> 01:21:27,970
and it stays like this tomorrow,

2118
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:31,399
let's go to see
tomorrow's first lightning.

2119
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:33,010
(Let's go to see
tomorrow's first lightning!)

2120
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:35,170
- The first lightning?
- Lose the cliche idea...

2121
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:37,939
of catching the morning sun.

2122
01:21:37,939 --> 01:21:39,950
I was worried that it would keep raining,

2123
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:41,450
and we wouldn't see
the sunrise in the morning.

2124
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:42,950
- I really admire you.
- Okay.

2125
01:21:42,979 --> 01:21:45,019
- The 1st lightning.
- The 1st lightning.

2126
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:48,920
I've never imagined seeing
the first lightning of the day.

2127
01:21:49,819 --> 01:21:51,389
- Okay.
- I'm learning a lot.

2128
01:21:51,389 --> 01:21:52,559
Thanks.

2129
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:54,889
- Have a good night.
- Sweet dreams.

2130
01:21:54,889 --> 01:21:56,330
It was a fantastic night.

2131
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:58,429
- It was indeed fantastic.
- Yes.

2132
01:21:58,429 --> 01:21:59,729
Look how it's getting wet.

2133
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:03,200
It was so wet that I slept on the floor.

2134
01:22:03,399 --> 01:22:04,899
I should play a brick-breaker game.

2135
01:22:06,069 --> 01:22:07,670
He'll suddenly play a game
in the middle of the night?

2136
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:10,010
I didn't have the internet,
but I could play that game.

2137
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:14,349
As you play, you get really sleepy.

2138
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:16,019
You're positive.

2139
01:22:18,819 --> 01:22:20,989
It was the perfect way
to wrap up the trip.

2140
01:22:21,389 --> 01:22:23,489
My body was exhausted,
but I had so much fun.

2141
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:26,590
I won't be able to forget our last night.

2142
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:27,630
(A night to remember
for the rest of his life)

2143
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:30,660
If someone asked me
what Adventure by Accident is about,

2144
01:22:30,899 --> 01:22:33,670
I'd show them our last night
and tell them that's how we travel.

2145
01:22:33,929 --> 01:22:35,800
The wind suddenly started blowing
like crazy.

2146
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I didn't know what was going on
and held onto the tent.

2147
01:22:38,099 --> 01:22:39,670
And Kian84 just asked me to sleep.

2148
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:42,679
I could ignore it and sleep
since I was so tired.

2149
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,380
Pani Bottle seemed shocked...

2150
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:46,309
because he kept saying
we shouldn't sleep there.

2151
01:22:46,309 --> 01:22:47,679
He said the tent collapsed.

2152
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:48,950
But this is what I thought.

2153
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:50,920
We could cover ourselves
with it like a blanket.

2154
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:53,519
Since we could breathe, anyway.

2155
01:22:53,689 --> 01:22:55,989
I was supporting the tent with my body...

2156
01:22:55,989 --> 01:22:57,819
and blocking the rain with my head...

2157
01:22:57,819 --> 01:23:00,260
while Kian84 was trying to sleep,
lying down...

2158
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:01,529
and asking what I was doing.

2159
01:23:01,529 --> 01:23:03,760
Then I thought, "Right. This is the spirit
of Adventure by Accident."

2160
01:23:04,029 --> 01:23:06,870
The wind was blowing like this,

2161
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:08,029
and the tent was shaking.

2162
01:23:08,029 --> 01:23:09,439
(It looked like a disaster movie.)

2163
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,170
"Dex, close the door!"
And we couldn't see the door.

2164
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:13,609
(Actor Lee is acting hard.)

2165
01:23:13,609 --> 01:23:16,010
- "Dex, try to find it!"
- Is this a monodrama?

2166
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:19,080
And it was pouring rain.

2167
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:22,750
Then Kian84 shouted,
"We're men of nature!"

2168
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:25,550
It was scary and fun at the same time.

2169
01:23:25,819 --> 01:23:28,450
It was hilarious.

2170
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:32,319
The weather completely changed,
which was surreal.

2171
01:23:32,319 --> 01:23:35,090
I was thrown off and found it fun too.

2172
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:38,099
I usually hate that kind of situation.

2173
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,399
It was the situation
that I wanted to avoid at all costs.

2174
01:23:40,569 --> 01:23:43,840
But I had fun since I was with Si Eon.

2175
01:23:44,069 --> 01:23:45,569
(Dependable)

2176
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:48,040
I liked it.

2177
01:23:48,109 --> 01:23:51,139
I'd been feeling
like I was living in a wrapper...

2178
01:23:51,139 --> 01:23:52,210
when I was in Korea.

2179
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:55,950
But all that rain and wind
produced a lot of adrenaline.

2180
01:23:55,950 --> 01:23:58,279
I felt alive.

2181
01:23:58,679 --> 01:23:59,889
It was wilder.

2182
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:01,750
I was in the middle of nature.

2183
01:24:01,889 --> 01:24:05,090
Madagascar started with lightning
and ended with it too.

2184
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:07,760
I came up with a mini title.

2185
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:08,960
"Into the Storm."

2186
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,660
(Adventure by Accident, Into the Storm)

2187
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:11,660
Totally.

2188
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:13,670
That's how I felt.

2189
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:14,929
(They spend
their final night in the storm.)

2190
01:24:16,599 --> 01:24:18,739
(It's the quiet break of dawn.)

2191
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:21,970
The rainstorm has subsided.

2192
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,139
Pani Bottle.

2193
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,109
Why did you sleep on the ground
when I told you to sleep here?

2194
01:24:28,179 --> 01:24:30,319
It was too damp,

2195
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:31,580
so I preferred the ground.

2196
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:33,989
What time is it?

2197
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:40,830
Did they say sunrise was at 5:10 a.m.?

2198
01:24:41,429 --> 01:24:43,200
Hey, let's watch the sunrise.

2199
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:44,760
This is their last morning.

2200
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,130
The show doesn't end
if we don't watch the sunrise.

2201
01:24:48,099 --> 01:24:50,540
I see. You need to see the sunrise
if you want to come back to Korea.

2202
01:24:50,769 --> 01:24:51,970
We have to get up no matter what.

2203
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:53,670
Si Eon.

2204
01:24:54,309 --> 01:24:55,510
Let's go watch the sunrise.

2205
01:24:57,479 --> 01:24:59,210
I'm not wearing any pants.

2206
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:00,779
Why aren't you?

2207
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:03,779
My clothes are drenched,

2208
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:05,349
so I have nothing to wear.

2209
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,489
You don't? Then just wear your underwear.

2210
01:25:07,849 --> 01:25:09,590
(He's strict with Si Eon.)

2211
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:12,489
Come to the military training ground
in one minute.

2212
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:15,330
(Yes, sir.)

2213
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,899
- The tide is high.
- Yes.

2214
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:22,399
Judging by the tide,
we had to move anyway.

2215
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:23,540
(The tide is high
because of the rainstorm.)

2216
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:25,939
Gosh, Si Eon is so lazy.

2217
01:25:26,939 --> 01:25:28,239
He's lazy until the end.

2218
01:25:28,439 --> 01:25:30,679
Look at what happened
to that tree yesterday.

2219
01:25:31,309 --> 01:25:32,410
What? You're right.

2220
01:25:32,739 --> 01:25:34,080
Wasn't that Dex's tree?

2221
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,309
- What?
- That was his house.

2222
01:25:35,309 --> 01:25:37,779
- It's his house.
- It's underwater.

2223
01:25:37,779 --> 01:25:39,319
- That's his house.
- Gosh.

2224
01:25:39,889 --> 01:25:41,750
Hey. Behind us.

2225
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:43,660
- It's underwater.
- Behind us.

2226
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:45,120
(I had a great time, my house.)

2227
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:47,160
Where's the tent that you borrowed?

2228
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,859
- That flew away.
- It did?

2229
01:25:48,859 --> 01:25:51,559
We later found it, so we took it back.

2230
01:25:51,559 --> 01:25:53,929
It was damaged, so we paid for it.

2231
01:25:53,929 --> 01:25:55,269
I see. That's good.

2232
01:25:55,630 --> 01:25:57,340
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

2233
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,769
(They all gather to watch the sunrise.)

2234
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,139
Gosh.

2235
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:04,510
This path looks incredible.

2236
01:26:04,609 --> 01:26:06,279
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2237
01:26:06,279 --> 01:26:08,609
- Gosh.
- The path resurfaced.

2238
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:10,950
This is a strange vibe.

2239
01:26:12,519 --> 01:26:15,420
When the tide is low,
the path leads to that island.

2240
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,460
I see.

2241
01:26:17,559 --> 01:26:19,590
(The path opens up at low tide.)

2242
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:21,689
- You can go there at low tide.
- At low tide.

2243
01:26:21,689 --> 01:26:24,000
- Gosh.
- We can go there now.

2244
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,099
Gosh.

2245
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:28,269
- Look at that crab.
- Gosh.

2246
01:26:29,069 --> 01:26:30,500
There were crabs.

2247
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,139
There are crabs.

2248
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:35,970
This is exactly why
we should camp in the morning.

2249
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:37,010
We have privacy.

2250
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:38,309
You're right.

2251
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:41,580
(The place teems with tourists
in the afternoon.)

2252
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:45,620
It felt like
we were the only people left on earth.

2253
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,050
Who'd camp in the rain?

2254
01:26:48,389 --> 01:26:51,590
Gosh, this path is...

2255
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:55,029
What's that?

2256
01:26:55,029 --> 01:26:56,630
It looks like they're above water.

2257
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:57,830
It looks like they're floating.

2258
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:59,460
It looks like we're walking on water.

2259
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,800
Si Eon, the sun...

2260
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:03,899
- is slowly rising.
- Look at the sunlight.

2261
01:27:05,099 --> 01:27:06,210
Goodness.

2262
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:09,269
(They're excited as if they're watching
the New Year's sunrise.)

2263
01:27:09,979 --> 01:27:11,710
Doesn't the cloud remind you of a dragon?

2264
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:13,250
It looks insane.

2265
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:14,609
- It looks like a dragon.
- Gosh.

2266
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:15,880
(Even the cloud celebrates
the Year of the Dragon.)

2267
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,420
- It does look like a blue dragon.
- You're right.

2268
01:27:19,179 --> 01:27:21,220
This is our first time
watching the sunrise together.

2269
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:23,760
I never got to see it on this show.

2270
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:26,830
Does the sun look round as it rises?

2271
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:29,260
Well, it's not square-shaped.

2272
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:30,359
(He states the obvious.)

2273
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:32,200
I'm spewing nonsense.

2274
01:27:33,429 --> 01:27:34,500
I'm sorry, Si Eon.

2275
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:38,700
(He cuts the nonsense
and waits for the sunrise.)

2276
01:27:39,739 --> 01:27:41,239
(They want time to flow slowly.)

2277
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:43,880
You must've been sad
since it was your last day.

2278
01:27:46,179 --> 01:27:48,149
Should we write something on the sand?

2279
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:49,779
What? What would you like to write?

2280
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,380
Or should we write our own names?

2281
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,620
Sounds good. Let's do that.

2282
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:56,090
- Should we do that?
- This is a clean canvas.

2283
01:27:58,519 --> 01:28:01,559
(Exclaiming)

2284
01:28:01,559 --> 01:28:04,599
Dex tends to make sounds
when he does something.

2285
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,800
- "Dex."
- "Dex."

2286
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:09,870
(Artistic84 puts his heart into it...)

2287
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,300
(even when writing his name.)

2288
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,069
- That's his signature.
- He's good.

2289
01:28:13,069 --> 01:28:14,739
- That's his signature.
- Of course.

2290
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:16,439
Artists sure stand out.

2291
01:28:16,939 --> 01:28:18,479
What did you write, Pani Bottle?

2292
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:20,349
Just "Pani." In English.

2293
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:22,080
- That's nice.
- "Pani."

2294
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:23,720
(His name is the smallest.)

2295
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,120
Yours is too small.

2296
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:26,519
That's all I can handle.

2297
01:28:26,519 --> 01:28:28,450
(He's humble.)

2298
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:30,660
Why did you write "Lee Si Eon Eon?"

2299
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,859
I was afraid it'd get erased,
so I wrote it again at the bottom.

2300
01:28:34,189 --> 01:28:36,029
I see. "Si Eon is the best."

2301
01:28:36,029 --> 01:28:37,399
- "Si Eon is the best."
- "Si Eon is the best."

2302
01:28:39,059 --> 01:28:40,399
He sure loves himself.

2303
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:41,769
(He loves himself greatly.)

2304
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:43,899
"Were here."

2305
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,500
"Were here."

2306
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:47,370
You all have different styles.

2307
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:50,210
Hey.

2308
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,880
There it rises.

2309
01:28:53,279 --> 01:28:55,450
- There it comes.
- It's the sunrise.

2310
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:56,679
(The sun started to rise
while they were writing their names.)

2311
01:28:58,179 --> 01:28:59,279
(This is their last sunrise
in Madagascar.)

2312
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:00,450
What a sight.

2313
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:01,649
How beautiful.

2314
01:29:02,519 --> 01:29:03,920
You need to come back to Korea now.

2315
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,059
No. This can't be over!

2316
01:29:06,059 --> 01:29:07,260
No, we refuse to say goodbye!

2317
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:09,189
- Let us come back to Korea.
- Don't come!

2318
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:10,700
- Let us come back.
- Don't come!

2319
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,330
- Don't rise! Go back down!
- Go back down!

2320
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:13,769
- Don't rise!
- Don't rise!

2321
01:29:13,769 --> 01:29:15,470
- Don't rise! Go back down!
- Go back down!

2322
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:17,470
No.

2323
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:19,099
(However, the sun continues to rise.)

2324
01:29:19,099 --> 01:29:20,739
It's so golden.

2325
01:29:24,679 --> 01:29:27,010
(He puts his hands together with respect.)

2326
01:29:27,849 --> 01:29:29,050
Let's make a wish.

2327
01:29:29,050 --> 01:29:32,220
(They make wishes to the rising sun.)

2328
01:29:36,859 --> 01:29:40,160
I'm grateful that no one got hurt
during this trip.

2329
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:41,689
(Thank you for keeping us safe.)

2330
01:29:42,130 --> 01:29:43,500
Let's each say something.

2331
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,670
Kian84!

2332
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,239
What was that?

2333
01:29:50,569 --> 01:29:51,639
All right.

2334
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:55,510
Right. They can read each other's minds.

2335
01:29:56,109 --> 01:29:58,910
Yes, I'm finally going home!

2336
01:29:58,910 --> 01:30:00,880
You blurted out your deepest thoughts.

2337
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:03,319
I'm going home too!

2338
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:11,260
Our trip is over.

2339
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:13,859
(Our trip is over.)

2340
01:30:16,029 --> 01:30:19,059
Let's all be healthy...

2341
01:30:19,059 --> 01:30:20,370
and happy!

2342
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:26,670
The trip ended...

2343
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:28,710
in the blink of an eye.

2344
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:35,010
(Si Eon was a city guy
who struggled in South America.)

2345
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,179
(He became weaker and weaker
in the brutal environment.)

2346
01:30:38,179 --> 01:30:39,679
(Save me.)

2347
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:43,790
(He knew how much his friends struggled,)

2348
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:49,760
(so he decided to surprise them.)

2349
01:30:50,359 --> 01:30:53,170
(He even cooked Korean food for them.)

2350
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,639
(He fed them rejuvenating food.)

2351
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,939
(He was their eldest brother and mother.)

2352
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,870
(He led them during their bike ride.)

2353
01:31:01,939 --> 01:31:03,340
(Watch out for the cars.)

2354
01:31:03,479 --> 01:31:04,739
(Watch out for the holes.)

2355
01:31:05,139 --> 01:31:08,349
(He was like a control tower
and kept the others safe.)

2356
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,080
(Do you want me to take a photo?)

2357
01:31:11,849 --> 01:31:16,290
(He always volunteered
to take photos of them.)

2358
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:21,590
(His album was full of their photos.)

2359
01:31:21,590 --> 01:31:22,830
They all turned out nicely.

2360
01:31:24,059 --> 01:31:25,830
I joined the group a bit late,

2361
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:28,500
so our time together...

2362
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,470
felt precious and delightful.

2363
01:31:32,139 --> 01:31:34,470
If I look back to this trip
5 to 6 years from now,

2364
01:31:36,069 --> 01:31:38,779
it'll be a beautiful trip
that I can never go back to.

2365
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:42,580
I don't think
I'll ever get such an opportunity again.

2366
01:31:44,349 --> 01:31:48,189
(Any last words for your friends?)

2367
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:54,229
We may never be able
to go on another trip.

2368
01:31:54,929 --> 01:31:58,599
It made me happy...

2369
01:31:59,970 --> 01:32:01,769
to be able to join you guys midway.

2370
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,670
I had a blast.

2371
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:09,109
Let's continue bickering...

2372
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:13,609
Let's continue bickering...

2373
01:32:13,609 --> 01:32:14,609
(He becomes teary-eyed.)

2374
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,880
I hope we continue to get along.

2375
01:32:21,349 --> 01:32:23,090
Just like that blazing sun,

2376
01:32:24,189 --> 01:32:26,590
I hope we will all shine forever.

2377
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:28,559
(He hopes their memories
will continue to shine.)

2378
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:30,599
We all said our goodbyes in our own ways.

2379
01:32:30,599 --> 01:32:32,130
(They say their goodbyes
in their own styles.)

2380
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:35,229
You all said goodbye in your own ways.

2381
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:39,700
It feels weird to say, "Goodbye everyone."

2382
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:42,040
"This is the end."

2383
01:32:43,109 --> 01:32:44,979
I will part ways with this show...

2384
01:32:44,979 --> 01:32:47,609
without officially saying goodbye.

2385
01:32:48,809 --> 01:32:50,479
Yes, don't say goodbye.

2386
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:51,519
(He doesn't want to put an end
to these precious memories.)

2387
01:32:52,479 --> 01:32:55,819
(He will forever cherish these memories.)

2388
01:32:55,819 --> 01:32:58,160
(His trip comes to an end.)

2389
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:02,729
(And...)

2390
01:33:02,729 --> 01:33:04,130
I don't know.

2391
01:33:05,029 --> 01:33:06,599
I wanted to walk this far.

2392
01:33:08,929 --> 01:33:12,569
Just like how this path is stuck,

2393
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,910
I feel like my life is stuck as well.

2394
01:33:17,479 --> 01:33:20,809
(Before the trip...)

2395
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:24,080
(I can't stop.)

2396
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,920
(It'll be the end.)

2397
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:29,550
(Not letting himself rest
caused him to burn out.)

2398
01:33:29,989 --> 01:33:31,689
(I only have one wish these days,)

2399
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:34,359
(and it's to be isolated.)

2400
01:33:35,889 --> 01:33:38,859
(He dreamed of being isolated
from his everyday life.)

2401
01:33:39,559 --> 01:33:42,069
(Like so, he went to Madagascar,
a primitive island.)

2402
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:43,939
(Hey)

2403
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:45,899
(He was flustered from day one...)

2404
01:33:46,609 --> 01:33:47,670
(when he saw his friends
enjoy themselves at the festival.)

2405
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:49,010
That was the very beginning.

2406
01:33:49,939 --> 01:33:51,380
(I shouldn't have come.)

2407
01:33:52,179 --> 01:33:53,950
(Good job, Dex.)

2408
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:57,519
(But he soon let his guard down
alongside them.)

2409
01:33:57,519 --> 01:34:00,149
- Dex changed a lot.
- He did.

2410
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:01,950
(He received unconditional encouragements
from others.)

2411
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:03,489
Gosh, it's like a story of his youth.

2412
01:34:03,489 --> 01:34:04,760
I remember that.

2413
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:08,460
(He enjoyed the beauty
of going on a trip.)

2414
01:34:09,489 --> 01:34:10,559
(Let's go!)

2415
01:34:11,559 --> 01:34:16,769
(And the moment they came face to face
with the baobab trees they had dreamed of)

2416
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:20,870
(They embraced their bucket list
with their whole bodies.)

2417
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:22,010
Those are good memories.

2418
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:24,179
(It seems like
you're really enjoying things.)

2419
01:34:24,179 --> 01:34:25,239
(I really am.)

2420
01:34:25,710 --> 01:34:28,649
(I hope things can just keep going
like this.)

2421
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:32,750
(Yes, this was exactly what I wanted.)

2422
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:35,319
I really felt like we were just traveling
on our own.

2423
01:34:35,319 --> 01:34:37,220
That was when I started to feel
a sense of healing.

2424
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:40,059
I had been burned out in Korea,

2425
01:34:40,059 --> 01:34:41,929
but for some reason, my mind felt at ease.

2426
01:34:42,389 --> 01:34:43,899
I think that was what this time was about.

2427
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:48,200
I believe that there will come a moment...

2428
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,670
when things will get cut off
like this path here.

2429
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:53,000
But when I turn back,

2430
01:34:55,269 --> 01:34:56,979
we're all together.

2431
01:34:57,279 --> 01:34:59,910
I think I'll be able to make it somehow.

2432
01:34:59,979 --> 01:35:02,250
- Right, there's always another path.
- Yes, right.

2433
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:05,750
I'm actually a person
who's afraid of taking on challenges.

2434
01:35:05,849 --> 01:35:08,019
I only want to experience
tastes that I'm familiar with,

2435
01:35:08,019 --> 01:35:09,920
and I only want to experience
things that I'm used to.

2436
01:35:10,189 --> 01:35:13,359
But when we do things together,
I wasn't afraid of new challenges.

2437
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:14,989
They felt fun for me.

2438
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:17,760
I think it was a good decision
to come on this trip. And...

2439
01:35:18,729 --> 01:35:22,769
When I get back,
I think I should work hard again.

2440
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,069
And I think I'll be able to do a good job.

2441
01:35:27,439 --> 01:35:28,939
This has been Dex so far.

2442
01:35:29,769 --> 01:35:31,139
(Dex's adventure where he received
the strength to go back to his daily life)

2443
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:33,239
He was able to recharge his energy.

2444
01:35:33,609 --> 01:35:35,080
- Nice.
- "Dex's adventure."

2445
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:41,489
From Peru and Bolivia,

2446
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:44,720
and to India, and Madagascar,

2447
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:47,689
I've successfully finished three trips.

2448
01:35:47,689 --> 01:35:48,689
(Pani Bottle went on
all three adventures together.)

2449
01:35:48,689 --> 01:35:50,460
I've been on many trips before,

2450
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:53,000
but on this trip, I realized once again...

2451
01:35:54,099 --> 01:35:56,130
that having someone join me...

2452
01:35:58,139 --> 01:36:00,410
on my trek was...

2453
01:36:01,069 --> 01:36:03,410
a very happy and joyous thing.

2454
01:36:04,939 --> 01:36:06,880
(From their first meeting)

2455
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:09,779
Right. Oh, my goodness.

2456
01:36:09,779 --> 01:36:11,349
(What? Who are you?)

2457
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:14,019
(If we had to talk about this guy...)

2458
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:15,889
(He doesn't have altitude sickness,)

2459
01:36:15,889 --> 01:36:17,260
"He doesn't have altitude sickness."

2460
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:18,960
(but he does get nosebleeds.)

2461
01:36:19,559 --> 01:36:22,760
(His appetite hadn't exploded...)

2462
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:24,859
- His appetite exploded.
- <i>Pani baguette</i>

2463
01:36:24,859 --> 01:36:26,059
"Full of contradictions."

2464
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:29,970
(But when it comes to traveling,)

2465
01:36:30,739 --> 01:36:31,769
(he's Charismatic Pani himself.)

2466
01:36:31,769 --> 01:36:33,840
- "Charismatic Pani." Gosh.
- "Charismatic Pani."

2467
01:36:34,569 --> 01:36:35,809
(He's even considerate enough to
voluntarily take the uncomfortable seats.)

2468
01:36:35,809 --> 01:36:38,580
- I know. He's always considerate.
- He's so warm-hearted.

2469
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:40,609
He always takes the worst seat.

2470
01:36:41,649 --> 01:36:42,779
He's so kind.

2471
01:36:42,779 --> 01:36:43,779
(Even in the worst corner,
Considerate Bottle shined.)

2472
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:47,819
(Irreplaceable on Adventure by Accident,)

2473
01:36:48,649 --> 01:36:54,760
(the regular traveler who was present
for 3 consecutive seasons)

2474
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:01,000
Whether I get to join
for the next trip or not...

2475
01:37:02,929 --> 01:37:05,000
So, I...

2476
01:37:08,609 --> 01:37:09,939
Hang on. I'm starting to get choked up.

2477
01:37:11,809 --> 01:37:13,040
Gosh, hold on.

2478
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,620
Gosh, why am I suddenly...

2479
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:25,620
Why am I...

2480
01:37:26,189 --> 01:37:27,330
(In the end, his tears burst through.)

2481
01:37:27,330 --> 01:37:28,429
- Can I have a tissue?
- Gosh.

2482
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:33,569
I can't stop it. Goodness.

2483
01:37:36,069 --> 01:37:38,399
(Tearing up at the thought
that this is the last time)

2484
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:40,269
- That was the very last interview, right?
- Yes.

2485
01:37:41,609 --> 01:37:42,769
You've gotten soft-hearted.

2486
01:37:42,769 --> 01:37:45,279
- Gosh, that's touching.
- Pani Bottle.

2487
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:46,609
(The brothers understand how he feels.)

2488
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:48,550
This is my first time crying on TV.

2489
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:49,979
That was the first time.

2490
01:37:52,349 --> 01:37:55,689
(The traveler who was always sincere
as if it was the first time)

2491
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,220
(I'm not going to cry.)

2492
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,859
Gosh, I keep choking up. Why?

2493
01:38:01,859 --> 01:38:02,889
(He tries hard to hold back his emotions.)

2494
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:10,069
This was what I thought my role should be.

2495
01:38:10,069 --> 01:38:12,300
Of course, Kian84 is the leading man,
along with Si Eon.

2496
01:38:12,939 --> 01:38:16,880
I was there to fill in the gaps
on what they didn't know.

2497
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:21,010
I thought I should look after them.

2498
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:25,120
But as we went on,
this became my own trip too.

2499
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,120
Oh, my.

2500
01:38:29,649 --> 01:38:33,059
(He had become immersed in the trip
as if it was his own in no time.)

2501
01:38:36,899 --> 01:38:38,059
It became my own trip.

2502
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,399
(What?)

2503
01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:42,330
(What did he say?)

2504
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:43,939
Fine, it's yours.

2505
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,470
- You can do everything by yourself.
- Oh, my stomach.

2506
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:49,370
- I suddenly used a regional accent?
- Please send me that meme.

2507
01:38:49,370 --> 01:38:50,939
- That meme...
- His accent was...

2508
01:38:50,939 --> 01:38:52,139
"It became my own trip."

2509
01:38:52,979 --> 01:38:54,250
- What in the world...
- I want that meme.

2510
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:56,010
- "It became my own trip."
- "It became my own trip."

2511
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:58,250
I had thought it was someone else's trip,

2512
01:38:58,250 --> 01:38:59,950
but it had become my own.
That was what I meant.

2513
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:01,250
- "It became my own."
- How cute.

2514
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:02,849
- He's so cute.
- It's scary how we grow fond...

2515
01:39:02,849 --> 01:39:03,889
- of each other.
- "It became my own."

2516
01:39:03,889 --> 01:39:06,160
When I go somewhere, I always talk about
Adventure by Accident first.

2517
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:08,830
Since this is the last episode,
I wore the jacket I bought in India...

2518
01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:10,599
- and the boots I bought in Bolivia.
- That's right.

2519
01:39:10,599 --> 01:39:12,099
- Oh, you're right.
- I wore them.

2520
01:39:12,099 --> 01:39:14,330
The title will change now.
"Pani Bottle's Adventure by Accident."

2521
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,269
- Because it became his own.
- "Pani's Adventure, Since It's Mine."

2522
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,439
Give it up, Kian84.

2523
01:39:20,939 --> 01:39:22,170
You've won the Grand Award already.

2524
01:39:23,809 --> 01:39:25,639
- We've grown so fond of each other.
- It's scary how that happens.

2525
01:39:25,639 --> 01:39:26,910
(Like that,
they grew scarily fond of each other.)

2526
01:39:28,809 --> 01:39:31,950
(I hope Adventure by Accident
is number 1 in your hearts.)

2527
01:39:33,689 --> 01:39:37,290
(The brothers were already number 1
in Pani Bottle's heart.)

2528
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:41,260
(The brothers were already number 1
in Pani Bottle's heart.)

2529
01:39:43,029 --> 01:39:44,460
I think this will stay in my memories
for a long time.

2530
01:39:48,830 --> 01:39:50,099
It was fun.

2531
01:39:51,769 --> 01:39:54,040
This is it for Pani Bottle's
Adventure by Accident. The end.

2532
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:56,170
(The leading man
and not a supporting character,)

2533
01:39:56,170 --> 01:39:57,279
(Pani Bottle's adventure is over.)

2534
01:39:57,279 --> 01:39:59,380
- Right, you were all leading men.
- That's right.

2535
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:04,679
(And the guy who was the beginning
and the end of this trip)

2536
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:07,590
It's time for the last Kian TV.

2537
01:40:10,019 --> 01:40:11,519
Exactly a year ago,

2538
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:15,660
I saw the sunset
with Si Eon and Pani Bottle.

2539
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:18,899
And about five months ago, in India,

2540
01:40:18,899 --> 01:40:20,429
I saw the sunrise by myself.

2541
01:40:20,769 --> 01:40:23,670
Today, we saw the sunrise
as a whole group.

2542
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:26,170
Time hasn't gone by...

2543
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:30,269
Since I've turned 40,
it seems like it's going by faster.

2544
01:40:31,309 --> 01:40:33,109
Time is going by too fast.

2545
01:40:33,109 --> 01:40:34,210
(Looking back, it passed by in a flash.)

2546
01:40:35,149 --> 01:40:37,220
(The starting point of this trip)

2547
01:40:37,649 --> 01:40:40,250
(Whatever I do, it's not fun.
I've already done everything.)

2548
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:41,790
(He was spending his days
stuck in mannerisms.)

2549
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:43,760
It's like I wasn't sure
if I was dead or alive.

2550
01:40:43,859 --> 01:40:45,220
I was like a halibut that was being raised
in a fish farm.

2551
01:40:45,519 --> 01:40:47,660
I eat what I'm fed.
It's the perfect living condition.

2552
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,729
But it doesn't feel like I'm alive.

2553
01:40:51,099 --> 01:40:52,960
(That was how he dreamed of escaping...)

2554
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:55,069
(or of the 2nd chapter of his life...)

2555
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:58,599
(and crash-landed as the traveler
with no plans.)

2556
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:01,540
(Take out. Possible?)

2557
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:03,410
(How there rearview mirror?)

2558
01:41:03,410 --> 01:41:05,179
"How dare you have no rearview mirror?"

2559
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:10,420
(The novice traveler was
unfamiliar with everything.)

2560
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:14,349
(Still, without any prejudices
and in his own way, he got a taste...)

2561
01:41:14,849 --> 01:41:15,920
(Gulping)

2562
01:41:16,450 --> 01:41:19,260
(And he faced the local culture head-on
with his entire body.)

2563
01:41:19,559 --> 01:41:23,489
(In no time, he had blended
into the unfamiliar world...)

2564
01:41:24,229 --> 01:41:26,729
(and had become more like a local
than the actual locals.)

2565
01:41:27,599 --> 01:41:29,870
(The raw traveler)

2566
01:41:30,029 --> 01:41:31,239
Hello, Porfi.

2567
01:41:31,239 --> 01:41:33,000
- He made a lot of new friends.
- It's been so long.

2568
01:41:33,269 --> 01:41:37,679
(The friends he met
on the other side of the world)

2569
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:40,139
Gosh, I remember the little monks.

2570
01:41:40,139 --> 01:41:42,080
(They shared deep affection
as if they were a family.)

2571
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:46,679
(The cherished connections)

2572
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:50,489
I'm eternally grateful that I got to meet
people on the other side of the world...

2573
01:41:50,489 --> 01:41:51,720
and communicate with them.

2574
01:41:51,989 --> 01:41:54,729
You got to make many good connections
when you were far away.

2575
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:56,929
As I filmed Adventure by Accident...

2576
01:41:56,929 --> 01:41:59,229
While I was a farmed halibut before,

2577
01:42:00,229 --> 01:42:02,029
I feel like a wild halibut now.

2578
01:42:02,429 --> 01:42:04,840
I think I've become a wild halibut
to a certain degree.

2579
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:06,840
I feel that I'm alive.

2580
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:08,639
(And joining him,
the friends he's grateful for)

2581
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:09,970
What I'm even more grateful for is...

2582
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:11,979
When I began, there was just me.

2583
01:42:11,979 --> 01:42:15,109
But then, I met up with Si Eon
and got to know Pani Bottle.

2584
01:42:15,109 --> 01:42:16,410
Then, I got to know Dex.

2585
01:42:17,179 --> 01:42:20,380
(Kian84's world grew much broader.)

2586
01:42:23,389 --> 01:42:28,059
(The past days were more beautiful
because they were together.)

2587
01:42:29,090 --> 01:42:32,760
(And running with them
for the past 1 year...)

2588
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:35,200
(were the 3 travel mates.)

2589
01:42:35,769 --> 01:42:37,170
It was spectacular,

2590
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:41,269
but I think it was such a pure trip.

2591
01:42:41,269 --> 01:42:45,309
The whole time I was watching,
I wanted to go into the screen.

2592
01:42:45,309 --> 01:42:47,510
- I think I've come to think...
- Yes.

2593
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:49,479
- that I want to go and find my true self.
- That's right.

2594
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:54,550
(If being born is a journey itself...)

2595
01:42:55,149 --> 01:42:58,019
Everyone, including me and you,

2596
01:42:59,989 --> 01:43:01,330
should eat lots of good food,

2597
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:03,760
see lots of good sights,

2598
01:43:04,559 --> 01:43:06,059
and live without regrets...

2599
01:43:07,529 --> 01:43:10,099
until we go over to the other side.

2600
01:43:10,899 --> 01:43:13,069
I hope that can happen.

2601
01:43:13,069 --> 01:43:14,769
(Wishing everyone
a journey without regrets!)

2602
01:43:15,269 --> 01:43:17,479
I'll end Kian TV here.

2603
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:19,139
Bye.

2604
01:43:19,139 --> 01:43:21,279
(Kian84's trip,
which has matured some more,)

2605
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:23,950
(is over.)

2606
01:43:24,979 --> 01:43:26,019
Let's go.

2607
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:29,649
You guys all worked hard.

2608
01:43:30,859 --> 01:43:34,359
Traveling is about seeing things you know
nothing about, facing them head-on,

2609
01:43:34,359 --> 01:43:37,660
and meeting unexpected situations.
I think that's what traveling is about.

2610
01:43:38,929 --> 01:43:42,899
(Adventure by Accident 3,
the 3rd trip is over.)

2611
01:43:42,899 --> 01:43:44,939
(Pani Bottle, Lee Si Eon, Kian84,
and Dex were here.)

2612
01:43:44,939 --> 01:43:46,069
Good work, guys.

2613
01:43:46,069 --> 01:43:49,710
How adorable.

2614
01:43:49,710 --> 01:43:50,979
What's that? It says "nominee."

2615
01:43:50,979 --> 01:43:52,910
(People who were part of the show,
And Lee Si Eon)

2616
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:54,179
- "And Lee Si Eon."
- "And Lee Si Eon."

2617
01:43:54,179 --> 01:43:55,809
(Excellence Award winner, Jang Do Yeon)

2618
01:43:55,809 --> 01:43:56,880
Gosh, this is funny.

2619
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,819
(Excellent reactions, Lee Seung Hoon)

2620
01:43:58,819 --> 01:44:01,389
(Kian84's wife, Simon Dominic)

2621
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:04,019
- Gosh, that was so cool.
- "Kian84's wife."

2622
01:44:04,019 --> 01:44:05,220
We're at the end.

2623
01:44:12,099 --> 01:44:13,970
- Gosh.
- Our staff.

2624
01:44:16,569 --> 01:44:17,840
That was great.

2625
01:44:18,970 --> 01:44:20,569
- Great job, everyone!
- Great job.

2626
01:44:20,569 --> 01:44:22,069
You all worked so hard.
