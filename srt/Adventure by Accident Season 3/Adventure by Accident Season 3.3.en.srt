1
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,480
Gosh.

2
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,080
(Just a few hours after the crazy night
at the ship launching party)

3
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,850
- Shall we get going?
- Let's go.

4
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:23,989
I think we slept about three hours.

5
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,119
- Three or four hours.
- Right. Three or four hours.

6
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,059
- Three hours.
- You must've been tired.

7
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:28,620
We basically just took quick naps.

8
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,759
Let's go to launch the ship.

9
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,829
(Day 4 of the Madagascar Trip)

10
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:36,500
It's 4:57 a.m.,
just 3 minutes before it starts.

11
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,070
- Oh, really?
- Really.

12
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:40,169
Are they starting?

13
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:44,709
- The music seems different.
- They are still here.

14
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:47,340
- Still?
- They were dancing all night.

15
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,340
They stayed up all night.

16
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,209
(The locals enjoyed
the ship launching party all night.)

17
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,220
(This is how people in Madagascar
have fun.)

18
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,279
- That's amazing.
- Oh, my.

19
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,790
Someone's on top of the boat.

20
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,760
(Busily getting ready
for the ship launching ceremony)

21
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,859
(Confused)

22
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:08,999
(Coming toward Kian84 and Dex)

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,029
(They ran into Merci,
the ship owner's son, again.)

24
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:12,200
Nice to meet you.

25
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,510
(What will we do now?)

26
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,169
(Do we push it?)

27
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,010
(No, you have to pull it.)

28
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,409
(This is the cheering section.)

29
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,249
I think we hold this rope.

30
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,549
(Full of enthusiasm)

31
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,019
We pull it from over there.

32
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,689
(Moving to the center stage
of the launching ceremony)

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,389
I see. We hold this.

34
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,320
They have things ready.

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,559
(The logs and ropes are ready to go.)

36
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:41,200
I see. The logs are lined up...

37
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,299
to all the way over there.

38
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:48,040
(The launching ceremony will take place
right where last night's party was held.)

39
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,010
(At the party, they expressed
their congratulations through dance.)

40
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,180
You pull that together. I see.

41
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:57,409
We'll pull it onto water from there.

42
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,480
- I see.
- It's quite far.

43
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,980
- They lay logs on the ground.
- Right.

44
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,549
Then they roll the ship
all the way to the water.

45
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:06,320
Will they be able to move
such a large ship?

46
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,519
Gosh, this is like "Physical: 100."

47
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,090
It's like a tug of war.

48
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,090
Right.

49
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,430
I was told
that ship was around 1 to 1.5 tons.

50
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,369
The ship was a lot larger
than we had expected.

51
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:23,910
When we were dancing the night before,
it was too dark,

52
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,339
so I could only see
the front part of the ship.

53
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,810
So I thought it was around the size
of the wooden boat we had ridden.

54
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,280
It was much larger than that.

55
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,549
I wasn't sure whether this was possible
using only human strength.

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,989
When I saw the ropes and logs prepared,

57
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:41,459
I wasn't sure that we could do it.

58
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,130
Also, that place was a mudflat.

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,760
I thought,
"How can we pull a ship on a mudflat?"

60
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,500
I thought we wouldn't be able to do it.
I thought it was impossible.

61
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:53,169
There aren't that many people.

62
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,269
- There were so many earlier.
- Where did everyone go?

63
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,040
- Wait...
- Do you remember Luffy?

64
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,810
- Yes.
- He left with some woman earlier.

65
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,810
Really?

66
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,679
- He succeeded.
- Really?

67
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,310
- I saw them together.
- They left together?

68
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,250
I thought he looked very happy.

69
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:09,019
Gosh, Luffy...

70
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:10,690
(You lucky guy, Luffy...)

71
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,089
There isn't any water.

72
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:14,889
- Can we really pull this?
- Seriously.

73
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,030
(The party music ended.)

74
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,100
(Picking up the rope)

75
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,899
- People are starting to gather.
- We're going to pull now.

76
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:24,530
They're picking it up.

77
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,600
I've played a lot of tug of war.

78
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,510
It's been a while.

79
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,810
This heavy feeling.

80
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,709
Okay...

81
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,310
People who were
just dancing and drinking...

82
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,350
have now gathered around the rope
to start pulling.

83
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,450
- Yes.
- It's been a while.

84
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,290
The women are cheering and dancing
in the back.

85
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,459
- They were singing.
- They're cheering everyone up.

86
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,489
(We are launching ceremony cheerleaders.)

87
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,459
(Someone is standing on the stern.)

88
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,329
Gosh. He's become Johnny Depp.

89
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:57,399
What is he doing?

90
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,470
He was like the head cheerleader.

91
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,269
Okay.

92
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,010
("Physical: 100, Madagascar version"
is ready to go.)

93
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,209
That is insane.

94
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,609
I think they're getting started.

95
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:13,320
(All the strong men in town
have gathered here.)

96
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,619
(Wait a minute.)

97
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,450
I'm getting nervous.

98
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,560
There was a peculiar nervous feeling
before we got started.

99
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,359
- What is it?
- I think we're getting started.

100
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:28,329
(Focus!)

101
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:29,800
Ready!

102
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:30,899
(Yes!)

103
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:34,469
(The warriors raise their combative spirit
under the direction of the captain.)

104
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:35,740
Oh, the warriors.

105
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,409
It's like a ritual.

106
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:39,339
(Yes!)

107
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,310
(Pausing for a moment)

108
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,510
(Okay! Let's go!)

109
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:46,079
(Pull, warriors!)

110
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
- Oh, my.
- Let's go!

111
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,420
- Let's go!
- Let's get it the first time!

112
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,389
(Starting with a determined roar)

113
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,430
(Gathering all of their strength
by remembering track and field days)

114
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,459
Come on!

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,029
Let's go!

116
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,670
They're moving that huge ship.

117
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,200
(On the mudflat of Madagascar...)

118
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
You have to lean back a lot.

119
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,870
(The warriors fight.)

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,839
(Rope being pulled very tight)

121
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,170
(Glancing over)

122
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,709
It's not moving at all!

123
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,050
- Does this actually work?
- It's so heavy!

124
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,149
Right?

125
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,479
It's not moving at all.
It really didn't move at all.

126
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,349
- Oh, no.
- I think we need twice as many people.

127
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,550
Gosh, the smell of alcohol.

128
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,560
- Gosh, the smell of alcohol.
- It does smell like alcohol a lot.

129
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,889
They even stayed up all night
before pulling the ship.

130
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:31,990
Yes, they were partying.

131
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,159
Ready!

132
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,060
Let's go!

133
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,800
(We also say, "Yes!")

134
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,800
(Launching the 2nd attack
without taking a break)

135
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,510
(Go!)

136
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,039
(Go!)

137
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,979
(Pulling the ship
to the rhythm of the captain's shouts)

138
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:49,579
We just need it to start rolling.

139
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,680
(This game of tug of war...)

140
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,450
(is a matter of pride
for the ship and the warriors.)

141
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,550
Let's go!

142
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,959
(Come on...)

143
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,599
- It's not moving at all.
- It's not moving at all.

144
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:11,769
It's not moving at all.

145
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,700
Also, the logs were lumpy.

146
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:15,969
Hey. Is it not moving at all?

147
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,010
Not at all.

148
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,240
Hey! You get off and pull too!

149
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,339
- He's quitting.
- You discouraged him.

150
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:23,240
(Feeling embarrassed)

151
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:26,820
It can't roll
because the logs are lodged in the sand.

152
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:28,920
What do we do?

153
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,120
(Stand closer together.)

154
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,149
Oh, closer?

155
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:33,789
Okay.

156
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,959
We're concentrating our power
to the middle.

157
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,690
- I see.
- Right. It was too dispersed.

158
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,729
What are they doing?

159
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:40,159
(Stand farther apart, not closer.)

160
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,000
- They're disagreeing on what to do.
- I see.

161
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,769
They're starting to disagree.

162
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:45,000
They have different opinions.

163
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,070
Do we stand farther apart
or closer together?

164
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,440
- Too many chefs in the kitchen.
- Exactly.

165
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,740
Shouldn't they come closer?

166
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:52,510
I think they should come closer.

167
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,209
Wait. We have a new cheer captain.

168
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,680
- He was fired.
- He was fired.

169
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,849
This captain is like Bruno Mars.

170
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,820
(Goodbye, Johnny Depp.
Welcome, Bruno Mars.)

171
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,789
Bruno Mars is our new captain.

172
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:11,529
(Reorganizing under the direction
of Madagascar Bruno Mars)

173
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,000
Gosh. The sky looks so pretty.

174
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,329
That's a true African sunrise.

175
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,899
The sun came up while we were doing that.

176
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,070
- You saw the sunrise.
- We saw the sunrise doing that.

177
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,099
Here we go.

178
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,969
(Under the direction of the two captains,)

179
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,579
(the group reorganized quickly.)

180
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,680
- "Starting up the cheers again."
- It's a boost.

181
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,219
(We are ready.)

182
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,360
(Turning around quickly)

183
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,829
I really felt nervous.

184
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,630
Let's do this. Let's do it.

185
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,360
(Feeling nervous)

186
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,899
(Under the direction of the new captain,)

187
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:54,300
(they try to pull the ship
for the 3rd time.)

188
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,339
(Go!)

189
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:58,969
(The strong warriors became one...)

190
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:00,639
(for the launch of this new ship.)

191
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,880
- I think it's starting to move.
- Yes.

192
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,779
- It's the owner's son.
- He's serious.

193
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,719
(You can do it!)

194
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,149
(Everyone came together
to pull this ship.)

195
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,620
Is it starting to move a bit?

196
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,789
It's not working.

197
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:22,060
(Shouting)

198
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,300
- It's moving.
- It's going.

199
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
- Oh, my.
- Let's go.

200
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:26,940
- Let's go!
- Please move!

201
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:29,639
(Please.)

202
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,979
(Surprised)

203
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,820
(Oh, my!)

204
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:44,390
(They can still feel the excitement.)

205
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:47,619
Oh, it's going!

206
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,560
(Shouting)

207
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,259
Come on! Let's go!

208
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:54,259
(A thrilling run)

209
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:55,959
Let's go!

210
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,270
Let's get it done in one try!

211
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,869
(They finally won the fight
against the ship.)

212
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,469
- It's really going now!
- Yes!

213
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,640
- Oh, my.
- Good.

214
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,770
- My goodness.
- This is so fascinating.

215
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,410
- It's really moving.
- What is this?

216
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:08,810
- It's actually working.
- It is.

217
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,450
Bruno Mars is good.

218
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,249
Bruno Mars really is the best.

219
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,920
That makes a difference?

220
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,879
- It does.
- He got everyone focused.

221
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,349
- "The first captain is sad."
- He sure is.

222
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,690
- This is like a concert.
- Exactly.

223
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,290
- "He got everyone focused?"
- He has charisma.

224
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:27,499
Bruno Mars really is great.

225
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:29,430
(Distance moved)

226
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,129
- That's amazing.
- We moved it a lot.

227
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,900
At first, I didn't even think
we would be able to pull it.

228
00:10:32,969 --> 00:10:34,170
- Exactly.
- I didn't think we could pull it at all.

229
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:36,739
- I'm surprised this is actually working.
- Seriously.

230
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,969
Oh, we need to move this to the front.

231
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,979
They were moving the logs from behind
up to the front.

232
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:44,879
- I see.
- Then we lay them out and pull again.

233
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,579
- Oh, my.
- It's like laying down more tracks.

234
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,119
- I think we have to pull it up to there.
- Right.

235
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,450
The water comes up to the target position
when the tide comes in, right?

236
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,390
- Right. We have to pull it up to there.
- Right.

237
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,290
(Singing)

238
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,030
(Singing)

239
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,530
(Singing a melody)

240
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,700
(Singing it back)

241
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,530
This is so intense.

242
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,440
(Speaking gibberish)

243
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,670
- It must be some sort of a chant.
- Right.

244
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,310
(Having too much fun)

245
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,640
Oh, the smell of alcohol.

246
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,709
- The smell of alcohol.
- Right?

247
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,550
They're pulling the ship
with the power of alcohol.

248
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,950
Oh, the smell of alcohol.

249
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,849
(The launching ceremony
full of alcohol smell)

250
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,550
Oh, no. I hope he's okay.

251
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,589
This place is...

252
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:28,520
It's kind of like a bunch of men...

253
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,660
at a hangover soup restaurant...

254
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:33,160
somewhere downtown late at night in Korea.

255
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,329
All of the men who failed
at courtship dance...

256
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,900
(Courtship dance)

257
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,170
They all gathered
at the launching ceremony.

258
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,670
So those who found someone...

259
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,879
went back home for a beautiful time.

260
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,910
Luffy left.

261
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,109
Those who only danced the courtship dance
very passionately...

262
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,979
did some more training
through the launching ceremony.

263
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,349
(Laughing)

264
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,349
He's so happy.

265
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:00,690
Hey. Tonight isn't the night.

266
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:02,259
Look at those squares.

267
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:04,690
Let's just have some hangover soup
and take a taxi back home.

268
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,030
- Let's try again next time.
- Okay.

269
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,629
But they don't have taxis,
so they're still there.

270
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,300
Eventually, the sun came up.

271
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:15,300
I wanted to focus more on pulling the ship
during the launching ceremony.

272
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,940
(Go!)

273
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,239
(Go!)

274
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,180
(The launching ceremony is a hangover cure
for those who failed at courtship.)

275
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:25,509
(Go!)

276
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,150
(Go!)

277
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,650
(The 1st captain
who returned to his position...)

278
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,489
(and the Madagascar warriors...)

279
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:36,190
(are all shouting to express their sadness
of failing at courtship.)

280
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:38,160
- If you listen to it carefully...
- Right.

281
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,859
It sounds like, "Why?"

282
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,459
- Why?
- Why is this happening?

283
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,560
- Why isn't it working?
- Why isn't it working?

284
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,729
Why did I fail today?

285
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,770
(Raging about the reasons
they failed at courtship)

286
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:47,140
- Why?
- Why?

287
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,700
- Why did you...
- Why didn't things work out for me?

288
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,570
- Why did you leave with him?
- Why did you leave with him?

289
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:54,839
(Their questions echo through the air
without getting any responses.)

290
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:02,780
(They remember how hard they danced
the night before...)

291
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,119
(while feeling the camaraderie
on the mudflat.)

292
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,989
Oh, it's working!

293
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,599
(Leaving behind yesterday's disappointment
in the past...)

294
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,170
Oh, it's working!

295
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,070
I see it's going really fast,
now that I'm watching this.

296
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,270
Oh, my goodness.

297
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:21,599
It's really charging forward.

298
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:25,369
(We will begin another chapter today.)

299
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:29,910
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

300
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,410
(The result of intense camaraderie)

301
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,509
Oh, my. Your shoes.

302
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,050
Oh, that's not good.

303
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,290
Oh, the alcohol...

304
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,489
- The smell of wine.
- The alcohol smell is so strong.

305
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:41,989
We're almost there.
We need to pull it up to there, right?

306
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:42,989
Right.

307
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,989
- Over there.
- We need to pull 1 or 2 more times.

308
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:46,030
The water comes up to here.

309
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,700
- That's not good. Look at the front.
- Oh, my!

310
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,099
- Why?
- What's wrong?

311
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,099
- Oh, no.
- The head of the ship...

312
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:52,469
- Goodness.
- dug into the ground.

313
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,900
- Oh, no.
- It's starting to tilt.

314
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,200
It's so hard on the mudflats.

315
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,140
I haven't been on mudflats like this
in a long time.

316
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,109
- These are real mudflats.
- Be careful.

317
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,239
- Your shoes got stuck in the mudflats.
- Oh, my.

318
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,440
That's so intense.

319
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,709
(It's busy at the front of the ship.)

320
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:06,780
What's going on now?

321
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,979
What's going on?

322
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,089
- It's alcohol.
- Alcohol?

323
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,320
- They were drinking more.
- Oh, my.

324
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,690
Pull once, drink once.

325
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,660
(Trying to join)

326
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,900
It's like a midday drink or snack.

327
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,959
- Wine.
- This one.

328
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,770
This country loves alcohol too.

329
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,770
(Bravely trying a Madagascar drink)

330
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
What?

331
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
It's good!

332
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,609
- Is it alcohol?
- Look at him.

333
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,839
- Okay?
- Okay!

334
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,310
I tried it, and it was pretty good.
It was slightly sweet.

335
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,550
I think it's like raspberry wine.

336
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,349
There were two types.

337
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:42,820
Is Pani Bottle getting drunk?

338
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,050
He's not very good with alcohol.

339
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:47,050
Okay? Okay.

340
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,560
Let's go!

341
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,629
(Laughing)

342
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:54,259
One was sweet, and one was hard liquor.

343
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,200
- It must've been really strong. I see.
- It was.

344
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,999
You can't say no to a drink
when you're working hard.

345
00:14:58,369 --> 00:14:59,670
- "You can't say no."
- They're so happy.

346
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,999
- Gosh. You also...
- It tastes like chemicals.

347
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:04,109
Oh, really?

348
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:06,570
(Madagascar drinks are good, right?)

349
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,680
Are you sure this is okay?

350
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:09,209
(I promise it's okay.)

351
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,310
Okay.

352
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,520
(Pounding Pani Bottle's fist
while making sure he's okay)

353
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,719
Pani Bottle has a best friend now.

354
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:19,020
Pani Bottle really is good
at getting to know people.

355
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,320
He's so popular.

356
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,359
(One more drink?)

357
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,060
- No.
- No?

358
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,060
After I drank some alcohol,
they kept coming to talk to me.

359
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,190
People grow closer
by joking around together.

360
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,030
Hey. Your friend is climbing up a tree.

361
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,459
Why is he going up there?

362
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,829
- What's going on?
- He was really drunk by that point.

363
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:33,969
- That's why he went up there?
- How cute.

364
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,900
- Goodness.
- Hey! You're going to hurt yourself!

365
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,440
(Hold your breath and Madagascar dive.)

366
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
Oh, my goodness.

367
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,410
He jumped on purpose, right?

368
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,280
He didn't fall. He was diving.

369
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,749
- Oh, gosh.
- That scared me.

370
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,320
Is he drunk?

371
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:49,950
(He's always like that.)

372
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,450
This is insane.

373
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,890
(My friend is full of energy.)

374
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:58,160
I think they're trying to pull the ship
while lifting it up.

375
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,190
(Meanwhile, others are trying to stop
the ship from falling over.)

376
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:02,300
Okay. Go.

377
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,329
(Working hard together)

378
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,170
- Oh, they did it.
- They did it.

379
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:12,270
(The warriors gather around the ship
for the last time.)

380
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,450
(It took 7 years...)

381
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,180
(to make this dream come true.)

382
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,520
They built it for seven years.

383
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,150
- It's so meaningful.
- Totally.

384
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,190
Even the women joined us.

385
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,430
(Everyone is helping out in their own way
to celebrate the launch.)

386
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,999
(The Madagascar Brothers focus
and get a tight grasp on the rope.)

387
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,800
- We just need to pull one last time.
- The last time.

388
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,170
- It's the last time.
- We have to squeeze out our strength.

389
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:46,609
(Go!)

390
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:47,680
(Let's go!)

391
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,479
(Shouting)

392
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:56,050
(The warriors give it their all
on the mudflats.)

393
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,020
The cheerleaders.

394
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,420
(The cheerleaders never get tired.)

395
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,690
(They're all working together
to make someone's dream come true.)

396
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,129
- I really hope they can do it.
- Come on!

397
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,900
- Come on.
- Oh, my.

398
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,670
We have to do it. It's our last chance.

399
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,170
It's moving.

400
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,839
- Oh, my.
- A little bit more.

401
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,979
(Charging forward)

402
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:25,050
Let's go!

403
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,989
(The victorious warriors charge forward.)

404
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,390
(Falling over with joy)

405
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,430
(Running and cheering)

406
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:44,099
(And the hidden MVPs)

407
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:50,239
(We did it!)

408
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:52,339
- We did it.
- So cool.

409
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,509
(Giving themselves a round of applause)

410
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:55,739
Good work.

411
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:58,479
- That was amazing.
- You must've felt so proud.

412
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,749
- We felt so proud.
- Yes.

413
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:04,550
(The ship finally got onto the ocean
after 7 years of hard work.)

414
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,959
(The warriors celebrate with fist bumps.)

415
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:10,989
Good.

416
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,130
- I guess the water comes up to here.
- That was insanely tough.

417
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,700
(Laughing)

418
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,100
Gosh. We actually did it.

419
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
Humans can do this.

420
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,340
(Just a few hours ago,)

421
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,840
(the ship was here.)

422
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,110
We pulled it so far.

423
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,539
I can see it now that we're watching this.

424
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,410
- Seriously.
- I feel so proud.

425
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,680
You three worked so hard.

426
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,009
I was told they took seven years
to build this ship.

427
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:36,580
It felt very meaningful
that the three of us...

428
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,049
could help wrap up...

429
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:40,789
those seven years of work.

430
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:44,660
Also, I thought it was very meaningful
that we could help someone...

431
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,559
with a new start.

432
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:48,459
When we were pulling the rope,

433
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:49,729
(Everyone tugged the rope together.)

434
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,569
we bumped our fists
on our chests and everything.

435
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,140
We practically became a team.

436
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:56,600
It made me...

437
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,239
try harder too.

438
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,709
It was more enjoyable
because we did it together.

439
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:08,380
The launching ceremony was
like the wedding I attended in India.

440
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,489
Actually,
it was more emotional than the wedding.

441
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,719
- We tugged the rope together.
- Right.

442
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,719
Yes.

443
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:16,090
It felt like I was really traveling...

444
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,420
- when I did that.
- Right.

445
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,529
Dex and Pani Bottle joined me.

446
00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:22,459
The fact that
the three of us did that together...

447
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:23,959
made me happy.

448
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,499
Since the launching ceremony was over,
did the ship set out right away?

449
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,640
After the final inspection of the ship,

450
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,009
they'll start taking the ship out.

451
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,140
- They must set up the sail too.
- I see.

452
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,140
They're about 90 percent done.

453
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,940
Let's go.

454
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,910
- "Let's go?"
- Let's go.

455
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,219
(The locals are friendlier
after the launching ceremony.)

456
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:42,819
- They made friends like that.
- Right.

457
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:45,890
- My flip-flips.
- What?

458
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,950
- Did you lose them?
- Did you lose them?

459
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,319
(A while ago
before the launching ceremony)

460
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,130
- The flip-flops came off.
- It was because it was the mudflat.

461
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,029
(Tossing the flip-flops far away)

462
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,299
(Going after them)

463
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:00,100
(Picking them up)

464
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,539
(Nodding)

465
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,140
(She exits after scoring the flip-flops.)

466
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,870
"She exits after scoring the flip-flops."

467
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,380
- So she just picked them up?
- We nodded at each other.

468
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,009
I thought that she was going to
hold onto my flip-flops.

469
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,309
- You thought she was looking out for you.
- "Hold them for me."

470
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:14,479
But she thought I threw them out.

471
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,719
- So she was like, "I'll take them."
- "Thanks."

472
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,350
- There was a misunderstanding.
- You misunderstood each other.

473
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:21,190
(He coolly tugged the rope
the best he could without his shoes.)

474
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,489
I'm doomed. Someone took my flip-flops.

475
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,660
Darn it.

476
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,299
Hey, you got new shoes.

477
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,229
- The mud shoes.
- The mud shoes.

478
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,469
(He runs into the son of the shipowner
while wearing his mud shoes.)

479
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:35,539
Congratulations.

480
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,209
Congratulations.

481
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:39,809
Congratulations.

482
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,440
Congratulations.

483
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,610
Thank you so much
for coming to the launching ceremony.

484
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,019
I have presents for you at my house.

485
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:52,450
- Okay. Go home.
- Let's go.

486
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,719
Congratulations.

487
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:56,459
(They chummily set out
while wearing mud shoes.)

488
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,160
(Some time passes by.)

489
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,759
- The water is coming in now.
- Yes, the water is coming in.

490
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,430
The ship must be sailing
all around the ocean now.

491
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:06,870
- What a meaningful day you had.
- Yes.

492
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,969
(They follow Merci
and head to the village.)

493
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:12,969
Mr. Shipowner.

494
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:16,610
- But Merci isn't the shipowner.
- Okay.

495
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,709
- He's the son of the shipowner.
- I see.

496
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,549
How old are you?

497
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:23,019
I'm 22.

498
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,620
- I see.
- Merci is 22.

499
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:27,120
It took 7 years to build the ship.
Then you started building it at 15.

500
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,559
Did you start building it at 15?

501
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:32,130
Maybe he started helping his father
at the age of 15.

502
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,459
- They probably built it together.
- Right.

503
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,529
I bet it was the most natural thing to do.

504
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:36,100
(That's how parents educate
their kids early on.)

505
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,600
You have money and the ship.

506
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,370
That's why I thought he was...

507
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,100
young and very successful
at the same time.

508
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,840
- You thought he was the shipowner.
- Right. I thought that too.

509
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840
- Young and rich.
- I thought he was young and rich.

510
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,309
I thought he was born
with a silver spoon at first.

511
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:49,140
That's why
you stood especially close to him.

512
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,979
Were you acting like his secretary?

513
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:54,719
I see. This is a village.

514
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,789
They're dancing here too.

515
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:00,390
- Gosh. So cute.
- Look at the kids.

516
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,890
They really love singing and dancing.

517
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,360
Is it like a kindergarten here?

518
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:11,999
You can sit down over there.
I'll pick some coconuts for you.

519
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,600
- Okay.
- Thank you.

520
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,870
Should we sit here?

521
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,269
(Swaying Bottle
sits next to the dancing kids.)

522
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:19,640
- What's that?
- Gosh, Pani Bottle.

523
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,440
- I thought you were a local guy.
- I thought he was a local guy.

524
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,509
I was surprised.

525
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:25,009
Are they coconuts?

526
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:27,410
He's climbing up the tree.

527
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,420
(Merci)

528
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:29,979
(Taking big steps)

529
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:31,920
He's walking up
as if he's walking on a flat surface.

530
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,950
Thank you, Merci.

531
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,519
(He arrives at the peak in no time.)

532
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,729
I think I can do it. It's not that high.

533
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:41,799
Gosh. Come on.

534
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:44,029
- Merci.
- Dex ought to try it out too.

535
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,700
Gosh. Dex must try it out.

536
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:48,769
(Okay)

537
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:50,569
- Gosh. This...
- I know what to do with my legs.

538
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,039
This looks pretty challenging.

539
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:55,910
They made scratches on the tree
to use as a foothold.

540
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,549
Dex, will you try it out?

541
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:00,309
- I think I can give it a shot.
- Will you?

542
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:02,779
- You've never climbed up a tree before.
- Never in my life.

543
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:04,350
- You got this.
- I knew it.

544
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:07,249
Grab this. Okay.

545
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,860
(Screaming)

546
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:11,559
- He could get hurt.
- It was slippery.

547
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,660
It's not easy. For them,
it's part of the day-to-day life.

548
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,029
I mean, it wasn't that high.

549
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,670
Merci climbed up as if it was nothing.

550
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,239
Before going up,
I thought, "Gosh, I can do that too."

551
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,539
But when I went up, it was so slippery.

552
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,969
I thought, "How did Merci manage
to climb up on this slipper tree?"

553
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,910
So when I climbed up,

554
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,779
I slipped once.

555
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,479
My pride was bruised right at that moment.

556
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:36,249
I thought,
"Should I go down? But it's me."

557
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,789
(No way)

558
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,090
"I'll climb up to the top no matter what
even if I graze my skin."

559
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,120
He must keep his pride intact.

560
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,029
"But it's me. I'm Dex."

561
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,830
There's stuff on the bottoms of his feet.
He might slip.

562
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:52,969
Actually, he's gotten heavy
because he's been gaining muscles.

563
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,100
(Clenching his teeth)

564
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,340
He's determined.

565
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,370
(He's so close to the top.)

566
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,410
He's using his power.

567
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,410
Seriously.
He went up with his determination.

568
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,950
- He's only using his power.
- Gosh.

569
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,380
(He's pretty good.)

570
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,019
(He climbed up about a height of 3.5m.)

571
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,279
That's 3.5m high.

572
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,390
(He uses every ounce of his energy left.)

573
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,920
Gosh, this is a challenge.
But he went up to the top.

574
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,120
His feet must be slippery.

575
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,190
(Picking it off)

576
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,860
(Did you see that?)

577
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:22,959
(Nice catch.)

578
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:25,069
(Well done.)

579
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,100
How am I going to climb down?

580
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,239
- How am I going to climb down?
- It was higher than I thought.

581
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:33,039
How...

582
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:37,380
(The youngest member didn't think about
coming down before climbing up.)

583
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,180
Hey, be careful.
You'll scratch your thighs.

584
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:41,850
- Hey.
- Hey.

585
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:44,489
(Chafing)

586
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:45,549
- That must hurt.
- Goodness.

587
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:46,690
(Goodness. Oh, no!)

588
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:49,519
(Clasping his hands tightly)

589
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,459
(My goodness)

590
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:54,959
(He slips down
as he doesn't know any other method.)

591
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,100
(Grunting)

592
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,969
(What happened?)

593
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,910
- Oh, no.
- That must hurt.

594
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:06,940
(Goodness)

595
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,509
This is hard.

596
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,140
- Of course.
- It's hard.

597
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:12,779
Will you try it out?

598
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:14,150
- It's hard.
- Will you try it out?

599
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,719
Go for it.

600
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,719
Don't do it. You'll get hurt, Hee Min.

601
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,549
- If you can hear us, don't do it.
- If you can hear us,

602
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,890
don't do it.

603
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,489
But my feet are slippery.

604
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,289
(He bravely
gets into the starting position.)

605
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:28,600
(Fumbling)

606
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:30,959
Hey. There's nothing to grab.
How did you climb up?

607
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,069
- There was nothing to grab onto.
- It's dangerous.

608
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:34,769
Will you give up?

609
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:37,969
- Will you give up?
- What is it?

610
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,140
I need something to pull.

611
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,110
I see. The gear.

612
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,279
(The gear for climbing trees)

613
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,580
But the rope...

614
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,009
(He suddenly takes off
his favorite shirt.)

615
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:47,009
What?

616
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,289
(Even when he eats,
he insists on eating with his hands.)

617
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,420
(Wild84 is far from utilizing technology.)

618
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,160
I need this.

619
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,160
(Did he finally start using tools?)

620
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:00,559
- He's using tools.
- Gosh.

621
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,759
He's finally using his brain.

622
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,930
(He's pretty smart.)

623
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,999
(Chuckling)

624
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,640
- Hey, you're smart.
- How did you come up with that idea?

625
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:11,840
(Gosh, this is amazing.)

626
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:14,069
(Fascinated)

627
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:16,340
- I feel so bad for that shirt now.
- So this was...

628
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,509
(Save his favorite shirt.)

629
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,610
That's it. That's great.

630
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,779
(He tightly purses his lips...)

631
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,749
(and slowly makes his way up.)

632
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:26,019
(Hesitant)

633
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,420
Goodness.

634
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,360
Let's ask him to teach us a trick.

635
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,360
I was afraid that it might chafe my skin.

636
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,059
Right. You shouldn't get hurt.

637
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,400
I don't have any energy left.

638
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,670
Hey, he's breaking the coconut open.

639
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:42,539
He's breaking it open.

640
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:47,170
(He uses a hatchet to chip at it.)

641
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,709
- Gosh.
- I see. Like that.

642
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,350
(You worked hard. Have some.)

643
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,979
- Thank you.
- Wait.

644
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:54,580
- Wait.
- What is it?

645
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,450
What is it?

646
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,519
(He doesn't waste the coconut meat.)

647
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:00,719
- It's really good.
- Is it?

648
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,890
In my opinion, it was tastier
than the ones I had in Southeast Asia.

649
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
Is it good?

650
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:07,160
This is great.

651
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,160
(Little Dex who is a picky eater
has a sip too.)

652
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,930
It's so sweet.

653
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,969
- This part is tasty.
- This part?

654
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,600
- Yes. This is tasty.
- The skin?

655
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,739
You must have been hungry that day.
You guys used a lot of energy.

656
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,209
(Humming)

657
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,880
- The inside is tasty.
- Really?

658
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,080
- Pull the inside and try it.
- How does it taste?

659
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,319
Usually,
the coconut meat isn't that tasty.

660
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,249
- Is that so?
- It's rare to find a tasty coconut.

661
00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:34,249
It's really good.

662
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Our Little Dex.

663
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:38,229
(Spitting it out)

664
00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:40,430
- Look at him. Seriously?
- Did you feel it?

665
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,529
- Your mom would've given you a clout.
- Yes, I did.

666
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:44,969
- That's what babies do.
- Exactly. Babies do that.

667
00:27:44,969 --> 00:27:46,870
(Babies do that
when they eat something they don't like.)

668
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:48,640
- It's not my kind of food.
- Is that so?

669
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:50,900
(Chuckling)

670
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,009
(This one will be good.)

671
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:56,380
How do you say "cheers" in their language?

672
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:58,180
- Tchin tchin.
- Tchin tchin?

673
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,180
- Tchin tchin?
- Tchin tchin?

674
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,380
- Tchin tchin.
- Merci, Tchin tchin.

675
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,680
- Tchin tchin.
- Tchin tchin.

676
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,950
- That sounds like "best friend."
- "Best friend."

677
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,049
- I see.
- Congratulations.

678
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:09,289
(They drink up the coconut
while celebrating the launch.)

679
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:10,959
(Staring)

680
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,590
Do you want a sip?

681
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:16,499
A sip?

682
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:18,799
You don't want to drink it?

683
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,569
Kids preferred Coke to coconuts too.

684
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,499
Gosh. Okay.

685
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:26,239
- This isn't my style.
- I want the coconut meat.

686
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,239
(Axing)

687
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,249
Look at that. Gosh.

688
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:34,209
- You must eat the inside.
- Seriously.

689
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,620
It was enough for a meal.

690
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,190
They were enjoying that.
It was like they were eating crab meat.

691
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,549
(He pulls it apart
as if he's eating crab meat.)

692
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:42,489
Did you go there for the food,
Pani Bottle?

693
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,660
- You didn't drink anything there.
- Well...

694
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,630
Their palm trees were really tasty.
I'm serious.

695
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,499
It was like rice.
When I kept chewing on it, it got sweeter.

696
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,200
- It was savory.
- It was a good snack.

697
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,630
(Finding him cute)

698
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,400
- Merci.
- Yes?

699
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:56,969
We'll get going now.

700
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:59,269
(Okay, bye)

701
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:01,110
- Okay. Good luck.
- Good luck with your life.

702
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:02,539
- Good luck.
- Yes.

703
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:03,580
Make a lot of money.

704
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,479
- Bye.
- Bye.

705
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,080
- I hope you succeed.
- Thank you.

706
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,519
Thank you.

707
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,450
(Now that they're done
picking off the coconuts,)

708
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,559
(the sun is high up in the sky.)

709
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:18,959
(They're knocked out on their beds.)

710
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,870
- Gosh. Look at Pani Bottle's hair.
- It's 1:30 p.m.

711
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,799
- We slept a lot.
- That's the hairstyle of the ugly doll.

712
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,469
He looks cute. His face is nice and puffy.

713
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,640
It's way past lunchtime.

714
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:35,779
- Hello. Good afternoon.
- Hello.

715
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,479
Luckily, he spoke English.

716
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,610
Is there any room service?

717
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,650
Yes.

718
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,880
What should I order?

719
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,719
(He orders room service
as soon as he wakes up.)

720
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,450
Two pizzas.

721
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,890
- Two pizzas.
- Yes.

722
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:48,090
One salad.

723
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,959
- Smoked fish?
- Yes.

724
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,289
- A salad with smoked fish.
- Yes.

725
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:53,590
- Finished. Yes.
- Okay.

726
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,299
- To the room, please.
- Okay.

727
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,959
Aren't you hungry?

728
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,670
- I'm hungry.
- I ordered some room service.

729
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,299
- Really?
- There's room service?

730
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:04,440
I ordered some pizza and a salad.

731
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:06,309
- Amazing.
- Yes.

732
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,239
(Knocking)

733
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,340
It's here.

734
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,880
Yes.

735
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,910
(Getting the door barefoot)

736
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,350
(He quickly takes the food.)

737
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,489
This smells amazing.

738
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,120
(Very satisfied)

739
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,219
It tastes like smoked salmon.

740
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,019
Oh, pizza.

741
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,789
Great.

742
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,890
- Gosh.
- It looks good.

743
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:30,559
(Humming)

744
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,999
- What's that?
- Iced Americano.

745
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:36,569
They didn't have iced Americano there.

746
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,110
We asked for black coffee and ice.

747
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,410
(Clinking)

748
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:43,809
(He has a long swig of the cool coffee.)

749
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,809
He won't have to sleep for three days.

750
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,080
(Let me have a sip too.)

751
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:51,180
The ice melted quickly.
We had to drink fast.

752
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:53,450
(Munching)

753
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,160
It looks like I'm the only one eating.

754
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:56,759
It only looks like that.

755
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
What a nice meal.

756
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,660
What should we do today?

757
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,660
Let's rest.

758
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,330
He's getting rounder.

759
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,299
I would like to exercise. Pani Bottle.

760
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:12,209
As you can probably guess from my figure,

761
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:13,209
I don't exercise.

762
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:15,479
Why do you keep bulking up?

763
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,180
I'm bulking up with fat.

764
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,080
- As for our dinner,
- Okay.

765
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,950
I made a reservation
at a special restaurant for you guys.

766
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,120
- A restaurant?
- Yes.

767
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:25,749
- We're by the beach.
- Yes.

768
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,519
They serve lobsters and shrimp.

769
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,259
- Lobsters.
- I found a seafood restaurant.

770
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:31,890
I thought we had to get some seafood
since we were by the beach.

771
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,160
You should have told me sooner.

772
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:35,860
I finished the whole pizza with Coke.

773
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:38,700
Right? Aren't you full?
That's why we should work out.

774
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,499
That way, we can enjoy the meal even more.

775
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,900
- Now?
- We can go out and exercise.

776
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,239
(It's right now.)

777
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:47,009
Kian84 likes to work out.

778
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:49,009
I wanted to exercise with him again.

779
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,009
They were gym buddies in India.

780
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,249
You punk.

781
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:54,650
(The youngest brother
wants to exercise with him...)

782
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,120
(as the oldest brother likes exercising.)

783
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,749
So I asked them to exercise with me.

784
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,719
You see how
even the kids have great bodies?

785
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:02,890
(Even the kids have amazing bodies.)

786
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,529
If we go out and exercise in the sun now,
our faces...

787
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:07,360
We'll die if we exercise now.

788
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,229
We'll totally get the sunburn.

789
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:13,299
I knew that Kian84
would never bring sunscreen.

790
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,140
- Gosh.
- I brought sunscreen.

791
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,999
- How sweet.
- Good job.

792
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:19,039
You can use it up throughout this trip.

793
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,370
The consistency isn't too hard.
It's smooth.

794
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,440
It's pretty nice.

795
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:24,309
Your face got tanned a lot.

796
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,479
Right. It did.

797
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,979
(Rubbing)

798
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,779
If you spread it out nicely...

799
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:30,019
(Thoroughly spread it out.)

800
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,850
Kian84 never misses a spot on his face.

801
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,850
(He covered his face with
the white sunscreen on the last trips.)

802
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,420
That's good now.

803
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,660
- I can just smooth it out.
- Yes.

804
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,130
It's nice because
it doesn't create any white layer.

805
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:41,289
Gosh, look at my legs. Look at my skin.

806
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,029
Right. You should have applied sunscreen.

807
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,700
Totally.
Sunscreen is the most important step.

808
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,830
(The colors are visibly different.)

809
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,999
Had I applied it sooner,
I wouldn't have gotten the tan line.

810
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
(Rubbing)

811
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,809
(He thoroughly applies it
on his legs too.)

812
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:54,539
Well, if I were to make a suggestion...

813
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,239
You recently did a full marathon.

814
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,180
- We can go for a short run by the beach.
- Okay.

815
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,110
Let's do weights next.

816
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,950
When you guys exercise,
I'll go out and swim.

817
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,549
Sure. Let's go.

818
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:07,190
(Let's go and work out.)

819
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:10,360
(They set out to exercise.)

820
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,459
Gosh.

821
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,630
It's so windy.

822
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,799
How is it? Is it hot?

823
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,100
- It's pretty hot.
- It's hot.

824
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Gosh.

825
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,840
- Go and put on your shoes.
- No.

826
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:25,940
Kian84, wear my sunglasses.

827
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,410
- It's okay.
- I don't need them. I'll swim.

828
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,840
Gosh. That's...

829
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,749
- Stop training your eyes. Hurry.
- My eyes aren't that weak.

830
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:34,249
Come on. Help me out here.

831
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:38,450
(Kian84 has a habit of doing
an exercise to strengthen his eyes.)

832
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,519
(He's training his eyes here too.)

833
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,360
Come on. Help me out here.

834
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,420
- I won't put them on.
- He won't listen.

835
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,059
- Why would you train your eyes?
- Hey.

836
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:48,090
- Hurry.
- I must train my eyes too.

837
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,600
- He's driving me crazy.
- Sunglasses are...

838
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,400
for the weak.

839
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:52,529
Come on.

840
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:54,670
Okay. I'll swim over there.

841
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,069
- Keep your sunglasses on.
- Okay.

842
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,569
(Pani Bottle gives up
and sets out to swim.)

843
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,309
Is there any equipment?

844
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:03,380
Let's do the interval training.

845
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,680
- The interval training?
- Yes.

846
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,209
You do it all the time.

847
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,049
The sand here is pretty good.

848
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:10,420
- It's good, right?
- This part is solid.

849
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,150
Right. That part is good, right?

850
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,549
I'm doing it because you're here.

851
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,120
(The oldest brother: Kian84,
The youngest brother: Dex)

852
00:34:18,459 --> 00:34:21,559
(They show the perfect teamwork.)

853
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:25,569
Dex has a great body,
but Kian84 is in a better shape now.

854
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:26,700
(The physically impressive brothers
in Madagascar)

855
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,700
Wait. Look at the tree.

856
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:30,799
Can we lift weights with that?

857
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,940
I see. That?

858
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,170
I tried that a few times by the beach.

859
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,140
Kian84,
I saw you lift the log at the beach.

860
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:39,749
When you start doing that,
you sort of become narcissistic.

861
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,950
I noticed that it was trending.
Was it called beach training?

862
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:46,650
The culture of working out at the beach
started to spring up in Korea too.

863
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,789
Technically speaking,
I'm a trend leader too.

864
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,289
So we worked out at the beach.

865
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,289
Gosh, check this out.

866
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:57,959
- The gym from nature.
- This one.

867
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,630
- Gosh.
- Goodness. It must weigh over 20kg.

868
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,569
- It must be about 40kg.
- Gosh.

869
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,999
It's like a wooden stick.

870
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,610
- They don't hesitate.
- Gosh.

871
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,410
(He takes off his shirt right away
after spotting a nice target.)

872
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,910
Your blood would boil
when you work out in nature.

873
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,009
He's got a great body.

874
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:15,219
- Let's do squats.
- Squats.

875
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:16,549
Go for 40kg.

876
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:18,719
- Let's go.
- That's how athletes train.

877
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,790
All right.

878
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,189
(He puts the log on his shoulders.)

879
00:35:21,189 --> 00:35:22,620
- I bet it's really heavy.
- There.

880
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:24,919
All right. Let's do ten.

881
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:26,689
(Flying away)

882
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:28,290
Wait.

883
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,359
- Let's do this.
- Wait.

884
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,930
(Shaking)

885
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,230
(Putting it down)

886
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,299
It was heavy.

887
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:40,439
- They must be curious. "What's this?"
- The guys...

888
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,879
"Why are they doing that?
Even we don't even do that."

889
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,379
You're weak.

890
00:35:45,149 --> 00:35:47,149
- Gosh.
- Let's go.

891
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,649
- Come on.
- If I do this,

892
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:50,879
will I have good luck next year?

893
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,989
Of course.

894
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,250
(I'll have good luck next year?)

895
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,620
Show us!

896
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,529
- Gosh.
- Nice.

897
00:35:58,629 --> 00:35:59,859
Let's do ten.

898
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:02,200
Let's go. Work out your lower body.

899
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
One.

900
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,500
Two.

901
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:07,000
- This is easy.
- Three.

902
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,569
- This is easy.
- Nice.

903
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,370
- Four, five...
- He's a strong man.

904
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:15,839
- Eight. You're almost there. Ten.
- Goodness.

905
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:18,580
- What do you think compared to India?
- It's nice.

906
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,810
- You look much better.
- Yes. You look sexy.

907
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,180
- How come you're not saying anything?
- What?

908
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
What do you think?

909
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,290
Wouldn't it be a bit off
if I say you look amazing?

910
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,450
I love it, my dear Dex.

911
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,259
"I love it, my dear Dex."

912
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:32,060
- I see. This is how it feels.
- That made me cringe.

913
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,290
(The shy lady compliments him.)

914
00:36:34,189 --> 00:36:36,359
(Our dear Dex is full of energy.)

915
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:37,960
All right. Don't rest.

916
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,370
All right, Dex.

917
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:42,239
Start running.
Touch the boat and come back.

918
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,100
- Run as fast as you can.
- Go and touch it.

919
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:46,040
He suddenly turned into a drill sergeant.

920
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,410
Run as fast as you can!

921
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:48,910
Touch it and come back!

922
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:53,480
All right. Do 20 push-ups.

923
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,879
Do 20 push-ups.

924
00:36:55,149 --> 00:36:57,020
(Screaming)

925
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,089
(Laughing)

926
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:00,620
They must have thought we were crazy.

927
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,819
Gosh. I'm glad I didn't join them.

928
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
(Falling)

929
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,890
I'm sorry.

930
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,330
- Gosh.
- Okay.

931
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,100
You're too slow! Faster!

932
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,270
All right, Dex. Your arms.

933
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,200
Your arms. Come on, you'll lose muscles.
Hurry up.

934
00:37:15,669 --> 00:37:16,939
Do 20. Go.

935
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:19,009
(The merciless drill sergeant
doesn't give him a break.)

936
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:20,810
Do you know what crossed my mind
when I was doing that?

937
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,109
- "You just wait."
- Six.

938
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,480
- Six. Seven.
- Seven.

939
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,850
Faster.

940
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,680
(The drill sergeant enjoys Dex's pain.)

941
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,350
(He works out his biceps with the log.)

942
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:37,189
(It's the drill sergeant's turn now.)

943
00:37:37,189 --> 00:37:38,520
You're dead now.

944
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,060
This is my revenge.

945
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,089
Ten!

946
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,700
Squat down more!

947
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,629
- He didn't go down all the way.
- Squat down more!

948
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:48,169
- You must squat down more.
- It was very heavy.

949
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:50,439
- You must squat down a lot more.
- You're not doing it properly.

950
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:52,640
- Five more!
- You're too slow! Faster!

951
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,969
- Dex is known as the evil drill sergeant.
- Three.

952
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:56,939
Run!

953
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:58,750
(If you're done, run!)

954
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,779
(The original evil drill sergeant)

955
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:02,919
Push-ups.

956
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:05,390
One, two.

957
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,250
You must go down more.
Touch my hand with your chin.

958
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,350
- Right here.
- He's not doing it properly.

959
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,520
- Touch my fist.
- Come on.

960
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,989
- Come on. You barely went down.
- Gosh.

961
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:14,189
(Fascinated)

962
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:16,460
All right. Come up. Work out your biceps.

963
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,600
(Working out his biceps right away)

964
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
(Closing his eyes)

965
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,770
You definitely need someone
barking at you.

966
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:24,399
(Feeling proud)

967
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,140
Okay.

968
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,509
(Staggering)

969
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,379
- Good. Good job.
- Gosh.

970
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,109
- Good?
- Good.

971
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:34,879
Okay.

972
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:35,879
(The evil drill sergeant
is satisfied too.)

973
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:39,719
(But his enthusiasm to exercise
hasn't subsided yet.)

974
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,419
- He's barely going down.
- Wait. What's he doing?

975
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:46,290
- What is that?
- That's...

976
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,290
Is that right?

977
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,430
It looks like a turtle at a beach
during the spawning season.

978
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:50,799
A turtle?

979
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:52,129
I saw turtles lay eggs...

980
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,730
- in the spawning season like that.
- Yes.

981
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:56,069
I saw it on National Geographic.

982
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:57,870
(Working hard)

983
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,910
They go to the land...

984
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,339
- in the spawning season...
- Oh, my. My belly hurts.

985
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,739
to lay eggs like that.

986
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,410
Everyone has a great imagination.

987
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,980
- Laying eggs.
- My belly hurts.

988
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,109
He finished laying eggs.

989
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:10,149
Why did you become Baron Ashura?

990
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,149
You look like Baron Ashura.

991
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:14,589
What is it?

992
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:17,890
He put natural sunscreen on.

993
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,430
(Sand pack on the half of his face)

994
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,629
Shall we work out our abs?

995
00:39:20,629 --> 00:39:21,930
- Abs?
- You know...

996
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:23,060
- Is it not over?
- Go.

997
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,129
Lie down.

998
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:25,830
No way.

999
00:39:26,629 --> 00:39:27,700
(Groaning)

1000
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:29,239
(Tapping)

1001
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,200
It's not sharp.

1002
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,370
(Peekaboo)

1003
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:35,910
He's using that?

1004
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:37,779
(Hitting)

1005
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:40,379
(This is how an ab workout goes normally.)

1006
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,120
There's a workout like this.

1007
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,180
One, two.

1008
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,189
(He's touched by the appearance
of wild equipment.)

1009
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:49,319
Here.

1010
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:50,390
(Bright)

1011
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
There you go.

1012
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,960
You're doing well.

1013
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,660
Here it is.

1014
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,129
(Through the special wild training,)

1015
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:58,770
(his abs are getting stronger.)

1016
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,270
(My brother)

1017
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,330
Take this.

1018
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:05,410
Come here.

1019
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:07,669
(Oh, no)

1020
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,279
Do you know how scary this is?

1021
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,250
- Go easy on me.
- Do you know how scary this is?

1022
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,810
(The evil drill sergeant is back.)

1023
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:14,810
Hold on.

1024
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,779
- What are they doing?
- What's wrong with both of them?

1025
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:18,989
- Hold on.
- Let go of me.

1026
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:23,160
No. Don't hold it diagonally.
Make this side touch this side.

1027
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,259
(Laughing)

1028
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:26,189
You have a lot of requests.

1029
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:27,589
Make it so that these sides
are touching each other.

1030
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:28,589
(Wait for it.)

1031
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,700
(Teasing him)

1032
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,270
(He's shouting like crazy.)

1033
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,370
Five.

1034
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:35,569
More.

1035
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:36,839
More.

1036
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,200
Harder.

1037
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,609
- Harder.
- "Harder."

1038
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:42,009
(Harder!)

1039
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:44,140
- Five.
- "Harder."

1040
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,710
- It looks weird.
- "Harder."

1041
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,009
That's cute.

1042
00:40:50,419 --> 00:40:52,719
(They're done with their weird workout.)

1043
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:54,950
Kian84, look at this.

1044
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:56,560
I look like I received cupping therapy.

1045
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,689
You look cool. It makes you look stronger.

1046
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,799
(Satisfied)

1047
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:03,960
It was very nice...

1048
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:05,830
to suffer together.

1049
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:09,040
It was very fun.

1050
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,239
I enjoyed it a lot.

1051
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,169
(Pani Bottle went to enjoy swimming
by himself.)

1052
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:14,910
What was he doing?

1053
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,410
Barnacles.

1054
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,080
(It's filled with something.)

1055
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,450
(His swimming cap is quite different.)

1056
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,480
Are you going to fish?

1057
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,719
This one is comfortable
when you plan to swim.

1058
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,020
(It's comfortable to wear a swimming cap.)

1059
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,719
(He opens another equipment
without hesitation.)

1060
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:31,919
(Goggles)

1061
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:35,529
(He picks it up naturally.)

1062
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:37,259
- Oh, my.
- It looks like I love equipment.

1063
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:39,469
(Meanwhile, he even checks the sea,
which is perfect.)

1064
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:41,129
(Glaring)

1065
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:44,439
(Water Bottle's house is under the sea.)

1066
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:46,069
He does it often.

1067
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:51,009
(Relaxed)

1068
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,950
You have a lot of good gear.

1069
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,049
You look like a professional.

1070
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
(Flippers complete the gear.)

1071
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,089
(He's striding toward the wide sea.)

1072
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,819
(With a full set of gear,)

1073
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:02,859
What's that?

1074
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,890
(it's time to jump into the sea!)

1075
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,700
(It's his first diving in Madagascar.)

1076
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:12,870
I'm wearing what female divers
on Jeju Island wear.

1077
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:14,669
The water is like the Yellow Sea.

1078
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,270
You didn't need gear.

1079
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:18,870
That's a half bath.

1080
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,879
(The sea is quite shallow
for Water Bottle.)

1081
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,910
(But he's swimming with gear
without giving up.)

1082
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,279
He's proud of his gear. That's cool.

1083
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,649
(Floating in the middle of the sea)

1084
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:36,020
(Floundering)

1085
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:37,960
I was sitting down.

1086
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,330
(In a daze)

1087
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,759
It's warm.

1088
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,969
The water was so shallow. I couldn't swim.

1089
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:48,069
(Trees are peeking.)

1090
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,600
He showed his buttocks many times.

1091
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,669
(He's looking under the sea
while floating.)

1092
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,509
I came out with the gear,

1093
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,480
but the water only got to my ankle.

1094
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,850
So I couldn't swim.

1095
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
(Disappointed)

1096
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,219
He's making a sand castle.

1097
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,989
This is a workout.

1098
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:07,049
- I'm sweating.
- Right.

1099
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:09,390
He's running again.

1100
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,390
- He's running again.
- Kian84 is a runner.

1101
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,759
- He should go swimming.
- He's going into the water.

1102
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,230
(He's going into the water
without hesitation.)

1103
00:43:16,129 --> 00:43:17,899
(Hopping)

1104
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:20,930
(He ran in the same posture
in India as well.)

1105
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:21,969
That's a frilled lizard.

1106
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:24,200
(A frilled lizard)

1107
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,669
- Come on in.
- You should follow him.

1108
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,310
(Pani Bottle joins as well.)

1109
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,580
(The Beach Brothers in Morondava)

1110
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,180
You look like a jellyfish.

1111
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,819
(Jellyfish84 who is free)

1112
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:40,450
- I guess he can float well.
- He can swim very well.

1113
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:43,390
- That's nice.
- I'm glad because they look so free.

1114
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,930
(Take this.)

1115
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:49,960
(They're floating
while swimming on their back.)

1116
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,799
Wait. Let's make a bet with this.

1117
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,270
- A bet?
- A bet for dinner.

1118
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,540
- Right. They will go and have lobsters.
- A bet for dinner.

1119
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,469
We'll be having a swimming match.

1120
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,540
- Should we put up a sign?
- What?

1121
00:44:01,669 --> 00:44:02,879
Come here.

1122
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,480
- Come here.
- Yes.

1123
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:07,779
Would you like to become the referee?

1124
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:10,450
- Are you the referee?
- "Are you the referee?"

1125
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,149
(A little guy in the neighborhood
was cast.)

1126
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,149
Come here.

1127
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,890
You stay. When the three of us come,
you become the referee.

1128
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,290
You're the referee.

1129
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,600
(Finishing line)

1130
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:24,600
- What are we going to do? Running?
- No. You do this.

1131
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,069
That's cute.

1132
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:28,100
You can swim well.

1133
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:29,839
You need an "etiquette."

1134
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:31,839
- "Etiquette?"
- "Etiquette?"

1135
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,310
It has three syllables too.

1136
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,640
- Etiquette?"
- Don't use one arm.

1137
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,210
"Etiquette" is not wrong either.

1138
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:39,950
Actually, when I play a game
to decide who the winner is,

1139
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:42,180
I don't go easy on others
or give myself a handicap.

1140
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,649
I just think I should work hard
no matter what.

1141
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,850
He told me to play without an arm,

1142
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:46,890
so I said, "Okay."

1143
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,989
"But I will do that to win."

1144
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,960
"If I still win,
I'll become the true winner."

1145
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,060
That's what I thought
when I accepted the request.

1146
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,259
(The youngest one is competitive.)

1147
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,129
(While they're talking about etiquette
passionately,)

1148
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,730
(Pani Bottle is puzzled.)

1149
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:03,040
Those who are crazy about exercise...

1150
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,969
wanted to bet on dinner.

1151
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,569
It was obvious that I would lose.

1152
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:10,180
It was a game for the two.

1153
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,980
It was like they were telling me
to pay for the dinner today.

1154
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:15,509
No, it wasn't something like that.

1155
00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:17,080
- Here we go.
- Okay.

1156
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,989
- Number one.
- Listen to music.

1157
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,020
Yes.

1158
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,660
He's from Incheon.

1159
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,060
He does all the things others do.

1160
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,930
- Kim Jin Young.
- Kim Jin Young.

1161
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:31,600
Kim Jin Young.

1162
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:34,930
He knows the etiquette.

1163
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,040
Lane 2. Born in 1984.

1164
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,710
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

1165
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,339
(I can't hear it.)

1166
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,480
That's how Kian84 does push-ups.

1167
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,950
(Pumping with passion)

1168
00:45:50,149 --> 00:45:51,219
Lane three.

1169
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:54,520
Park Jae Han from Yaksa-dong.

1170
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,160
(As they're at the beach,
they will have a swimming race.)

1171
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,330
- It looks...
- He's nervous.

1172
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,859
They're doing it seriously
without a smile.

1173
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,700
- We were serious.
- We're serious about a game.

1174
00:46:08,129 --> 00:46:09,700
(Who will win?)

1175
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:11,069
(A battle for dinner)

1176
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:12,739
Everyone, get ready.

1177
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:14,310
On the count of three. No.

1178
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:16,540
Hey. What's this?

1179
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,040
(They just lie down immediately.)

1180
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:21,450
- Hey.
- No.

1181
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,250
- Mister.
- Hey.

1182
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:24,980
He's going.

1183
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,049
He can't hear it.

1184
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,620
He's awful.

1185
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,359
- Didn't we start?
- Why would you go already?

1186
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,330
I thought I had moved a lot.
Is this how much I traveled?

1187
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:34,859
No. He doesn't follow the etiquette.

1188
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,330
Get ready.

1189
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,299
Set, go.

1190
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:41,069
Set, go.

1191
00:46:41,069 --> 00:46:42,430
(3: Pani Bottle, 2: Kian 84, 1: Dex)

1192
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,569
It looks like the Olympics.

1193
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:47,540
My pants are going down.

1194
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,980
(Paddling powerfully)

1195
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,939
(I don't care who wins.)

1196
00:46:53,649 --> 00:46:55,310
Dex is following the etiquette, though.

1197
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,719
(Wait for me.)

1198
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:00,149
- Now...
- Oh, my.

1199
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,120
(The distance is quite big now.)

1200
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,359
(He'll finish last.)

1201
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:07,730
(Currently taking the lead)

1202
00:47:08,989 --> 00:47:10,660
(Glancing)

1203
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:12,029
(His one-arm booster is on.)

1204
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:13,330
Dex is moving like that with one arm.

1205
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,870
I know. That's incredible.

1206
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:20,669
(Who will win the swimming competition?)

1207
00:47:23,609 --> 00:47:25,540
- Dex finished in first place.
- It was close.

1208
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,609
(You won. Congratulations.)

1209
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:29,279
- The children are good referees.
- Yes.

1210
00:47:30,419 --> 00:47:31,750
(The adventurer is shouting.)

1211
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:32,919
You become the champion.

1212
00:47:32,919 --> 00:47:34,250
(I'll just let you become the champion.)

1213
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,790
(Exhausted)

1214
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:38,859
I'm tired.

1215
00:47:40,259 --> 00:47:41,589
I used one arm.

1216
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,129
It was cool.

1217
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,160
It was a good game.

1218
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,629
(The dinner is on me.)

1219
00:47:47,629 --> 00:47:49,669
(It's not a big deal.)

1220
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:51,839
We can go and eat something delicious now.

1221
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,210
Yes. Let's go.

1222
00:47:53,509 --> 00:47:55,069
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1223
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:56,140
(After exercising and having fun,
they're going to fill their stomachs.)

1224
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,310
We should run to wrap it up.

1225
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,279
- What?
- Are they running again?

1226
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,980
- It's cool.
- You'll remember it later.

1227
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,620
These sports addicts are driving me crazy.

1228
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,319
We swam instead of running earlier.

1229
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,719
- The sun was setting as well.
- Yes.

1230
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,629
We're burning calories.

1231
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,560
Yes. We're burning the least amount
of calories before eating.

1232
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:16,100
We should make ourselves hungrier...

1233
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,359
- before eating something delicious.
- Right.

1234
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,100
(Cheering)

1235
00:48:20,169 --> 00:48:21,169
It's the sea.

1236
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,799
(Singing)

1237
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:26,140
Is there a cane? I have bad knees.

1238
00:48:27,009 --> 00:48:28,739
- Pani Bottle, run slowly.
- Yes.

1239
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,779
They didn't run as hard as I had thought.

1240
00:48:31,879 --> 00:48:33,109
Slow.

1241
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,779
(Cha cha cha!)

1242
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:37,020
One, two, three, four,

1243
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,919
- five, six, seven, eight.
- We felt good before having dinner.

1244
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,549
Two. I feel good.

1245
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,689
When the three of us were running,
I thought about that.

1246
00:48:43,689 --> 00:48:46,359
In Varanasi, Kian84 and I...

1247
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:49,299
ran along the Ganges.

1248
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,899
Being reminded of that moment
was really nice.

1249
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,370
Back in India, Pani Bottle wasn't there.

1250
00:48:55,569 --> 00:48:56,600
- But now, we have Pani Bottle with us.
- Right.

1251
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,870
The three of you are running together.

1252
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:01,339
I could tell Pani Bottle
was trying to keep up.

1253
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,839
And if someone's running too fast,
he would always slow down for the others.

1254
00:49:04,939 --> 00:49:06,649
They matched my pace for me.

1255
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,779
What was important was that
we reached our target point together.

1256
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,790
I think it was meaningful that
the three of us started together.

1257
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,189
It looks like a scene from a youth drama.

1258
00:49:15,189 --> 00:49:16,560
(“If you want to go fast, go alone.
If you want to go far, go together.”)

1259
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,759
He kept saying he couldn't run
and that he'll just walk.

1260
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:22,230
But he kept running until the end,
and I appreciated him for that.

1261
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,230
But where is everyone?

1262
00:49:32,939 --> 00:49:36,279
(When they were working out,)

1263
00:49:36,279 --> 00:49:39,450
(there were so many locals.
Where did they all go?)

1264
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,450
Right. This is...

1265
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:43,549
It's so quiet here.

1266
00:49:43,649 --> 00:49:44,649
There's no one there.

1267
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:47,020
It was particularly quiet that day.

1268
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,020
The place is empty.

1269
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,620
(The beach is empty as if the three
rented the whole thing.)

1270
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:54,730
What's that?

1271
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,430
- Gosh, there are so many people.
- Look at all the people.

1272
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,270
- What is that?
- There must be something going on.

1273
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,330
(They spotted the locals
who had been hiding.)

1274
00:50:01,629 --> 00:50:03,640
It's another party.

1275
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,399
- A party?
- Another party.

1276
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,370
- Another launching party.
- Another launching party?

1277
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:09,710
Let's help them out.

1278
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:10,739
(He's a professional helper.)

1279
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:13,009
There are so many people.

1280
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:15,750
I had wondered where all the people were,
but they were all here.

1281
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,020
(He got off the course
as if he was bewitched.)

1282
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,850
(He approaches to see what's going on.)

1283
00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:22,649
- Futsal?
- Oh, it's futsal?

1284
00:50:22,649 --> 00:50:23,790
All of these people came to watch futsal?

1285
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:24,989
Or not.

1286
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:26,560
(It's crowded.)

1287
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,689
It looked like something was going on.

1288
00:50:27,689 --> 00:50:29,460
- It's like a full-blown...
- I thought it was a ritual.

1289
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,730
It looks like a full-blown event.

1290
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,370
(People are gathered
as if something has happened.)

1291
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,540
There's a speaker too.

1292
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,739
(He approaches it cautiously.)

1293
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,879
- Hey, join us.
- Okay.

1294
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:51,980
"Join us?"

1295
00:50:52,419 --> 00:50:54,250
They're boxing.

1296
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,950
(They're boxing.)

1297
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:57,060
Boxing?

1298
00:50:58,089 --> 00:50:59,259
He said they're boxing.

1299
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:01,189
(They're boxing on the beach?)

1300
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:06,899
(There's a boxing ring on the sand.)

1301
00:51:06,899 --> 00:51:08,629
They're boxing on the sand.

1302
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,799
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1303
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:14,469
I thought it was a village festival,

1304
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:16,339
but they were boxing.

1305
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:19,339
I was curious about what they were doing.

1306
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:22,580
As it was
with the ship launching ceremony...

1307
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,379
If the locals were gathered together,

1308
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,589
we knew to expect it to be something fun.

1309
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:29,819
What is this?

1310
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,859
- What?
- It's traditional martial arts.

1311
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:33,660
- Fighting?
- Yes.

1312
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,390
Do you want to join? Come on.

1313
00:51:35,489 --> 00:51:36,759
- Come on?
- Come on.

1314
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:39,160
She wants us to follow her.

1315
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,730
(They're all excited to watch
something fun, so they follow her.)

1316
00:51:46,569 --> 00:51:48,310
(The local broadcasting camera
and commentators are here too)

1317
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:49,939
- There's a camera.
- If this is televised, it must be...

1318
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:54,779
(It seems to be
quite a large-scale event.)

1319
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:58,919
What? Gosh.

1320
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:02,189
(They unexpectedly got front-row seats.)

1321
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,919
(They were in the middle of their run...)

1322
00:52:04,919 --> 00:52:06,960
(when they were dropped
right in the middle of this world.)

1323
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:09,060
(This boxing ring on the beach
is unbelievable.)

1324
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,730
The idea of a boxing ring
on the beach is so romantic.

1325
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,029
They're starting.

1326
00:52:14,169 --> 00:52:15,529
I was so excited.

1327
00:52:16,569 --> 00:52:19,000
(Right on the MC's cue,)

1328
00:52:20,069 --> 00:52:22,140
(the boxers enter the ring.)

1329
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,410
Oh, they're starting.

1330
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:26,009
(Are they really having a match here?)

1331
00:52:26,779 --> 00:52:28,750
(The match begins!)

1332
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:34,049
(An African boxing match is happening
right in front of them.)

1333
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,819
(It's intense.)

1334
00:52:39,629 --> 00:52:41,189
They're really going at each other.

1335
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,660
They're serious.

1336
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,000
(Serious punches are being thrown.)

1337
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,399
(It doesn't hurt?)

1338
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:50,169
- It doesn't hurt?
- "It doesn't hurt."

1339
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:51,569
(He keeps emphasizing
that it doesn't hurt.)

1340
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,140
(It doesn't hurt?)

1341
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,410
(The local commentary
even considers the tourists.)

1342
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:55,509
He says it doesn't hurt.

1343
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:56,509
Wait.

1344
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,239
What is he saying exactly?

1345
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,779
He's actually saying "Alefa."

1346
00:53:00,879 --> 00:53:02,649
It means, "Keep going. Go on."

1347
00:53:02,649 --> 00:53:04,319
- So he's telling them to keep fighting.
- To go on and fight.

1348
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,549
- Keep fighting.
- Fight.

1349
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:09,089
(They move on to the next game.)

1350
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:11,319
They're so fast. Gosh.

1351
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:13,930
They're good.

1352
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:17,930
He's provoking him.

1353
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,029
(You can try, but you can't catch me.)

1354
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,770
(The fighters are highly skilled
in boxing.)

1355
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,310
Look at the kids.

1356
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,480
(They're going crazy.)

1357
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,580
(The fierce game keeps going,)

1358
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,919
(and the audience is enthusiastic.)

1359
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:43,919
(The local audience
is going wild over each punch.)

1360
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,730
Gosh. The people of Madagascar...

1361
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,000
have a lot of exciting elements
in their culture.

1362
00:53:50,399 --> 00:53:51,460
From the launch ceremony...

1363
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:53,029
to the fighting,

1364
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:55,430
everything is a sport,

1365
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:57,569
and everything is exciting.

1366
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,810
(The essence of excitement in Madagascar)

1367
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:05,040
(Moraingy)

1368
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,009
(It's a local sport in which everyone,)

1369
00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:08,710
(regardless of age or gender,
take part in.)

1370
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:10,750
- Aren't they just fighting?
- Isn't it a fistfight?

1371
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:11,950
They're just...

1372
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,589
- assaulting each other.
- What's going on?

1373
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:15,390
- They're just assaulting each other.
- Right.

1374
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:16,859
(They're not assaulting each other.)

1375
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:18,819
It is a traditional martial arts
that is...

1376
00:54:18,819 --> 00:54:21,759
popular in the western coastal area
of Madagascar.

1377
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,100
While some areas allow
kicking and headbutting,

1378
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,700
in Morondava, only punching is allowed.

1379
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,299
It's one of their biggest festivals.

1380
00:54:31,299 --> 00:54:33,839
The locals love it,
regardless of age and gender.

1381
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,069
That's nice.

1382
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,080
When I saw it...

1383
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,710
It had a proper ring,

1384
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:39,879
there was a commentator,

1385
00:54:39,879 --> 00:54:43,319
and the audience watched
in an orderly fashion.

1386
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:44,950
(If someone violates the order,
they're instructed otherwise with a bat.)

1387
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:47,790
There were so many people,
so they had security standing guard.

1388
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:52,020
(They're so passionate that
they watch from special seats.)

1389
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,189
It was my first time
watching something like that,

1390
00:54:54,189 --> 00:54:55,730
so it was refreshing.

1391
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:57,899
(We love it too.)

1392
00:54:57,899 --> 00:55:01,270
The audience is so big. I don't think
all of them are local villagers.

1393
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:04,439
Whenever this festival is held,
they promote it on the radio.

1394
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,669
So everyone nearby comes together.

1395
00:55:06,669 --> 00:55:07,669
Oh, so all of the locals come too.

1396
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,839
That's why there was a camera too.

1397
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,710
The people who were
at the launching ceremony went home,

1398
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:13,009
took a nap,

1399
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:14,049
- Then they all came here.
- and then they came here.

1400
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:15,910
They came to watch Moraingy. I see.

1401
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,689
(There's a bustling crowd here
to watch Moraingy.)

1402
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,689
(Now it's a game between young fighters.)

1403
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,359
(He swung and missed.)

1404
00:55:28,029 --> 00:55:29,529
(Staggering)

1405
00:55:29,529 --> 00:55:31,330
It doesn't feel like they're trained.

1406
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,730
(They kind of look awkward...)

1407
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:38,939
(because they're participants
who are not athletes.)

1408
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:41,569
It's like an event game for the audience.

1409
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:43,180
(The audience are free to participate
in Moraingy.)

1410
00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:46,980
(We respect your courage.)

1411
00:55:48,009 --> 00:55:49,149
(Meanwhile,
people seem busy all of a sudden.)

1412
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:51,620
The crowd became disorderly
all of a sudden.

1413
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,919
(Did something happen?)

1414
00:55:55,549 --> 00:55:56,919
Hey. Let's go.

1415
00:55:56,919 --> 00:55:58,520
One of you fight.

1416
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,589
She wants us to fight.

1417
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,660
Let's go. One of you fight.

1418
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,330
- She wants us to fight.
- She wants us to fight?

1419
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:05,230
- She wants us to fight?
- Come on.

1420
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,469
- One of you three?
- You should go.

1421
00:56:07,629 --> 00:56:08,899
- Me?
- Gosh.

1422
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:10,040
- You go first.
- This is so out of the blue.

1423
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:13,069
Hold on. I'll think about it.

1424
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,870
(Give me some time to think about it.)

1425
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,580
(Actually, earlier...)

1426
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:18,910
(- Join us.
- Looking around? Okay.)

1427
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:22,009
(Join us in the game.)

1428
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,350
(He had said okay right away
to signing up as a fighter.)

1429
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:25,850
- You agreed.
- Oh, my gosh.

1430
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:27,549
Hey, you agreed.

1431
00:56:27,549 --> 00:56:28,549
I agreed...

1432
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:31,419
(Without knowing what was going on,)

1433
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,960
(he followed the woman and unexpectedly
entered the ring as a fighter.)

1434
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,560
She was a member of the event's committee.

1435
00:56:36,759 --> 00:56:38,730
We stood out because we were foreigners,

1436
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,330
so she kept asking us
to participate in the game.

1437
00:56:42,629 --> 00:56:45,500
(They were sitting in the fighters'
waiting area, not the audience.)

1438
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,739
We were in the waiting area.

1439
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:48,669
I wondered why they gave us
such good seats.

1440
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:49,939
We really didn't know.

1441
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,980
We thought they were helping us watch,
but it was the fighters' waiting area.

1442
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,250
So we were already
in the waiting area, then?

1443
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,750
Yes, that's the fighters' waiting area.

1444
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,919
(They found out too late about
the secret of their front-row seats.)

1445
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:02,750
(You told me you would participate.)

1446
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:05,160
- All of a sudden?
- I knew it.

1447
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,489
(The audience is excited
about foreign fighters competing.)

1448
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:10,000
You can tell at a glance
that we were the only foreigners there.

1449
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,600
It was only natural for us to stand out.

1450
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,270
(The eldest doesn't know what to do.)

1451
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:16,469
He's considering it.

1452
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:17,640
(The youngest is
seriously considering it.)

1453
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,700
Do you want to participate?

1454
00:57:20,109 --> 00:57:21,939
(What should we do?)

1455
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:23,109
Dex should participate.

1456
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:24,310
Okay.

1457
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,080
(He's so cool.)

1458
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,080
He said okay.

1459
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,580
- That's Dex for you.
- Gosh.

1460
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:29,710
(You're really going?)

1461
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,180
(Amazing.)

1462
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:34,850
Just like in India,

1463
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:37,790
I wanted to experience
the strong people of Madagascar.

1464
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:40,589
There are so many strong people...

1465
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:42,129
in this vast world.

1466
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,899
(He's stripping off his shirt.)

1467
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,330
Both of you?

1468
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,830
(The oldest also participates.)

1469
00:57:48,129 --> 00:57:51,469
I felt like the locals found us
fascinating because we were tourists...

1470
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:53,469
and wanted us to participate.

1471
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:57,939
If I had given up,
I would've disappointed them.

1472
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:01,279
I felt like I had to join them.

1473
00:58:01,279 --> 00:58:02,310
(The oldest wanted
to meet their expectations.)

1474
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,049
(While they're standing by
to participate,)

1475
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,219
(the beat suddenly changes.)

1476
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:10,819
What?

1477
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,290
(They cheer
with a traditional dance performance.)

1478
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:16,390
- They dance with discipline.
- That's cool.

1479
00:58:17,129 --> 00:58:18,529
(Proud)

1480
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,399
(The two are too nervous
to enjoy the performance.)

1481
00:58:21,399 --> 00:58:23,000
- We were nervous.
- It made us nervous.

1482
00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:26,810
(Cheer up.)

1483
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,810
(After the performance,)

1484
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,580
(the youngest goes first!)

1485
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,649
I'm more worried about
his opponent than him.

1486
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,250
(Raising his hand)

1487
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,589
Dex is relaxed.

1488
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:43,689
- Look at Dex.
- As if he's a local.

1489
00:58:44,359 --> 00:58:45,689
Let's go, Dex!

1490
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,859
I pretended to be calm
since it was a festival.

1491
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,259
That's good showmanship.

1492
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,060
(Is he the one to play?)

1493
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,529
(Here comes our player.)

1494
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:54,870
They accepted a participant
on the spot again?

1495
00:58:58,299 --> 00:59:01,069
He saw me and chose to fight against me.

1496
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:03,169
- Oh, dear.
- He seems extraordinary.

1497
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,210
I got in the ring and saw my opponent.

1498
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,980
From his posture, he looked like
he'd trained for a long time.

1499
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,819
It made my heart race and flutter.

1500
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:18,960
(The reason why
his heart raced and fluttered)

1501
00:59:20,029 --> 00:59:22,689
(It doesn't make my blood boil
when I see someone my level.)

1502
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:25,529
(It does
when I see someone above my level.)

1503
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,969
(Use your full power, okay?)

1504
00:59:29,129 --> 00:59:31,140
(He becomes stronger
in the presence of someone strong.)

1505
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,339
I casually spar...

1506
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:35,839
with people at the gym.

1507
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:40,580
I've never played in front of
a large crowd before in my life.

1508
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,950
I thought, "It wouldn't kill me.
Let me give it a try."

1509
00:59:44,919 --> 00:59:46,180
(Good luck to both of us.)

1510
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,189
(Tapping)

1511
00:59:48,089 --> 00:59:51,089
- Look at his face.
- His eyes looked so fierce.

1512
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,629
That was when I knew
that he wanted to knock me out.

1513
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:57,330
But I'm not an easy opponent.

1514
00:59:57,859 --> 00:59:59,460
I thought I should show him.

1515
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,200
Is he an ordinary person?

1516
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,100
- No. He's a professional.
- He is?

1517
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,069
- But we were not pros.
- Right.

1518
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,810
We put on headgear...

1519
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,109
- for safety.
- Right.

1520
01:00:10,109 --> 01:00:12,109
- Did you put on a mouthpiece?
- No, we didn't have them.

1521
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,580
I don't even wear a mouthpiece
when sparring in Korea.

1522
01:00:15,609 --> 01:00:17,850
I should always be ready to fight.

1523
01:00:18,149 --> 01:00:19,819
Why did you become a fighter?

1524
01:00:20,089 --> 01:00:22,049
You fight traveling around the world.

1525
01:00:22,049 --> 01:00:24,219
- You're like Mas Oyama.
- Mas Oyama.

1526
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:25,259
Mas Oyama.

1527
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,390
Go, Dex!

1528
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:29,890
(Thank you, Kian84.)

1529
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,500
Oh, my.

1530
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:35,430
(His opponent is also ready.)

1531
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,669
In a way, this is Dex's debut game.

1532
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,339
Dex's weight class seems higher than his.

1533
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:43,339
Their weight classes are different.

1534
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,310
(Round 1 starts.)

1535
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:49,980
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

1536
01:00:51,319 --> 01:00:52,319
(Thud)

1537
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:55,390
(He counters while keeping his gaze fixed
on the opponent.)

1538
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:57,319
There you go. Make use of your reach.

1539
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,620
That's right.

1540
01:01:00,489 --> 01:01:02,430
(His opponent is consistently aiming
for his body.)

1541
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,660
But we trained our bodies with logs.

1542
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,029
(It doesn't hurt?)

1543
01:01:07,029 --> 01:01:08,500
- "It doesn't hurt."
- "It doesn't hurt."

1544
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,299
(It seemed as if the judge was cheering
for him, saying, "It doesn't hurt?")

1545
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,069
Let's go, Dex!

1546
01:01:13,609 --> 01:01:15,739
(After feeling out his opponent,
he gets started for real.)

1547
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,580
That's right.

1548
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:21,009
- Why is he so fast?
- He's super-fast.

1549
01:01:21,009 --> 01:01:22,210
Watch your body.

1550
01:01:23,649 --> 01:01:25,080
(As he gets cornered,
he punches his opponent.)

1551
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,080
(Swaying)

1552
01:01:26,919 --> 01:01:28,450
It's good that we trained with logs.

1553
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,689
- Dex is good.
- Yes.

1554
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,660
(He's not that bad.)

1555
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,020
- The old man stood up.
- Yes.

1556
01:01:33,219 --> 01:01:34,890
(Intrigued)

1557
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:35,890
What?

1558
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:37,299
Everyone is into it now.

1559
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:40,569
(With everyone's eyes on them,)

1560
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:42,069
(the opponent throws punches
at him continuously.)

1561
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:43,700
- Goodness.
- Okay.

1562
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,439
- That was a good punch.
- That's good.

1563
01:01:46,399 --> 01:01:48,270
(Now stop.)

1564
01:01:48,969 --> 01:01:50,739
It's a close match.
Closer than we expected.

1565
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,180
The opponent may be fast,

1566
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,710
but Dex throws many effective punches.

1567
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:55,980
Do you want me to pour some water on you?

1568
01:01:57,049 --> 01:01:58,120
- Here?
- Yes.

1569
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,049
(Caring Pani)

1570
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:01,549
Are you all right?

1571
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:02,890
- How is it?
- What?

1572
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:05,120
The three of them were tourists earlier.

1573
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:06,290
How did this happen?

1574
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:08,160
- Right.
- Now Pani gives him water...

1575
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,160
and asks him if he's okay.

1576
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,629
- What's going on?
- Someone had to do that.

1577
01:02:11,629 --> 01:02:14,069
What is the story of those three
in Africa?

1578
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:16,029
If Kian84 hadn't said yes,

1579
01:02:16,029 --> 01:02:18,270
- I know.
- I wouldn't have gotten in the ring.

1580
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:19,839
- Right. Gosh.
- Goodness.

1581
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:21,810
Are you all right?

1582
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:23,210
- How is it?
- What?

1583
01:02:23,509 --> 01:02:25,339
Your opponent seems so serious about this.

1584
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,810
He doesn't want
to play this half-heartedly.

1585
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,279
- Right.
- He wants to give it his all.

1586
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,120
He kept punching your body.

1587
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:34,419
I'm taking an out-boxing approach.

1588
01:02:35,089 --> 01:02:37,319
(While the oldest is coaching him)

1589
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:38,319
His name is Dex.

1590
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,330
- Dex!
- Goodness.

1591
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:41,660
- He's a cheerleader.
- A cheerleader.

1592
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:43,700
- Dex!
- I found my job.

1593
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,129
- Dex!
- Way to go.

1594
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,969
- Dex!
- Way to go.

1595
01:02:48,169 --> 01:02:49,870
(Responding to his fans' cheer)

1596
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:52,399
Dex!

1597
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:54,910
Let's go, Dex!

1598
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,339
It must give him a lot of strength.

1599
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,810
Let's go!

1600
01:03:00,379 --> 01:03:02,210
He was like the man
who sits on the first row...

1601
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:03,680
on "National Singing Contest."

1602
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:04,980
- Right.
- The dancing man?

1603
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,549
Yes. He was like him.

1604
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:09,790
- What is that?
- Thank you, Pani.

1605
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,290
- I didn't know you did that.
- I did.

1606
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:15,189
- Dex!
- Dex!

1607
01:03:15,189 --> 01:03:16,460
My goodness.

1608
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,529
(Dex's number 1 fan
even entered the ring.)

1609
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:20,600
- Dex's number one fan.
- Dex!

1610
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,029
- This is killing me.
- Dex!

1611
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:25,040
(As his number 1 fan leaves,
the opponent comes in.)

1612
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:27,669
(He came back without his headgear.)

1613
01:03:27,669 --> 01:03:29,469
It seems like he couldn't see well.

1614
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:33,480
(I'll take it off as well.)

1615
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,580
(Smirking)

1616
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,819
Why is he taking that off? No.

1617
01:03:37,049 --> 01:03:39,049
We have to play fair on equal terms.

1618
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:40,120
Really?

1619
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,989
This is getting serious.

1620
01:03:43,189 --> 01:03:45,390
(The next player gets worried.)

1621
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,230
They're diving into Round Two
with no headgear this time.

1622
01:03:54,529 --> 01:03:56,799
(An intense feel-out process)

1623
01:03:57,839 --> 01:03:58,899
- Okay.
- Gosh.

1624
01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:01,310
Guard your side.

1625
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:04,580
- He should watch his ribs.
- He wants to punch my body and come up.

1626
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,680
There you go.

1627
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:06,980
(Thud)

1628
01:04:07,879 --> 01:04:09,009
- He nailed me there.
- Did you see it?

1629
01:04:09,009 --> 01:04:10,680
- It must hurt.
- He punched me spot on.

1630
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:14,219
"It breaks the heart
of Dex's number one fan."

1631
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:15,589
His fans are sad.

1632
01:04:16,649 --> 01:04:18,460
(Facing his opponent)

1633
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:20,989
(He succeeds in attacking quickly
and dodging.)

1634
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:22,930
- That's right.
- That's good!

1635
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:25,460
(As the opponent
tries to counterattack...)

1636
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:28,000
(He responded with a valid punch.)

1637
01:04:29,569 --> 01:04:31,069
(Then he threw a sudden hook.)

1638
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:33,839
(The opponent dodges the hook
and attacks him back.)

1639
01:04:35,009 --> 01:04:36,540
(Dex avoids it.)

1640
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,580
He's good at dodging.

1641
01:04:37,779 --> 01:04:40,080
(The opponent charges at him...)

1642
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,279
(when the game ends.)

1643
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:43,750
He took good care of it.

1644
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:44,950
(Dex's number 1 fan)

1645
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:45,950
- Dex.
- "Dex's number 1 fan."

1646
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:48,549
- Dex!
- Dex!

1647
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,919
- "He's almost like a champion."
- "A champion."

1648
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:53,290
An Asian champion from overseas.

1649
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,290
They will go crazy about him
in Madagascar as well.

1650
01:04:55,529 --> 01:04:57,359
(They greet their opponents.)

1651
01:04:57,759 --> 01:04:58,859
He's a tough guy.

1652
01:04:58,859 --> 01:05:00,830
He seems a little upset.

1653
01:05:01,399 --> 01:05:03,399
His weight class is different from Dex's.

1654
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,200
In this game,

1655
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,469
it is a big honor to defeat someone
in a higher weight class.

1656
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:10,480
That's why his blood boiled
when he saw Dex.

1657
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:13,310
- Right.
- He wanted to beat him no matter what.

1658
01:05:13,379 --> 01:05:15,779
Who's the winner, then?

1659
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:17,750
It was more like a friendly match,

1660
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:19,120
so there were no winners declared.

1661
01:05:20,919 --> 01:05:23,919
(After greeting his opponent,)

1662
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:26,589
(he turns to the crowd now.)

1663
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,290
Pani cheered for him behind the scenes.

1664
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:31,830
That was the role I had to play.

1665
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:34,730
(He gets excited
and responds to his fans.)

1666
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:38,040
- Dex!
- Dex!

1667
01:05:39,799 --> 01:05:42,210
- He's got good showmanship.
- His number one fan feels good.

1668
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:45,439
(Look at him.)

1669
01:05:45,879 --> 01:05:46,879
Did you win?

1670
01:05:46,879 --> 01:05:48,649
(Now there's his number 2 fan.)

1671
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:51,219
- Oh, dear. He's going crazy.
- His number two fan.

1672
01:05:51,219 --> 01:05:52,480
His number two fan appeared.

1673
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:55,750
(I love you, Dex.)

1674
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,020
This is crazy.

1675
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,359
(He sees his number 2 fan.)

1676
01:05:58,589 --> 01:06:00,089
He's going along.

1677
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,830
Dex.

1678
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:03,460
I wanted to respond to him.

1679
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,460
- He's a good dancer.
- He's in the zone.

1680
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,069
Look at him.

1681
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,370
Dex could work there.

1682
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:11,770
He totally blended in.

1683
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:13,540
It looks like Africa suits him better.

1684
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,609
Right.

1685
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:16,739
"This is how I enjoy sports."

1686
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,640
That's what I wanted to show.

1687
01:06:18,939 --> 01:06:20,950
I wanted to keep it
as a friendly competition...

1688
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,850
rather than bringing him down...

1689
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,980
so that everyone could feel comfortable
and enjoy it.

1690
01:06:25,279 --> 01:06:27,549
That's how I wanted to spend that time.

1691
01:06:27,549 --> 01:06:31,489
At that moment, I just wanted to enjoy it.

1692
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:33,160
The spectators became one.

1693
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,430
They were smiling and having fun.

1694
01:06:36,529 --> 01:06:38,160
I have respect for my opponent too.

1695
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:40,399
He played hard,

1696
01:06:40,469 --> 01:06:43,569
so I didn't want to disappoint the crowd
and show something.

1697
01:06:43,969 --> 01:06:46,600
I might have lost...

1698
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,210
technique-wise and strength-wise.

1699
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:51,410
But in terms of composure, I think I won.

1700
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:54,609
So I was satisfied with the game.

1701
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,719
I punched his face a lot.

1702
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,680
Now Kian84 will play.

1703
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,250
He's in trouble.

1704
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,719
- He's in trouble as the second player.
- I was so nervous.

1705
01:07:04,259 --> 01:07:05,290
This is not good.

1706
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:07,089
I was on the verge of throwing up.

1707
01:07:07,529 --> 01:07:09,129
I felt like something kept coming up.

1708
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:11,629
Their expectations must be so high
after seeing Dex.

1709
01:07:11,629 --> 01:07:14,669
- Dex made everyone so excited.
- He got them excited.

1710
01:07:14,899 --> 01:07:16,730
- I felt so much pressure.
- I can imagine.

1711
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:19,370
He was bigger than me,
so people had higher expectations.

1712
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,540
- That's true.
- Oh, dear.

1713
01:07:20,939 --> 01:07:22,009
I can't wait to see.

1714
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,140
(While feeling pressure,
he gets ready to play.)

1715
01:07:24,939 --> 01:07:26,279
He shut his mouth hard.

1716
01:07:26,439 --> 01:07:27,680
(Sticking out)

1717
01:07:29,549 --> 01:07:32,020
(The oldest enters the ring.)

1718
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:33,819
(Punching himself)

1719
01:07:33,819 --> 01:07:36,189
Kian84 is sparring every week too.

1720
01:07:36,189 --> 01:07:38,020
- Right.
- He's not a regular person.

1721
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:39,919
I'm looking forward to it.

1722
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:42,359
After I made some hits, people became...

1723
01:07:43,129 --> 01:07:44,129
What is his name?

1724
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,629
He's asking what his name is.

1725
01:07:45,629 --> 01:07:47,629
- Kian84.
- He might come to Korea.

1726
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,969
- Kian84!
- Kian84!

1727
01:07:50,969 --> 01:07:51,969
(Dex's number 1 fan)

1728
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,009
(He becomes Kian84's number 1 fan.)

1729
01:07:55,009 --> 01:07:56,370
What is this?

1730
01:07:56,469 --> 01:07:58,379
Aren't they the ones
who were dragging boats earlier?

1731
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:01,250
- I feel like I saw him then.
- Goodness.

1732
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:02,450
I'm cracking up.

1733
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:04,149
- He's so professional.
- It's so funny.

1734
01:08:04,149 --> 01:08:06,180
- This is crazy.
- It's hilarious.

1735
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:08,250
What is his name?

1736
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:10,660
- Kian84.
- Kian84?

1737
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:12,790
(They're addicted to cheering.)

1738
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:14,960
- They're addicted to cheering.
- Kian84!

1739
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:16,430
- Kian84.
- He's staying calm.

1740
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:17,730
- He seems worried.
- He doesn't look good.

1741
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:19,000
My stomach hurts. It's so funny.

1742
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:21,629
(Let us tell you about this player.)

1743
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:25,299
(He built up his stamina
through Muay Thai.)

1744
01:08:26,339 --> 01:08:27,339
(His punches are extraordinary.)

1745
01:08:27,339 --> 01:08:28,739
- He's good.
- His punches are strong.

1746
01:08:28,739 --> 01:08:30,210
He works out a lot.

1747
01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:31,779
(You don't punch with your hands.)

1748
01:08:32,379 --> 01:08:33,850
I talked nonsense again.

1749
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:35,609
"You should throw a punch
using your body."

1750
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,620
(When I have to fight,
I punch with my body.)

1751
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,219
Punch with your body, not with your hands.

1752
01:08:39,219 --> 01:08:41,049
(Finally, the time to fight has come.)

1753
01:08:41,049 --> 01:08:43,189
He'll finally show what he's got.

1754
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:44,520
(It's a good opportunity
to show off his textbook punches.)

1755
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,719
He seems too big.

1756
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:47,259
Where is your opponent?

1757
01:08:47,259 --> 01:08:48,660
- What?
- Why?

1758
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:51,200
If you don't feel good about it,
just leave. Don't go out of your way.

1759
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,560
Who is he fighting against?

1760
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,200
Oh, dear. Hold on.

1761
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,899
- It's him?
- Isn't he a heavyweight player?

1762
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:58,370
Those with hidden muscles are
really intimidating.

1763
01:08:58,739 --> 01:08:59,739
They're so strong.

1764
01:08:59,739 --> 01:09:01,939
His arms are as thick as a leg.

1765
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:05,640
- Kian84.
- I...

1766
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,910
I have that look for a reason.

1767
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:09,980
I was very anxious.

1768
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,049
Honestly, I was a little scared...

1769
01:09:12,049 --> 01:09:13,580
because he was big.

1770
01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:15,819
Still, I tried to control my mind.

1771
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:17,960
I wanted to look cool.

1772
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:19,919
(Determined)

1773
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,230
- He chose Kian84 as well.
- Right.

1774
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,600
Right. This is the main event.

1775
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,529
(The crowd...)

1776
01:09:29,429 --> 01:09:32,099
(and the members are also focused,
holding their breaths.)

1777
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,300
(Round 1)

1778
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:36,569
Kian84!

1779
01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:38,679
- Kian84!
- Kian84!

1780
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:39,679
(Thud)

1781
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,349
(The opponent punched first.)

1782
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,979
(The oldest also looks
for the right time to attack.)

1783
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:48,590
- Oh, dear.
- Gosh.

1784
01:09:49,149 --> 01:09:50,689
- No!
- No!

1785
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:52,760
- Kian84, run!
- No, Hee Min!

1786
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,460
- Run away.
- No.

1787
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,330
- It's so fast.
- No.

1788
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:57,559
His punches were like...

1789
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,899
How do I put this?

1790
01:09:58,899 --> 01:10:00,160
- That was funny.
- It felt like he was punching...

1791
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,069
with a utility pole. Seriously.

1792
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:05,300
You trained your abdominal muscles,
and he hit you in the head.

1793
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:06,739
I'm tearing up.

1794
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,470
Kian84!

1795
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:13,210
(The oldest suddenly takes off
his headgear.)

1796
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,109
Why did you take it off?

1797
01:10:15,109 --> 01:10:16,309
I couldn't see well.

1798
01:10:16,609 --> 01:10:17,620
He'll play without it?

1799
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,450
(He secures clear vision
and comes back to the game.)

1800
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:23,590
- He got better.
- That's good.

1801
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:27,189
(The youngest takes the lead in cheering.)

1802
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,830
- Kian84!
- Kian84!

1803
01:10:30,929 --> 01:10:32,229
(The opponent charges at the oldest.)

1804
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:33,660
- Avoid.
- Dodge.

1805
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,330
(Turning his head)

1806
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,130
He dodged that well.

1807
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,370
(Throwing a punch)

1808
01:10:38,939 --> 01:10:40,500
(The spectators are into it.)

1809
01:10:41,309 --> 01:10:42,870
(Stop.)

1810
01:10:43,069 --> 01:10:45,809
- He's too strong, though.
- It makes me nervous.

1811
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:47,250
Round One didn't go well.

1812
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,109
Water.

1813
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,580
It looks so different from the preview.
You looked so confident in the preview.

1814
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,819
Hey, you have to be there.
You can't do anything.

1815
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,160
- You were so confident in the preview.
- It breaks my heart.

1816
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,689
That's why you should watch
the entire show when it airs.

1817
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:01,960
You could throw jabs to feel him out.

1818
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,689
You only threw big punches.

1819
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:06,800
He seems a little scared too.

1820
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,029
(Him too?)

1821
01:11:08,029 --> 01:11:09,300
Go, Kian84!

1822
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,500
(Calm)

1823
01:11:11,599 --> 01:11:13,040
Dex lied.

1824
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,870
(He puts on headgear again.)

1825
01:11:16,769 --> 01:11:19,410
(The oldest goes for Round 2.)

1826
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,450
(With the crowd rooting for Kian84,)

1827
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,179
(Round 2 starts.)

1828
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:26,220
Kian84!

1829
01:11:29,389 --> 01:11:30,590
(Hopping)

1830
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:32,090
(He suddenly charges at Kian84.)

1831
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:34,489
(The oldest looks for good timing.)

1832
01:11:34,489 --> 01:11:36,689
- Dodge well.
- Be careful.

1833
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:38,300
(But his opponent keeps cornering him.)

1834
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,670
(He can't attack in this situation.)

1835
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:43,500
- That's good.
- Use a strategy.

1836
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:46,899
When I train at the gym, I can feel it.

1837
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:50,510
I know when I can handle my opponent...

1838
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:53,540
and when I might get knocked out if I try.

1839
01:11:55,109 --> 01:11:56,880
I felt the latter
when playing against him.

1840
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,720
He never let his guard down,

1841
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,519
and his punches were strong.

1842
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,489
Besides, he was super calm.

1843
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:04,989
They told me later...

1844
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,819
that he was the champion in the area.

1845
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:09,029
- Really?
- For real?

1846
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:10,800
I was helpless.

1847
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,300
That's why his opponent seemed relaxed.

1848
01:12:14,569 --> 01:12:16,500
That's when I came up with a strategy.

1849
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,500
- What strategy?
- What is it?

1850
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:18,670
Just watch.

1851
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,210
(The eldest's improvised strategy)

1852
01:12:22,769 --> 01:12:24,739
(Stepping back)

1853
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,279
What's with the song?
The lyrics go, "Let's run away."

1854
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,580
- It's the saddest way I've ever heard.
- It's the saddest.

1855
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,019
(As the oldest keeps stepping back,
his opponent is only moving forward.)

1856
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:34,920
- Do you see my strategy?
- Just stepping backward?

1857
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:38,160
I was going to go to the lodging
by stepping back.

1858
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:41,889
Didn't you think of coming back to Korea
by doing that?

1859
01:12:42,529 --> 01:12:44,929
(Adventure by Stepping Backward)

1860
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:47,970
(The oldest keeps going backward.)

1861
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,269
(The youngest has been watching this.)

1862
01:12:50,269 --> 01:12:51,599
Kian84, jab!

1863
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:55,069
(The crowd seems desperate as well.)

1864
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:57,910
If I gave up here, I'd disappoint them.

1865
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,809
(His opponent attacks him nonstop.)

1866
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:03,550
Dodge well.

1867
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:05,649
(He still tries throwing punches.)

1868
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:09,250
He can hold out that much
because he works out.

1869
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,720
(With the crowd cheering for him...)

1870
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:15,729
He doesn't give up.

1871
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:17,599
(The oldest does his best
without giving up.)

1872
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,200
(After holding out tenaciously)

1873
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:23,269
(The match ends.)

1874
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:26,269
- He did well.
- He didn't get injured.

1875
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:27,470
- That's good.
- Right.

1876
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:29,309
Even though you fought
against the champion.

1877
01:13:29,309 --> 01:13:30,910
- That's impressive.
- It's amazing.

1878
01:13:31,479 --> 01:13:34,510
- Kian84!
- Kian84!

1879
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,420
(The cheering squad welcomes the oldest.)

1880
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:41,349
He's too big.

1881
01:13:41,889 --> 01:13:44,460
I had to leave without doing anything.

1882
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:45,960
I knew I was going to lose,

1883
01:13:46,859 --> 01:13:47,889
and I did.

1884
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,760
I didn't even know who he was.

1885
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,559
He was just a big guy
with a big belly to me.

1886
01:13:52,559 --> 01:13:53,559
(I don't know him either.)

1887
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,069
I just played on the spot,
but I felt resentful.

1888
01:13:57,569 --> 01:13:58,800
It made me furious.

1889
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,870
I should've punched him at least once.

1890
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,639
But in a way, it was an honor.

1891
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:08,380
At least, I got to fight against
the number-one fighter in Morondava.

1892
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,609
I think he went easy on me, though.

1893
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:12,420
(Thank you.)

1894
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,519
- It's an honor.
- Right. He's a champion.

1895
01:14:14,519 --> 01:14:15,550
Although I was only beaten up.

1896
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:16,620
It's a good experience.

1897
01:14:17,149 --> 01:14:18,260
(Sad)

1898
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,529
(The three brothers leave the arena.)

1899
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:23,689
Look at the sunset.

1900
01:14:23,989 --> 01:14:25,300
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1901
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,099
It's so beautiful.

1902
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,569
- It's stunning.
- It's beautiful.

1903
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,899
You looked cool throwing jabs
with a step back.

1904
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,609
You looked cool too.

1905
01:14:34,609 --> 01:14:35,670
- Me?
- For real.

1906
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:37,510
- At least,
- Your dodging was so good.

1907
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:39,210
- we got to exercise.
- I dodged well?

1908
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:41,309
Why do I feel so resentful?

1909
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,279
Kian84, well done. It was awesome.

1910
01:14:44,519 --> 01:14:46,720
No. I couldn't do anything.

1911
01:14:48,519 --> 01:14:51,519
Anyway, we had our exercise today.

1912
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,819
Let's go to the restaurant I found.

1913
01:14:53,819 --> 01:14:55,660
- It must be good.
- Even I feel hungry.

1914
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,059
Whatever they eat, they'll enjoy it.

1915
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,599
- What do we do tomorrow, by the way?
- Tomorrow...

1916
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,800
- we'll see baobab trees.
- Baobab trees?

1917
01:15:05,099 --> 01:15:06,739
How tall are baobab trees?

1918
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,109
- They're huge.
- They're really tall.

1919
01:15:08,269 --> 01:15:09,609
Would they be around 50m?

1920
01:15:09,609 --> 01:15:10,840
- Are they that tall?
- Fifty meters?

1921
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,609
Then are baobab trees the largest trees
in the world?

1922
01:15:13,779 --> 01:15:17,380
I'm not sure about that,
but they must be the oldest.

1923
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:18,950
- Right?
- They're thousands of years old.

1924
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:20,620
- Thousands of years old?
- Yes.

1925
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,250
They live for thousands of years, then?

1926
01:15:22,519 --> 01:15:23,550
- Right.
- Yes.

1927
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:24,889
Don't they get sick of living?

1928
01:15:26,389 --> 01:15:28,130
Hey, the sun is setting.

1929
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:30,590
Let's see the sunset before we leave.

1930
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,529
The clouds look like those from anime.

1931
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,000
- They look cool.
- Yes.

1932
01:15:35,529 --> 01:15:37,639
- We should make a wish.
- A wish?

1933
01:15:37,899 --> 01:15:41,210
The sunset on the horizon
is really beautiful.

1934
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:43,370
- The sun disappears at the end.
- Right.

1935
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:48,349
(They watch the sunset in Morondava
side by side.)

1936
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:49,380
It's cool.

1937
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,279
Please make Kian84 wear sunglasses.

1938
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,319
I'm paying more attention
to my eye health, thanks to Pani.

1939
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:57,720
- Is that so?
- It went down.

1940
01:15:58,420 --> 01:15:59,960
(The sun sets over the ocean,
carrying Pani's wish.)

1941
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,889
(Disappearing)

1942
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,859
It disappeared.

1943
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,000
Done.

1944
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,200
- I made a wish.
- I did too.

1945
01:16:12,099 --> 01:16:13,099
Dex, what did you wish for?

1946
01:16:13,899 --> 01:16:16,540
Me? For my family to be healthy.

1947
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:19,309
Secondly, for me to earn a lot of money.

1948
01:16:20,739 --> 01:16:23,880
I wished
that we could go back home safely.

1949
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:24,880
In one piece?

1950
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:27,450
Let's go back home in one piece.

1951
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:30,349
- Let's stay safe!
- Let's stay safe until we go back.

1952
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,620
Let's go! Goodness.

1953
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,229
These days I'm realizing
that staying safe is best.

1954
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:39,399
(They're walking on the road
by the beach.)

1955
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:41,300
(Dropping his shoes)

1956
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:43,899
(While Kian84 is putting on shoes,)

1957
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,870
(Dex comes close.)

1958
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,840
I should just go barefoot.

1959
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:50,170
- It's the opposite now.
- It changed.

1960
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:52,439
- Yes. Kian84 usually goes barefoot.
- It's usually Kian84.

1961
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,779
I feel like once we finish eating,

1962
01:16:54,779 --> 01:16:57,210
we should take a boat
to the launching ceremony again.

1963
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:59,979
Then I'll pass today.

1964
01:16:59,979 --> 01:17:01,720
- The launching ceremony.
- We dance all night like this?

1965
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,889
(Join the dancing group for the 2nd time?)

1966
01:17:05,859 --> 01:17:08,359
The whole town looks empty.
Everyone must be watching the boxing game.

1967
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:09,590
- Yes.
- Right.

1968
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:11,529
- The launching ceremony yesterday.
- The launching ceremony yesterday...

1969
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:12,729
- and today...
- Boxing.

1970
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:16,630
They don't have places like karaoke rooms
or internet cafes to have fun.

1971
01:17:17,229 --> 01:17:19,739
So when there's a festival,
everyone goes there.

1972
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,540
They don't restrict foreigners,
so everyone can enjoy it.

1973
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:25,309
They don't reject you at the entrance.

1974
01:17:27,139 --> 01:17:28,210
We're almost there.

1975
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:29,910
- Isn't that the place?
- Le Corail.

1976
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:30,910
"Le Corail."

1977
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:32,920
- It's here.
- This is it.

1978
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:34,920
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

1979
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,319
- Hello.
- My gosh.

1980
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,590
I love the vibe there.

1981
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:40,859
- Hello.
- Hello.

1982
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:42,830
- Hello.
- Hello.

1983
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:43,929
(She brings them the menu.)

1984
01:17:44,189 --> 01:17:45,599
Order as much as you want.

1985
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:48,399
I don't think I'm going to eat that much.

1986
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:51,870
We should have some lobsters
since we're here.

1987
01:17:52,939 --> 01:17:54,309
- Do they have lobster here?
- Yes.

1988
01:17:54,309 --> 01:17:55,910
It's ten ariary.

1989
01:17:56,769 --> 01:17:57,840
That's 30 dollars.

1990
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,710
That's really cheap.

1991
01:17:59,779 --> 01:18:02,779
There's a ton of seafood
since they're by the beach.

1992
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:04,779
The food was really cheap.

1993
01:18:04,779 --> 01:18:06,149
- Lobster is expensive here.
- Right.

1994
01:18:07,319 --> 01:18:08,319
Okay.

1995
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:09,420
(She comes back to take their orders.)

1996
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,059
How many kilos are they?

1997
01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:13,460
Lobsters, shrimp, crabs...

1998
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:16,059
This is 1kg.

1999
01:18:16,059 --> 01:18:17,160
- This is 1kg?
- Yes.

2000
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,660
- Then we should get 3 of them.
- That's 1kg?

2001
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:20,229
No, just get two.

2002
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:21,769
Let's order just a bit first
then order more if need be.

2003
01:18:21,769 --> 01:18:23,729
- Let's do that.
- No, I'm already hungry.

2004
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,700
- All right then.
- Then you can have 2kg.

2005
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,370
- As for me...
- I was still...

2006
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,410
very shocked at that moment.

2007
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,779
So I had no appetite.

2008
01:18:32,279 --> 01:18:34,710
I hadn't fully calmed down yet.

2009
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,349
You were too upset to have an appetite.

2010
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,279
Then we'll order some lobsters.

2011
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:41,620
Shrimp and crabs.

2012
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:43,750
- And...
- And...

2013
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,689
We'd like some beer first.

2014
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,120
- Okay.
- Yes.

2015
01:18:47,929 --> 01:18:49,529
She's fluent in English.

2016
01:18:50,529 --> 01:18:52,399
I should write down the grocery list.

2017
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:56,029
We agreed to camp out
under the baobab trees.

2018
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:57,269
So we need to buy some food.

2019
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:59,599
I'm finally going to check something off
my bucket list the next day...

2020
01:18:59,599 --> 01:19:00,939
which is camping...

2021
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:02,510
- underneath the baobab trees.
- I see.

2022
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:06,109
Is that place far from here?

2023
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,250
I wouldn't know
since this is my first time.

2024
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,279
Really?

2025
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:12,420
- This is my first time in Madagascar.
- Then what'll happen to us?

2026
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:14,620
I doubt we'll die.

2027
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:19,460
This is going to be fun.
I'm excited for this camping trip.

2028
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,130
I think I'll feel rejuvenated...

2029
01:19:22,559 --> 01:19:25,559
- by the end of this show.
- Really?

2030
01:19:25,559 --> 01:19:27,899
I felt bored
because of my repetitive lifestyle...

2031
01:19:27,899 --> 01:19:31,000
before coming here,
but I'm having a blast now.

2032
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,099
Really?

2033
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:37,069
I think I was exhausted
despite being blessed in my situation.

2034
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:40,739
I think I was suffering from burnout.

2035
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:43,809
I'm an introvert who enjoys being alone.

2036
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:48,349
And I'm having a blast here.

2037
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,120
I was happy and missed going on trips.

2038
01:19:52,189 --> 01:19:53,290
And then,

2039
01:19:54,059 --> 01:19:56,590
we'll head to the capital on the 22nd.

2040
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:59,700
I love that we're in Madagascar.

2041
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,929
But once we arrive at Antananarivo,

2042
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:03,029
let's sleep in different rooms
for just one day.

2043
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,439
- I want some distance.
- I was going to say the same thing.

2044
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:08,439
That was what you really wanted to say.

2045
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:09,569
- Yes.
- Right.

2046
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:11,179
- Let's...
- Let's dedicate one day...

2047
01:20:11,179 --> 01:20:13,380
- to just touring on our own.
- Sure.

2048
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,380
- Let's do that.
- Let's not even look at each other.

2049
01:20:15,779 --> 01:20:17,880
- No contacting either?
- We can contact each other.

2050
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,720
Let's just spend some alone time.

2051
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,849
We'll feel different once we reunite.

2052
01:20:22,849 --> 01:20:24,220
- Right.
- That's right.

2053
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,260
I agree.

2054
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:27,720
You guys were waiting for this moment.

2055
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,859
- You were waiting for him to say that.
- Well...

2056
01:20:29,859 --> 01:20:31,830
It's not like
we'll reunite at the airport.

2057
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:32,899
Right.

2058
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,700
They'll still be nearby.

2059
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:37,399
We'd feel a bigger bond afterward.

2060
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:38,899
They say married couples who meet
only on the weekends are happier.

2061
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,540
You didn't need to go that far.

2062
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:44,779
You sounded like
a middle-aged man just now.

2063
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:47,210
I am old though.

2064
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,479
- How old are you again?
- I'm 37.

2065
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,220
- You are old.
- I'm 29.

2066
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:53,349
(Dex was born in 1995,
and Pani Bottle was born in 1987.)

2067
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:54,849
He's young.

2068
01:20:54,849 --> 01:20:56,849
I'm much younger than you guys.

2069
01:20:57,649 --> 01:20:58,689
He's so young.

2070
01:20:58,689 --> 01:21:00,590
- We'll spend...
- You all look so young though.

2071
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:02,960
We'll spend some alone time
at the capital...

2072
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,300
- for just one day.
- That sounds great.

2073
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,359
I think it'll be nice.

2074
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:08,029
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

2075
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:10,370
I've been having a blast so far.

2076
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:15,210
(Impressed)

2077
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:17,040
That was tasty.

2078
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,210
(She brings out the lobsters.)

2079
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,010
Why are they so huge?

2080
01:21:22,109 --> 01:21:23,179
What is that?

2081
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:25,519
We can't finish this.

2082
01:21:26,649 --> 01:21:27,649
(Check out that size.)

2083
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:28,649
It's crazy, right?

2084
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:30,620
Check out the size!

2085
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:32,559
No way.

2086
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:35,429
They were called giant lobsters.

2087
01:21:35,429 --> 01:21:38,000
Lobsters from Madagascar tend to be big.

2088
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,260
I see.

2089
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,160
I've never seen one that big before.

2090
01:21:41,269 --> 01:21:43,470
They were so huge and plump.

2091
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,000
They're twice as big as Korean lobsters.

2092
01:21:48,309 --> 01:21:49,540
This is insane.

2093
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,609
I've never seen these before.

2094
01:21:51,609 --> 01:21:53,439
- They caught them here, right?
- Right.

2095
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:55,410
- They're bigger than Korean ones.
- They look so delicious.

2096
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,080
This is game over.

2097
01:21:57,510 --> 01:21:59,250
It's crazy. I could have this every day.

2098
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,620
Did you say this was worth
over 100 dollars in Korea?

2099
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:02,090
- This dish would cost...
- About 200 dollars?

2100
01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:03,819
- almost 300 dollars.
- That's insane.

2101
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:05,790
They're so plump.

2102
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:07,519
(They get to enjoy this dish
for only 60 dollars.)

2103
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,889
This is so cheap.

2104
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:10,660
Is this shrimp?

2105
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:12,160
Even the shrimp is huge.

2106
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:13,700
- I asked for big ones.
- This is shrimp?

2107
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,769
- They're so big.
- They're huge.

2108
01:22:15,769 --> 01:22:16,899
How could shrimp be that huge?

2109
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,370
They're the size of our lobsters.

2110
01:22:19,739 --> 01:22:21,099
You must've had a great meal.

2111
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:23,809
(He loves it.)

2112
01:22:23,809 --> 01:22:25,279
- They're so big.
- They're humongous.

2113
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:29,179
(She brings out the crabs.)

2114
01:22:29,179 --> 01:22:30,380
You guys picked the best restaurant.

2115
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:33,519
(The crabs are marinated in garlic sauce.)

2116
01:22:34,179 --> 01:22:35,420
That looks scrumptious.

2117
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,319
I saw those crabs in Singapore.

2118
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:39,359
(Sniffing)

2119
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:43,359
(They smell delicious.)

2120
01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:46,099
Hot sauce. Spicy.

2121
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:47,970
- Spicy?
- Spicy sauce, please.

2122
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:49,729
Is all the seafood from that sea?

2123
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,500
- Yes.
- From Morondava?

2124
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,540
I'm going to enjoy this meal.

2125
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:56,370
This is a crustacean party.

2126
01:22:56,609 --> 01:22:58,580
- The seafood...
- Can you finish this, Dex?

2127
01:22:58,679 --> 01:22:59,779
Of course.

2128
01:23:00,779 --> 01:23:02,809
Thank you for the meal.
This is truly a feast.

2129
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:04,920
I wasn't planning to eat.

2130
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,179
Darn it. I guess I'll be eating.

2131
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:09,550
- Let's clink our glasses first.
- All right.

2132
01:23:09,649 --> 01:23:10,649
Let's clink.

2133
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:12,660
This is really nice.

2134
01:23:13,519 --> 01:23:15,160
(They drink.)

2135
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:16,630
This is nice.

2136
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,000
Guys, I'm just...

2137
01:23:18,099 --> 01:23:19,160
really thankful.

2138
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,130
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

2139
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:22,929
- Eat up, guys.
- Look at this. Goodness.

2140
01:23:23,569 --> 01:23:24,630
Okay.

2141
01:23:25,569 --> 01:23:27,370
I'm craving it all over again.

2142
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:29,870
It's as thick as a steak.

2143
01:23:30,069 --> 01:23:31,380
I had just wanted a bite.

2144
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:32,439
Gosh.

2145
01:23:32,979 --> 01:23:34,040
It looks like chicken.

2146
01:23:34,779 --> 01:23:36,309
There was so much meat.

2147
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:38,149
It's not easy to have them like that.

2148
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:40,080
It was so plump. It was the best.

2149
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:42,720
How incredible.

2150
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,720
(He loves it.)

2151
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:46,290
(He takes out something
as soon as he starts eating.)

2152
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:48,359
He took out the gochujang.

2153
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:50,429
This is the last batch.
I couldn't help it.

2154
01:23:50,729 --> 01:23:52,529
There's not much, so share it.

2155
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,300
I had brought that from the plane.

2156
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,000
- It was wise of you.
- That was clever.

2157
01:23:57,269 --> 01:23:58,439
Here you go.

2158
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:01,769
- Is that the sauce?
- Thank you.

2159
01:24:01,769 --> 01:24:03,569
- It's spicy.
- We need to dip it in that.

2160
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:05,739
Thank you.

2161
01:24:06,109 --> 01:24:08,250
(Dex is focused on the food.)

2162
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:10,380
Look at Dex.

2163
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:13,349
I was always reluctant to eat.

2164
01:24:13,349 --> 01:24:14,380
Seriously.

2165
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:17,090
(Dex couldn't eat well back in India.)

2166
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,359
He was so eager to eat that night.

2167
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,160
That was all meat.

2168
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,630
Look at that. That's insane.

2169
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:29,429
It was so delicious.

2170
01:24:29,429 --> 01:24:31,739
I used to imagine...

2171
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,939
shoving lobster in my mouth.

2172
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,370
- This is all meat.
- That's big enough to shove.

2173
01:24:35,569 --> 01:24:37,010
- Gosh.
- Try it.

2174
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:38,109
(The lobster is so plump.)

2175
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:39,710
I'll dip it in the gochujang.

2176
01:24:40,939 --> 01:24:41,979
That looks delicious.

2177
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:43,849
- Bite it off.
- Gosh.

2178
01:24:43,849 --> 01:24:45,950
- It's tasty.
- Gosh.

2179
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:48,420
(He's on cloud nine.)

2180
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:49,550
You eat so well.

2181
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:51,250
It's good to see you eating so well.

2182
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:52,660
- Seriously.
- Gosh.

2183
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,189
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2184
01:24:54,830 --> 01:24:56,889
- It's really good.
- Look at him frowning.

2185
01:24:56,889 --> 01:24:58,359
(It means it's delicious.)

2186
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:00,160
- It was really good.
- You're truly enjoying it.

2187
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,359
It was scrumptious.

2188
01:25:02,069 --> 01:25:05,399
(Our dear Dex has changed.)

2189
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:09,269
(The food is perfect for his taste.)

2190
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:11,340
I have a huge appetite now. This is bad.

2191
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,010
I think I'll gain weight here.

2192
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:15,380
(Dex isn't the only one
with a big appetite.)

2193
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,479
I knew it.

2194
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:18,149
You already had a big appetite.

2195
01:25:19,019 --> 01:25:20,649
He had it ever since his trip to India.

2196
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:24,019
(Voracious Bottle is enjoying
his meal once again.)

2197
01:25:24,019 --> 01:25:25,489
I couldn't help it.

2198
01:25:25,489 --> 01:25:26,889
The food is insane.

2199
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:28,359
(He breaks the shell.)

2200
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:29,989
I've never seen
an eating show like this before.

2201
01:25:29,989 --> 01:25:32,099
- Gosh.
- This is amazing.

2202
01:25:32,429 --> 01:25:33,599
I can't stop eating.

2203
01:25:34,059 --> 01:25:35,300
I'm going to gain weight.

2204
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:37,569
(He grabs another piece of lobster.)

2205
01:25:37,569 --> 01:25:39,399
You're eating so well.

2206
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:42,470
Everything is so tasty these days.
This is bad.

2207
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:44,510
Nothing tastes bad.

2208
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:47,380
(Hitting)

2209
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,880
Do they have no hammers?

2210
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:51,819
The meat in the pincers tastes good.

2211
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:53,019
- Right.
- It's plump.

2212
01:25:53,019 --> 01:25:54,319
- Gosh.
- It's firm.

2213
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:56,389
(He's determined to crack it open.)

2214
01:25:57,649 --> 01:25:59,189
(I will crack this open.)

2215
01:26:00,019 --> 01:26:01,189
Gosh.

2216
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:02,929
- We still have so much meat though.
- What?

2217
01:26:03,889 --> 01:26:06,059
(He eats it in less than 3 seconds
after dropping it.)

2218
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:08,059
Is that spicy sauce?

2219
01:26:08,059 --> 01:26:09,130
- Here.
- Yes.

2220
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,630
- She brought this.
- The sauce...

2221
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:11,700
I see.

2222
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,210
I see. Like this.

2223
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:18,340
I can fit this entire lobster in my mouth.

2224
01:26:18,779 --> 01:26:20,080
Gosh.

2225
01:26:20,809 --> 01:26:22,649
(Crushing)

2226
01:26:22,649 --> 01:26:23,649
Gosh.

2227
01:26:23,849 --> 01:26:25,149
You're eating so well.

2228
01:26:25,149 --> 01:26:26,550
I'll have the head now.

2229
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,319
(He drenches it in hot sauce.)

2230
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:31,620
This is insane.

2231
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,989
(Munching)

2232
01:26:32,989 --> 01:26:34,590
He's inhaling the food.

2233
01:26:36,029 --> 01:26:38,200
The shrimp's head is
as big as a lobster's.

2234
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,529
Gosh, that looks like
a ginseng root or something.

2235
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:41,700
Ginseng?

2236
01:26:41,769 --> 01:26:44,200
(The best part of crustaceans
is the head, indeed.)

2237
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:46,170
It's savory.

2238
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,439
(Sucking out the savory meat)

2239
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:52,510
(Earlier, when they were ordering food)

2240
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,149
(Kian84 said he didn't have an appetite,
which was quite unusual.)

2241
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:59,050
(Slurping it away in the flash of an eye)

2242
01:26:59,779 --> 01:27:01,179
Where did the surprised guy go?

2243
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,620
When I saw that, I felt a bit more calm.

2244
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:06,559
(Salivating)

2245
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:09,359
(He was surprised to see the fighter,)

2246
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:10,960
(but he calms down
after seeing the lobster.)

2247
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,000
The leg...

2248
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,929
(In a trance)

2249
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,899
The juice just keeps on coming.

2250
01:27:17,929 --> 01:27:19,170
(Slurping)

2251
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:20,500
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

2252
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,540
(Dripping)

2253
01:27:22,269 --> 01:27:23,510
Gosh.

2254
01:27:24,139 --> 01:27:27,479
Should I mix some rice
in the shell and eat it?

2255
01:27:27,479 --> 01:27:29,550
Gosh, you're totally destroying
the lobster.

2256
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:30,779
(He adds some hot sauce too.)

2257
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:32,450
In the crab shell? Gosh.

2258
01:27:32,979 --> 01:27:35,790
- With the sauce.
- Yes, that's it.

2259
01:27:37,689 --> 01:27:39,720
Gosh, this is almost as good
as soy sauce marinated crab.

2260
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,760
Try mixing some rice in the shell.

2261
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,130
(He's done making the crab shell rice,
the perfect combination.)

2262
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:49,830
The innards are tasty, no matter what.

2263
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:51,269
(Savory and sweet)

2264
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:52,470
Gosh, that's good.

2265
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:53,540
(His appetite is back.)

2266
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:54,540
It's so savory.

2267
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:57,609
(He cleans out the crab shell
as if he's out of his mind.)

2268
01:27:57,609 --> 01:27:58,979
He's enjoying it so much.

2269
01:27:58,979 --> 01:28:01,239
- I liked the umami taste of it.
- Gosh, that's crazy.

2270
01:28:01,239 --> 01:28:03,750
(Dirty)

2271
01:28:04,809 --> 01:28:06,849
We seem like we've been starving
for a few days.

2272
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,250
I'm getting goosebumps.

2273
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,149
It's so tasty.

2274
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,220
This is my first time eating it like this.

2275
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:13,720
It was my first time eating
such a big one.

2276
01:28:13,819 --> 01:28:14,920
You picked a good restaurant.

2277
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:17,460
- It's not an easy thing...
- Gosh.

2278
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:18,700
- to get full on lobster.
- Right.

2279
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:20,929
Gosh, how luxurious.

2280
01:28:21,769 --> 01:28:23,769
When you go to eat lobster,

2281
01:28:23,769 --> 01:28:25,599
- it's not easy to get full from it.
- Right.

2282
01:28:25,599 --> 01:28:27,170
- You're right.
- You always feel slightly less than full.

2283
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:28,200
- Of course.
- Right.

2284
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,540
- You fill up by eating...
- Right.

2285
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:30,739
other foods too.

2286
01:28:30,739 --> 01:28:32,109
You usually fill up with the side dishes.

2287
01:28:32,109 --> 01:28:33,639
But here, you can purely...

2288
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:34,939
- get full...
- On lobster?

2289
01:28:34,939 --> 01:28:37,410
on the meat of the lobster itself.

2290
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:38,819
We got the luxury treatment.

2291
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:41,319
- Guys, isn't this nice?
- Yes?

2292
01:28:42,649 --> 01:28:43,720
I'm happy.

2293
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:45,489
I'm so happy right now.

2294
01:28:45,489 --> 01:28:47,220
(His happiness level is at its max.)

2295
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:48,529
There were two cats here.

2296
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:51,029
Hey, come here.

2297
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:53,830
Come here. Have some.

2298
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:55,300
(He shares his happiness
with the cats too.)

2299
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:57,099
So cute.

2300
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:02,639
(He finishes happily with some cold beer.)

2301
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,840
(Satisfied)

2302
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,540
(Beads of happy sweat)

2303
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,479
(Looking)

2304
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:12,479
(Out of the blue)

2305
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:13,720
(Laughing)

2306
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,120
We really look like we're in
"The Slave Hunters."

2307
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,389
(Laughing)

2308
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,620
- We were eating like beggars.
- Gosh, it's so tasty.

2309
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:23,290
(Dae Gil84 looks at...)

2310
01:29:23,290 --> 01:29:24,489
(his happy brothers.)

2311
01:29:24,489 --> 01:29:25,729
Dae Gil84.

2312
01:29:25,729 --> 01:29:27,160
(Dae Gil84 looks at his happy brothers.)

2313
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:29,630
(Smiling)

2314
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:32,099
- We deserve to eat like this.
- We do.

2315
01:29:32,439 --> 01:29:33,800
We lived hard.

2316
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,170
- We did a lot today.
- Yes.

2317
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:39,910
We went to the launching ceremony,

2318
01:29:40,809 --> 01:29:41,849
exercised,

2319
01:29:42,349 --> 01:29:43,380
and sparred.

2320
01:29:44,109 --> 01:29:47,279
(Their brotherhood has grown stronger
through exercise.)

2321
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,420
(Lobster after a hard day's work)

2322
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:52,319
(How great is it?)

2323
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:57,489
(Kian84, I'm happy.)

2324
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:00,760
Watching them eat like beggars
made me feel like...

2325
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:02,500
we really didn't have
anything to hide from each other.

2326
01:30:03,569 --> 01:30:05,139
(So close)

2327
01:30:05,769 --> 01:30:08,410
Guys, let's keep going strong
without any trouble.

2328
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:09,739
(The beggar brothers grow a step closer.)

2329
01:30:09,739 --> 01:30:11,639
- We shouldn't have any trouble.
- No trouble and for a long time.

2330
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:12,979
- He's still scarfing down food.
- I'm not even listening.

2331
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:15,450
- You're really not listening.
- You can't hear anything in that state.

2332
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:19,250
Gosh, Dex. You ate so much.

2333
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:20,819
(Total destruction)

2334
01:30:20,819 --> 01:30:22,989
- You totally destroyed those.
- I totally did.

2335
01:30:22,989 --> 01:30:25,160
This was like a carpet bombing.

2336
01:30:25,889 --> 01:30:27,420
I thought I ate a lot, but gosh...

2337
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,160
Goodness.

2338
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,559
(It was like this before.)

2339
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:32,630
We were on fire.

2340
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,559
Gosh, we ate all of this.

2341
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:37,170
- This is like a crustacean graveyard.
- Yes.

2342
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:38,370
(RIP, Crustaceans)

2343
01:30:39,099 --> 01:30:40,470
Sir!

2344
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:42,870
- How much do you think we spent?
- Sir?

2345
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:44,840
- Can we have the bill?
- The bill.

2346
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,080
- Check?
- Yes, check please.

2347
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:49,410
- It's 348,000 ariaries?
- Is that about 100,000 won?

2348
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:50,779
How much is 348,000 ariaries?

2349
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,080
About 120,000 won?

2350
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,080
(It's about 116,000 won.)

2351
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,279
- Per person.
- Is that right?

2352
01:30:54,279 --> 01:30:56,189
- No, it's not per person. Total.
- It's not per person.

2353
01:30:56,849 --> 01:30:58,620
- Gosh, this is...
- Total?

2354
01:30:58,620 --> 01:30:59,859
This is practically free.

2355
01:30:59,859 --> 01:31:01,260
It was 110,000 won total?
About 110 dollars?

2356
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:03,130
Hey, if we ate this in Gangnam,

2357
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:06,130
- it would've been 120,000 won for 1.
- I exchanged a lot of money.

2358
01:31:06,429 --> 01:31:07,859
Great job, guys. Let's go.

2359
01:31:07,859 --> 01:31:10,000
- Let's go.
- Thank you for the meal.

2360
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:12,500
Gosh, it was a long day, wasn't it?

2361
01:31:13,239 --> 01:31:14,870
- I feel like I'm going to pass out.
- Let's go.

2362
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,870
- Let's go.
- It feels like it's midnight.

2363
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:18,139
Gosh.

2364
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:19,639
Gosh, this is...

2365
01:31:20,179 --> 01:31:21,880
- Gosh.
- Is that the original color?

2366
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,479
The size is huge.

2367
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:24,750
It looks kind of scary.

2368
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:27,479
That was a great meal.

2369
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,019
- Goodness.
- Let's go.

2370
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,489
- Gosh, let's go.
- Goodness.

2371
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:31,859
- I feel like I'm going to pass out.
- Let's go.

2372
01:31:32,759 --> 01:31:33,759
(Now that they've filled their stomachs,)

2373
01:31:33,759 --> 01:31:34,759
(they'll go see
the long-awaited baobab trees!)

2374
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:36,829
(The three brothers set off
to see today's highlight.)

2375
01:31:36,829 --> 01:31:38,459
(Excited)

2376
01:31:38,889 --> 01:31:40,299
(- It's baobab.
- Oh, my.)

2377
01:31:40,299 --> 01:31:41,400
(It's huge!)

2378
01:31:41,499 --> 01:31:42,969
(They finally arrive at Baobab Avenue
after driving for a while.)

2379
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,570
(A surreal beauty unfolds
before their eyes.)

2380
01:31:45,969 --> 01:31:48,100
(A new world presented to them
by the baobab trees)

2381
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:50,539
(At the overwhelming sight,)

2382
01:31:50,539 --> 01:31:53,679
(the three brothers feel
a mix of emotions.)

2383
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:56,879
(This is the true Madagascar!)

2384
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,879
(Do you like mango?)

2385
01:31:58,879 --> 01:32:00,249
(Sweet)

2386
01:32:00,249 --> 01:32:02,350
(The irresistible youngest
is sweet here as well.)

2387
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,450
(Bashful)

2388
01:32:03,549 --> 01:32:05,919
- Adventure by...
- Adventure by...

2389
01:32:05,919 --> 01:32:08,060
- Accident.
- Accident.

2390
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:10,259
(The oldest is promoting
Adventure by Accident 3.)

2391
01:32:11,089 --> 01:32:12,089
(And then, that night)

2392
01:32:12,089 --> 01:32:13,259
(Is this time to reveal our secrets?)

2393
01:32:13,629 --> 01:32:14,629
(When he heard that Dex were coming...)

2394
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,230
(Surprised)

2395
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:17,370
(They begin unleashing their rough secrets
one by one.)

2396
01:32:17,929 --> 01:32:19,999
(The night grows deeper as they have
an honest talk under the baobab tree.)

2397
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,810
(I want Adventure by Accident
to be number 1 inside your hearts.)

2398
01:32:25,539 --> 01:32:26,980
(Adventure by Accident 3)
