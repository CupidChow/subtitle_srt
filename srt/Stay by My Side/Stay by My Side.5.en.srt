1
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,850
Didn't you say you would give me a reward?

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,152
Why do I feel like you are
using me as a backrest?

3
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,956
You want a reward?

4
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,290
Of course.

5
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,459
You dragged me into doing so many things,

6
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,111
and I agreed to all of them.

7
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,429
Well,

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,098
turn around.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,735
Why?

10
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,375
Obedient kids get candies.

11
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,452
Why would someone willingly stay by your side?

12
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,986
Why would one person

13
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,922
be so kind to another?

14
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:36,128

27
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,453
Episode 5
Gu Buxia.

28
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,021
Stop acting dumb.

29
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,689
Help me find my daughter.

30
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,693
What should we do?
He seems to really not hear us.

31
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,961
Could it be his power

32
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,164
has been temporarily sealed by yang-qi?

33
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,533
It seems like every time
that guy Jiang Chi is around,

34
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,434
Gu Buxia can't hear us.

35
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,304
Recently I've been staying close to my roommate

36
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,273
and haven't heard
those ghost voices for a while.

37
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,607
Take him back here someday.

38
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,142
I'll take a look for you.

39
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,612
It's not like a boyfriend meets the family.

40
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,114
Besides, I can't always depend on him.

41
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,249
What if he ignores me one day?

42
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,084
I still have to be independent and strong.

43
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,287
Pluck the flower when it blooms,

44
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,189
or you'll be left with the branches.

45
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,291
You'll just have to save up more normally.

46
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,442
What's wrong?

47
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,345
My dad fainted while he was seeing a patient.

48
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,347
I need to go back and check on him.

49
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,223
Is he okay now?

50
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,490
I don't know.

51
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,366
I don't know when I can come back.

52
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,702
Can you manage alone?

53
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,703
Of course.

54
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,905
Hurry and go see your dad. Take care.

55
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,473
Call me if you need anything.

56
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,709
Don't forget to call me.

57
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,450
Jiang Chi has left.

58
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,784
This is our chance.

59
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:12,952
No way.

60
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,387
Someone's father is sick.

61
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,689
Even as ghosts, we should have a conscience.

62
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,859
Don't say we ghosts don't have a conscience.

63
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,362
I'm so cold that feel like I could die again.

64
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,397
I can't be bothered about conscience anymore.

65
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,125
Gu Buxia, can you hear us?

66
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,143
Gu.

67
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:55,161
He heard us.

68
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,232
No way.

69
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,801
It's only the second day
without being with Jiang Chi.

70
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,436
And my quota dropped so fast.

71
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,079
There should still be some
of Jiang Chi's yang-qi here.

72
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,548
Gu Buxia, don't be afraid.

73
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,150
You have to be strong.

74
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,569
Jiang Chi will be back soon.

75
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,720
No.

76
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,255
We have to be brave and depend on ourselves.

77
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,223
You'll get used to it
if you listen for a while.

78
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,392
It's useless.

79
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,394
Just do as we say.

80
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,829
Child.

81
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,147
Don't be afraid.

82
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:33,199
Just help us out.

83
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,285
Stop harassing me.

84
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:36,669
My Jiang Chi

85
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,870
will be back soon.

86
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:41,280
(Yu Stadium)

87
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,608
Move!

88
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,323
Are you okay? Hey.

89
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,058
I'm fine.

90
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,326
Let's help him up first.

91
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,498
Are you in any pain?

92
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,835
No way.

93
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,536
Did you break up with Jiang Chi?

94
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,040
Gu Buxia, have you lost your soul?

95
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,041
Where's Jiang Chi?

96
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,542
I haven't seen him these days.

97
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,613
He's got some family matters,

98
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,814
so he's gone for a few days.

99
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,584
It's only a few days.

100
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,752
But why does he look

101
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,787
like he's been dumped?

102
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:28,888
You don't understand.

103
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,624
This is what people call
"a day apart feels like three seasons".

104
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,464
Let's go.

105
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,229
You'll be okay, right?

106
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,835
Once upon a time, I was good at basketball.

107
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,370
But it seems their basketball team

108
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,273
isn't doing well these past two years.

109
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,376
Gu Buxia, why do you look so weak?

110
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,916
Dear uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters,

111
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,285
please spare me.

112
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,853
Let me get some good sleep tonight.

113
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,055
Don't always be so fierce.

114
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,825
Or else, if this continues,

115
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,794
I will be headed to your place.

116
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,961
Child.

117
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,196
Don't be afraid.

118
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,064
We came first, and you
haven't solved our issues.

119
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,800
When others hear about this and come,

120
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,102
you will surely go crazy.

121
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,212
How's your dad?

122
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,548
He's stable now.

123
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,783
But no caretaker can stand him.

124
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,851
So I have to take care of him.

125
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,621
What about your mom, your brother,
and your sister?

126
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,157
Can't you take turns?

127
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,142
Won't it be exhausting like this?

128
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,394
Doctors don't have time
to take care of their family.

129
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,462
I'm alright.

130
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,163
Do you need anything?

131
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,498
I can bring them to you.

132
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,799
Nope, it's all very convenient here.

133
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,734
What about school?

134
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,270
If you need anything, you have to tell me.

135
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,806
Worry about yourself instead.

136
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,042
Without a translator by your side,

137
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,143
you need to work harder.

138
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,247
Gu Buxia.

139
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,515
Come closer.

140
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,385
Why do you have heavy dark circles?

141
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,054
Did you not sleep well without me?

142
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,291
I didn't sleep well because of the game.

143
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,027
How could it be because of you?

144
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:17,196
Alright, I will go to bed earlier.

145
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,632
Remember not to look too serious.

146
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,267
Don't be mean to the patient.

147
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,503
Remember to thank the nurse.

148
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,938
I'm in the middle of a game.

149
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,206
I have to go now.

150
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,783
(Wait for me to come back.)

151
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,163
If Jiang is not here, Gu can't block us.

152
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,798
- When he's back…
- Just ignore him.

153
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,066
I'll see what you have to say.

154
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,202
I hope Jiang moves out soon.

155
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,371
I relied on Jiang Chi, but he's gone now.

156
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,206
It's best to rely on oneself

157
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,639
I'm not around,

158
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,741
will he be okay by himself?

159
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,636
Running anywhere is useless.

160
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,237
Let's see who can last longer.

161
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,507
But he doesn't have the incense smell.

162
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,309
Perhaps it's useless to talk to him?

163
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,878
Even if it's useless, we must continue.

164
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,580
We finally caught someone

165
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,549
who can hear our voices.

166
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,152
While that person hasn't returned,

167
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,153
shall we wake him up first?

168
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,522
Otherwise, once he touches him…

169
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,191
He won't be able to hear us.

170
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,361
That man is back.

171
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,964
Every time he gets close to this kid,

172
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,833
it seems like there's a shield.

173
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,407
You're finally back.

174
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,123
You must be tired, Jiang.

175
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,324
Welcome back.

176
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,094
Let me, as your roommate, make up for it.

177
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,395
What do you want?

178
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,116
Thank you for making up for it.

179
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,624
Next time getting a kiss,

180
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,792
remember to close your eyes.

181
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:11,797
You…

182
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,432
Why did you kiss me?

183
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,136
You seemed to want that.

184
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,437
No, I didn't.

185
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,172
You didn't?

186
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,341
Did I?

187
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,213
I didn't, right?

188
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,253
Okay, you didn't. It was me.

189
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,423
I was too tired these days,
and seeing you made me happy.

190
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,625
We're both men. You won't mind, right?

191
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,463
We're both men.

192
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:45,999
It's okay, right?

193
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,633
I don't mind.

194
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,101
We two with panda eyes

195
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,669
should be able to sleep well tonight, right?

196
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:55,923

♫ Go, going left, going right, and where to ♫

198
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:18,432
♫ This isn't the familiar crossroad
I pass by every day ♫

199
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:23,392
♫ You have disrupted my rhythm ♫

200
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:28,576
♫ The weather is sometimes clear,
sometimes cloudy, and sometimes rainy ♫

201
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:32,064
♫ In the wind and rain,
I love to wander here and there ♫

202
00:13:32,064 --> 00:13:34,624
♫ I've lost myself in the wandering ♫

203
00:13:34,624 --> 00:13:38,688
♫ Dreams are like a fleeting storm ♫

204
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,857
If this goes on,

205
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,692
I can't leave him anymore.

206
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,060
What should I do?

207
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,838
Here, this is for you.

208
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:02,908
I'm going to shower.

209
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,109
Wait for me for a bit.

210
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,113
Why should I wait for you?

211
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,049
Why would I care if you shower or not?

212
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,939
Bad habit.

213
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,121
(Yu Stadium)

214
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,208
- Good morning.
- Morning.

215
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,010
- Your defense needs to be solid.
- Baiwei, you're up.

216
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,096
Okay.

217
00:15:14,944 --> 00:15:16,215
Keep your hands low.

218
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,344
Yes.

219
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:18,851
Gu Buxia.

220
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:19,852
Morning.

221
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,188
You're late. Where is Jiang Chi?

222
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,498
Captain.

223
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,666
There he is.

224
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:57,990
Welcome, welcome.

225
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,158
Thank you for joining us.

226
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,194
If you want to thank someone, thank Gu Buxia.

227
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,164
He needs me.

228
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,935
Don't forget the conditions we agreed on.

229
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,438
The only practice combination
that cannot be separated.

230
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,573
Brand new designated number 11 jersey.

231
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,008
And a jersey towel,

232
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,710
designated for Gu Buxia to wash personally.

233
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,989
Why didn't you tell me you were coming today?

234
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,359
To thank you for the supplements you gave me.

235
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,027
Supplements?

236
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:39,531
Hey, what are you two whispering about?

237
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,966
We're all brothers here.

238
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,102
Buxia asked why I joined the basketball team.

239
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,269
Why?

240
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,026
Because

241
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,378
I ate

242
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,580
the supplements

243
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,681
from Gu Buxia.

244
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,485
Last night…

245
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,487
Last night,

246
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,589
he was convinced by my heartfelt persuasion.

247
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,125
You should all thank me very much.

248
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,395
- Impressive.
- Of course.

249
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,130
- Let's start practicing.
- Okay.

250
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,166
Pass the ball.

251
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,039
What supplements?

252
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,574
Give me the ball. Here.

253
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,862
Why are you buying groceries
and cooking for no reason?

254
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,165
Didn't you say you wanted
to make it up for me?

255
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,366
Please.

256
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,901
We could order delivery

257
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,736
or eat out.

258
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,841
That's not sincere enough.

259
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,212
I really can't cook.

260
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,047
No.

261
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,916
I've never even cooked instant noodles before.

262
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,485
You were so good to me before,

263
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,821
and now that you have me,
you're planning to slack off?

264
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,190
What do you mean "have you"?

265
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,827
I can do other things that I'm good at for you.

266
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,729
Things you're good at?

267
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,433
Gu Buxia.

268
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,002
What are you daydreaming about?

269
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,939
I was thinking about pandas.

270
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,344
Your dark circles are still quite obvious.

271
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,547
You're not much better.

272
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,483
Should we sleep together again tonight?

273
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,169
I'll leave the rest to you.

274
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,886
Why are your ears so red?

275
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,558
It's all your fault.

276
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,027
Why did you get so close for no reason?

277
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,398
Don't you also get close to those guys
from the basketball team?

278
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,666
I'm not used to it.

279
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,467
They're not like you.

280
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,469
What am I like?

281
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,374
Are you on strike?

282
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,343
I'm going to the bathroom.

283
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,166
Jiang Chi.

284
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,968
Have you seen this before?

285
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,135
You haven't seen it?

286
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,706
Everyone's been passing it around lately.

287
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,307
Deadlock.

289

Your actions caused misunderstandings.

290
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,265
Should we explain?

291
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,634
Explain what?

292
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,971
Or do you not want to make it public?

293
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,677
Can anyone tell me

294
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:19,811
what we are

295
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,446

Is this a move between brothers?

I meant what I said.
