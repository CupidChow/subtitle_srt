00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,360

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,679

43
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,381
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

44
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,350

46
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,023

Pretend what?

Isn't it all because of you guys,

51
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,765

52
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,651

Look,

63
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,965
the neighbors made some goodies!

64
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,201
I can't eat them all, so I've brought you some.

65
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,711
Why have your got heavy dark circles?

66
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,215
Is it the ghosts' voices?

67
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,486
You're not starting to see them, are you?

68
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,860
Something wrong with that Heater Guy?

69
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,596
I'm not in the mood.

70
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,448
Don't talk about him.

71
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:39,899
Did you guys fight?

72
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,168
Again?

73
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,304
He said he likes me,

74
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,572
and asked if I like him.

75
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,376
Congrats!
My brother just got his love confession!

76
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,044
Then what did you say?

77
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,714
I didn't.

78
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,820
Oh you novice,

79
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,755
is it because you don't know how to love

80
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,091
or how to express it?

81
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,296
I'm really stupid.

82
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,298
I don't know what to do at all.

83
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,451
He seems to be sincere,

84
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:16,702
but I,

85
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,574
I just want to get close to him

86
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,842
to get rid of the ghosts' voices.

87
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,745
It is one conditional relationship.

88
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,747
Am I not despicable?

89
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,083
He asked to clarify
that we're not in a relationship.

90
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,085
But that's just not true!

91
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,956
Why give it too many thoughts?

92
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:41,477
If you like him, just go for it.

93
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:43,463
If you don't like him,

94
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,465
you can just use him.

95
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,967
How can I do that?

96
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,903
I'm only joking!

97
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:51,904
If you didn't like him,

98
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,673
you wouldn't be bothered now.

99
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,943
You know, when you fall for someone,

100
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,178
you miss them when they're not around.

101
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,747
And when you're together, you're very happy.

102
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,917
Doing stuff with them

103
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,385
feels warm.

104
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,721
Especially during those intimate moments,

105
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,490
you don't want to push them away,

106
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,558
but instead, your heart races

107
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,560
like you're expecting something.

108
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,166
You talk as if you've been in love.

109
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,167
The only things you ever love

110
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,269
are those strays in the temple.

111
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,004
What are you talking about!

112
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,776
You said you were upset

113
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,545
when he said
you two weren't in a relationship, right?

114
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,815
Then make your relationship real.

115
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,751
Boy, what are you afraid of being rejected?

116
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,852
Go for it again.

117
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,788
Do you think Grandpa would support us?

118
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,324
We're both men, after all.

119
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,461
Grandpa would definitely say,

120
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,663
as long as it's someone
who can get a hold of you,

121
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,265
who cares who it is.

Why does it feel weird today?

134
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,543
That day I asked Buxia about Jiang Chi.

135
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,045
Maybe he was just shy.

136
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,413
But he said

137
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,415
if it weren't for taking Jiang Chi in the team,

138
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,083
he wouldn't be bothered with him.

I said I like you,

and I mean you, right in front of me.

179
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,369

00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,510
when someone kisses another,

184
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,279
what would be the reason?

185
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:51,392
<i>♫ But just want you to hear me ♫</i>

186
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:53,515
<i>♫ I miss you ♫</i>

187
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:57,228
<i>♫ Like a burning fire ♫</i>

188
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,672
<i>♫ Breaking taboos and boundaries ♫</i>

189
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:05,152
<i>♫ Spreading endlessly ♫</i>

190
00:14:05,152 --> 00:14:09,184
<i>♫ Your silhouette, your eyes ♫</i>

191
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:13,489
<i>♫ Moments of despair and joy ♫</i>

192
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:20,034
<i>♫ All branded on my left chest ♫</i>

193
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,000
<i>♫ If there were a ticket ♫</i>

194
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,080
<i>♫ Let's jump back to that second ♫</i>

195
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,037
<i>♫ I'd hug you tight before you fade ♫</i>

196
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,096
<i>♫ Let me be your straw ♫</i>

197
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:35,510
<i>♫ To soothe away your sorrow ♫</i>

198
00:14:35,513 --> 00:14:39,843
<i>♫ A straw of warmth ♫</i>

199
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:44,568
<i>♫ If only we could stay this way ♫</i>

200
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,352
<i>Damn, they are really a thing now.</i>

201
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,122
<i>I could really use a boyfriend.</i>

202
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,592
<i>Somebody please come hold my hand.</i>

203
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,461
<i>When can I go find him?</i>

204
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,932
<i>Hey, now's not the time to be envious.</i>

205
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,267
<i>They stick together all day long.</i>

206
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,870
<i>What about us?</i>

207
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,439
<i>Yeah, we're doomed.</i>

208
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,453
<i>[Library]</i>

209
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,342
I feel sleepy whenever I open a book.

210
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,410
Be serious.

211
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,045
Aren't you afraid of failing the exam?

212
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,515
What if you couldn't graduate with me?

213
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:45,600
<i>[Sure you don't want that law internship?
There's only one place. It'll be worth it.]</i>

214
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,960
<i>[Give the opportunity to others, thank you.]</i>

215
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,096
<i>[Are you free tomorrow?
The professor wants to ask you about the case.]</i>

216
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:06,688
<i>[Email me, I'm busy tomorrow.
I'll get it done for you at midnight.]</i>

217
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,475
Why are you leaving so early today?

218
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,543
I have to go for rehabilitation later.

219
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,544
I've got class.

220
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,079
Tuition.

221
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,981
How come you're all busy today?

222
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,416
You can go to Jiang Chi.

223
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,418
He's gone to work.

224
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,053
I was thinking about inviting you to dinner.

225
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,821
- Suddenly felt like having hot pot.
- We have to go!

226
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,923
Keep it up!

227
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,832
Fighting!

228
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,250
What was I doing

229
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,852
when Jiang Chi wasn't around?

230
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,254
Ugh, I can't remember now.

231
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,258
<i>Hiding our relationship is deception.</i>

232
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,993
<i>Don't you know that?</i>

233
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:50,162
<i>It's because--</i>

234
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,530
<i>Stop.</i>

235
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,931
<i>I don't want to hear anything.</i>

236
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,533
<i>I didn't dare to tell you</i>

237
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,101
<i>because I'm afraid you'll ignore me,</i>

238
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,536
<i>that you'll leave me!</i>

239
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,705
<i>Don't I deserve your trust?</i>

240
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,006
<i>If my feelings for you</i>

241
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,041
<i>are taken as a tool,</i>

242
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,543
<i>then I'd rather take it back</i>

243
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,911
<i>and throw it in the trash can.</i>

244
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,379
<i>Hey! Don't leave!</i>

245
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,583
Yeah yeah, where are you going…

246
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,955
Yelling, really?

247
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,358
Aren't you supposed to work all day?

248
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,059
Follow me.

249
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,872
I didn't think you're the 'birthday' type.

250
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,207
I don't do birthdays,

251
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,675
but for you, I'd do it.

252
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,147
So you've cleared the place.

253
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,083
Of course. I can't let anyone disturb us.

254
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,587
Come eat the noodles, for lasting health.

255
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,431
I didn't know you're into this sort of stuff.

256
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,101
I didn't know you've got such dirty thoughts.

257
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:57,664
<i>♫ Oh, it's love, it's love. I'm in love ♫</i>

258
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:15,299
<i>♫ Don't leave me stranded in a sea of people ♫</i>

259
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:20,227
<i>♫ Crying for help on an island of memories ♫</i>

260
00:21:20,227 --> 00:21:23,960
<i>♫ I don't want anyone to find out ♫</i>

261
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:28,003
<i>♫ But just want you to hear me ♫</i>

262
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:30,179
<i>♫ I miss you ♫</i>

263
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:33,725
<i>♫ Like a burning fire ♫</i>

<i>♫ You hear that, don't you? ♫</i>

267
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:49,411
<i>♫ I finally get it now♫</i>

268
00:21:50,147 --> 00:21:55,747
<i>♫ What I never said to you ♫</i>

269
00:21:58,243 --> 00:22:02,211
<i>♫ Answer me if you can hear me ♫</i>

271
00:22:05,795 --> 00:22:07,811
<i>[Stay by My Side]</i>

272
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,795
I hope that in the future

273
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,063
you and I can have the same key.

274
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,531
I never thought the day may come

275
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,800
when someone else celebrates my birthday.

276
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,968
Don't you guys think

277
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,203
that I don't deserve Jiang Chi?

278
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,338
Love is love.

279
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,689
Who cares if it's worth it.

280
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:22,641
Did I say I need you to stay with me every day?

281
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,476
I stay because I care. But you don't want it.

282
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,061
So I'd better leave you on your own,

283
00:22:26,061 --> 00:22:27,512
am I wrong?
