1
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,175
It's all your fault.

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,811
Your actions caused misunderstandings.

3
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,513
Even I, when I look at them…

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,714
What?

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,351
Look, it's like this.

6
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,321
Should we explain?

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,689
Explain what?

8
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,893
Or do you not want to make it public?

9
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,267
I didn't expect we could
see a real-life love scene.

10
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,002
This is so exciting.

11
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,437
Sorry to interrupt.

12
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,874
Hello, we're from the school newspaper.

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,576
Since everyone is very curious about you two,

14
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,145
can we have an interview with you?

15
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,546
- Sure.
- Not really.

16
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,918
There were rumors that you two
were not getting along.

17
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,586
Is that true?

18
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,680
Yes.

19
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:57,891
Why?

20
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,226
Because he didn't want to live with others.

21
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,096
Then how did you two make up?

22
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,865
You seem to get along
very well from the photos.

23
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,504
I just saw the photos this morning.

24
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,972
I realized our schoolmates

25
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,675
are really good at taking photos.

26
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,545
Sorry, I digressed.

27
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:22,082
This is a good chance to clarify

28
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,651
that our relationship is actually quite good.

29
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,653
He might have a cold and serious face,

30
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,388
but actually, he's a good person.

31
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,390
Although I was very annoyed with him at first,

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,825
later I found out

33
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,194
he was cold on the outside
but warm on the inside.

34
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,196
Are you two dating?

35
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,436
We're just together.

36
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,778
We just live together.

37
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,114
Can you define a specific timing

38
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,883
of liking someone?

39
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,854
For me,

40
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,256
there's no specific timing for liking someone.

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,259
When you can't stop thinking about someone,

42
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,061
that's probably when you start to like him.

43
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,473
Buxia, what about you?

44
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,475
- I…
- Right.

45
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,477
The reason why I joined the basketball team…

46
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,113
Was it for Buxia?

47
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,188
Please cheer for the basketball team together.

48
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,690
- So you two later…
- That's all the questions.

49
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,791
I haven't finished yet.

50
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,959
Thank you. We'll leave now.

51
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,794
I still have questions.

52
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:43,997
Wait.

53
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,834
Why did you say that?

54
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,203
Isn't it good to cheer for the basketball team?

55
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,205
No.

56
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,574
It's the way you said it and that expression,

57
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,709
it will worsen misunderstandings.

58
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,482
It's not a misunderstanding.

59
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,551
I meant what I said.

00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,419
Forget it.

106
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,154
You can never win an argument with him.

107
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,755
I don't care anymore.

108
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,224
It's his fault for being so handsy.

109
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,793
What a bad habit.

110
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,715
Did I gain weight recently?

111
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,954
It's all Jiang Chi's fault
for all the late-night snacks.

112
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,093
The workload of the law department is so heavy.

113
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,930
He also has work and the basketball team.

114
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,364
Won't this be too exhausting?

115
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,899
Will he be at the practice today?

116
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,000
Did he tell me?

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,635
Or did I miss it?

118
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,878
The report is due today.

119
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,179
If I'm late, it's all over.

00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,152

Stop kicking me.

125
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,613
I thought you wouldn't come today.

126
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,448
I did send you a message.

127
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,983
I forgot to bring my phone.

128
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,087
Buxia, Jiang Chi just came in.

129
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,121
You're his regular partner.

130
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,122
Cultivate some tacit understanding.

131
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,857
No problem.

132
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,125
And also,

133
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,828
in order for your
tacit understanding to get better,

134
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,998
you'll be washing Jiang Chi's
basketball uniform and towel.

135
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,099
Me?

136
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,834
Yes, and wash it by hand.

137
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,102
Why?

138
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,803
I don't even wash mine.

139
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,805
Why should I be responsible for his?

140
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,045
You think I can accept

141
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,180
my clothes being washed with everyone else's?

142
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,316
I joined the basketball team for you.

143
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,784
Washing my clothes by hand,

144
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:12,852
is it that hard?

145
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,311
Nice.

146
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,546
Let's go.

147
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,784
Yes, that shoot just now was amazing.

148
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,519
Super cool. Awesome.

149
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,454
- Was I cool just now?
- You have potential.

150
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:01,267
Thanks.

00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,737
You two make a good team.

152
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,973
One look, and you know what it means.

153
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,108
Captain, it's because we don't live together

154
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,743
that our understanding is a little bit off.

155
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,144
Your flaw is

156
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,746
you're too good at finding excuses.

157
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,648
You can start living together from today.

158
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,949
Wouldn't it improve your understanding?

159
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,351
- Right.
- Yes, that could work.

160
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,685
Why are you drinking our water?

161
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:20,786
Your water is over there.

162
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,788
It's all the same. His is better to drink.

163
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,548
Gu Buxia.

164
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,495
Alright, Gu Buxia. Enough.

165
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,796
Who cares?

166
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,988
I thought number 11 was already taken.

167
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,473
Why do you have it?

168
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,711
You like Slam Dunk.

169
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,245
You're number 10,

170
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,980

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,464
<i>♫ Spreading endlessly ♫</i>

184
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:29,888
<i>♫ Your face and your eyes ♫</i>

185
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:34,671
<i>♫ Your sadness and your joy ♫</i>

186
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:40,702
<i>♫ Are all engraved in my heart ♫</i>

187
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,573
<i>Everyone is so good at imagining.</i>

188
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,475
<i>They are really taking secret photos.</i>

189
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,880
<i>Jiang Chi is also taking secret photos.</i>

190
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,473
What's wrong with me?

191
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,775
Is this a move between brothers?

192
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:10,910
I didn't drink,

193
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,711
and I slept well.

194
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,215
So what got over me?

195
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,085
He kissed me, but why didn't I dodge?

196
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,490
Why didn't you dodge when he kissed you?

197
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,226
I thought I could absorb more energy to store.

198
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,029
In case he suddenly disappears
for a long time like last time.

199
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,864
But why did your heart beat faster?

200
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,266
Your hand went up,
and even your mouth puckered up?

201
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,635
As an ordinary person being kissed like that,

202
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,270
you can't help but get involved, right?

203
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,039
And if my heart didn't beat,

204
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,674
I'd be dead.

205
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,509
People are saying you're dating.

206
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,044
Why don't you explain?

207
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,845
He did explain.

208
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,914
He said we're not dating,

209
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,482
we're just together,

210
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,951
living together.

211
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,254
He's so busy, and he still takes care of you.

212
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,789
He joined the basketball team for you.

213
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,724
Don't you feel guilty?

214
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,025
Why not just tell him directly

215
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,994
that you're afraid of hearing
the voice of the ghosts?

216
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,264
I'm afraid he'll think I'm using him.

217
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,633
What if he gets angry?

218
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,243
Continue, dribbling between the legs.

219
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,645
Morning.

220
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,981
Later, we'll practice dribbling.

221
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,484
I don't need to warm up.
I ran here this morning.

222
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,685
Really?

223
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,256
Hey.

224
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,425
Are you really with Jiang Chi?

225
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,395
Don't listen to their nonsense.

226
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,164
We're just roommates and teammates.

227
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,266
Is that so?

228
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,568
I've known you since junior high,

229
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,003
and I've never seen you so clingy to anyone.

230
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,005
Me?

231
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,873
There are reasons for all of that.

232
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,075
Then tell me,

233
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,710
what's going on between you and Jiang Chi?

234
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,146
It's just that we're living together,

235
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,481
and we're just close.

236
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,084
In those photos, it looks like
you guys are in a relationship.

237
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,887
You guys are too much.

238
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,689
We're both men.

239
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,159
I really don't know what you guys are thinking.

240
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,160
Please.

241
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,928
There's no gender difference in love.

242
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,097
- Right?
- Yeah.

243
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,200
Besides, the Ice Face is only nice to you.

244
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,302
Anyone with eyes can see that, okay?

245
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,404
If you don't have feelings for him,

246
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,605
why would he throw himself at you?

247
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,939
What are you talking about?

248
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,275
It's all because you guys forced me
to get him on the team.

249
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,445
And you said, if he doesn't join,
you won't let me play.

250
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,580
Otherwise, I don't even
have time to play games,

251
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,716
why would I bother talking to him?

252
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,951
So you treated him well
just to trick him into the team?

253
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,857
Thank you for your hard work

254
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,559
and so much sacrifice for the team.

255
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,729
It's not exactly like that.

256
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,053
<i>Where are you?</i>

257
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,922

Don't be angry.

268
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,373
Angry about what?

269
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,675
About you were only nice to me
to trick me into joining the team?

270
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,512
I just said that earlier because I was afraid

271
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,113
they would spread rumors.

272
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,351
I admit

273
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,454
getting you into the basketball team
was to realize the captain's dream

274
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,556
of winning a few games before he graduates.

275
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,925
What does other people's dream
have to do with you?

276
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,860
You're always glued to me and hugging me.

277
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,295
Even if I kissed you, you didn't turn away.

278
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,863
It was all for the basketball team?

279
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:29,001
I'm so sorry that you had
to sacrifice so much for the team.

280
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,370
I like sticking with you

281
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,239
because I feel comfortable with you.

282
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,807
Can you be clear?

283
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,342
Don't leave me hanging.

284
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,577
I like you.

285
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,579
Don't say you don't feel it.

286
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,251
I… I…

287
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,553

You.

I'll explain clearly

301
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,104
that you and I, have nothing

322
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,281
I just wanted to not hear the ghost's voice,

so I approached him.

324
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,217
Enough with the gifts.

325
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,952

326
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,888

327
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,974
You really like me, right?

328
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:40,492
No matter why I approached you,

329
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,594
or whether I hid things from you,

330
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,596
you'd still like me, right?
