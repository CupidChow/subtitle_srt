00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,578
Do you have anything to say
to your special person?

2
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,028
Tell me.

3
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,697
What do you want with me?

4
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,471
Here's the thing.

5
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:42,475
Do you have time to join the basketball team?

6
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,644
That way, we'd have more chances to interact

7
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:45,945
And more opportunities

8
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,447
to get to know each other.

9
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,785
You want to spend more time with me.

10
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,189
So you got close to me
just to get me to join the basketball team?

11
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,225
No.

12
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,395
Mainly I want to have more time

13
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,863
to be with you,

14
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,500
and the basketball team needs you too.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,170
Also, the basketball team offers subsidies.

16
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,272
You need money, don't you?

17
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,573
What do you say?

18
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,943
You mentioned so many benefits
of joining the basketball team,

19
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,778
if I spend so much time with you,

20
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,313
what's in it for me?

21
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,249
Spending time with me?

22
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,584
You're spending time with me?

23
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,121
If I'm so special to you,

24
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,756
let's see your actions.

25
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:36,529
Actions?

26
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,098
What kind of actions?

27
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,114
You're so tall,

28
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,582
but your sense of balance isn't great.

29
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,989
Don't mess with my head.

30
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,024
That's a right reserved for my family.

31
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,526
Where are you going?

32
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,362
To work.

33
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,965
Working at this late hour?

34
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,968
I'll be alone in the dorm.

35
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,112
Weren't you quite comfortable
being alone before?

36
00:02:18,112 --> 00:02:19,239
But...

37
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,673
Go to bed early.

38
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,585
Fine, so be it!

39
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,120
I don't care.

Get up if you can hear me.

54
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,589
Don't be so fierce.

55
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,557
Maybe he only hears us occasionally?

56
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,062
Kid, be a conscientious person.

57
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,697
Don't pretend to be deaf.

58
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:55,268
You, my friend,
are really good at playing dumb.

59
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,403
How about we let him see us?

60
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,023
Hello?

61
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,625
When will you be back?

62
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,712
Why?

63
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,794
I...

64
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:22,962
I'm hungry.

65
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:23,997
What do you want to eat?

66
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,766
Barbecue, crispy fried chicken.

67
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,934
And shaved ice

68
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,335
Wait for me for 20 minutes.

69
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,118
I can't quit having late-night snacks.

70
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,486
Is it like not being able to quit

71
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,421
the bad habit of wanting to see someone?

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,126
Buxia.

73
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,228
Gu Buxia.

74
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,896
How are you and Jiang Chi?

75
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,998
Are you getting along well?

76
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,334
Shaking your head, what does that mean?

77
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,602
Buxia?

78
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,240
Gu Buxia.

79
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,008
This girl is cute.

80
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,313
The worst part of being a ghost
is not being able to get laid.

81

The Monitor is coming.

82
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,617
He secretly likes you.

89
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,271
Why were you so eager to have me back?

90
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,811
I can't say

91
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,946
that I use him as a tool to not hear ghosts.

92
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,517
Since he started it,

93
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,619
I shouldn't be the one who removes the veil.

94
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,753
According to the the materials,

95
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,589
I need to give the confessor some confidence.

96
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,427
You asked when I was coming back

97
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,995
because you missed me?

98
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:13,332
No.

99
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,735
I was just too bored alone in the dorm.

100
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,937
And I was hungry,

101
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,439
so I asked when you'd be back.

102
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,879
What happened to your hand?

103
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,048
It's nothing.

104
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,900
Got burnt by a pot at work.

105
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,685
Did you put it under running cold water?

106
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,525
Didn't you study medicine before?

107
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,927
Why didn't you address the burn?

108
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,130
I was waiting for Gu Buxia to take care of me.

109
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,273
Have you never been injured

110
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,708
or has no one helped you?

111
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,079
Both my parents are doctors.

112
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,414
They've never had time for me
since I was little.

113
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,250
I'd just deal with injuries myself.

114
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,786
How can you just deal with it?

115
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,987
When I was a kid and got hurt,

116
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,589
Grandpa would help me like this.

117
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,991
He said boys still need to be taken care of.

118
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,527
After all, our bodies are given by our parents.

119
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,001
What about your parents?

120
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,871
They left when I was young.

121
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,006
My sister and I were raised by our grandpa.

122
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,244
Right, I'll take you to our family temple
when there's a chance.

123
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,863
You really have a lot of these charms.

124
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,467
Because I was afraid of ghosts
when I was little,

125
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,168
and Grandpa would prepare a lot for me.

126
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,005
You study medicine and law,

127
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,573
so you won't believe in these things.

128
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,019
I'm always here if you need me.

129
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,231
You're really kind to your classmates.

130
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,433
Sorry, I used to think you were annoying.

131
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:31,971
I don't do it for others.

132
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,072
And there's no need.

133
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,711
I'm always here if you need me.

134
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,347
I don't do it for others.

135
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,481
And there's no need to.

136
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,590
Why are you here so early today?

137
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,692
You look like you could use more sleep.

138
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,694
You didn't stay up all night
working on a report like me, did you?

139
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,233
If I'm so special to you,

140
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,801
let's see your actions.

141
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,375
Don't ask, or you'd be too touched.

142
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,076
That was mine.

143
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,645
You can go buy another one.

144
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,169
You're up.

145
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,871
Come and have breakfast.

146
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,345
Come, please have a seat.

147
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,385
Fill up your stomach before running.

148
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,054
Don't drink iced milk anymore.

149
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,356
Here, have some hot soy milk.

150
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,995
Here, please drink.

151
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,538
You ate the breakfast
I specially bought for you,

152
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,939
so don't forget to leave a five-star review.

153
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,374

to join the basketball team.

155
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,658
Didn't you say you were moving out?

156
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,126
My senior plans to move back home.

157
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,729
This house is pretty good
and can be rented directly.

158
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,896
You should think about it.

159
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:11,968
Thank you.

160
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,380
You came to find me.

161
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,085
Lunch.

162
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,520
After eating, have a conscience.

163
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,921
The basketball team is waiting for you.

164
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,727
You actually get along well with Gu Buxia.

165
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,646
He even brought lunch for you.

166
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:45,731
Why would you use the word "actually"?

167
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,335
Everyone says you two don't get along.

168
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,371
But there is a group of people
who genuinely believe

169
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,240
that you love each other.

170
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,475
Luckily, you appeared together
yesterday to clarify.

171
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,743
And those photos.

172
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,179
They've completely gone viral on the internet.

173
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,280
Let me show you.

174
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,916
This is your group chat.

176
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,920
Don't mind.

177
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,829
Although I initially wanted you to move out,

178
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,798
you don't have to now.

179
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,201
Besides, where outside is as convenient
and cheap as the dormitory?

180
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,549
You should ask him for a coffee chat someday.

181
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,419
Are you close to him?

182
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,371
The definition of special is special,

183
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,374
just like how I feel about you.

184
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,310
But you can actually smile like that at others,

185
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,345
and only give me a poker face.

186
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,582
Are you happier to be with others than with me?

187
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,051
You're so flirty.

188
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,019
His face is so serious.

189
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,055
I told you to find Buxia.

190
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,058
He was angry in the afternoon
and let us find him ourselves.

191
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,296
Your basketball team is short of people.

192
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,733
But your performance is poor.

193
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,304
That's why we wanted to find you.

194
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,374
Our team's performance is just slightly worse.

195
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,542
But we have great potential.

196
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,445
If it weren't for Gu Buxia...

197
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,750
Gu Buxia was originally admitted

198
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,184
because of basketball.

199
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:22,054
But the rest of us are terrible.

200
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,690
And our senior will graduate soon.

201
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,058
So I thought that before that,

202
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,193
I'd better find someone to partner with Buxia

203
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,262
so that he can continue to soar

204
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,730
on the basketball court he loves.

205
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,767
I have a condition.

206
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,663
What was so interesting on the phone?

207
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,265
Laughing so happily.

208
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,550
What good stuff are you looking at?

209
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,655
We're both men. Share.

210
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,525
Stingy.

211
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,693
Fine, I won't look.

212
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,582
Are you in a mood?

213
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,485
You can tell?

214
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,921
After all, you usually
jump around like a monkey.

215
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,967
I know my daily habits aren't great,

216
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,636
and my attitude to you is sometimes too casual.

217
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,304
However,

218
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,307
you don't regret living
in the same dormitory with me, do you?

219
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:25,344
No.

220
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,048
I thought you were moving out.

221
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,050
You saw it at noon.

222
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,655
When I just moved in,

223
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,490
didn't you want me
to find accommodation outside?

224
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,063
But I don't have money.

225
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,898
What's more,

226
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,436
I got used to living with you after a while.

227
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,341
Actually,

228
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,178
I really like you.

229
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,783
Even though I hated you at first.

230
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,319
You like me?

231
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,523
Don't get me wrong.

232
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,159
I just really like being with you,

233
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,130
and doing things together.

234
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,472
Do you really want me
to join the basketball team with you?

235
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,582
Come with me to a place first.

236
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,096
Thank you, guys.

237
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,197
Thanks.

238
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,248
I'll treat you to dinner another day.

239
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:55,117
- Alright.
- Bye.

240
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:56,288
Let's go.

241
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,106
"Come with me to a place".

242
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,775
So you tricked me
into helping your senior paint.

243
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,919
Are you close with her?

244
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,057
Jealous?

245
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,467
Her boyfriend asked me for help.

246
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,902
There's money in it.

247
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,203
I'll treat you to a meal.

248
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,337
Then I want half.

249
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,707
I'll transfer it to you when we get back.

250
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,481
Why is mine red?

251
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,849
Because it came with the blue one.

252
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,023
Wearing this kind of helmet
while riding a heavy motorcycle.

253
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,591
Isn't that ridiculous?

254
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,026
It's fine if the person is handsome.

255
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,463
If it weren't for the sentimental value
of this bike,

256
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,332
I would have sold it
for living expenses long ago.

257
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,535
Did your parents really cut off
your financial support?

258
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,636
What?

259
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:05,804
You want to sponsor me?

260
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,472
I don't have money.

261
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,175
But in the future, when you work part-time,
you can take me with you.

262
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,744
So half of the payments
count as me sponsoring you.

263
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,297
Didn't you say you would give me a reward?

264
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,565
You want a reward?

265
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,076
Gu Buxia.

266
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,377
You're trying so hard

267
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,878
to get Jiang Chi on the team.

268
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,215
I'm so touched.

269
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,152
Wait, why are those two so close?

270
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,623
So this is Jiang Chi's type.

271
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,858
My Buxia.

272
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,560
Is he finally coming out?

273
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:11,111
The Deadlock CP original photo.

274
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:13,504
Place your bet on who's the top
and who's the bottom.

275
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:36,034
♫ Don't leave me stranded in a sea of people ♫

276
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:40,962
♫ Crying for help on an island of memories ♫

277
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:44,695
♫ I don't want anyone to find out ♫

278
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:48,738
♫ But just want you to hear me ♫

279
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:50,914
♫ I miss you ♫

280
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:54,460
♫ Like a burning fire ♫

281
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,922
♫ Breaking taboos and boundaries ♫

282
00:21:57,922 --> 00:22:01,954
♫ Spreading endlessly ♫

283
00:22:02,498 --> 00:22:06,498
♫ You hear that, don't you? ♫

284
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:10,146
♫ I finally get it now♫

285
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:16,482
♫ What I never said to you ♫

286
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:22,946
♫ Answer me if you can hear me ♫

287
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,530
♫ Okay? ♫

288
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,640
(Stay by My Side)

289
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,760
It's all your fault.

290
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,817
Your movements caused misunderstandings.

291
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,819
How about we sleep together again tonight?

292
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:34,853
No way.

293
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,922
It's only the second day
without being with Jiang Chi.

294
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,190
And my quota dropped so fast.

295
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,257
When he's back,

296
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,893
I'll see what your guys have to say.

297
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,494
Did you not sleep well without me?

298
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,596
You're finally back.

299
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,932
Let me, as your roommate, make up for it.
