So scary.

3
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,405

00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,853
will announce our thoughts

8
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,755
after watching a horror movie in dorm room A04.

9
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,390
It's everyone's duty to dispel superstition.

10
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,591
Come in and have a look.

11
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,061
- The most timid one is here.
- Here.

12
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,464
What? It's just a trip to the toilet.

13
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,498
You look like you've seen a ghost.

14
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:06,533
What's wrong?

15
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,502

18
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:15,942
- Accompany me to the toilet.
- What?

19

<i>The one that scared you
was that evil ghost last time.</i>

20
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,351
<i>The resentment was so heavy.</i>

21
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,288
<i>Anyway, his attitude was bad
and he didn't play by the rules.</i>

22
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,257
<i>If he wasn't scaring people sick,
he was causing accidents.</i>

23

<i>Don't be alone recently.</i>

24
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,584
<i>At least when you faint…</i>

25
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,778
Have you been diligent lately?

26
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,881
You have that international mock court debate.

27
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,282
How are you preparing?

28
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,550
No problem.

29
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,785
I will absolutely make you proud.

That's great.

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,456
Do you want a reward for that?

32
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,930
I always reward you.

33
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,532
Why don't you reward me?

34
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,438
Does Senior Buxia know
that the live broadcast is still on?

35

Let's get through this first.

37
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,810
Can we have this kind of reward every day?

38
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,379
That depends on your performance.

39
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,715
Was the ghost movie good?

40
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,383
It doesn't even come close to you.

41
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,886
In my eyes, you are the best.

42
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,591
Why did you lose so much weight?

43
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,493
I was waiting for you to come back.

44
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,295
I'm starving.

45
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,297
I had to work.

46
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,465
It's all my fault.

47
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,133
I didn't feed you enough.

48
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,504
Yeah, I did lose some weight.

49
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,806

we were on a live broadcast.

00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,659

00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,661
it could be a way to train our courage.

90

It's your birth year, month, day, and time.

91
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,241
You asked me how heavy
my 'Eight Characters' are.

92
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,776
How should I calculate it?

93
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,512
There's a table you can refer to.

94
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,782
The lightest is 2.1 Liang.
It means extremely bad luck.

95
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,317
The heaviest is 7.1 Liang.

96
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,686
It means great ambitions and unstoppable will.

97
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,591
Why are you asking me this?

98
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,660
Just curious.

99
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,898
Tell me the truth.

100
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,033
Did my sister say something to you last time?

101
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,570
Your sister didn't say anything to me.

102
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,240
Don't get fooled by my sister
with whatever she's planning.

103
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,242
You can't casually tell your 'Eight Characters'
to anyone, understand?

104
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,010
I really want to understand.

105
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,111
Jiang Chi,

106
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,814
there's someone looking for you,
and she said she was your fiancée.

107
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,920
Who…

108
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,034
are you?

109
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,203
I'm Bao Bao.

110
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,771
Bao Bao?

111
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,339
Which Bao would that be?

112
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,208
When I was a child, your parents
gave me this necklace

113
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,709
and we were engaged. Did you forget?

114
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,250
When I was a child, you fed me pudding,

115
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,452
told me stories,

116
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,986
and told me not to cry.

117
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,858
I remember now,

118
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,426
you were two years old.

119
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,295
You fell and broke your front tooth.

120
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,864
Although my mom jokingly proposed a marriage,

121
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,632
she was scolded by my dad later.

122
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,001
He said you were too young,
afraid you'd grow up wrong,

123
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,504
so we shouldn't make random promises.

124
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,940
I've just returned from abroad,

125
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,224
and your mom told you to take care of me.

126
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:57,677
What are you studying?

127
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,145
Fashion trends.

128
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,913
What can a law student

129
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,381
like me teach you?

130
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,091
If my mom asks, just tell her,

131
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,626
I am seeing someone.

132
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,727
You have a girlfriend?

133
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,729
No, I have a boyfriend.

134
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,639
She was only two years old at the time.

135
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,474
Why do you remember it so clearly?

136
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,044
I have a good memory. I can't help it.

137
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,847
Then do you want to think harder?

138
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,750
I'm afraid next time someone
will pour water on me directly.

139
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,087
If there really is,

140
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,189
it could only be my mom.

141
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,557
At that time, you just retort and tell her

142
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,125
that you are my boyfriend.

143
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,873
What's the matter?

144
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,046
I will not let you face my mom.

145
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,583
Jiang Chi.

146
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,586
Your parents will definitely oppose us.

147
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,856
I don't want you to fall out
with them because of me,

148
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,125
but I also can't accept you marrying others

149
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,826
while dating me.

150
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,398
What's got into your head?

151
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,900
Shall we ask your sister to perform a ritual

152
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,402
and bind us together?

153
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,473
Whoever changes his heart first
won't be able to be erected.

154
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,708
Do you dare to do it?

155
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:41,514
Why are you laughing?

156
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,949
I was being serious.

157
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,522
So, what you're saying is

158
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,558
if I write his 'Eight Characters'
and press it with mine,

159
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,726
it should do it, right?

160
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,028
<i>Yep, it helps to prevent fickleness.</i>

161
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,666
But what if it's removed one day?

162
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,702
Would it be like this never happened?

163
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,974
At such a young age, you want to be
a jerk and abandon someone?

164
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,375
No.

165
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,043
What I meant was,

166
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,678
if one day he doesn't like me anymore,

167
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,046
then so be it.

168
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,514
I don't want to be clingy.

169
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,816
I can return his 'Eight Characters',

170
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,051
and just forget about it.

171
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,287
You might as well just go with the flow

172
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,022
and have a casual relationship.

173
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,091
But I'm not willing to give up.

174
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,626
He's got such good conditions.

175
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,129
You're being paranoid and dramatic.

176
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,632
Anyway, if his 'Eight Characters'
and yours are pressed together,

177
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,534
apart from the effect of binding you together,

178
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:39,005
<i>it also ensures Jiang Chi's safety
and well-being.</i>

179
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,032
How about that?

180
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,710
I mean Jiang Chi is basically family now.

181
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,379
So if his is with yours,

182
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,748
our ancestors can bless them together.

183
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,051
<i>Okay, if you don't want it, forget it.</i>

184
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,519
<i>Make up your mind.</i>

185
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,254
<i>I have to go now. Bye.</i>

186
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,465
Hey, what's wrong?

187
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,108
Are you okay?

188
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,510
Were you hurt?

189
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:19,545
Is it serious?

190
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,348
I'm fine. I just twisted my wrist.

191
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,150
Your classmate called me
and said you had an accident.

192
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,951
I was scared to death.

193
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,656
Is your motorcycle okay?

194
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:31,691
Did you break anything?

195
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,925
I was carrying things today,

196
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,393
so I borrowed a scooter from a classmate.

197
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,995
There's just a minor scratch.

198
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,800
That's good to know.

199
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,737
Are you more concerned about me getting hurt

200
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,272
or about the bike needing repairs?

201
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,175
Motorcycles are expensive.

202
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,777
I'm afraid if it breaks down and need repairs,

203
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,312
you'll either have to work more,

204
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,381
or bow down to your parents.

205
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,983
But I can't bear either of these.

206
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:01,087
And I don't have much money.

207
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,730
My parents never cared about my thoughts.

208
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,132
They only force me to do what they want.

209
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,136
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,406
I can't get their approval now.

211
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,575
But if they come to trouble me again,

212
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,009
I promise,

213
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,711
I'll definitely stand by your side.

214
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,190
Does your sister's temple have
anything that can keep me safe?

215
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,526
or should I go there and light a candle?

216
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,797
Since when did you become so superstitious?

217
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,198
Because I want you to be at ease.

218
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,903
If you sweet-talk others and I found out,

219
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,671
I will definitely cut you off.

220
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:53,806
You're going to cut me off?

221
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,374
Then I'll cut you off.

222
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,209
You wish you could.

223
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,611
Come on.

224
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,678
You're about to cut me off,

225
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,846
so why should I kiss you?

226
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,715
Give me a kiss, hurry up.

227
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,186
Did you write this?

228
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,989
Compared to him,

229
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,558
my handwriting is better than Jiang Chi's.

230
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,994
I'm afraid the gods will mistake it.

231
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,497
(Have you done it?)

232
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,871
Have you done everything you needed to do?

233
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,576
What needs to be done?

234
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,643
Well,

235
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,312
a sincere heart.

236
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,081
Don't treat this as a game.

237
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,087
Sister, you seem to be blabbing
more and more nowadays.

238
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,256
Come to the middle.

239
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,497
I hope to bless the person I love

240
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,066
to be safe and healthy in this life.

241
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:13,056
<i>[Peaceful Praying]</i>

242
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,232
Sis.

243
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,104
Thank you for entrusting Buxia to me.

244
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:36,969
What do you mean entrusting?

245
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,837
It's more like custody, OK?

246
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,039
Let me tell you.

247
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,140
Xia might appear

248
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,375
dumb and easy to bully,

249
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,644
but if you dare to treat him badly one day,

250
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,246
Senior and I will

251
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,615
make your life a living hell.

252
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,420
By the way,

253
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,057
this peace charm is for you.

254
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,058
Just to protect you a bit.

255
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,726
I don't know if it will help.

256
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,830
Thanks

257
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,065
for taking care of my brother.

258
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,709
I am doing it for myself.

259
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,613
because I want to be able to protect him

260
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:22,848
even when I'm not around

261
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,383
or paying attention.

262
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,787
Actually, it's not that serious.

263
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,956
He will get used to it, don't…

264
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,558
But I don't want him to get used to it.

265
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,520
He doesn't need to.

266
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,944
Don't say such touching things.

267
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,214
They say rappers singing love songs are deadly.

268
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,318
Facial paralysis guys like you
talking about love is quite powerful too.

269
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,394
Grandpa,

270
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,996
don't worry.

271
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,466
Someone will help to take care of Buxia.

272
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,636
You must bless them.

273
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,388
What were you and my sister
talking about just now?

274
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,856
I find that every time we come back,

275
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,192
you two are whispering behind my back.

276
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,197
The road ahead is still very long.

277
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,532
Gu Buxia,

278
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,966
are you willing to go with me?

279
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,316
Can you not draw such difficult
patterns in the future?

280
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,185
I was trembling as I engraved them.

281
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,569
I'm not good at sweet talk,

282
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,784
but,

283
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,775
thank you for letting me hear your voice.

284
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,414
Gu Buxia,

285
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,549
you are really not meant for serious talk.

286
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,586
Jiang Chi,

287
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,687
I won't say

288
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,388
these things to you even if you beg me.

321
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:48,440
in case of an emergency,
we can come to you first.

322
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,809
I've been waiting for a while.

323
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,579
Could you kindly relay this for me?

324
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,018
- Let's go.
- Sure.

325
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,820
What took you so long?

326
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,622
I just went to buy something for you.

What did you buy?

328
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,824
Guess.

00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,826
Chocolate milk?

330
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,129
I didn't fall asleep in class just now.

331
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,165
There is nothing to brag
about not falling asleep in class.

332
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,767
It's me. I rarely stay awake.

333
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,602
Shouldn't I be rewarded for that?

334
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,624
Alright.

335
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,541
What do you think we should eat next?

336
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,642
It depends on what you want to eat.
