00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,945
Hello, what's wrong?

2
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,014
Sis, has the seal been broken?

3
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,016
Broken?

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,284
I had a fever after I came back yesterday.

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,419
And then today, I started to hear

6
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,087
some strange noises

7
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,390
whispering in my ears.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,126
Also, my protective amulet is broken.

9
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,612
Buxia, did you say you can hear them now?

10
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,948
Just calm down first.

11
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,651
Grandpa said whoever takes over the temple
has to be responsible for it.

12
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,952
We all know you're scared,

13
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,321
so I volunteered to do it.

14
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,624
I burned my talisman last night.

15
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,660
Now, I can hear, see, and talk to them.

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,895
And?

17
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,031
You burned yours, but mine's still sealed.

18
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,367
Didn't Senior help strengthen my seal?

19
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,688
I burned my talisman to unseal it,

20
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:11,771
but...

21
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,240
But what? Be more specific.

22
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,012
I accidentally burned a tiny part of yours.

23
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,613
Really just a little bit.

24
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,415
I thought it wouldn't cause any major problems.

25
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,750
Anyway, just hang in there for now.

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,151
Pretend like you're listening

27
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,487
to ghost stories in a podcast.

28
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,689
At least you can only hear them
and not see them right now.

29
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,192
I will figure something out.

30
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,426
Wait for me.

31
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,799
I'm so cold.

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,901
So cold.

33
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,807
I want to redress my grievances.
I want revenge.

34
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:55,840

48
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,113
Please. I'm going crazy just hearing it.

49
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,781
Please don't let me see it.

50
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,650
Save me.

51
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,268
There's a ghost.

52
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,636
Why are you hiding here to scare me?

53
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,637
You're the ghost, aren't you?

54
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,216
Help!

55
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,939
Can you tell me your birth date and time?

56
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,876
It's okay if you don't want to say it.

57
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,912
Just tell me how heavy
your 'Eight Characters' are.

58
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:12,385
Those sounds...

59
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,387
Strange.

60
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,522
When I touched him,

61
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,258
those sounds disappear.

62
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,562
Why does it have to be him?

63
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,907
He must think I'm crazy.

64
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,610
If I were him,

65
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,678
I'd probably kick him out.

66
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,087
You said it gets cold
when the ghost sounds appear,

67
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,355
but when you touched your roommate,

68
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,924
the sounds disappeared and it got warm.

69
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,092
I've tried a few times,

70
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,594
and it seems to be true.

71
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,696
How heavy are his 'Eight Characters'?

72
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,930
I asked him,

73
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,916
but he just looked at me like I was crazy.

74
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,202
You should try a few more times
to see the effect.

75
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,538
This makes me look like a pervert.

76
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,407
Alright.

77
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,726
I'll find a chance to try again.

78
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,778
Luckily, I only burned a corner of it.

79
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,448
To prevent you from seeing what you shouldn't,

80
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,252
just stick close to your roommate for now.

81
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,088
Sis, you made this mess,

82
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,890
hurry up and fix it.

83
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,491
Sis.

84
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,954
This is for you to give to Jiang Chi.

85
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,223
You can't eat it yourself.

86
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,790
(You haven't touched
the money in your account.)

87
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,058
(How did you register?)

88
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,311
Don't worry about me.

89
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,263
I won't do anything illegal.

90
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,498
You won't lose face.

91
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,700

92
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,036

93
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,404
You followed me?

94
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,540
You watch too many TV dramas.

95
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,309
People might think I did something wrong.

96
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,047
(What's wrong with being a doctor?)

97
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,282
(Why study law?)

98
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,902
(Your brother and sister
are already capable on their own.)

99
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:00,219
(Isn't that enough?)

100
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,688
If you have medical disputes in the future,

101
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,190
I won't charge you.

102
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,179
Actually, he's quite cute
when he's not being sarcastic.

103
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,614
Not as cute as me though.

104
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,750
No wonder some people would give him snacks,

105
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,872
but not me.

106
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:44,597
What?

107
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,003
Why would you scare people
with your small courage?

108
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,005
You're the one with small courage.

109
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,007
I wanted to surprise you.

110
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,747
It's rare to meet you

111
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,749
when you're not on your way to work or class.

112
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,053
This is for you.

113
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,058
A female classmate asked me to give it to you.

114
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,159
It's not from me.

115
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,293
I don't want it.

116
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,296
If you don't want it, then I'll eat it.

117
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,466
It's a nice gift from a girl.

118
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,101
Just accept it with gratitude.

119
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,103
I don't want to be misunderstood.

120
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,405
Then I'll really eat it.

121
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,427
Translating English to Chinese, huh?

122
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,830
Are you doing a new part-time job
or just reading?

123
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,378
My sister always says I have a loose mouth.

124
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,986
You can go back to work.

125
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,187

131
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,600

Gathering in the morning,

143
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:16,435
- What are you looking at?
- (I miss it so much.)

144
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,104
- Looking at some collected photos.
- (I used to...)

145
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,139
- Watching you guys interact.
- (have such photos as well.)

146
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,541
(Getting along so well is nice.)

147

148
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,048
- What do you think of this set of photos?
- (Too close.)

149
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:27,079
- Cool, right?
- (Perhaps he...)"

150
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,214
- Everyone likes them a lot.
- (can't hear.)"

151
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,216
(This guy Jiang is so full of positive energy.)

152
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,619
(Should we think of a way to drive him away?)

153
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,689
(Jiang.)

154
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,857
- What are all these?
- (Gu.)"

155
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,526
(These two are so close again.)

156
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,694
This can't be.

157
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,293
You're really special to me.

158
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,952
How did I just hug him like that?

159
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,020
What if he thinks

160
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,488
I want to try something?

161
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,678
What do you mean by that?

162
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:51,764
What do you mean?

163
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,332
You said I'm special to you.

164
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,700
How special?

165
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,370
Why is that?

166
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,815
Can you not get so close to me so casually?

167
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,590
Jiang Chi, wait a moment.

168
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,592
What's up?

169
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,228
About joining the basketball team,

170
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,997
do you really not want to reconsider?

171
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,231
I told you, I don't have the time.

172
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,669
I thought since you live with Buxia,

173
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,037
you two should have a tacit understanding.

174
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,274
Are you close to him?

175
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:09,875
Of course.

176
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,177
Our team is like a family.

177
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,648
Can I ask you a question?

178
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,650
As long as it's about the basketball team,

179
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,817
you can ask me.

180
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,320
It's a personal question.

181
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,457
I have a friend,

182
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,093
who's always being harassed
by someone in various ways.

183
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,631
He finds all kinds of reasons to be around him,

184
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,333
often stares at him,

185
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,870
and even touches him
intentionally or unintentionally.

186
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,973
Didn't your friend fight him back?

187
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,811
Then it's not harassment.

188
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,214
It should be considered

189
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,484
body language that shows affection.

190
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,092
Besides physical contact,

191
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,493
did he say anything else?

192
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:05,097
He said he was very special.

193
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,132
Then I get it.

194
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,369
Affection at first sight,
wanting to stay together,

195
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,972
it's the special person in one's life.

196
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,640
Just wait a little longer.

197
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,011
He will start to play hard to get,

198
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,448
waiting for someone to confess first.

199
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,117
Where did confession come from?

200
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,254
Who is that friend of yours?

201
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,523
Why not just ask him out for a chat?

202
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,093
I have a class now. I'll leave first.

203
00:16:35,392 --> 00:16:36,462
Jiang Chi.

204
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,164
Please consider joining
the basketball team again.

205
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,302
For the Interschool Cup
second-round knockout match,

206
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,603
since the opponent forfeited,

207
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,105
we're confirmed to advance.

208
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,406
YES.

209
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,310
Why are you so excited
about advancing by forfeit?

210
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,012
Why don't we just forfeit too?

211
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,613
It will be an early relief.

212
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,081
So that we don't embarrass ourselves.

213
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,218
Don't be so negative.

214
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,270
Like I told you, I'm here.

215
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,056
Can you play against five people on your own?

216
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,491
My leg is injured, so I can't keep up with you.

217
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,292
Yunhao isn't accurate enough.
Baiwei isn't fast enough.

218
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,195
Others either lack experience
or have poor stamina.

219
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,560
I heard that the captain and team manager
tried to recruit Jiang Chi.

220
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,709
And then?

221
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,710
Rejected in a second.

222
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,811
It's up to you.

223
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:26,812
Me?

224
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,640
Hey.

225
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,826
You haven't answered my question
from this morning.

226
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,083
Your feelings are heating up quickly.

227
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,118
What were you two whispering about just now?

228
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,687
He did it on purpose.

229
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,955
On purpose.

230
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,457
On what purpose?

231
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,492
Intentionally making everyone
think you two get along well.

232
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,294
Please, he's Jiang Chi.

233
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,496
The famous Ice Cube Man of the law department.

234
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,932
He's not idle, right?

235
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,508
You're responsible for bringing him in.

236
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,111
You don't even know if he can play basketball.

237
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,047
He's not taller than me,
and his attitude isn't better than mine.

238
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,951
He just looks a little cooler
holding a basketball.

239
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,119
If you don't bring him in,

240
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,820
you don't need to play in the next match.

241
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,357
I...

242
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:09,214
Blackmail? Bribe? Begging?

243
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,582
If he ignores me,

244
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,718
the captain really won't let me play.

245
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,253
If you turn it on, watch it.

246
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,555
And if you aren't watching, turn it off.

247
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,069
Do you have anything to say
to your special person?

248
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,281
Can you stop staring at me like this?

249
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,749
If you weren't staring at me,

250
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,517
you wouldn't notice my looking at you.

251
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,766
The last time we arm wrestled,

252
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,668
you were so close to me and not embarrassed.

253
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,702
How come now when I get close to you,

254
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,404
you immediately turn away?

255
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,572
You were the one who came close,

256
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,073
and you're the one who's dodging.

257
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,575
Aren't you going to explain?

258
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,015
Tell me.

259
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,518
What do you want with me?

260
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,259
Actually, our fates are interestingly tied.

261
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,161
We met at the school gate.

262
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,395
Do you remember?

263
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,698
I almost bumped into you like this.

264
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,834
Later, on the basketball court,
you caught my pass

265
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,836
and made a nice shoot.

266
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,447
That's right.

267
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,783
I find it very comfortable being with you.

268
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,785
But you're so busy,

269
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,488
and we don't have classes
in the same department.

270
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,023
So I thought

271
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,426
do you have time to join the basketball team?

272
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,229
That way, we'd have more chances to interact.

273
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,530
And more opportunities

274
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,165
to get to know each other.

275
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,404
You find it comfortable being with me,

276
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,607
and you want to spend more time with me.

277
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,245
So you got close to me
just to get me to join the basketball team?

278
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,181
No.

279
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,485
Mainly I want to have more time

280
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:27,953
to be with you,

281
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,523
and the basketball team needs you too.

282
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,192
Also, the basketball team offers subsidies.

283
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,044
You need money, don't you?

284
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,496
What do you think?

285
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,999
You mentioned so many benefits
of joining the basketball team,

286
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,801
if I spend so much time with you,

287
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,036
what's in it for me?

288
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,072
Spending time with me?

289
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,707
You're spending time with me?

290
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,110
If I'm so special to you,

291
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,945
let's see your actions.

292
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:42,274
♫ Don't leave me stranded in a sea of people ♫

293
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:47,202
♫ Crying for help on an island of memories ♫

294
00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:50,935
♫ I don't want anyone to find out ♫

295
00:22:52,258 --> 00:22:54,978
♫ But just want you to hear me ♫

296
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:57,154
♫ I miss you ♫

297
00:22:57,154 --> 00:23:00,700
♫ Like a burning fire ♫

298
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,162
♫ Breaking taboos and boundaries ♫

299
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:08,194
♫ Spreading endlessly ♫

300
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:12,738
♫ You hear that, don't you? ♫

301
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:16,386
♫ I finally get it now♫

302
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:22,722
♫ What I never said to you ♫

303
00:23:25,218 --> 00:23:29,186
♫ Answer me if you can hear me ♫

304
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,770
♫ Okay? ♫

305
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,786
(Stay by My Side)

306
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,848
Are you asking me when I'll be back

307
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,384
because you miss me?

308
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:40,218
You study medicine and law,

309
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,353
so you won't believe in these things.

310
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,888
I'm always here if you need me.

311
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,623
You can actually smile like that at others,

312
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,024
but only give me a poker face.

313
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,759
You're really kind to your classmates.

314
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,860
I don't do it for others.

315
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,888
And there's no need to.

316
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,246
Actually,

317
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:52,998
I really do like you a lot.
