He gave up many activities for me.

His mother has remitted money to him,

00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,754
and it should be enough.

30
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,556
But he still wants to work,

31
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,558

Although Senior Gu is a bit sad now,

34
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,967
his words are kind of showing off, right?

35
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,201
He is showing off.

00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,870
Trying to kill us singles.

37
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:18,972
Knock it off.

00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,710
Did you see those things on the forum?

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,314
It's all my fault.

40
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,316
I made him fall from the pedestal.

41
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:35,321
I think the person involved should
stay away from the internet.

42
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,392
So you want me to contact Jiang Chi,

43
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,927
but what should I tell him?

44
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,595
I want to open my heart to him.

45
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,298
Tell him I, Gu Buxia, can't live without him.

46
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,971
I think I ate something bad.

47
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,072
You guys shouldn't eat it.

48
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,707
It's bad. You continue.

49
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,710
I think even if you look him in the eyes,

50
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,978
you won't be able to say it.

51
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,683
So I thought about telling him when I'm drunk.

52
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,819
Unfortunately, I can hold my liquor.

53
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,156
You can hold your liquor, can't you?

54
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,830
Quarrels and misunderstandings are normal.

55
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,365
Just clear things up when you have time.

56
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,173
Say it clearly.

57
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,175
Gu Buxia, if you're a man,

58
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,577
finish this bottle.

59
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,845
And then fuck Jiang Chi for all you care.

60
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,386
I mean, find Jiang Chi for all you care,

61
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,055
and clear things up.

62
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,089
Yes, that's right.

he was having a mood because
he had a fight with you.

Look at him now, he's drunk.

84
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,416
He's not as articulate as you.

85
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,984
Please be understanding.

86
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,186
He's drunk like this.

87
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,388
He drinks when he has a fight,
and I have to be understanding.

Are you sober?

99
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,005
See if you dare to do this again.

100
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,175
But you just spanked me.

101
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,647
That's because you…

102
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,949
Why did you take off your pants?

103
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,219
How can you take a bath
without taking off your pants?

104

105
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,894
You just vomited all over the place.

But in the future, there will definitely
be many trials and tribulations.

114
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,492
Don't use this move.

115
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,227
I don't like to muddle through

116
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,729
when things are not clear.

117
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,533
But you were ignoring me.

118
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,669
I wasn't ignoring you.

119
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,271
I went to lead the team.

120
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,073
And if you're angry, you should talk about it.

121
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,441
Not like this.

122
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,771
I like to throw things around

123
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,440
because it makes me feel secure.

124
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,244
But after you moved in, you kept nagging.

125
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,246
It's really annoying.

126
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,083
Later, I started to hear the voices of ghosts.

127
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,053
But as soon as I touch you,

128
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,188
those voices would disappear.

129
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,924
But I didn't have to courage to say it.

130
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,259
If I did,

131
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,394
you would think I'm acting weird.

132
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,169
Later, I got used to having you by my side.

133
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,238
Listening to your nagging is happiness.

134
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,275
Playing basketball with you is fun.

135
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,012
Seeing you on the bed makes me feel secure.

136
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,948
So when you gave me the key,

137
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,117
I was really, really happy.

138
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,620
But I'm also scared.

139
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:28,094
What if one day you don't talk to me?

140
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,498
What are you talking about?

141
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,267
You're so nice to me,

142
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,803
and I'm so dependent on you.

143
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,008
What if we break up?

144
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,851
I'll say it one last time.

145
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,419
Gu Buxia,

146
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,554
nobody can decide for me what I should do.

147
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,391
I will only be responsible for my own choices.

148
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,760
No matter what happens,

149
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,261
as long as you stay,

150
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,696
I won't leave.

151
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,771
You're mine.

152
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,273
I've made a mark, so you can't be taken away.

153
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,208
Are you a dog?

154
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,643
You bit me so hard.

155
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,082
You are mine.

156
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,750
I can do whatever I want.

162

Grandpa was right.

163
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,392
They won't hurt me.

164
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,594
They just want me to pass on some messages.

165
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,629
I'll write them down and tell my sister.

166
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,932
Anyway, when you come back,

167
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,267
I will only be hearing your voice.

00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,858
We've known each other for so long.

173
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,960
Can't you talk normally?

174
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,027
<i>I just thought</i>

175
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,497
<i>that would be more fitting to my identity.</i>

176
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,733
I've told my sister about your problems.

177
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,635
She will help you deal with them in time.

178
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,636

Being with him is not to use him.

184
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,849
I'm not that kind of person.

185
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,885
<i>I want to tell you,</i>

186
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,354
<i>some evil ghosts are not as good as us.</i>

187
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,289
<i>They might try to harm you.</i>

188
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,192
What evil ghosts?

189
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,927
And why would they harm me for no reason?

190
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,297
Don't gang up to bully me.

191
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,821
Why is the water heater getting worse?

192
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:07,395
<i>[Jiang Chi]</i>

193
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,268
Are you in pain anywhere?

194
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,842
Someone scared me when I was taking a bath,

195
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:39,111
so I accidentally slipped
and bumped into something.

196
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,848
Who brought me back?

197
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,885
I'm so embarrassed.

198
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,621
I was all soapy at the time.

199
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,922
It scared me to death.

200
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,391
If I hadn't come back and looked for you,

201
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
you would have been seen by others already.

202
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,695
It's okay.

203
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,597
I wasn't very smart to begin with,

204
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,165
so I'm not afraid of getting stupid.

205
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,439
<i>Jiang Chi, where's my little brother?</i>

206
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,208
He just fainted in the bathroom,

207
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,576
and I had the school doctor look at him.

208
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,111
<i>He should be fine.</i>

209
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,447
<i>He said someone scared him, so he slipped.
What happened?</i>

210
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,616
It seems like you've been calling him a lot.

211
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,318
I'm not sure either.

212
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,020
Just now, the talisman
that Grandpa sealed for him

213
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,588
<i>had a crack on it.</i>

214
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,323
So I thought I'd give him a call,

215
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,592
afraid something might happen to him.

216
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,227
Do you have any other options?

217
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,596
I can't be with him 24/7.

218
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,933
There seems to be a solution.

219
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,200
You should take him back for now.

220
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,545
Jiang Chi, wait for me here,

221
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:47,746
I need to buy something for my sister.

222
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:48,981
I'll be back soon.

223
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,526
Luckily, only a little corner was burnt.

224
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,895
Buxia can now hear but not see.

225
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,565
But this crack…

226
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,167
I'm afraid it won't hold.

227
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,708
But I looked at the documents left by Grandpa,

228
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,409
and there's actually a way.

229
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,245
First, we need to find a suitable person

230
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,313
and combine their 'Eight Characters'

231
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,649
and Buxia's talisman.

232
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,584
Can this prevent him from hearing and seeing?

233
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,555
But honestly, I don't know

234
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,490
what will happen to that person.

235
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,593
After all, this is our family's destiny.

236
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,696
I feel a bit guilty to pass it to someone else.

237
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,166
At most, they'll see and hear those things,

238
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,301
isn't it?

239
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,203
Aren't you afraid?

240
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,405
Buxia said you, Grandpa,

241
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,407
and Senior can all hear.

242
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,177
My brother may not be reliable,

243
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,280
but he's really good at judging people.

244
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,983
You do seem like a good fit,

245
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:01,153
after all, your body can make him not hear,

246
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,860
but it's said in the ancient books,

247
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,796
that the two people must be husband and wife.

248
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,636
Um, actually, in our tradition,

249
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,572
being husband and wife
doesn't refer to the ceremony,

250
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:21,740
it means…

251
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,342
Can't you just say it all at once?

252
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,444
If it's not a ceremony, then what is it?

253
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,351
I'm a girl, and you want me to be explicit?

254
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,658
Your process is slow, huh?

255
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,828
But it doesn't matter,

256
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,363
we can make up for the progress.

257
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:49,134
Sis Tao, is this real or did you make it up?

258
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,303
Would I joke about my brother?

259
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,605
But I don't know if it will work.

260
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,974
We can only hope for the best.

261
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,215
For the 'Eight Characters' to be effective,

262
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,118
firstly, that person must be sincere.

263
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,654
Buxia has to write
his 'Eight Characters' himself.

264
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,923
And finally, press it on with his own hands.

265
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,226
Do you think if we
tell Buxia about this method,

266
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,095
he would agree to it?

267
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,863
What are you doing?

268
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,135
I told you not to bully him.

269
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,337
I didn't mean for you to like him.

270
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,705
If you lack a boyfriend, find one yourself.

271
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,474
Jiang Chi is mine.

272
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,319
My sister is bullying me.

273
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,254
Help me fight her.

274
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,423
I'll count on you.

275
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,759
- I've only been out for a little while.
- Let me see.

276
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,462
What have you two been up to behind my back?

277
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,966
Where does it hurt?

278
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,937
Actually, Grandpa always wanted me
to take over the temple.

279
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,772
But once during a ceremony,

280
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,008
I accidentally saw a terrifying scene,

281
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,410
and I had a fever for a week.

282
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,646
So Grandpa had to give up this idea

283
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,381
and sealed it for me.

284
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,617
If it weren't for my sister…

285
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,552
If it weren't for your sister's mistake,

286
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,954
you wouldn't have come to me, clinging to me.

287
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,489
We would probably be strangers.

288
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,391
What do you mean clinging to you?

289
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,061
You pursued me, not the other way around.

290
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,901
Gu Buxia,

291
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,602
if there was a way

292
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,071
for you to neither hear nor see those things,

293
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,506
would you want it?

294
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,608
Of course.

295
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,411
But it depends on what the method is.

296
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,513
Luckily you're here now,

297
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,515
so I'm not that scared.

298
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,537
Wait a minute,

299
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:50,989
are you trying to get rid of me?

300
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,895
Don't knock me like my sister does.

301
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,363
I'll get stupid.

302
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,433
Don't overthink with this head of yours.

303
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,435
Worry about what you should worry about.

304
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,974
Grandpa once told me,

305
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,175
there is a certain number of people

306
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,611
with destiny in this world.

307
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,012
If one loses it somewhere,

308
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,248
there will be one more somewhere else.

309
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,649
Sometimes, if I think about it,

310
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,318
I'll forget the idea.

311
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,086
If it's me, it's me.

312
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,188
If I wasn't so scared,

313
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,090
maybe I could even help them.

314
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,993
Gu Buxia.

315
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,962
You may be willing, but I'm not.

316
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,129
You are mine,

317
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,065
and you should stay by my side.

318
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,067
What if you can't sleep well all day?

319
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,590

<i>[Stay by My Side]</i>

340
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:35,287
You asked me how heavy my
'Eight Characters' are. How would I know?

341
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,705
Why are you asking me this?

342
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:37,756
Ask your sister to perform a ritual

343
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,791
and bind us together.

344
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,227
Whoever changes his heart first
won't be able to be erected.

345
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,479
Do you dare to do it?

346
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,263
Have you done everything you needed to do?

347
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,867
I'm sorry.
