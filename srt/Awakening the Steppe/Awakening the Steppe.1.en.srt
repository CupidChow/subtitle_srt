1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,833
Amur

2
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,416
Amur

3
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,208
Hey

4
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:12,500
Amur

5
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,125
Amur

6
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:28,500
Amur

7
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,916
Ha ha ha ha

8
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,333
Hey

9
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,875
Oh, I just knew you'd be by the lake again

10
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:36,541
Hey

11
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,625
This month's meat

12
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,750
Vegetables and daily supplies are all on the counter

13
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,541
Mm

14
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,958
Alright, Mongke

15
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,166
Put it on my tab

16
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,125
Yeah

17
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,375
Your tab, y'know... it's been over half a year

18
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,250
How's business lately?

19
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,791
Why don't you settle up last quarter first?

20
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,250
Business?

21
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Same as always

22
00:01:58,916 --> 00:01:59,875
Hit or miss

23
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,208
Hey, if business ain't good, get out there

24
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,750
Hand out some flyers, y'know

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,166
Oh right

26
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,875
Where's Xiaohei? How come he's not back yet?

27
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,625
I can't hear him barking

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,416
Feels kinda strange, hey

29
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,083
Xiaohei

30
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,916
Don't know where he went

31
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,708
Went out looking but couldn't find him

32
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,708
Let's wait a bit more

33
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,416
Maybe if we wait, he'll come back on his own

34
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,666
Without Xiaohei to help out

35
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,708
It's really been a lot of trouble, y'know

36
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,458
Before, whenever you ordered stuff

37
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,916
Xiaohei would carry it over himself

38
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,416
Yeah

39
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,791
You don't think Xiaohei got eaten by wolves on the way?

40
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,833
Oh, go on, get outta here

41
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,791
You're the one who'd get eaten by wolves

42
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,708
Hey, it's getting dark, head home

43
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:52,916
Any later and there really might be wolves

44
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:53,708
Yeah

45
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,000
Heh, I ain't scared of no wolves

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,750
You study hard now

47
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,458
Do well on your exam, hey

48
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,958
Heh, you're so long-winded

49
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:03,916
I'm already studying, aren't I?

50
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,375
Yeah yeah, alright alright

51
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,875
I'm off, I'm off

52
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,666
Let's go, Xiaohei

53
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,666
Woof woof

54
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,291
Xiaohei's hungry

55
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,208
Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof

56
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,500
Xiaohei's really hungry

57
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,500
Woof woof woof woof woof

58
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,916
Then let's get you something tasty

59
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:58,875
Woof woof woof

60
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,208
Come on

61
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,458
I'm from Singapore

62
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,916
Before my father passed, he said

63
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,041
A person should see the great grasslands

64
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,666
That way, when you go

65
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,708
You won't have any regrets

66
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,666
I came to the grasslands with my own willfulness

67
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,291
I never expected

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,083
To encounter a pack of wolves

69
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,541
Fortunately

70
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,166
A black dog saved me

71
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,875
And brought me here

72
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,458
Hey

73
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,791
Where I met him

74
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,583
Hey

75
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,500
Who are you?

76
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,125
Hey

77
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,416
What happened to you?

78
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,458
You're...

79
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,000
Ah

80
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,291
Oh, you're awake

81
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,833
Here, let me take a look

82
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,416
Hey

83
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,041
I'm a doctor

84
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,916
Stay still, don't move

85
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,250
The low fever has passed

86
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,291
Hungry?

87
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,125
Here, let me get you a bowl of meat

88
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,125
Um

89
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,500
Where are my clothes?

90
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,375
You were soaking wet when you arrived

91
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,375
I washed them and hung them out to dry

92
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,541
So I'm naked?

93
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,500
Oh

94
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,416
Wait just a moment

95
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,375
Here, they're dry now

96
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,583
Oh, good

97
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,083
Let me pour you some milk tea

98
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,958
Um, sorry

99
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,458
Could you

100
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,166
Could you step out for a moment?

101
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:40,916
Oh

102
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,500
Sure

103
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,375
Eat up. Weren't you just hungry?

104
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,625
Let me tell you

105
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,041
I stewed this meat for a long time

106
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:02,750
I put in sea buckthorn, cistanche, and more. Here

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,208
Hey, eat up

108
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,791
Oh right, and this piece too

109
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,000
Here

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,666
Bring your bowl over, quick

111
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,250
Dip it in this, it's good

112
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:28,708
Here
