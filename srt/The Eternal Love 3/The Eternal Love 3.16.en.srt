16
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,160
What's wrong? Are you mad at me?

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,759
Do you enjoy ordering me around?

18
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,919
Sorry.

19
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,880
I won't ask you

20
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,440
to serve me tea or water again.

21
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,080
I can forgive you.

22
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,679
But Su Yue La won't.

23
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,919
It's a pleasant moment. Why must you
bring up her name?

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
Your Highness.

25
00:02:58,559 --> 00:02:59,639
Curse that witch.

26
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,000
Why is she here?

27
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,399
I told you.

28
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:05,119
She won't be restless at night.

29
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,000
There are rules.

30
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,399
Princess and Prince Consort

31
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:10,880
may sleep together once every seven days.

32
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,559
You must restrain your urges until then.

33
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,919
In that case,

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,600
I'll be waiting outside

35
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,119
until Your Highness decides to
go to your room with me.

36
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,039
Your Highness, please be quick.

37
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:24,360
Tell her I'm not around.

38
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,240
Go on.

39
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,679
It's futile.

40
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,800
She will barge in here to arrest you.

41
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,559
I'm not going.

42
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:32,720
Just go. Hurry up.

43
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,199
No!

44
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,199
Go on.

45
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,559
No!

46
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,839
Just go.

47
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,520
What happened?

48
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,520
Jing Xin.

49
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,960
She won't let me sleep with Cheng Cheng.

50
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,080
She even asked me to leave the room.

51
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll handle it for you.

52
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,480
I'll distract her.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,920
Your Highness.

54
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,440
Please.

55
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,559
Rest well, Your Highness.

56
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,440
I'll wait here and keep watch.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No evildoer will sneak past me!

58
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,720
We have a majestic full moon tonight.

59
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,959
Every time there is a full moon,

60
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:13,519
I always spend the night alone.

61
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,880
But I have you to keep me company tonight.

62
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,640
I somehow feel...

63
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,279
a little touched.

64
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,279
Everyone would miss some
old friends on quiet nights.

65
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,119
Whether it's old acquaintances or new friends,

66
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,040
I always wish there could be

67
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,559
a soulmate by my side

68
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,200
who could listen to my thoughts at this moment.

69
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,760
A soulmate?

70
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,920
Who wouldn't want a soulmate?

71
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,480
But it's all part of fate's plan.

72
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:16,600
It's destiny.

73
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,279
It seems like...

74
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,399
It seems like...

75
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,359
you have your fair share of woes too, Official Su.

76
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,799
Mr. Mo, you're Prince Consort's birth father.

77
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:49,959
You're also a role model of
manly virtues in Dongyue.

78
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:51,959
You've been a widower for over ten years

79
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,359
and never involved in indecency.

80
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,839
Your virtuous character is truly impressive.

81
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,119
I'm flattered, Official Su.

82
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,519
Her Highness couldn't sleep by herself

83
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,640
and Prince Consort is responsible for that.

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,839
He must be supervised closely.

85
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,679
I've invited you here,

86
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,559
so you can show him the right path

87
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,079
and tell him not to break the
moral codes for men again

88
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,519
by seducing Her Highness with his charm!

89
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,920
I insisted on staying in his room.

90
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,359
He wasn't seducing me.

91
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,079
Your Highness and Mo Yan Chen
were childhood friends.

92
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,720
His love for you stays true and unyielding.

93
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,519
If Mo Lian Cheng hadn't employed seduction,

94
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,239
Your Highness wouldn't have disowned him.

95
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:41,720
You...

96
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,000
Her Majesty has orders for Your Highness.

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,119
This way, Your Highness.

98
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,399
Father.

99
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,160
I was merely putting up with
Su Yue La's inspection.

100
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,720
That's all there is to it.

101
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,600
I have nothing more to teach you.

102
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,000
Come to the study with me.

103
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,000
The study?

104
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,359
Since she wants me to teach you
moral codes for men,

105
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,959
you can copy some moral codes and fool her.

106
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,519
Father. Su Yue La is acting suspiciously.

107
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,640
Please be cautious.

108
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,959
I'm aware of what's happening.

109
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,640
I don't need your lecture.

110
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,799
Mo Yuan Long and Mo Lian Cheng are still acting as

111
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,520
loving father and son in the presence of outsiders.

112
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,159
But they barely interact

113
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,919
with each other in private.

114
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,919
They each copied a set of moral codes for men.

115
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:46,119
My guess is it's just for show

116
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:47,359
to fool us.

117
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,640
They have grown estranged because of

118
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,719
Mo Yan Chen's repudiation.

119
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,679
They haven't reconciled for the moment.

120
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:57,440
Whether you're right or not, we can't
draw conclusions rashly.

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,080
Keep observing.

122
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,840
Employ some tactics if necessary.

123
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,559
I will aid you.

124
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:07,880
Yes. I shall take my leave now.

125
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,479
(Troubles might stir at the armory
and the provision warehouse.)

126
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:13,080
(Come to Black Cloak Alley at 3 AM.)

127
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,919
(This is my father's handwriting.)

128
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,479
(But I've withdrawn myself from the rebellion.)

129
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:26,960
I supervised my son as he copied
moral codes for men.

130
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:30,159
He should learn his mistakes after
copying the text with diligence.

131
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,559
(Could it be...)

132
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,239
(that Su Yue La mimicked my father's handwriting)

133
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,840
(to see if I'm still working with the rebels?)

134
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:45,320
(Then my father must have received a letter)

135
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:47,119
(that imitated my handwriting.)

136
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,119
Officials, it's time.

137
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,559
When the two rebels arrive,

138
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,000
take them both down.

139
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,760
Yes!

140
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,820
(Black Cloak Alley)

141
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,280
My Lord.

142
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,599
Why are you here?

143
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,320
Eighth Young Master sent me here to wait for you.

144
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,400
This meeting is Su Yue La's scheme.

145
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,080
There is an ambush ahead.

146
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,080
We should both leave now.

147
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,239
Have mercy on me!

148
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:44,599
This...

149
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:45,440
My father is very ill!

150
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,760
I was going to ask for a doctor at the clinic!

151
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,080
Have mercy on me!

152
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,520
Please spare my life!

153
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,440
Scram.

154
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,200
Officials, this is my mistake.

155
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:54,799
We might have been exposed.

156
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,640
In that case, fall back.

157
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,080
Let's go.

158
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,280
So Her Majesty didn't send Su Yue La here

159
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,760
to teach us the rites or reimpose laws of virtues.

160
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,599
She is here to investigate

161
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:20,799
whether my men and I have secretly joined
hands with your father's rebellion.

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,840
This is huge plotting.

163
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,200
Su Yue La is cunning.

164
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,760
She is also conspiring with Qu Mei Er.

165
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,159
She will be a great threat if she stays.

166
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,080
That is why

167
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,359
we must get leverage on her

168
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,520
to prevent further risks.

169
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,039
She may be sneaky,

170
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,760
but I'll show her the real deal.

171
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,960
Judging by your eyes,

172
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,200
you can show her a great deal.

173
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:53,520
Her youth is behind her and she is still single.

174
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,239
Perhaps

175
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,880
the loneliness is tormenting her heart.

176
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
What dirty scheme are you up to now?

177
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,400
Are you...

178
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:06,880
You'll see.

179
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,159
Are you sure this person

180
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,760
used to be in love with Su Yue La?

181
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,239
He was her first love.

182
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,200
It's the first love!

183
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,239
I ordered Jing Xin to ask around.

184
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,280
Su Yue La hasn't married other men

185
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,719
because she couldn't move on

186
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,599
from the man in this picture.

187
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,280
But we got the description from others,

188
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,719
then the painter drew this based on ours.

189
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:36,599
Are you sure this is what he really looks like?

190
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,799
Official Wang has checked this picture.

191
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,599
She is from Su Yue La's hometown.

192
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:41,559
She confirmed that

193
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:44,799
the man looks exactly like this picture.

194
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,919
But this man

195
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,960
somehow looks familiar.

196
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,960
It reminds me of someone.

197
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,039
I think I've met this man before as well.

198
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,280
I feel like...

199
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,400
I got it. Come on.

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,359
My skill as a makeup artist is unquestionable.

201
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Now he does look like

202
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,039
the man in this picture.

203
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,880
With some beard,

204
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,440
he can win her heart for sure.

205
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,760
You have a point.

206
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,159
I was told that Young Master
will draw me a portrait.

207
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,080
But what is it for?

208
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,400
We should tell him the truth.

209
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:27,799
You want me to seduce Su Yue La?

210
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,640
How can I do that to her?

211
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,039
Calm down.

212
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,440
I'll double your salary for the next month.

213
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,799
I don't give up my money for honor...

214
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,880
No, I don't trade my honor for money!

215
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,599
This is a great chance to display your charm!

216
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:41,400
This isn't embarrassing at all.

217
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,760
I wouldn't mind if it was others.

218
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:43,919
But it's Su Yue La...

219
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,599
I just can't do it.

220
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,679
Young Master, please don't make me do it.

221
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,719
Yu Hao.

222
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,200
You already know the ambush in Black Cloak Alley.

223
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,440
Su Yue La will cause us more trouble in the future.

224
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,159
Her Highness's and my safety...

225
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:04,880
are in your hands.

226
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,280
You should put some effort into this.

227
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,239
Leave.

228
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:33,880
She misses the man from her memories,
his gentle manner is never forgotten.

229
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:40,119
He lives in the cabin in the woods, but his
presence has my heart bewildered.

230
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,799
The plum blossoms are in the wind.

231
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,280

I am Secondary Prince Consort's right-hand man.

246
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,239
You know poetry.

247
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,359
I'm flattered.

248
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,920
My elder sister taught me some
poems when I was a kid.

249
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:56,880
(He is just like him.)

250
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,079
(Is this really a coincidence?)

251
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,359
I've been here for days.

252
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,119
Why haven't I met you before?

253
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,040
Official Su, you have your hands full.

254
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,839
Of course, you wouldn't notice a mere servant.

255
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,359
But should you ever need anything,

256
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,439
I'm at your command.

257
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,359
Yu Hao?

258
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,119
Official Su.

259
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:48,130

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,920
It's late at night. Shouldn't you get some rest?

263
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,479
I'll rest after I've collected the tangerine peels.

264
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,439
Orange peels?

265
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,319
Yes.

266
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,880
♪If I could meet her someday♪

267
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,160
An old friend of mine liked orange peels too.

268
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:22,640
Especially the scent.

269
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,359
Scents can be so fascinating.

270
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,760
We can't see nor touch it.

271
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,319
But when there is a scent,

272
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:35,160
the memories come pouring in.

273
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,359
I'm sure that old friend

274
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,040
was very dear to you.

275
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,640
It's all in the past now.

276
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:44,560
Right.

277
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,319
You've served Secondary Prince Consort for years.

278
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,680
Have you ever thought about getting married?

279
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,319
I did.

280
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
But unless I could meet

281
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,839
a gentle and upright person much like yourself,

282
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,239
I'd rather stay unmarried.

283
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,199
It's getting late.

284
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
You should get some rest.

285
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,479
Yu Hao! Your...

286
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,640
Your sachet...

287
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,000
Did he leave this here on purpose?

288
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,920
He had fallen in love with me.

289
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,270
(Princess's Residence)

290
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,400
Official Su, is this...

291
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,000
Come on, sit down.

292
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,239
Official Su.

293
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,239
Isn't this what you want?

294
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,560
I don't think it's appropriate.

295
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:51,719
You took the initiative to show affection...

296
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,160
Then I shall do it as you wish!

297
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,079
Official Su, please behave yourself.

298
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,079
It would be bad

299
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,839
if others saw this!

300
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:03,280
Let them watch!

301
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,760
They shall witness how I pamper you.

302
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,839
No, Official Su.

303
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,000
Stop yelling.

304
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,359
No one will be here to save you.

305
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,160
Scream all you want, but no one will save you!

306
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
How dare you!

307
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:21,760
How dare you defile a man in my house!

308
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,520
Your Highness! I deserve justice!

309
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,000
This pervert

310
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,880
stole my sachet,

311
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:32,920
and now she wanted...

312
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,959
She even wanted to tarnish my reputation!

313
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,119
Your Highness, that's not true.

314
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,680
This is a misunderstanding.

315
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,160
Have mercy on me!

316
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,640
This is all a misunderstanding!

317
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,959
A misunderstanding?

318
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:46,199
Then you can explain yourself
at the administrative office!

319
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
Please, no.

320
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,760
Your Highness, please don't do this.

321
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,680
I'm sorry. Please punish me, Your Highness!

322
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,359
If you're sorry,

323
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,479
you should apologize to Yu Hao.

324
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,880
Yes, you're right.

325
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,920
This is my fault.

326
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,920
I couldn't hold my urges.

327
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,199
Please forgive me!

328
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,040
Please...

329
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,079
In your opinion,

330
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,439
how should we punish Official Su?

331
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,959
After all, Official Su...

332
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,439
is a respected officer.

333
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,680
If word gets out...

334
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,880
Prince Consort, please show mercy!

335
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,199
Please have mercy, Prince Consort!

336
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:32,199
If Official Su

337
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,239
doesn't cause any trouble here,

338
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,599
we could overlook this incident.

339
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,359
What does Your Highness think?

340
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,719
Well...

341
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,479
Official Su...

342
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,959
I get it. I get it!

343
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,119
I definitely won't cause you any trouble.

344
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,560
I will behave at all times.

345
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,800
Your Highness, Prince Consort, forgive me.

346
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,959
Forgive me!

347
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,040
Well...

348
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
We'll proceed with my husband's proposition.

349
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,199
I'm grateful to both Your Highness and
Prince Consort for your mercy!

350
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:10,800
I'm grateful to both Your Highness and
Prince Consort for your mercy!

351
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:19,400
How could I live with this?

352
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,839
I should just end my life...

353
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,880
Your Highness!

354
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,000
You must help me!

355
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,599
That cursed Qu Tan Er...

356
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,560
is blackmailing me with what I did
to that servant.

357
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,079
Her Majesty is losing patience because
I couldn't deliver results.

358
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:54,520
I'm having a wolf by the ears.

359
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,199
I'm grateful Your Highness would
listen to my worries.

360
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,959
Otherwise, I couldn't handle this harsh life.

361
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Official Su, stand up.

362
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,479
I know your frustration.

363
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,640
But if there's no major movement,
please stay cautious.

364
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,479
If you come to my manor too often,

365
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,439
people might start suspecting.

366
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:48,160
But I serve Her Majesty.

367
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,119
If Your Highness wants to know
what Her Majesty is doing,

368
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:52,839
I'll still have to come here to inform you.

369
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,520
Your Highness.

370
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,439
Eldest Young Master refused to

371
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,239
accept the ginseng soup you sent again.

372
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:07,599
I must see to other matters.
I should go now, Official Su.

373
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,079
Your Highness? Your Highness? Your Highness!

374
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:45,000
Your Majesty, it's time for your medicine.

375
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,479
How is the investigation I sent you on?

376
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,400
As Your Majesty expected,

377
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,319
Su Yue La and Eldest Princess

378
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,599
have been meeting more frequently.

379
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,400
She is conspiring with Qu Mei Er.

380
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,839
I had already turned a blind eye to it.

381
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,520
The inspection on the operation progress

382
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,839
was a bold move from her.

383
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,599
Your Majesty values loyalty the most.

384
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,199
Su Yue La has defected.

385
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
She betrayed Your Majesty.
Her sin cannot be forgiven.

386
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,479
Send my word to Second Princess's
Residence tomorrow.

387
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:23,479
Su Yue La will be assigned to Yu Prefecture
to work as its new governor.

388
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,760
She must set out immediately.

389
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,160
I shall get rid of the root of the trouble

390
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,160
while she is stationed at that remote land.

391
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,839
Yes.

392
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,239
Your Majesty.

393
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:51,119
The operation is still a priority.

394
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:52,920
Yes.

395
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,400
(Princess's Residence)
As decreed by Her Majesty,

396
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,000
Supervisor of Internal Affairs Su Yue La

397
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,040
is wise and righteous.

398
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,239
She has been appointed the
Governor of Yu Prefecture.

399
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,680
Effective immediately.

400
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,400
The end.

401
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,640
Yu Prefecture?

402
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,319
That is a remote and barren land!

403
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:32,280
After Official Wu was sent to Yu Prefecture,

404
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:35,160
her corpse was found in the wild.

405
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:39,239
I can't go there. I can't be there!

406
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,680
I want to serve Her Majesty! I must stay!

407
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,880
Kneel and be grateful for the offer.

408
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,160
No.

409
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:45,680
No.

410
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,040
Your Highness. Your Highness!

411
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,199
Your Highness, save me!

412
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,560
Put up a few good words for me to Her Majesty.

413
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,239
I can be your servant!

414
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,199
I will forever be loyal to you!

415
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:59,000
I will devote my life to serve Your Highness!

416
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,079
Official Su, this is a promotion.

417
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,880
Technically speaking, you should
have my congratulations.

418
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,319
Your Highness. Your Highness!

419
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,640
Your Highness! Save me!

420
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
I can't go to that place!

421
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,719
Your Highness, save me! Your Highness!

422
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:18,439
I can't disobey Her Majesty's order.

423
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,599
Official Su, you should accept your fate.

424
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,000
Be on your way.

425
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,680
Qu Tan Er.

426
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:37,560
If you did not set me up,

427
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,520
I wouldn't have gone so far!

428
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,760
I'll kill you!

429
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:49,680
I'll kill you!

430
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,359
Cheng Cheng, you got hurt.

431
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,160
Qu Tan Er, I curse you!

432
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,920
I'll kill you!

433
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,479
I'll kill you!

434
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,640
Let go of me!

435
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,400
Qu Tan Er! I'll kill you!

436
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:11,839
Let me go!

437
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,599
Qu Tan Er! I'll kill you!

438
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:19,040
Cheng Cheng, how are you?

439
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,319
Are you all right?

440
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:25,839
Bear with it a little. I'll get the medicine.

441
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,760
Tan Er.

442
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,439
Are you my Cheng Cheng?

443
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,199
Yes. I am your Cheng Cheng.

444
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,880
I'm glad you're fine.

445
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,199
I'm so glad...

446
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,160
you've been waiting for me.

447
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,359
Do you know how hard it has been for me?

448
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,439
Do you know how badly I want to

449
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:17,520
go back to raise our son with you?

450
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,046
Do you know how much I had missed you?

451
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,790
♪You turn around as the firework fades♪

452
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
♪Fate played a trick on me
so I pick up my flute again♪

453
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,280
I know.

454
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,439
I know everything now.

455
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:40,830
♪The string broke and the song ended,
they went their separate ways♪

456
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:41,839
I also know...

457
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,040
you're a stubborn cockroach.

458
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:51,599
You're a cockroach.

459
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,160
Now, listen to me.

460
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,760
When Su Yue La attacked you,

461
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,199
I regained my memories.

462
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,239
But...

463
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,160
All right, don't worry.

464
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:21,640
I know everything now.

465
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:26,400
Whenever I feel worried for you

466
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,319
or when I feel jealous,

467
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,800
our memories together or
any familiar conversations

468
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,479
will come back to me.

469
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,239
I'll regain my memories.

470
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,479
I am aware of these factors too.

471
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:41,680
I used them to restore your memories.

472
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,959
But it doesn't work every single time.

473
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,839
Just now

474
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,479
Su Yue La tried to stab you.

475
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,199
The worry and fear I felt

476
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,839
were like a leash,

477
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,280
it binds my heart.

478
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:01,160
My heartbeat elevated.

479
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,520
It was like it's going to come out of me.

480
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,839
You mean

481
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:09,719
your fear caused palpitation.

482
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,080
When I regained my memories back then,

483
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,600
I had the same feeling.

484
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,919
I get it now.

485
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,040
You managed to regain your memories

486
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,959
because the situation you were in

487
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,120
shared great resemblance
to our past experiences.

488
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,000
At the same time, your heartbeat

489
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,840
elevated in a short time.

490
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,520
When it reaches a certain level,

491
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:38,080
your memories will come back to you.

492
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,439
A certain level?

493
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,520
We don't have an electrocardiogram

494
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,000
or CT scans in this world.

495
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
We don't even have MRI here.

496
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,199
I'm not sure what that particular rate is.

497
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,280
But one thing is certain.

498
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,280
When your emotion reaches its peak,

499
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,080
the gateway to your memories will be opened.

500
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,919
Who would have thought

501
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,439
Physician Qu's theory actually
has academic values?

502
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,439
However,

503
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:16,760
there are matters at hand

504
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:18,040
that require time to plan.

505
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:19,560
Also,

506
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,399
I haven't regained my power either.

507
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,320
As long as you're my dear Cheng Cheng.

508
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,159
As for your power...

509
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,840
Only one thing matters.

510
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:52,940
(Princess's Residence)

511
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:56,080
(Tan Er.)

512
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:58,919
(Returning a gift is the only excuse I can have)

513
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:01,399
(to see you again.)

514
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,840
Give it to me.

515
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,679
Young Master, what about we send
someone else to inform them?

516
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:12,800
No need.

517
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,199
Whenever it is,

518
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,040
I always belong to Second Princess's Residence.

519
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:38,800
Su Yue La was eventually useful

520
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:40,639
before she got lost.

521
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,959
Now...

522
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:45,560
we finally know how to trigger your memories.

523
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,959
Since it's a double delight,

524
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,479
shouldn't we celebrate it?

525
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,199
How should we celebrate it?

526
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:00,479
You know the rules.

527
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,560
If we kiss now,

528
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,320
you'll become the other guy again.

529
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,639
Even without my memories of the past,

530
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,760
I will always be myself.

531
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,719
I'm still the one who will never get tired

532
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,320
of kissing you thousands of times.

533
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,280
This house...

534
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,919
has no place for me.

535
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,280
Everything I've sacrificed...

536
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,080
was just a joke.

537
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,199
Get out!

538
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,360
How many times have I told you?

539
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:55,719
I told you to get out.

540
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:58,280
It's me, Yan Chen.

541
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,120
Why are you here?

542
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:21,360
Yan Chen, no matter what you want to do,

543
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,199
I'll always be there for you.

544
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,239
Even if I have to anger the world

545
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:27,719
and get cursed by thousands of people,

546
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,479
I will still be by your side.

547
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,080
Why?

548
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:35,320
Do I not deserve...

549
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,800
the slightest attention...

550
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:39,760
or affection from them?

551
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,959
You've done nothing wrong.

552
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,520
It's their fault.

553
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,600
You should blame the customs
for making you obey.

554
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,919
The customs?

555
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,679
It's like a knife...

556
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:58,159
that is stabbing in my heart.

557
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,399
I could only let my blood...

558
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:07,560
slowly drain away from my body.

559
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:15,199
No, Yan Chen.

560
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,239
No?

561
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:19,600
No one is willing to give me any hope!

562
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:40,760
You will have the best life out of all men.

563
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:42,479
You'll have the most freedom.

564
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:46,600
You'll live more like yourself.
