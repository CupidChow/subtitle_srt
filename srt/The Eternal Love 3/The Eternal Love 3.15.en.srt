16
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,160
How about it?

17
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,720
If I say

18
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,880
that I don't want him to leave,

19
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,240
even if that means putting on an act forever,

20
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,390
and spending the whole lifetime in a lie

21
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,800
to let him live in a dream,

22
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,440
would you be mad?

23
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,390
Did you say to him that you want a divorce?

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,670
I know how much he loves Qu Tan Er

25
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,240
and I know that if he thinks that

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,630
Qu Tan Er has abandoned him,

27
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,720
he would be in unendurable pain.

28
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,000
I can't bear to see that.

29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,550
I know that

30
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,670
his kindness towards you

31
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,720
and towards me

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,080
was genuine.

33
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,240
If there is a way to keep up the lie forever,

34
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,600
so that he wouldn't be in pain,

35
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,030
I would gladly do it.

36
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,670
But no matter what choice we make,

37
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,470
we would be hurting him to no end.

38
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,390
Perhaps since the moment the real Qu Tan Er

39
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,030
drowned and lost her life,

40
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,110
Eldest Brother was bound to get hurt.

41
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,270
But he doesn't know

42
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,270
that you're not the real Qu Tan Er.

43
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,800
Don't blame yourself too much.

44
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,190
But it was my arrival

45
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,670
that disrupted the peace.

46
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,880
Let's give him some time

47
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,080
and let him think about it calmly.

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,830
We also need to think about it.

49
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
To think it through.

50
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,320
Go to rest now.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,480
Okay.

52
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,920
Cheng Cheng.

53
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,270
These days, Yan Chen

54
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,000
pretends as if nothing has happened.

55
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,480
I don't know what to do.

56
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,720
Yan Chen.

57
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,160
During breakfast,

58
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,070
I saw that you were sweating a little.

59
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,390
So I thought that perhaps
your clothes were too thick

60
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,000
and asked a servant to fetch some thinner
clothing out of storage.

61
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,320
Yan Chen...

62
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,110
Alright.

63
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,270
I still need to verify the ledger of the residence.

64
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,720
You keep getting no salary as a punishment,

65
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,550
so I must be more careful with our money.

66
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,510
- Yan Chen.
- Eldest...

67
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,760
I'll put the clothes away.

68
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,000
He has chosen to lie to himself

69
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,950
and pretend that nothing ever happened.

70
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,000
Tan Er!

71
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,200
I was just about to bring you these desserts.

72
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,550
These are your favorite walnut and date delights.

73
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
I made them myself.

74
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,160
Yan Chen,

75
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,160
this is the divorce paper.

76
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,760
If you think there's something wrong with it,
please tell me.

77
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,070
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,920
You're really trying to take care of me
with your every word.

79
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,040
As long as I am willing to leave,

80
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,720
you can give me anything.

81
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,720
What would be wrong there?

82
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,000
Yan Chen...

83
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,000
A divorce isn't appropriate.

84
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,270
Repudiation...

85
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,200
if you give me a repudiation paper,
I will leave.

86
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,790
But if I repudiate you,

87
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,070
your life would be even harder,

88
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,110
only a divorce can...

89
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,030
If you are going to abandon me,

90
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,960
then stop pretending to care about me!

91
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,520
The less of this ridiculous compensation
you give me,

92
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,790
the less sorrow and misery I feel.

93
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,150
As it currently stands,

94
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,670
I have no other choice.

95
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,320
I'm sorry. Please calm down.

96
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,470
No other choice?

97
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,550
I don't want to leave.

98
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,000
I was repudiated by you.

99
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,080
I will wait for you

100
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,790
to come to see me with the repudiation paper.

101
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,960
What else do you want to say?

102
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,590
Go ahead.

103
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,080
I can't explain it well,

104
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,710
but Qu Tan Er really did love you.

105
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,320
However, the current Second Princess isn't...

106
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,470
Even now,

107
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,080
you are still trying to meddle with my emotions.

108
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,280
I know

109
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,710
you won't believe in any of my explanations,

110
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,440
but the Qu Tan Er before loved you very much.

111
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,790
Of course I know that.

112
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,470
Of course I know

113
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,200
Tan Er's love for me was real.

114
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,350
If it weren't for you,

115
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,030
her feelings for me would always be real!

116
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,960
It was just an incident at the harem selection,

117
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,400
yet the next day she climbed over the fence
just to meet you.

118
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,960
The day before, you were the laughing stock of
the entire country for being unscrupulous.

119
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,910
The day after, you got her

120
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,910
to write a song about how morally sound you are.

121
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,080
Don't tell me that

122
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,670
you had no one else to choose but her!

123
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,880
If you indeed had no feelings for her,

124
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,080
why would you choose someone
I treasured like this?

125
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,960
At that time,

126
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,960
I indeed had no feelings for her.

127
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,470
My mistake for realizing it so late.

128
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,790
I was using my own happiness to protect you

129
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,150
throughout all that has happened.

130
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,710
I cannot argue with that.

131
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,520
Perhaps since that moment,

132
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,200
all I can see is her.

133
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,670
I'm sorry.

134
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,030
I will leave this place

135
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,150
as you wish.

136
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,670

(Mo Residence)

159
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,910
What happened?

160
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,000
I have no idea either.

161
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,640
Leave!

162
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,280
Go, go, go, go.

163
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,080
His Lordship has told me to tell you that

164
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,350
the Mo Family's motto is to be faithful and bold,

165
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,880
and those who treat their wives
poorly are not allowed in the residence.

166
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,350
I'm very sorry to say this,

167
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,000
but morals and the family's motto are above all.

168
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,280
Eldest Young Master,
please abide by the traditions.

169
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,400
Either cut off your hair and train as a monk

170
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,670
or leave your name on the memorial arch
to preserve your chastity

171
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,840
in order to right the cardinal guides
and constant virtues.

172
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,710
Young Master!

173
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,440
Eldest Brother, what are you doing?

174
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,000
Get up and come in with me.

175
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,640
It's Father's idea?

176
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,710
I will talk to him.

177
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,520
Feng Yang.

178
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This is fine.

179
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,710
I can finally cut off my feelings.

180
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,590
Eldest Brother!

181
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,880
Yun Ying!

182
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,000
Take good care of Eldest Brother.

183
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,080
Tell him, I know it's not his fault.

184
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,440
Yes.

185
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:28,460
(Mo Residence)

186
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,110
Why can't they take him in?

187
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,150
Isn't Feng Yang the head of the family?

188
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,590
Hasn't she always respected Yan Chen very much?

189
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,320
I heard that Feng Yang tried her best to stop
Yan Chen from cutting his hair to become a monk.

190
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,110
But Eldest Brother was afraid that his staying
would affect the Mo Family's reputation.

191
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,840
I originally thought that...

192
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,790
letting him go was the best option,

193
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,200
but who would have thought it'd come to this.

194
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,880
Cheng Cheng.

195
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,790
I wish that he could live a peaceful life.

196
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,040
Who is it?

197
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,880
Father.

198
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,230
Wait a moment.

199
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,230
Hurry and leave from the back door.

200
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,430
Continue to recruit soldiers
and purchase supplies.

201
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,880
But don't act rashly.

202
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,000
Follow my instructions.

203
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,560
Understood.

204
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,280
Come in.

205
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,350
If you have come here for your eldest brother,

206
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,470
then don't bother speaking.

207
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,830
Father, even if you had let Eldest Brother stay,

208
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,160
how much of an impact would it have on you?

209
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,710
Did you have to be so cruel?

210
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,880
I wanted to ask you.

211
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,520
Why did you have to go that far?

212
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,950
Yan Chen being repudiated

213
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,070
will let Her Majesty think

214
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,800
that there's more to your marriage

215
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,710
than what was mentioned before.

216
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,350
Now that Her Majesty
grows suspicious of Second Princess,

217
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,400
the Mo family will look even more suspicious.

218
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,400
Of course I need to ease that suspicion of hers.

219
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,350
Is Eldest Brother's situation

220
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,560
so unimportant to you?

221
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,230
Was it me who caused him to be in such a situation?

222
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,190
Cheng Er,

223
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,430
aren't you the cause of his misfortunes?

224
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,310
Since it has come to this,

225
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,310
and Second Princess is fully devoted to you,

226
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,640
you must make haste

227
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,640
and fulfill your responsibilities.

228
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,350
Father, please accept Eldest Brother
into the residence.

229
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,230
Cheng Er.

230
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,800
You knew very well that Yan Chen
and Second Princess are childhood friends,

231
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,040
yet you still robbed Yan Chen of his beloved.

232
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,190
Was it not you
who wanted to use Second Princess

233
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,590
to take the throne?

234
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,590
Was it not you who

235
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,230
came to me and spoke of your plan?

236
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,470
Have you forgotten about all that?

237
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,350
Indeed, it was me.

238
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,830
But I now have someone I wish to protect

239
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,070
and I have found a reason to not hurt the innocent.

240
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,800
Someone you wish to protect?

241
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,950
Very well.

242
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,710
Cheng Er.

243
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,710
Your mother carried this sword into battle
for many years.

244
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,640
I clean it carefully everyday

245
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,350
as I can't bear to see any dust on it.

246
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,830
Eagles don't catch flies.

247
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,190
Those with weak hearts can accomplish nothing.

248
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,920
Father, if so,

249
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,950
then I can no longer work alongside you.

250
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,520
I shall take my leave.
Forgive me for not being a filial son.

251
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,230
Cheng Er!

252
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,560
Your Majesty.

253
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,800
Has the repudiation of Mo Yan Chen cleared
the cloudiness in Your Majesty's mind?

254
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,920
I once thought that they were using each other
to each of their own benefits.

255
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,640
It is only now that I realize

256
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,520
if their relationship wasn't genuine,

257
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,230
why did she have to repudiate Mo Yan Chen?

258
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,040
Now that Qu Tan Er has abandoned
this childhood friend of hers,

259
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,280
then she will no longer bother

260
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,190
to put up an act in front of me.

261
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,190
Your health is of the utmost importance,
Your Majesty.

262
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,350
No matter what they do,

263
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,000
they cannot escape from
Your Majesty's arrangement,

264
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,310
so there's no need to worry.

265
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,470
Even if we met, you wouldn't recognize me now...

266
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,760
Forget it.

267
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,350
I worried too much before.

268
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,520
Qu Mei Er would not let this go.

269
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,640
She won't let Qu Tan Er

270
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,680
treat this as a private matter.

271
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,110
Let's see how this will go down.

272
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,350
Many thanks to Official Chen and Official Su

273
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,590
for your help.

274
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,470
Once we succeed,

275
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,830
I will not forget your loyalty to me.

276
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,400
Long live Your Highness.

277
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,470
Your Highness, chances like this are rare.

278
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,590
Tomorrow, we will ask to impeach

279
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,160
Second Princess in front of Her Majesty.

280
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,560
But...

281
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,920
But what?

282
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,710
Forgive my bluntness,

283
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,070
but the current situation is dire.

284
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,070
Your Highness, you must not

285
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,640
be held down by your personal feelings this time,

286
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,640
you must draw the line with Mo Yan Chen.

287
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,070
This is for the best.

288
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,070
Right.

289
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,520
If Your Highness were to be involved with
Mo Yan Chen right now,

290
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,070
then in Her Majesty's eyes, it would be immoral.

291
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,190
I fully understand your concern.

292
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,880
However, my Prince Consort will only be

293
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,680
Mo Yan Chen, whenever it is.

294
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,760
I hope you keep this in mind.

295
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,190
Yes, Your Highness.

296
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,070
Speak up. What is with these memorials?

297
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,680
Your Majesty.

298
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,880
Second Princess's Prince Consort,
Mo Lian Cheng,

299
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,760
has ignored all tradition and acted disrespectfully
toward those of higher status.

300
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,560
Second Princess, being the head of the household,

301
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,230
not only has she not stopped him,

302
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,590
she hasn't fulfilled her duties either
and got carried away in her private life.

303
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,110
Furthermore, she repudiated her Main Prince Consort,
Mo Yan Chen, for no reason.

304
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,680
This is against cardinal guides
and constant virtues.

305
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,000
Is that really so?

306
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,830
Not a single word of lie, Your Majesty.

307
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,800
Your Majesty, according to Dongyue traditions,

308
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,560
after Mo Yan Chen was repudiated for no reason,

309
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,830
he suffered and was forced to
move into the memorial arch of chastity.

310
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,160
Second Princess being a princess,

311
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,190
is the foundation of our nation,
a descendant of the royal family.

312
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,070
But based on what she has done,

313
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,830
I recommend that she should be abolished.

314
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,070
Agreed.

315
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,430
I also agree.

316
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,280
I agree as well.

317
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,710
I, Qu Tan Er, am here to plead to Your Majesty.

318
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,430
Your Majesty, please clear Mo Yan Chen's name.

319
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,470
I would accept any punishment.

320
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,110
Call her in.

321
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,310
Greetings, Your Majesty.

322
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,520
Speak.

323
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,680
Now that Mo Yan Chen
was repudiated by me for no reason

324
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,310
and exiled to the memorial arch
of chastity to suffer.

325
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,520
Was it all my fault?

326
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,190
Second Princess repudiated him for no reason,
it is against order and morals.

327
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,040
Of course it is the fault of Second Princess.

328
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,230
That is correct, Official Chen.

329
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,880
If it is supposedly all my fault,

330
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,680
yet the victim is also suffering,

331
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,710
isn't that illogical?

332
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,190
Your Majesty,

333
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,950
I am at fault.

334
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,350
Therefore, the laws should be rewritten

335
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,160
to clear Mo Yan Chen's name.

336
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:49,110
Then, I will accept any punishment.

337
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,950
Qu Tan Er, if Her Majesty were to clear

338
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,000
Mo Yan Chen's name as you mentioned,

339
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,000
are you willing to take any punishment?

340
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:57,920
Of course.

341
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,310
So Eldest Princess,

342
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,950
do you think that Mo Yan Chen is innocent?

343
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,920
Of course Mo Yan Chen is innocent.

344
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,070
Everyone here knows it's true.

345
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,310
If so, then it is my plead to Your Majesty

346
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,310
to have a declaration made, so that innocent men
that were repudiated like Mo Yan Chen

347
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,520
can live a peaceful life.

348
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,880
Afterwards, I will accept
any punishment from Your Majesty

349
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,520
with no objection.

350
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,280
Since a conclusion has been made,

351
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,590
I will allow it.

352
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,560
Prepare to receive your punishments,
Second Princess.

353
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

354
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,460
(Princess's Residence)

355
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,400
Second Princess is grounded right now,

356
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,430
but she told me to bring these

357
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,920
to Eldest Young Master no matter what.

358
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,920
Oh.

359
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,040
Fourteenth Young Master,

360
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,640
how about I carry these for you?

361
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,880
As a woman, it is my responsibility.

362
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,560
Then I take half, and you take half.

363
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,310
Let's go.

364
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,400
Fourteenth Young Master,

365
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,160
when I taught you swordsmanship last time,

366
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,710
you said that I was cute.

367
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,230
If you don't like it,

368
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,880
then I'll never say it again!

369
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,880
But please don't be mad at me.

370
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,430
No, no, I'm not mad at you.

371
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,590
I'm a woman.

372
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,640
How can you say that I'm cute?

373
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,760
It's good to be cute.

374
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,160
Second Princess once told me,

375
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,190
to be cute, you must speak in reduplication.

376
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,880
Reduplication?

377
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,920
For example,

378
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,680
"eat food food", "take a nap nap", "so scared scared".

379
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,520
That sounds right.

380
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Reduplication?

381
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Then Fourteenth Young Master,

382
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,470
"hurry hurry" back to the "residence-dence".

383
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,640
Those "present-sents" are a bit heavy.

384
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,190
Be "careful careful".

385
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,070
When you come to visit the next time,

386
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,710
how about I teach you
"swordsmanship-ship" again?

387
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,070
Sounds good. I'll get going then.

388
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,310
Don't forget your promise of teaching me
"swordsmanship-ship".

389
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,920
But don't get "mad mad" at me

390
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,350
for being "clumsy clumsy".

391
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,800
Or else I'll be "depressed-pressed".

392
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,040
Then I'm leaving, Jing Xin Xin.

393
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,830
Fourteenth Young Master is way cuter than me.

394
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,590
Fourteenth "Young Master Master".

395
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,110
No, Fourteenth "Young Young Master".

396
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,920
Fourteenth Young...

397
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,560
Why is this reduplication thing so hard?

398
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,520
Fourteenth Young...

399
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,040
Jing Xin Xin.

400
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,680
Your Majesty,

401
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,920
are you perhaps suspecting
that Second Princess' actions today

402
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,830
had something to do with Mo Yuan Long?

403
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,280
Since when did she care about laws?

404
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,470
She was definitely prepared for today.

405
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,430
It's just a matter of whether
Qu Tan Er and Mo Lian Cheng

406
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,710
are pawns of Mo Yuan Long

407
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,110
or his allies.

408
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,680
Eighth Young Master of the Mo family...

409
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,880
How about I go and investigate what they're up to?

410
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,430
Mo Lian Cheng has acted immorally.

411
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,070
Second Princess's Residence's conduct
needs to be rectified.

412
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,710
Get Su Yue La into the residence for rectification.

413
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,430
Understood.

414
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,680
I hope that Official Su
won't let Your Majesty down

415
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,800
and find the evidence

416
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
of Second Princess being beguiled
by Mo Yuan Long.

417
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,640
Second Princess.

418
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,470
Second Princess, Qu Tan Er, humbly accept the decree.

419
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,040
By the grace of heaven's will,
Her Majesty hereby proclaims...

420
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,590
Troubles have constantly arisen
in Second Princess's Residence.

421
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,070
Secondary Prince Consort, Mo Lian Cheng,
disrespected those of higher status.

422
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,350
Cardinal guides and constant virtues
were violated.

423
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,710
Second Princess, Qu Tan Er,
focused solely on her romantic relationships

424
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,760
and neglected her studies.

425
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,400
Thus, Her Majesty has mandated
Secretary of State, Su Yue La,

426
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,470
to supervise the rectification in the residence
so that all returns to normal.

427
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,190
That is all.

428
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,830
Second Princess, please accept the decree.

429
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,040
I humbly accept the decree.

430
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,230
Official Su.

431
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,230
You came in such grandeur.

432
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,230
Those who knew might think
you're here to pass on the decree,

433
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,880
those who didn't would think you're here
to confiscate the residence.

434
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,230
Official Su.

435
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,400
Second Princess has got a quick mouth.

436
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,710
Please forgive her, Official Su.

437
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,280
Official Su, may I ask

438
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,040
if all this rectification business

439
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,800
has a set time?

440
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,070
Such as, at what hour
do you enter the residence

441
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,520
and at what hour do you leave for the palace?

442
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,110
What Her Majesty intended is that

443
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,590
from now on, I no longer need to return to the palace.

444
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,000
Until I believe that

445
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,430
the cardinal guides
and constant virtues have been

446
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
reestablished in Second Princess's Residence.

447
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,430
You're staying?

448
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,040
She's planning to walk all over me, huh?

449
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,470
Jing Xin.

450
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,640
Settle Official Su down in a nice guest room

451
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,590
and prepare rooms
for the servants from the palace.

452
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,000
Yes.

453
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It hasn't been long since the position of
Main Prince Consort has become vacant,

454
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,560
and you, Secondary Prince Consort,
have already taken charge of the household.

455
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,310
Official Su, it doesn't seem like you are here
to reestablish the guides and virtues,

456
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,880
but rather, it appears you're here for a fight.

457
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,310
I'm only here because of Her Majesty's orders.

458
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,310
Second Princess, I warn you not to
deduce Her Majesty's thoughts.

459
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,110
I think that Su Yue La

460
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,950
is just using the decree to make a show of force.

461
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,000
It's clear that

462
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,830
she's here to take her revenge

463
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,070
about her little brother losing out in
the harem selection.

464
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,000
Su Yue La is not hard to deal with,

465
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,920
but I'm afraid Her Majesty is behind this.

466
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,920
However, we have indeed been

467
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,830
a little high-key these days.

468
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,000
We've been out promoting
financial freedom for men

469
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,470
and promoting the freedom to divorce.

470
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,760
I think Her Majesty is warning us

471
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,310
to not try to usurp her power.

472
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,430
She's telling us to lay low.

473
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,310
If she wants to punish you,

474
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,920
she has other ways of doing it.

475
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,000
She definitely has something
she wants to investigate,

476
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,560
or else she didn't have to send an official
to stay over at the residence.

477
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,590
Well, in my opinion,

478
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,800
Her Majesty just wants to take you into her harem.

479
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,520
She sent Su Yue La here

480
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,880
to see whether

481
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,040
our bond is unbreakable

482
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,190
or as fragile as glass.

483
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,400
Kisses, hugs, and lift you high.

484
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,560
Why don't you tell me
if our bond is unbreakable or not?

485
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,400
Look at you, being a quick-learner.

486
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,880
We would need Su Yue La to help us

487
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,040
decipher the true intent of Her Majesty.

488
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,640
For now, we will deal with challenges
as they come up.

489
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,190
When the time is right,

490
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,680
she will let the cat out of the bag.

491
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,800
Then... where's my kiss?

492
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,640
You!

493
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,560
How can you do such a shameful act

494
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,470
under broad daylight?

495
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,760
And you call yourself a royal? How shameful!

496
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,430
It's Secondary Prince Consort's fault
for being so charming

497
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,320
that I couldn't resist him.

498
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,190
Very well.

499
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,600
It seems that Secondary Prince Consort
knows a lot about seduction techniques,

500
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,040
but nothing about the moral codes for men.

501
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,670
Our first lesson in etiquette

502
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,120
would be learning
Three Obediences and Four Virtues.

503
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,040
Men should comply by Three Obediences
in their lifetime.

504
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,430
None is their independence.

505
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:51,470
The unmarried shalt obey their mother.
The married shalt obey their wife.

506
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,950
The widowed shalt obey…

507
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,430
Secondary Prince Consort,
do you know what Four Virtues are?

508
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,910
Four Virtues are

509
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,430
ethics, speech,

510
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,710
visage, and skill.

511
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:12,910
A virtuous man should act
with dignity and politeness.

512
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,800
A virtuous household should be

513
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:21,630
tranquil and dignified,

514
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,360
modest and unsullied.

515
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,660
(Sand Vulture)
[*A slang which means "moron"]

516
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,190
How strange!

517
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,470
Why are there still mosquitoes
at this time of year?

518
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,230
Shoo shoo.

519
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,870
You have my thanks, Your Highness.

520
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,230
It's nothing. No need to thank me.

521
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,560
Then I'll continue...?

522
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,360
Go ahead.

523
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:55,040
A virtuous husband should act
with dignity and politeness.

524
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,280
A virtuous household should be

525
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,910
tranquil and dignified,

526
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,120
modest and unsullied.

527
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:12,840
Now let's talk about
the speech of a virtuous husband,

528
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,630
that is to not belittle, to not speak
with magniloquence, and to not double-tongue.

529
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,430
(idiot)
[*literally "Sand Vulture", means idiot]

530
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,520
With his wife...

531
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,660
Sand Vulture?

532
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,870
What's this?

533
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,430
This is the Prince Consort
complimenting Official Su.

534
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,230
You might not know this,

535
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
but it is said that

536
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,630
the "Sand Vulture" is a legendary beast.

537
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,280
People say that it has feathers
that shine like the golden sun.

538
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,760
It has a mighty body

539
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,150
that allows it to fly tirelessly
for thousands of miles.

540
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,800
In Prince Consort's heart,

541
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,360
Official Su, you are that big Sand Vulture!

542
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,630
Princess's order is the most important.

543
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,870
Wait a minute!

544
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,560
How can you touch the inkstone
with your bare hands

545
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,120
when grinding the inkstone?

546
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,600
You should wrap it with a piece of paper

547
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,800
as dirtying your hand with ink is unsightly.

548
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,520
Then let me check

549
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,150
if Prince Consort's hand

550
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,560
is dirtied with ink.

551
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,280
Those slender fingers of his are so fair.

552
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,560
Very well.

553
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,040
Then let me see if

554
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,520
any ink has gotten on

555
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,630
