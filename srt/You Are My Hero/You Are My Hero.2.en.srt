Dr. Shao.

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,280
Have you talked to

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,160
the academy?

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,040
I’ve taken care of it.

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,520
I’ll be back for two years

28
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,480
as an exchange doctor.

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,720
Everyone knows

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,160
that the domestic
neurosurgery technology

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,880
has been developing rapidly.

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,880
They also hope

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,040
that we can enrich our experience

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,480
on the front lines.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,600
Great, we will wait for you.

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,720
See you later.

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,400
Okay.

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,470
Let’s go.

39
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,550
Dr. Shao.

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,680
I’m a resident neurosurgeon

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,640
in this hospital, Mi Ka.

42
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,040
I’ve read all of your articles

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,720
published in

44
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,400
this magazine.

45
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,840
I really admire you.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,720
Thank you.

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,970
Excuse me.

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,720
Dr. Shao!

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,720
Dr. Shao, just give me a second.

50
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,480
Sorry.

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
I said I need to catch a plane.

52
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,600
I just need one second.

53
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,440
It’s just... I...

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,360
Dr. Shao.

55
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,200
I have a

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,280
very close friend

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,280
who has grade 3 high-grade glioma.

58
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
After three operations,

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,000
she relapsed.

60
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,360
Her body ached all over.

61
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,720
I read your innovative treatment

62
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,360
published in the magazine

63
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
which can drastically reduce

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,960
the pain of the patient.

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,200
This is her medical record.

66
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,240
Please take a look.

67
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,040
She has been sick for so long

68
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,280
and she has her own attending doctor.

69
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,560
I don’t know her medical history.

70
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,480
I can’t give you

71
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,680
any accurate suggestion.

72
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,480
You just said

73
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,920
patients should live with dignity.

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,620
Why would you reject me

75
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,890
without even reading

76
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,720
her medical record?

77
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,540
As a doctor,

78
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,280
it’s very unprofessional

79
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,400
to get too attached

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
to the patient.

81
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
If being numb is professional,

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,800
I’m willing to be
unprofessional all the time.

83
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,360
This is a life.

84
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,640
Even there is a silver lining,

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,400
she shouldn’t be given up.

86
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,800
Your phone.

87
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,320
My contact information,

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,880
her pathology report

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
and the medical records are all in it.

90
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,920
I will reply to you after I read it.

91
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,800
Getting attached to the patient

92
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,240
will impair your rational judgment.

93
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,360
It’s very unprofessional.

94
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,680
But compared to being numb,

95
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,280
the former is better.

96
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,400
Thank you, Dr. Shao!

97
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Mi Ka is pretty bold.

98
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,830
It’s late and she hasn’t come back.

99
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,070
She is bold enough.

100
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,120
Where did you two go?

101
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,120
We went to the grocery store

102
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,040
to buy popsicles.

103
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,800
Don’t you two have a period now?

104
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,760
Why...

105
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Why are you eating popsicles?

106
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,640
We lied to that stupid instructor.

107
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,480
I hate running.

108
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,520
Great.

109
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,350
Sorry.

110
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,000
It’s okay.

111
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,080
Thank you.

112
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,960
No problem.

113
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,360
Have you forgotten me so soon?

114
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
You are the kind guy

115
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,080
who sent me to the city?

116
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,080
You are also here for shopping?

117
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah.

118
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,040
Are you going back to the base later?

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,960
Yeah.

120
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,280
Let me pay it for you.

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,880
No need.

122
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,440
It’s okay. You’re welcome.

123
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,600
Captain Xing.

124
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,640
Captain Xing?

125
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,040
Are you Xing Kelei?

126
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,880
Captain Xing!

127
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,960
I got the person you want.

128
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,160
What are you waiting for?

129
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,040
Ring the bell! Fall in now!

130
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,120
Yes!

131
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,280
I’m done.

132
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,480
Mi Ka.

133
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,760
When did you come back?

134
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,760
My phone was taken away by Shu Sir.

135
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,320
He doesn’t allow me to notify you.

136
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,760
Who is that?

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,080
He looks handsome.

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,640
I think

139
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,680
he’s more handsome than Shu Sir.

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,200
Why are you so chatty?

141
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Quiet!

142
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,320
Let me make an introduction.

143
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,800
This is our chief instructor,

144
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,120
Xing Kelei.

145
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,240
What brings him here?

146
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,440
Zhang Qingqing. Chen Xiaoyan.

147
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,440
Out.

148
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,760
Take 10 laps around the track.

149
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
20 laps if you don’t get started now.

150
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,640
I know you have

151
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,360
heard

152
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,880
what kind of person I am.

153
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
I don’t think I need to

154
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,400
waste the time.

155
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,720
If any of you

156
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,680
wants to slack off,

157
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,240
play tricks and goof off
like these two people,

158
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,360
I advise you to leave now.

159
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,160
I also promise that such people

160
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,360
won’t get the Certificate of Completion.

161
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,720
Since no one wants to leave,

162
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,040
I hope you can

163
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,360
get rid of your bad habits!

164
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,600
Since you chose to be here,

165
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,800
you must abide by the discipline here

166
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,200
and obey orders.

167
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,400
Understand?

168
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,920
Yes!

169
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,200
Understand?

170
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,760
Yes!

171
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,000
This afternoon,

172
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,920
some of you left the base
without permission.

173
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,920
Who is so unruly?

174
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,880
It doesn’t matter who this person is.

175
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,280
The important thing is

176
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,280
that you are a team.

177
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,400
All of you

178
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,280
will be punished

179
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,080
because of this person.

180
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,920
You were fifteen minutes late
for the assembly.

181
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,480
Everyone.

182
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,920
Take fifteen laps!

183
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,200
That person is such a pest.

184
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,080
Turn left!

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,720
Double, march!

186
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,080
No way.

187
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,160
I can’t do it. I’m exhausted.

188
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,360
I can’t keep running.

189
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,440
As men, you only took a few laps

190
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,920
and you are panting like this.

191
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,440
If we send you to the disaster area,

192
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,360
should they save you

193
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,560
or you save others?

194
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,440
You’d better not shake your hands

195
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,960
when you hold the scalpel

196
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,600
and cut off the large intestine

197
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,440
as the cecum.

198
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,160
Keep running!

199
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,240
Now you know

200
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,120
how weak you are!

201
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,640
Come on!

202
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,320
All rise!

203
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,110
Get up.

204
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,920
In the large-scale disaster area,

205
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,360
the public security officers,
armed police and firefighters

206
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,000
have physical strength,

207
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,720
but we lack the professional

208
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,720
medical knowledge!

209
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
As doctors,

210
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,040
you are the opposite of us.

211
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,440
What you lack

212
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,560
is adaptability and physical fitness

213
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,040
in extreme environments!

214
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,000
Our training

215
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,520
is to select

216
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,440
talents

217
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,280
with these two abilities

218
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,680
for saving

219
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,960
more lives!

220
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,480
You are not here for fun!

221
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,520
Someone said

222
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,240
that our training is just formalism.

223
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,440
Good.

224
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,280
From tomorrow,

225
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,560
the real training will start!

226
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,960
Attention!

227
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,200
You’ve worked hard.

228
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,760
Dismiss!

229
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,680
I was wondering
why he was so nice to me.

230
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,680
He even gave me a ride.

231
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,520
He was setting a trap

232
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,920
for me to jump into.

233
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,640
I told you to be careful.

234
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,000
He still got you.

235
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,680
And Shu Sir.

236
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,240
How could he not notice

237
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,400
that there was one person missing?

238
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,640
You went out and ran into Xing Kelei.

239
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,680
Aren’t you asking for trouble?

240
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,880
It happened for a reason.

241
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,520
It’s my fault

242
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,080
to leave the base without permission.

243
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,560
But

244
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,680
he could have

245
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,880
exposed me in the first place.

246
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,640
Right?

247
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,960
He pretended to be nice

248
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
and sent me out.

249
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,000
Then

250
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,920
he took the chance
and eavesdropped on me,

251
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,240
so he could counterattack us.

252
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,600
He is too insidious and cunning.

253
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,960
He is extremely insidious and cunning.

254
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,240
You’d better think about

255
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,040
how to deal with it.

256
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,160
What do you mean?

257
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,400
He punished me, didn’t he?

258
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,040
What else can I do?

259
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,120
Have you forgotten

260
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,320
how our senior failed to

261
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,720
get the Certificate
of Completion last time?

262
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Do you want to be

263
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,480
the first person

264
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,400
who fails to get

265
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,760
the certificate in Renxin Hospital?

266
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,360
So what?

267
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,560
It won’t be that serious, right?

268
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,960
Good luck with that.

269
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,200
Xing… Xing Sir.

270
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,560
I am sorry.

271
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Can you forgive me?

272
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,000
No...

273
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,960
Xing Sir, sorry.

274
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
Can you forgive me?

275
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,840
Xing Sir.

276
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,440
Please accept

277
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,120
my apology.

278
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,560
Xing Sir, sorry.

279
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,680
Sorry. I was wrong.

280
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,520
Xing Sir, I was wrong.

281
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,040
I was wrong, can you forgive me?

282
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,720
I will receive any punishment.

283
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,400
Xing Sir.

284
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,520
Are you a thief?

285
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,800
You are sneaky.

286
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,810
(Tiger Assault Team)

287
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,160
Mi Ka, right?

288
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,960
Yes.

289
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,200
Dr. Mi did such a grand gesture.

290
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,400
How do you think

291
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,920
I should deal with you?

292
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,880
I know I was wrong.

293
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,320
You can punish me as you want.

294
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,640
Leaving the base without permission

295
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,040
should get you fired.

296
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,960
Is it that serious?

297
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,200
Xing Sir.

298
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
I didn’t have other choices,

299
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,160
so I didn’t ask for leave. You...

300
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,800
I know you are right.

301
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,560
But don’t fire me, please.

302
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,400
At here,

303
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,480
any of your reasons

304
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
can’t be called a reason.

305
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,600
Do you understand?

306
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,520
Deduct 30 points.
Record a major demerit.

307
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,480
If it happens one more time,

308
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,000
you will leave right away.

309
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,400
Thank you, sir.

310
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,760
It’s too early. I haven’t finished it.

311
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,440
Clean the toilets today

312
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,640
after the training is over.

313
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,200
Okay.

314
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,400
All of it?

315
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,640
Yes.

316
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,270
Is there any problem?

317
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,000
No problem.

318
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,780
I will clean

319
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,530
the toilets carefully.

320
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,210
You can leave.

321
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,840
Thank you, sir.

322
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,000
Dear Mr. Special Policeman.

323
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,640
First, please accept

324
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,960
my salute to you.

325
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,800
Thank you for protecting us

326
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
with your life

327
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,640
in the jewelry store rescue operation.

328
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,360
It was like a nightmare,

329
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,520
but I am also lucky.

330
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,840
I want to

331
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,480
thank you again.

332
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,360
Mi Ka.

333
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,320
Hold it tight, I will take you out.

334
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,600
Then what?

335
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,920
Blow me up in another place?

336
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,480
You won’t die.

337
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,600
I will take you to
the explosion-proof point.

338
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,980
(Not Available)

339
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,520
When do we have

340
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,480
such a young and beautiful

341
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,190
cleaning lady?

342
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:43,840
Don’t talk nonsense.

343
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,240
She is a trainee.

344
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,200
So you are punished
to clean the toilets?

345
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,560
Why don’t you go inside?

346
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,960
There is someone inside.

347
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,760
Based on your expression, do you have

348
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,440
any problem with cleaning?

349
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,480
Do you have nothing better to do?

350
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,360
It’s just cleaning.

351
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,480
What problem can I have?

352
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,240
I...

353
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,240
Captain Xing was inside.

354
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,400
I mean, I put a sign here.

355
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,400
It says Not Available.

356
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,960
Why did you still go inside?

357
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
I didn’t use it.

358
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,840
Why did you go inside
if you didn’t use it?

359
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,060
Yeah.

360
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,200
Why did you go inside
if you didn’t use it?

361
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,240
Do you have nothing to do?

362
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,600
No.

363
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,920
Are you finished?

364
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,600
I’ll continue to clean it
if you are finished.

365
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,280
Li Nian.

366
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,560
Yes!

367
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,000
Five kilometers.

368
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,120
Bear load.

369
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,680
Yes!

370
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,640
Go ahead. Hurry up.

371
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,760
Big mouth.

372
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,760
I’m here to check

373
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,960
whether the toilet is clean.

374
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,560
I didn’t use it.

375
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,240
What a meddler.

376
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,080
One minute ago,

377
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
I just finished cleaning

378
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,120
all the men’s toilets in the base.

379
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,240
I don’t know

380
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,440
why they need so many
men’s toilets here.

381
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,360
There will be no hot water
and the bathroom will be closed

382
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
if you don’t take a shower now.

383
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,980
(Bathroom)

384
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,470
Hey.

385
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,600
Xing Sir.

386
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,800
I’m not hey. My name is Mi Ka.

387
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,240
I have cleaned all the toilets.

388
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,520
Is there anything else?

389
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Did I say that you only
need to clean the toilets?

390
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,240
Clean the bathroom.

391
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,680
Also the bathroom?

392
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,080
Is there an end?

393
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,360
Well, do you have a problem?

394
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,400
Not at all.

395
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,960
Mop the ground.

396
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,280
Lock the door after you shower.

397
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,760
She will take a shower
after cleaning the bathroom.

398
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,560
Xing Sir.

399
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,440
Shouldn’t you be interviewed

400
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,120
by the television director

401
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,560
and shoot the promotional video?

402
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,880
You do it.

403
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,160
I need to train them later.

404
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,880
I will train them.
You will do the interview.

405
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,240
That’s not what you said.

406
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,320
I’m the captain.

407
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,720
Can’t I change my order?

408
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,760
You do it.

409
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,040
Yes!

410
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,960
When you do emergency rescues

411
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,600
in the wild and in the mountains,

412
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,000
most of the time we will use

413
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,760
such an emergency stretcher.

414
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,240
These protective belts

415
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,600
are relatively more important.

416
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,280
The protective belts must be fastened

417
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,840
to prevent slipping

418
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,640
and sliding.

419
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,920
Mi Ka.

420
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,680
Work with me.

421
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,920
How?

422
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,200
Lie down.

423
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,320
Come on, step on it well.

424
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,840
Hands up.

425
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,960
Can I put my hands down?

426
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,920
Yes.

427
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,440
Do you understand?

428
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,400
Girls, try it first.

429
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,480
Unfasten it and do it again.

430
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,720
Come on.

431
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,720
He just wants to make me look funny.

432
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,480
I thought he was nice

433
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,920
to let me take a shower.

434
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,200
I’m really stupid.

435
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,800
Take a shower?

436
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,440
No. No.

437
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,560
I think you two

438
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,000
just don’t get along.

439
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,080
Exactly.

440
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:42,990
Mi Ka.

441
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,600
I think you should

442
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,440
rename yourself as Mi Kelei.

443
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,000
You are his jinx.

444
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,760
You will bring

445
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,800
bad luck to him.

446
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,840
He will fall down the steps,

447
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,200
trip when he climbs the mountain,

448
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,280
and choke... choke

449
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,000
when he drinks water.

450
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,240
He won’t get enough to eat.

451
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,760
-No more Xing Kelei.
-Stop it.

452
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,440
Mi Kelei.

453
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,230
-Mi Kelei.
-Ke... Ke...

454
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,880
Is it funny?

455
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,280
I will tell it to you every day.

456
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,640
Such a fool.

457
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,280
We don’t know

458
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,440
what the next training is.

459
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,280
Why are you washing your hair now?

460
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,040
I cleaned the toilets.

461
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,920
I feel that I stink.

462
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,760
Go ahead and wash it.

463
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,880
Thank you.

464
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,720
It’s good.

465
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,680
Sorry, Xing Sir.

466
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,280
I’m sorry.

467
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,000
The training this afternoon
is about to start.

468
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,920
Hurry up.

469
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,480
Okay.

470
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,960
Sorry, Xing Sir.

471
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,800
It’s okay.

472
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,120
You know

473
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,440
that I didn’t do it on purpose.

474
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,120
Who knows?

475
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,880
Get up.

476
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,680
I’ll be there right away.

477
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,360
Why am I so unlucky
every time I see you?

478
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,380
(Special Police Training Base)
Attention!

479
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,520
About turn!

480
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
About turn!

481
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,440
Dress right!

482
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,280
Excuse me.

483
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,920
Off limits
to all unauthorized personnel.

484
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,720
I know it.

485
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,320
That’s why they send you

486
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,520
to pick me up, right?

487
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,920
It’s me.

488
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,400
I’m the television director,

489
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Ruan Qingxia.

490
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,320
You have added me
as your WeChat contact.

491
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,480
(Ruan Qingxia)
Really?

492
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,040
The Photoshop retouching is too much,

493
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,400
I almost can’t recognize you.

494
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,280
I mean your picture is beautiful.

495
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,160
You mean I’m ugly in person.

496
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,000
Hello.

497
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,160
My name is Shu Wenbo.

498
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,480
Welcome to interview us.

499
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,160
Please come inside.

500
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,480
I’ll carry the equipment for you.

501
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,800
It’s not my equipment.

502
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,080
It’s my luggage.

503
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,160
Don’t you only stay here for three days?

504
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,280
Do you have any problems?

505
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,640
No, not at all.

506
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,520
Wait a moment.

507
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,960
Let’s go.

508
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,040
Where is this place?

509
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,960
This is our dormitory.

510
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,640
That’s where you will live.

511
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
We have arrived.

512
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,120
Let’s go.

513
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,160
If you are

514
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,440
not used to living here,

515
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,520
or if you need anything,

516
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,200
just tell me directly.

517
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,800
I...!

518
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,360
I just want to remind you

519
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,120
that there is a problem with the zipper

520
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,160
and you need to be careful.

521
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,120
I mean,

522
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,360
why didn’t you warn me earlier?

523
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,400
-You...
-Well...

524
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,710
Sorry, I’ll pick them up for you.

525
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,340
I’ll pick them up.

526
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,160
I mean...

527
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,860
Well...

528
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,440
They will be deformed
if you squeeze them!

529
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,800
Put them down now!

530
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,960
No...

531
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,560
Sorry.

532
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,720
I didn’t mean it. I...

533
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,920
Well, I’ll pick them up for you.

534
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
My desert rose.

535
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,960
It’s broken like this before it’s used.

536
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,520
I’m sorry!

537
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,080
I will buy another one for you.

538
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,240
You can’t buy it in China.

539
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,200
I asked a friend to buy it.

540
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,880
Okay, let me help you

541
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,670
get the suitcase inside.

542
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,760
The stretcher swung. Take 20 laps.

543
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,980
(The Score of Emergency Rescue Training)
Next group.

544
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,960
Irregular fixation of the wounded.

545
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,600
Take 20 laps.

546
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,120
Come on, next group.

547
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,400
Next group!

548
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,780
Oh my goodness.

549
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,450
Good. Well done.

550
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,000
I’m so scared.

551
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,720
The last group

552
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
failed.

553
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,200
Everybody will take 20 laps
this afternoon.

554
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Why?

555
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,120
Xing Sir.

556
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,240
Are you professional at all?

557
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,440
Our stretcher is fine.

558
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,800
The wounded is fine.

559
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,200
How did we fail?

560
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,200
You can’t just

561
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,040
fail my whole group

562
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,560
because of

563
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,280
our personal grievances.

564
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,760
Do you think you passed it?

565
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,160
Of course.

566
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Li Nian! Give her a helmet!

567
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,640
Do you think

568
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,480
you can pass it now?

569
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,600
No.

570
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,360
The place we fastened the belt is low,

571
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,480
leading to the instability
of the upper body.

572
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,000
Without a helmet,

573
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,160
I might have

574
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,800
wrecked my head.

575
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,240
The most important thing about
emergency rescue

576
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,400
is to not let the wounded

577
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,800
get hurt again.

578
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,960
But you guys

579
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,920
would take away their lives directly.

580
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,040
Just like I said,

581
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,880
every part is crucial

582
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,680
and needs to be practiced repeatedly.

583
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,200
Are you convinced?

584
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,600
Yes.

585
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,920
Accept the punishment then!

586
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,000
Dismiss!

587
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,720
Xing Sir.

588
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,560
Your helmet.

589
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,800
Sorry.

590
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,600
My hands were shaking.
I couldn’t hold it steady.

591
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,520
A surgeon’s hands can’t be shaking.

592
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,240
See me alone for training
at two o’clock in the afternoon.

593
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,040
A surgeon’s hands can’t be shaking.

594
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,000
I can’t help it.

595
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,550
One! Two!

596
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,400
This is

597
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,080
our lift vehicle.

598
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,200
The shelf

599
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,040
can be lifted up

600
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,360
which can help our snipers

601
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,960
shoot and kill the suspect.

602
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,240
This vehicle is very interesting.

603
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,200
It is an extendable vehicle.

604
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,320
This shelf

605
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,200
can stretch out a lot.

606
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,720
It’s generally used on bridges.

607
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,560
Okay.

608
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,440
Can I see it?

609
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,240
Sure.

610
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,400
Let’s look at the next vehicle.

611
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,800
-Okay.
-Let’s go.

612
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,880
This is an armored assault vehicle.

613
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,160
It’s three-level bulletproof.

614
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,640
There are gunports on the body

615
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,440
and there is a rotating turret on it.

616
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,560
Electric tear-gas launcher.

617
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,400
Can I take a look inside?

618
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,240
Yes.

619
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Be careful.

620
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,000
This is an independent lift-up

621
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,880
monitor cradle head

622
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,280
which can allow the commandos

623
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:45,930
to carry out surveillance and shooting

624
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,800
without leaving

625
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,680
the vehicle.

626
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,160
Let’s check the vehicle ahead.

627
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,840
Okay.

628
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,880
Hello.

629
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,920
I’m Shao Yuhan.

630
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,000
Dr. Shao.

631
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,920
Well,

632
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,440
there is a

633
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,040
doctor friend of mine abroad

634
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,960
who is doing

635
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,440
an experimental study
of Ye Xiaoman’s case.

636
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,520
I sent him

637
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,160
some information.

638
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,840
He asked for extra information.

639
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,040
Do you have time

640
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,000
to bring Ye Xiaoman

641
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,440
to our hospital this afternoon?

642
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,400
No problem.

643
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,160
Okay.

644
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,120
Does she have any

645
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,760
family members here?

646
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,680
No.

647
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,440
Her family is in her hometown.

648
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,520
We are from the same place.

649
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,880
She came here

650
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,640
for treatment.

651
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,440
I’m living with her.

652
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,520
Then you

653
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,230
come here with her.

654
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,000
You are a doctor

655
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,730
and also her friend.

656
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,400
She can be more at ease
if you are there.

657
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,840
Okay, I’ll be there right away.

658
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,840
Okay.

659
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,360
Captain Xing, I...

660
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:40,960
Something came up.

661
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,320
Mi Ka!

662
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,000
She is crazy.

663
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,080
This is a bulletproof helmet.

664
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,760
This is a night vision.

665
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,520
What is this?

666
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,560
This is the infrared

667
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,760
retractable video inspectoscope,

668
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,000
which is generally used in large places

669
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,080
for screening some venues

670
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,120
and vehicles.

671
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,840
It can also be used at night.

672
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,400
This is an imaging device.

673
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,420
Can I pick it up and have a look?

674
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,200
Sure.

675
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,400
This is very interesting.

676
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
It’s like a tumbler.

677
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,600
When you throw it,

678
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,960
its lens will always be upward.

679
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,040
It can send

680
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,160
the image and sound

681
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,240
within a hundred meters

682
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,200
back to our terminal.

683
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,400
It’s amazing.

684
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,520
What’s in this big box?

685
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,920
This is an electric climber.

686
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,900
It’s generally

687
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,620
for climbing over obstacles,
climbing buildings,

688
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,730
rescuing the wounded members

689
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,720
in the stairwell

690
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,680
and transferring equipment.

691
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,960
What’s this?

692
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,040
This is a pair of capture gloves

693
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,200
with lithium battery.

694
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,560
It can make the suspect

695
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,320
lose the ability to resist immediately.

696
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,760
Do you want to feel it?

697
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,840
Okay.

698
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,630
What’s wrong?
Do you have something to do?

699
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,440
No.

700
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,320
Dr. Shao, thank you

701
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,840
for getting this chance

702
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,840
for Xiaoman.

703
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,000
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

704
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,520
a life

705
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,120
should not be given up.

706
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,840
I feel the same way.

707
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,630
Dr. Shao.

708
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:35,960
You are here.

709
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,640
Come on, have a seat.

710
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,220
Relax, it’s okay.

711
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,720
I am Shao Yuhan.

712
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,280
I’ve read your

713
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,120
medical report.

714
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,040
I don’t need to say it,

715
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,400
you should know

716
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,360
your condition.

717
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,360
I want to see you today

718
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
because there are some things

719
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,600
I want to talk to you

720
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,800
and I want to know your idea.

721
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,680
Well,

722
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,400
the medical research institute
where I work at

723
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,880
is developing

724
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,880
and conducting

725
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,520
clinical trials of a new drug.

726
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,240
Now it has reached the third period.

727
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,400
The effect is significant.

728
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,560
It’s mainly to suppress and reduce

729
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,800
the recurrence rate of glioma.

730
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,280
With the use

731
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,870
of this new drug,

732
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,400
there will be a series of treatments.

733
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,800
But the whole process

734
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,840
needs to be carried out abroad.

735
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,720
What I want to say is

736
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,760
I can help her

737
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,560
get this opportunity.

738
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,440
It’s great.

739
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,800
Thank you, Dr. Shao.

740
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,200
Is there any difficulty?

741
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
What’s wrong?

742
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,880
Are you worried

743
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,280
about the cost?

744
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,880
As for the cost,

745
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,120
because it’s a medical research,

746
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,200
the medical expense is exempted.

747
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,760
But you need to take care of

748
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,240
the living expenses.

749
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,640
It’s okay.

750
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,400
It’s destined.

751
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,120
Dr. Shao,

752
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,520
I am very grateful

753
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,160
that you get this chance for me.

754
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,040
What are you thinking about?

755
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,080
You have to find a way to do it.

756
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,120
I can

757
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,920
borrow the money from my parents.

758
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,320
I’ll think about it.

759
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,480
At that time when you
needed to buy materials,

760
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,760
you couldn’t pay your rent

761
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,440
but you didn’t
ask your parents for money.

762
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,720
How can you

763
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,560
do it now for me?

764
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,080
These are two different things.

765
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,560
Just leave it to me. I can fix it.

766
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,080
Thank you, Dr. Shao.

767
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,240
Pass it to me.

768
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,080
Be careful.

769
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,120
Great.

770
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,200
Pass it to me.

771
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,360
Great.

772
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,240
Let’s stop here.

773
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
I need some rest.

774
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,040
Captain Xing, you came
too strong today.

775
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,960
Captain Xing, well done today.

776
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,400
Very aggressive.

777
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,040
You gained a lot of points by yourself.

778
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,200
Captain Xing.

779
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,240
You crack down on us

780
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,080
in the training ground for so long,

781
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,710
now you vanquish us
in the basketball hall.

782
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,640
Why... why are you leaving now?

783
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,520
Who messed with him?

784
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,960
We dare not mess with him.

785
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,840
Only you dare do it.

786
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,340
One! Two! Three! Four!

787
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,720
Xing Sir.

788
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,440
Xing Sir, it was my fault

789
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,560
that I left yesterday

790
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,200
without asking for leave

791
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,280
in advance.

792
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,160
I sent you a message later.

793
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,840
Dr. Mi.

794
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,400
This is the second time.

795
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,760
You are fired.

796
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,000
Xing Sir.

797
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,680
I can clean the playground,

798
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
the toilets,

799
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,960
and the bathroom.

800
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,900
I can clean anywhere.

801
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,800
I can do whatever you want,

802
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,600
just don’t fire me.

803
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,680
I won’t punish anyone

804
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,240
because of

805
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,640
my personal emotions.

806
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,960
At here,

807
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,800
discipline is above everything.

808
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,240
I know that in your profession,

809
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,520
discipline is above everything.

810
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,720
But I didn’t go out

811
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,080
for other things.

812
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,000
I’m really...

813
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,400
Right now you are still emphasizing

814
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,200
your own reasons!

815
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,840
You put

816
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,240
your personal affairs first

817
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,200
during training,

818
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,280
if there is an emergency one day,

819
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,240
I’m not sure

820
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,840
what choice you will make.

821
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,240
If everyone

822
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,320
has a reason for their fault,

823
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,880
then the order means nothing.

824
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,480
I know no matter what I say now,

825
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,760
it’s all wrong.

826
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,800
But I’m not here

827
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,920
just to get a certificate.

828
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,040
I really want to learn something.

829
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,480
I have joined an emergency rescue team

830
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,160
since I was in college.

831
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,720
I hope I can

832
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,600
save some people

833
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,360
who need me.

834
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,960
I really hope

835
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,680
I can use what I learned

836
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,320
to help others.

837
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,680
It’s not for you.

838
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,360
I won’t leave.

839
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,200
It’s up to you.

840
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,000
You would never graduate
as long as I’m here.

841
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,160
I didn’t come here

842
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,640
for the certificate!

843
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,920
Mi Ka?

844
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,120
Why are you here?

845
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,520
I’m here to shoot a promotional video.

846
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,400
What happened?

847
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,800
Alright.

848
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,520
It’s okay.

849
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,280
(Male toilet)

850
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,000
Now you know

851
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,880
how miserable I am.

852
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,080
This game

853
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
is getting more difficult

854
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,680
as you pass the level one by one.

855
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,520
But there are people who still love it.

856
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,440
Why does him

857
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,840
have to pick on me all the time?

858
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,840
Life is interesting

859
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,800
when you do high challenges.

860
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,120
I’m serious now.

861
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,960
If a man is handsome enough,

862
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,480
you can ignore his personality.

863
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,240
Ruan Qingxia, you really are

864
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,720
hopeless.

865
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,400
I mean,

866
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,520
if you don’t want the certificate,

867
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,280
why are you staying here
and looking for suffering?

868
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,320
I’m willing to do it.

869
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,440
If I stay,

870
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,760
I can still learn something

871
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,880
which I can use later.

872
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,600
You are fired now.

873
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,880
Stop cleaning the toilet.

874
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,920
No, that’s a different matter.

875
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,440
I don’t want him

876
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,000
to have any more excuses

877
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,960
to drive me away.

878
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,280
But seriously,

879
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,520
I was there all day

880
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,560
when they were training.

881
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,680
It’s really hard.

882
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,480
Why are you looking for trouble?

883
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,560
I really want to stay.

884
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,400
I didn’t mean to break the rule.

885
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,120
I know.

886
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,120
I know you.

887
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,080
I was confident

888
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
when I came here

889
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,560
for training.

890
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,960
I thought I can go to

891
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,160
the emergency rescue team.

892
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,080
I didn’t expect such things to happen.

893
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,520
I thought Xiaoman

894
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,040
can be saved.

895
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,560
It’s still about money in the end.

896
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,040
Why nothing is

897
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,320
going well?

898
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,640
All right.

899
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,800
The saying goes well,

900
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,960
in the end, things will mend.

901
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,000
It will be solved.

902
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,880
It’s my phone.

903
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,200
Hello.

904
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,560
Dr. Shao.

905
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,360
Really?

906
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,560
That’s great. Great.

907
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,800
Okay. Okay.

908
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,560
Okay.

909
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,440
Thank you. Thank you.

910
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,520
Thank you. Goodbye.

911
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,440
Dr. Shao told me

912
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,560
that he found a charity fund

913
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,920
which can pay

914
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,520
part of the expenses for Xiaoman.

915
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,040
I’ll borrow some money

916
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,700
from my parents.

917
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,920
Xiaoman can be saved.

918
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,080
Really?

919
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,360
I told you!

920
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,210
You didn’t

921
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,530
suffer for nothing today.

922
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,160
Really?

923
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,400
I’m willing to sweep the floor
for many more days.

924
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,440
Today is field training.

925
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,960
Each group will have

926
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,680
a SWAT member

927
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,240
cooperating with you.

928
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,840
Now the people I name

929
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,280
line up in groups.

930
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,440

attention!

954
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,000
Dress right!

955
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,320
Eyes, front!

956
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
At ease, attention!

957
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,080
Turn right!

958
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,000
Forward, march!

959
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,640
Keep up.

960
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,840
Xing... Xing...

961
