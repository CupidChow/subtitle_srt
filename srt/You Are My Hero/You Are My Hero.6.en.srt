20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,920
Okay.

21
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,160
Wash the tissues and stop the bleeding.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,240
Yes.

23
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,680
Zhang Yang,

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,720
how are things going there?

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,600
Director Shao,

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,920
we’ve reached the point

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,560
and are ready for drainage.

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,800
There’s a lot of blood.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,040
I can’t stop it from bleeding.

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,320
You take it up.

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,840
See if there are

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,560
any remains of the bullet

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,440
in his brain.

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,130
Yes.

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,770
I’ll go to the other side.

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,240
How is he?

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,720
Director, see.

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
As the hematoma strips from the skull,

39
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,080
there is a lot of blood
from the superior vena cava.

40
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,360
Don’t worry. Let me see.

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,200
No, you can’t stop
the bleeding like this.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,680
Apply the gelatin sponge
to the bleeding surface.

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,680
Gelfoam pieces can be suspended.

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,560
Director,

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,000
his blood pressure is decreasing.

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,120
Inject plasma.

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,160
Is this an aortic angioma?

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,640
Why we didn’t see it

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,840
on the CT film?

50
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,320
We didn’t have the time

51
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,440
to do the vascular assessment.

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
It’s a plain scan,

53
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,520
so we’re not sure
of his vascular conditions.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,800
Director,

55
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,040
we’ve found

56
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,920
an aortic angioma here.

57
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,200
I can’t go over now.

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,960
Control his blood pressure

59
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,920
and don’t let the tumor rupture.

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,520
Okay.

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,840
We don’t have enough plasma.

62
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,080
How much plasma is left?

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,120
200 ml.

64
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,000
Tell the blood bank to send more.

65
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,000
Let Mi Ka help you

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,720
with the aneurysm clipping.

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,380
Okay.

68
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,160
Tell the blood bank to send more.

69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,720
Okay.

70
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,040
Prepare for an aneurysm clipping.

71
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,280
Mi Ka,

72
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,720
dissect the aneurysms
adherent to adjacent vasculature

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,800
for a temporary arterial occlusion.

74
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,360
Yes.

75
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,920
No need for
a temporary arterial occlusion.

76
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,360
You can leave it

77
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,600
when the tumor ruptures.

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,280
Okay.

79
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,960
Dissect the aneurysms

80
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,760
so you can see the aneurysm neck.

81
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,960
Yes.

82
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,200
Director Shao,
we’ve stopped the bleeding.

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,400
Okay, Zhang Yang, take over my work.

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,030
Okay.

85
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,760
Drain the hematoma.

86
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
I’ll check on how Jia Li is going.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,560
All right.

88
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,240
A successful aneurysm clipping.

89
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,440
No rupture.

90
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,240
Have you drained up the hematoma?

91
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,680
Yes.

92
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,280
Replace the bone flap.

93
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,280
Yes.

94
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,920
How is he?

95
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,200
Both surgeries were successful.

96
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,600
But they need to be sent

97
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,440
to the ICU

98
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,880
for further observations.

99
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,920
You can

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,880
rest now.

101
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,360
There’s another thing

102
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,270
I think I should tell you.

103
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
We found

104
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
an aortic angioma

105
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,880
in Xiaochao’s brain.

106
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,000
We’ve done what we should do,

107
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,320
but I can’t promise

108
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,040
there won’t be any side effects.

109
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,400
We need to check on him
when he wakes up.

110
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,920
We’ve been rude to you.

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,360
I’m sorry.

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
I’m a doctor.

113
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,520
My decision is based

114
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,600
on my ability and judgment.

115
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,440
You’re the police.

116
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,400
We see things differently.

117
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,360
So,

118
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,400
it’s understandable.

119
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,200
It’s not about right or wrong.

120
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,400
No need to apologize.

121
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,840
Thank you.

122
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,270
Certificate of Completion.

123
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,280
(Certificate of Completion, Mi Ka)

124
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,320
Mi Ka.

125
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:35,600
(ICU)

126
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,040
Why only you are here?

127
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,520
I’ve asked them to go home.

128
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,680
It’s no use staying here.

129
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,120
You can’t visit patients

130
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,240
in the ICU.

131
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,760
I know.

132
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,960
Have you eaten anything?

133
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,520
Thank you.

134
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,440
Just have some.

135
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,320
You must haven’t had

136
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,360
anything for the day.

137
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
I was as furious as Li Nian

138
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,480
when I heard the decision

139
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,000
Dr. Shao made.

140
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,360
They killed people,

141
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,160
sold drugs and robbed others.

142
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,480
But Xiaochao

143
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
is the best sniper

144
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,200
in our team.

145
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,280
We risked our lives

146
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,240
to catch them.

147
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,000
But what can we do?

148
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,600
We’re the police.

149
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
We’re the police.

150
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,840
We have no choice.

151
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,720
A doctor has to carry out

152
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,440
the Hippocratic Oath which says that

153
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,200
“I’ll abstain from all intentional

154
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,640
wrong-doing and harm

155
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,000
to my patients

156
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,320
even if it’s for the sake
of justice and benevolence”.

157
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,240
All lives are equal.

158
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,440
As a doctor,

159
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
I’ll always cherish lives.

160
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,680
You’re a policeman.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,880
You should uphold the law

162
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,280
and you did it.

163
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,320
I understand your choice.

164
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,320
But do you know that

165
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,880
Xiaochao was

166
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,120
a professional shooter?

167
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,680
He could have been chosen to

168
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,960
serve the national team,

169
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,600
but when he knew

170
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,240
that the police unit needs shooters,

171
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,360
he just came and joined us.

172
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,840
He was not that strong

173
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,160
and had nearly been dismissed.

174
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,520
I was with him

175
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,680
and kept cheering him up,

176
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,480
so he persevered.

177
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Staying in Tiger,

178
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,120
he must feel proud.

179
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Perhaps it would be better

180
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,480
if he has given it up.

181
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,600
At least,

182
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,920
he won’t be lying here.

183
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,880
He just told us

184
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,720
before he was sent to the mission

185
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,520
that he would soon get married

186
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,560
and he asked us to attend his wedding.

187
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,360
So, when I stood there this afternoon,

188
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,910
I was thinking

189
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
how I wish it could be me

190
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,080
who’s lying there.

191
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,160
I think he may

192
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,800
think the same as you.

193
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
He won’t like to see

194
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,440
you being pushed in.

195
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,440
Since the moment

196
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,160
I put on my police uniform,

197
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,960
I’ve been ready

198
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,720
to die for justice.

199
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,800
But when I saw him like this,

200
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,440
I still couldn’t take it.

201
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,080
When I was a kid,

202
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,600
I was given some toy doctor kits.

203
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
And then

204
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,200
every time when I

205
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,680
played the doctor,

206
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,280
other kids would visit me.

207
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,320
And I was thinking

208
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,840
that I would be a doctor someday

209
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,040
when I could

210
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,520
cure all patients in the world.

211
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,760
But when I did grow up

212
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,240
and become a doctor,

213
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,920
I only find that

214
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,040
I feel helpless about most things.

215
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,040
The first year of my internship,

216
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,600
a family of three

217
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,960
had a car accident on the highway.

218
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,080
I failed to save anyone of them.

219
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,760
I felt guilty

220
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,760
and helpless.

221
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,440
But then I thought

222
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,760
I had to continue my career,

223
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,560
so I could help

224
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,080
and save more people.

225
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,200
It’s the same for you.

226
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,280
Because of you,

227
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,600
we can live in

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,320
a safer world.

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,280
You’ve done what you should do

230
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,840
to Xiaochao.

231
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,840
Now you need to

232
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,960
pull yourself together

233
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
and believe us.

234
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,960
The surgery will be successful

235
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,040
and he’ll wake up.

236
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,680
Thanks.

237
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,240
You’ve stayed up late

238
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,200
but you would still spend your time
chatting with me.

239
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,480
No worries. I’ve gotten used to it.

240
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,200
I always work at night.

241
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,200
I was uncomfortable

242
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,360
at my first

243
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,560
internship year

244
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,200
to stay up every day.

245
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,680
So I always called my mother

246
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,560
and she would always

247
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,360
comfort me,

248
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,520
and ask me questions.

249
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,080
So, I thought I’d better

250
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,800
not bother her,

251
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,000
or she won’t sleep well.

252
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,400
Then I no longer told her

253
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,920
my duty schedule.

254
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
I didn’t want her to worry about me.

255
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,120
What about you?

256
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,760
Your family must

257
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,560
worry more about you
as you’re a policeman.

258
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,520
My family is abroad.

259
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,880
It’s inconvenient

260
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,680
for a policeman to go abroad,

261
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,560
so we didn’t see each other much.

262
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,600
That’s why

263
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,240
you need to

264
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,480
take care of yourself,

265
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,960
so they won’t

266
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,400
worry about you.

267
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,840
How can he do this?

268
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,520
Yes.

269
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,800
How shall we handle it?

270
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,120
Do you have

271
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,000
any other opinions?

272
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,600
As the former director of the ND,

273
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,360
though

274
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,760
I’m the vice-president
of the hospital now,

275
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,680
I feel shocked to

276
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,800
what Director Shao has done,

277
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,200
and worry about

278
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,440
the future of the ND.

279
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,280
It takes us ten years

280
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,360
to build Renxin hospital’s reputation

281
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,080
nationwide.

282
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,040
I don’t want to see

283
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,040
anyone with his adventurous way

284
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,000
ruin our reputation.

285
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,040
Mr. Zheng, I don’t think
it will be that serious.

286
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,440
Anyway, both of the surgeries

287
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,720
have been done successfully.

288
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,760
President Zhang,
what’s your opinion?

289
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,280
It’s true that

290
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,960
a doctor should

291
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,040
not break the rules of the hospital

292
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,880
when treating

293
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,280
patients.

294
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,480
President,

295
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,400
can I have a word?

296
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,640
Sure.

297
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,440
I’m just a junior doctor

298
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,840
that helped Director Shao
in the operation.

299
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
We are inexperienced

300
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,000
and I know I should not

301
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,160
have spoken in such an occasion.

302
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,840
But I want to tell you

303
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,320
some of my feelings and thoughts.

304
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
It has been my dream

305
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,920
to work here

306
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,920
since I became a medical student.

307
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,200
Every doctor here is

308
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,520
excellent.

309
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,360
I thought as long as

310
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,080
I worked hard enough,

311
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,640
I would put on
the while coat someday,

312
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,240
but not until yesterday

313
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,200
did I know what’s the meaning of it.

314
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,720
If because of the rules or regulations,

315
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,960
a doctor has to

316
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,080
choose whom to live

317
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,360
between two lives,

318
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,360
then what’s our original purpose

319
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,480
of being a doctor?

320
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,560
I was there

321
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
throughout the operation.

322
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,120
I think Director Shao

323
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,160
was confident

324
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,920
when he made the decision.

325
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,760
I think it shows

326
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,960
the expertise

327
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,040
and courage of a doctor,

328
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,800
which also have contributed

329
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,440
to our hospital’s reputation.

330
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,280
That’s all.

331
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,000
This junior doctor

332
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,360
understands that

333
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,120
lives and patients will always

334
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,000
be the first consideration

335
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,080
when a doctor makes the decision.

336
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,840
The municipal special police unit

337
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,640
has contacted Director He

338
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,960
and said they would

339
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,000
send us a banner as a gift.

340
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,240
This is their acknowledgment

341
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,280
of our work.

342
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
All high-tech here

343
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,960
is to save people’s lives.

344
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,880
We can sit there.

345
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,860
-Okay.
-What are you looking?

346
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,710
Why are you looking?

347
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,560
Wasn’t it them?

348
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,300
Yes.

349
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,600
The ND, right?

350
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,920
Yes, it was them yesterday.

351
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,640
Did you see them?
Are they from the ND?

352
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,320
Yes.

353
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,160
It was them.

354
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,760
The ND doctors.

355
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,360
Yes.

356
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
That’s strange.

357
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Yesterday, the whole hospital

358
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,520
had the rumor that
we were in trouble,

359
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,320
yet all of them are
praising us today.

360
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,920
Mi Ka, I’ve heard it that

361
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,280
you had convinced all of them

362
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,480
in the president’s meeting.

363
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,880
You’re amazing.

364
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,200
I just said what I thought,
all right?

365
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,760
Taste this.

366
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,720
Couldn’t you just focus on
your own food?

367
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,840
Isn’t it unhygienic

368
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,040
to clip dishes?

369
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,880
I haven’t used my chopsticks.

370
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,400
Mi Ka,

371
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,120
you’ll win Director Shao’s heart

372
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,200
as you’ve stood up for him.

373
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,160
I didn’t speak those words

374
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,680
to win his heart.

375
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,840
He Xiaoxiao,

376
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,920
you know nothing.

377
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,560
Mi Ka is honest and frank,

378
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,160
or silly and innocent.

379
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,020
You don’t know her.

380
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,760
Just shut up.

381
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,720
Did you just say I was silly?

382
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,520
Yes.

383
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,480
Just a joke.

384
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,440
Don’t worry.

385
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,040
(Outpatient)

386
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,570
Thanks.

387
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,120
No problem.

388
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,680
Xiaoman.

389
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,800
Xiaoman.

390
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,080
I’ve applied for

391
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,920
a domestic medical fund

392
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,280
and they can help you

393
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,360
with some living expenses.

394
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,360
Thank you!

395
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,240
Ye Xiaoman,

396
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,160
take care of yourself
when you’re abroad.

397
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,240
I want to see you

398
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
come back safe and sound.

399
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,480
Remember?

400
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,040
Mi Ka,

401
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,680
as I can’t make food
for you from now,

402
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,320
do have some other food
rather than instant noodles,

403
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,400
or you can

404
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,800
eat in the hospital canteen.

405
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,360
It’s almost the end

406
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,000
of the month.

407
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,880
Find someone to

408
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,960
share the rent with you.

409
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,680
Remember?

410
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,280
Don’t make me worry about you.

411
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,920
You can still make food
when you’re abroad.

412
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,800
And I’ll register
an official account with which

413
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,320
you can share the food photos
on the Internet.

414
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,680
Perhaps it will go viral.

415
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,400
Okay.

416
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,640
I’ll try.

417
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,120
Xiaoman.

418
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,120
It’s time to go.

419
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,880
See you.

420
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,720
See you.

421
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,040
Slowly.

422
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,640
Goodbye.

423
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,240
See you.

424
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,200
Let’s go back.

425
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,680
Isn’t he the new specialist of the ND,

426
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,720
Shao Yuhan?

427
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,760
That’s cool.

428
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,840
He has made a girl cry

429
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,520
only a few days after his arrival.

430
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,360
He was called by the president.

431
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,080
Perhaps he was in a bad mood.

432
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,240
Excuse me.

433
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,800
I’m not in a bad mood.

434
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,680
It’s fine to be sad.

435
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,440
But don’t indulge in it.

436
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Don’t be like this

437
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,280
when you’re at work.

438
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,200
Okay, Director Shao.

439
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,200
Dr. Zhang,

440
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,320
this the examination report
of the eighth bed.

441
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,920
Please sign here.

442
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,880
I heard that Mi Ka was crying

443
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,200
after being scolded by Director Shao.

444
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,720
What happened?

445
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,560
I just passed by the ER

446
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
and they said

447
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,640
they saw Mi Ka crying

448
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,720
when followed Director Shao

449
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,120
into the elevator.

450
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,840
Our new director has gotten

451
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,120
an unpredictable temper.

452
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,920
Mi Ka has just spoken for him

453
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,680
before the president,

454
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,280
yet he forgot about it right away.

455
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,680
In my opinion,

456
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,520
I’d suggest Mi Ka

457
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,360
to stay away from him.

458
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,320
About turn.

459
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Eyes front.

460
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,720
Attention.

461
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,280
Turn right.

462
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,040
-Finished?
-Yes.

463
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,520
-Kelei.
-Sir.

464
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,960
Let’s go.

465
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,120
There is a publicity campaign meeting

466
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,200
in the municipal office.

467
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,240
I’ll let you attend the meeting.

468
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,520
You can take it as a day off.

469
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,840
Anyone can attend the meeting.

470
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,960
I’d better go to the hospital

471
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,920
and visit Xiaochao.

472
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,400
What happened to him?

473
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,720
He had a fit after he woke up

474
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,720
and dismissed all nurses.

475
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,200
Why?

476
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,840
Because he won’t let any woman

477
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,000
wash his body.

478
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,840
A nurse has seen enough of that.

479
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,560
Where is his fiancée?

480
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,680
Looking after his mother.

481
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,280
You can find a male nurse for him.

482
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,160
No.

483
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,120
He’ll go crazy

484
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,360
if you find a male nurse for him.

485
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,480
It’s better to send me.

486
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,160
Okay.

487
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,760
It will ease my burden

488
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,160
if he can recover himself.

489
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,640
Mi Ka,

490
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,240
I can’t find my clothes.

491
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,360
Could you help me search for them?

492
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,720
Open the wardrobe

493
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,640
and find them yourself.

494
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,240
Is there any news

495
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,600
from Shu Wenbo?

496
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,320
I’m not him.

497
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,080
You should go

498
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,480
ask him yourself.

499
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,360
What’s this?

500
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,560
Have you changed your tastes?

501
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,680
Why did you buy

502
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,120
a vest?

503
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,000
I didn’t buy it.

504
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,720
Xing Kelei gave it
to me as compensation.

505
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,120
Xing Kelei gave it to you?

506
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,280
What’s going on?

507
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,240
We had an emergency rescue that day.

508
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,050
I just used my camisole

509
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,920
to dress his wound.

510
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,720
-And...
-What did you use?

511
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,560
My camisole.

512
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,000
Did you use your camisole
to bandage him?

513
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,000
It was an emergency.

514
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,480
I just fetched

515
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,480
what was by my hand.

516
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,840
Does it mean

517
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,920
that now you have

518
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,560
a vest of his

519
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,200
and he has a camisole of yours?

520
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,880
How special

521
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,960
your love tokens are.

522
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,320
Tell me the truth.

523
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,840
Do you anticipate

524
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,080
something to happen between you?

525
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,000
No, I won’t give you.

526
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,920
I have some news

527
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,240
from Shu Wenbo.

528
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,600
Didn’t you say you didn’t know?

529
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,920
I know now.

530
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,000
Give it back to me.

531
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,640
Fine.

532
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,800
Stop gossiping about me.

533
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,400
Listen,

534
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,600
he goes to the hospital a lot.

535
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,280
Is he ill?

536
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
No.

537
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,920
It’s his fellow man, Xiaochao.

538
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,840
He was injured

539
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,560
in a mission.

540
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,880
Some serious injury.

541
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,280
But his family

542
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,520
are not there.

543
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,200
So Shu Wenbo and others

544
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,560
will come to accompany him.

545
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,720
I know.

546
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,760
Now I have got a new plan.

547
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,560
All right.

548
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,640
You’re my born friend.

549
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,960
You should tell me immediately

550
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,920
if you have such information.

551
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,040
Are you taking advantage of me?

552
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,160
What’s a “born friend”?

553
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,320
Why hit me?

554
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,240
Go find your clothes.

555
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,160
If you need

556
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,040
a love consultant,

557
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,280
I’m 24-hour available.

558
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,280
You can deal with

559
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,560
that Shu Wenbo first.

560
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,520
All right.

561
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,060
Good.

562
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,340
(Outpatient)

563
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,400
Hello.

564
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,440
My father

565
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,800
is lying in the hospital.

566
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,000
Why didn’t you come and see him?

567
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:17,900
Are you waiting to

568
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,480
see him at his funeral?

569
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,760
Hello!

570
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,040
Did you hear me?

571
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,760
Hello.

572
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,000
Are you the family

573
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,360
for the 5th bed, Wu Jianguo?

574
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,680
Yes.

575
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,560
What’s up?

576
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,600
The doctor will

577
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,200
examine your father.

578
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,280
Please listen to
what the doctor will say.

579
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,080
And

580
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,480
don’t make calls in the ward.

581
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,160
You’ll disturb other patients.

582
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,520
If you have to,

583
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,480
you need to go out.

584
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,680
Doctor,

585
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,400
can you be faster?

586
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,320
I told you,

587
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,600
my father doesn’t feel well.

588
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,800
If anything goes wrong with him,

589
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,240
I’ll hold you accountable.

590
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,440
It’s better not to argue with

591
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,800
the patient’s family
under such circumstances.

592
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,760
But she had disturbed

593
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,080
other patients.

594
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,440
Leave the matter to nurses.

595
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,960
We have the patient satisfaction

596
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,320
indicator in our monthly
performance assessment.

597
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,560
Don’t make trouble for yourself.

598
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,760
Readings are in the normal range.

599
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,640
The blood pressure is a bit high.

600
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,800
I’ll give him some

601
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
hypotensive drugs.

602
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,400
Monitor the intracranial pressure,

603
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,480
or we can’t give him surgery.

604
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,720
Okay.

605
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,960
Xiaoxiao.

606
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,400
Change patients

607
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,440
on the 27th and 28th beds

608
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,600
to the secondary care

609
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,430
and tell their family

610
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,960
to do some hand massage for them.

611
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,740
-All right?
-Okay.

612
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,040
And take this.

613
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,960
Does he come for you?

614
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,240
I don’t think so.

615
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,800
He was waving at you.

616
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,560
Is he the one

617
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,360
who followed you to the meeting room

618
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,600
and gave you

619
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,520
the vest?

620
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,560
Crazy girl.

621
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,040
Go. Go. Go.

622
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
What brings you here again?

623
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,520
Thank you.

624
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,840
He took it back.

625
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,840
Why did he take it back?

626
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,440
I guess

627
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,240
you don’t have a boyfriend.

628
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,320
So what?

629
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,840
I haven’t asked you

630
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,320
why did you send me

631
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,320
a vest?

632
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,440
They all laugh at me now.

633
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,640
Is that funny?

634
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,880
Only a crazy man would

635
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,480
give others a vest.

636
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,360
If you want to give me the certificate,

637
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,080
you just give me a certificate.

638
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,600
Why did you put it within the vest?

639
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,480
Is it too big for you?

640
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,360
Where is Xiaochao’s ward?

641
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,760
He is in a general ward now.

642
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,520
I’ll take you there.

643
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,560
Okay.

644
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,400
You’re doing well.

645
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,320
You could speak now only after
a week in bed.

646
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,720
The doctor even said

647
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,000
the special policeman

648
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,680
was expectedly strong.

649
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,240
I...

650
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,880
I’ll have a speedy recovery.

651
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,040
You will.

652
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,320
Xia,

653
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,480
why did you come here?

654
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,920
We heard about

655
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,480
Xiaochao’s story

656
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,000
and I was sent on half
of our television crew

657
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,360
to visit the hero.

658
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,840
Keep your voice down.

659
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,640
He hasn’t fully recovered yet.

660
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,600
Why did you bring so many things?

661
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,440
Can I put them here?

662
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,520
Let me help you.

663
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,200
No problem.

664
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,400
Do you have time?

665
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,920
We can have lunch together.

666
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,800
I need to stay here

667
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,840
to keep him company.

668
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
I don’t have time

669
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,760
for lunch.

670
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,920
Okay, it doesn’t matter.

671
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,720
I’ll be here with you.

672
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,360
Is there anything

673
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,770
-I can help with?
-No, you don’t have to.

674
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,750
There is nothing

675
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,040
you can do.

676
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,960
Who says there’s nothing to do?

677
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,400
Captain Xing.

678
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,320
You can leave now and I’ll stay here.

679
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,440
That’s fine.

680
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,400
Now

681
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,200
do you have time for lunch?

682
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,780
I just remember that

683
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,760
I have a training course later.

684
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,720
See her off.

685
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,160
Well...

686
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,480
Okay.

687
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,600
Let’s go.

688
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,480
Wish you an early recovery.

689
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,920
See you.

690
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,200
Come on!

691
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,760
Text me on WeChat if you need me.

692
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
How can I text you?
That’s interesting.

693
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,080
Why do you keep following me?

694
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
I’m going back to the base.

695
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,920
What a coincidence!
I’m going there, too.

696
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,080
Haven’t you been there

697
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,040
last time to interview us?

698
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,520
I will do the training when I’m back.

699
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,440
Just like last time.

700
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,760
I’m not going to watch you
do your training.

701
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,000
I’m going to find Captain Hao.

702
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,720
He doesn’t have time.

703
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,760
Who said it?

704
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,580
(Captain Hao)

705
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,400
Hello, Captain Hao.

706
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,080
Hello.

707
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,520
This is Xia.

708
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,440
Our program team

709
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,240
just had a discussion today

710
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,840
and I have something to ask you.

711
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,280
Are you available for
a talk in your office?

712
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,160
Sure.

713
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,880
But it can’t be too long.

714
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,440
Fine. See you later.

715
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,120
Let’s go.

716
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,080
Get on.

717
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,880
Be careful.

718
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,680
Drive slowly. I’m scared.

719
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,320
Okay.

720
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Don’t you think

721
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,560
Shu Wenbo is obtuse?

722
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,200
The girl has been attracted to him.

723
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,920
Is he going to stay single
for the rest of his life?

724
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,960
Don’t laugh.

725
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,320
Xing,

726
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,840
how is my mother?

727
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,360
Everything is fine.

728
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,120
I didn’t tell her this.

729
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,360
Has your arm been washed?

730
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
No need.

731
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,920
What’re you saying?

732
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,200
Don’t be too polite to me.

733
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,880
We’re both men.

734
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,520
No need for it. Brother.

735
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,320
Why did you call me brother?

736
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,560
No need.

737
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,780
What’s up?

738
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,320
My head...

739
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,520
You have a headache?

740
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Dr. Mi. Dr. Mi.

741
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,280
I feel pressure in my head.

742
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,120
His head hurts.

743
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,400
I’ll find Director Shao

744
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,600
and give him a CT scan.

745
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,880
You go borrow a wheelchair.
Be quick.

746
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,600
Okay.

747
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,080
Excuse me.
Please make room for us.

748
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,840
Sorry.

749
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,720
Excuse me.

750
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,900
Excuse me. Sorry.

751
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,910
-What’s the matter with you?
-This patient,

752
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,480
he has an emergency,

753
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,880
so he will go
to the emergency entrance.

754
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,080
(Examination Room 3-CT)
Emergency entrance?

755
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,360
You’re wearing a white coat.

756
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,440
I’m afraid you’re making
an exception for him.

757
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,200
We’re following

758
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,840
the rules in the hospital.

759
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,960
Please understand.

760
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,040
Understand?

761
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,320
Then who will understand me?

762
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,520
My wife has her arm broken

763
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,560
and we’ve been waiting here

764
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,040
for over two hours.

765
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,120
Forget it.

766
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,080
Since we’ve been waiting this long,

767
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,200
it won’t matter
if we let them in first.

768
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,240
No.

769
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,520
You’ve been waiting so long,

770
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,720
and what if they can’t reset your bone

771
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,600
because it’s been too late?

772
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,400
Sir,

773
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,240
this patient

774
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,240
just had a craniotomy.

775
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,160
Please let them in

776
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,600
and I’ll stay here

777
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,480
to explain it

778
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
to you, right?

779
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,600
I said no.

780
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,440
Don’t pick a fight.

781
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,480
What the hell’s wrong with it?

782
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,400
You offended us
and you dare to complain about it?

783
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,280
Do you think you were right
to jump the queue?

784
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,280
Do you want a fight?

785
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,300
I will push him in

786
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,190
for an examination.

787
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
-Come and have a look.
-The doctor hit me.

788
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,360
He jumped the queue

789
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,800
and hit me.

790
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,750
The doctor hit me.

791
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,720
(Doctor jumped the queue and hit others)
Come and have a look.

792
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,970
(We must investigate into it.)
No shooting, stop.

793
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,020
(Police)

794
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,160
No worries.

795
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,200
I’m not

796
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,400
that weak.

797
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,200
You dislike me?

798
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,040
No.

799
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,680
I didn’t know I would

800
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,240
come to the police station one day.

801
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,560
Just state what happened

802
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,560
to the policemen.

803
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,440
It’s not that serious.

804
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,960
Just tell me

805
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,800
if anyone makes trouble with you.

806
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,000
Okay.

807
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,320
Why not let me see you off?

808
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,760
No need. A taxi just comes.

809
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,520
I’ll go. See you.

810
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,200
Can’t it be a coincidence?

811
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,640
Sir, can you take me?

812
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,400
Sure.

813
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,160
This is the patient’s
complaint against you.

814
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,440
This is the hospital’s

815
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,920
response to it.

816
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,220
(Letter of Notification
to Dr. Mi Ka of the Neurosurgery)

817
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,840
(Transferred to the ER
from Neurosurgery.)

818
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,080
Do you have any questions?

819
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,840
A complaint won’t be that serious,

820
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,480
but this has gone viral

821
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,400
on the Internet,

822
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,680
which may affect

823
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,920
our hospital in the year-end’s

824
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,840
spiritual civilization evaluation.

825
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,560
We may not be able to

826
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,280
secure the top-three place.

827
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,720
I will bear the consequence.

828
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,360
But I want to know

829
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,760
is it a decision made

830
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,600
by Director Shao

831
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,520
to have me transferred to the ER?

832
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,000
This is the hospital’s decision.

833
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,000
Director Shao agrees.

834
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,800
I see. Director He.

835
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,120
Thank you.

836
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,280
How is it?

837
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,000
Let me see.

838
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,600
Transferred to the ER?

839
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,640
Is it that serious?

840
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,480
No worries.

841
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,720
They just want to

842
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,960
train me more.

843
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,880
So I can take shifts

844
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,040
with you. Isn’t it good?

845
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,240
I’ll pick up my things.

846
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,640
No worries.

847
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,760
You’re good.

848
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,200
You’re famous now.

849
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,440
I never thought that

850
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,440
you would earn us merits

851
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,760
in such a manner.

852
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,480
They’re talking nonsense.

853
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,080
You must not believe in them.

854
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,360
You dare defend yourself?

855
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,040
A special policeman picked up

856
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,880
a fight in Renxin Hospital.

857
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,000
They have the right

858
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,160
to gossip about it

859
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,360
and make it sound true.

860
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,200
It wasn’t started by me.

861
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,560
How can they say I hit him?

862
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,480
Don’t forget that

863
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,640
you’re a special policeman.

864
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,040
I know

865
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,400
that’s because of Xiaochao.

866
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
But you are not

867
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,800
a hotheaded man, are you?

868
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,360
I have nothing to say.

869
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,560
As it’s so said on the Internet,

870
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,200
though our seniors will

871
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,120
understand you,

872
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,880
what about the common people?

873
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Can you explain it to them

874
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,800
one by one?

875
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
As a policeman,

876
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,640
you should be strict

877
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,480
with yourself.

878
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,840
You are not alone.

879
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,240
What you did is

880
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,160
on behalf of the whole unit.

881
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,640
I was wrong.

882
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,560
Well.

883
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,000
Don’t go to the hospital

884
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,880
for the following days,

885
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,440
unless someone

886
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,680
may have found out your identity.

887
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,720
What about Xiaochao?

888
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,640
Do you think

889
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,680
we don’t have men who can

890
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,920
take care of him

891
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,680
except you?

892
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,230
Tomorrow,

893
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,040
a special police unit

894
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:11,920
from our neighboring city

895
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,400
will come to visit

896
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,400
our Tiger Assault Team.

897
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,190
It’s a contactless training.

898
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,920
I’ll leave the job to you.

899
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,630
Yes, I won’t fail you.

900
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,820
(Neurosurgery, Mi Ka)

901
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:03,420
(Neurosurgery, Mi Ka)

902
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,840
For this patient,

903
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,720
you need to pay attention that

904
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,840
-his cranial pressure can’t be high.
-Hello, Director Shao.

905
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Director Shao.

906
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,240
There are two pieces
of A4 paper 50m ahead of you.

907
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,840
One with circles on it.

908
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,040
One doesn’t.

909
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,280
Imagine the paper with circles
is the hostage-taker

910
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,160
and the other is the hostage.

911
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,280
Each of you

912
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,480
will only have one chance.

913
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,000
So,

914
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,040
you must hit the hostage-taker.

915
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,120
This is our country’s self-made

916
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,280
accurate sniper rifle.

917
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,920
It won’t be worse than

918
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,440
the Russian T5000.

919
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,900
(Target)

920
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,960
A good sniper

921
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,960
should be highly skilled

922
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,280
but also has a stable mind.

923
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,680
You must

924
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,960
feel the rifle

925
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,920
as a part of your body.

926
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,120
Do you understand?

927
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,160
Yes.

928
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,000
Okay, let’s begin.

929
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,380
(Xiaoman)

930
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,240
Xiaoman.

931
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,800
Mi Ka, have you gone to bed?

932
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,920
No, I just arrived home,

933
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,320
did some cleanup,

934
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,360
and took a shower.

935
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,320
What’s up?

936
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,280
You sound upset.

937
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,240
No.

938
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,760
Perhaps I just

939
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,080
haven’t had enough food.

940
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,400
Are you exhausted?

941
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,920
It must be stressful
to work in the ND.

942
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,320
Yes.

943
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,520
I have a lot to learn.

944
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,960
It’s a stressful job.

945
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,520
How do you do?

946
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,960
Everything is fine here.

947
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,000
You don’t need to worry about me.

948
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,280
Take care of yourself.

949
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,520
Fine.

950
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,840
Take care of yourself

951
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,360
and follow the doctor’s instructions.

952
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,200
I’ll hang up then.

953
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,200
I need to rest.

954
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,600
Goodnight.

955
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,280
Come in.

956
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,400
Captain Xing.

957
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,680
How is Xiaochao?

958
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:56,880
He is good.

959
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,400
The draw is removed.

960
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,480
And the doctor said

961
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,640
the test result was good, too.

962
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,400
Fine.

963
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,640
What is this?

964
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,280
A training plan for them.

965
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,640
(Training Plan)
Several robberies have happened

966
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,160
around the gold processing plant
in the south.

967
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,600
I’ll make a scheme to deal with them.

968
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,280
Go ahead.

969
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,440
I’ll leave you alone.

970
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,680
Have you seen anyone else
in the hospital?

971
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,680
No.

972
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,360
In our unit, just me

973
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,160
has gone to the hospital.

974
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,200
I didn’t mean our unit.

975
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,960
I mean the...

976
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,840
Who?

977
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,880
It was only me.

978
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,720
Only I have gone

979
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,880
-to the hospital.
-You can leave now.

980
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,880
Is he being silly on purpose?

981
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,900
(Emergency)

982
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,880
Brother.

983
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,570
Brother.

984
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,950
-What happened?
-Brother, please wake up.

985
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,540
What happened?

986
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,120
Brother.

987
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,830
What happened?

988
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,480
Brother.

989
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,720
-Brother.
-What’s up?

990
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,400
Doctor, please check on him.
He just fainted.

991
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,120
Let me see.

992
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,920
-How is he?
-What disease he has?

993
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,960
He has a heart disease.

994
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,600
He said he felt pain
in the chest this morning.

995
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,840
Anything else?

996
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,840
No.

997
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,040
Excuse me.

998
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,080
What’s up?

999
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,280
This patient has dilated pupils,

1000
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,080
a weak pulse
and decreased breathing.

1001
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Which department do you work for?

1002
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,560
I’ve just been transferred
to the ER today.

1003
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,440
My name is Mi Ka.

1004
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,440
Send him to the first aid room.

1005
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,160
Okay.

1006
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,400
What’s going on?

1007
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,220
Dr. Zhou,

1008
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,880
this is our new doctor Mi Ka.

1009
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,320
The patient fainted outside.

1010
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,080
He has a heart disease.

1011
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,040
Now he’s short of breath
and has a weak pulse.

1012
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,280
Why a heart patient

1013
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,240
was sent to the ER?

1014
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
He has a cut on his hand.

1015
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,520
He fainted when

1016
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,120
he was waiting in the ER.

1017
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,640
It looks like a heart attack.

1018
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,440
Run an ECG test
and monitor his condition.

1019
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,680
Mi Ka, give him some oxygen.

1020
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,040
Manman, administer into his veins.

1021
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,580
-Okay.
-Well.

1022
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,260
Move him onto the bed.

1023
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:10,950
Here you are.

1024
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,400
Sir.

1025
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,880
What’s your name? Sir.

1026
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,440
Sir.

1027
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,960
He is unconscious.

1028
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,680
Damn it!

1029
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,960
He has ventricular fibrillation.

1030
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,920
Ventricular fibrillation?

1031
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,760
Go fetch an AED.

1032
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,430
Yes.

1033
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,420
(Manual Defibrillation)

1034
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,520
200 J. Make room for me.

1035
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,560
The heart starts again.

1036
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,880
That’s great.

1037
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,640
Again, ventricular fibrillation.

1038
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,160
Continue.

1039
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,240
300 J.

1040
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,000
Has it come back?

1041
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,560
Yes, the heart starts.

1042
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,880
What’s up?

1043
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,640
Don’t move!

1044
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,240
-Sir!
-Sir!

1045
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:31,880
-Sir.
-Relax yourself.

1046
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,160
-We’re saving your life.
-Relax.

1047
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,920
Hold him.

1048
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,640
-Quick.
-Tie him up.

1049
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,760
Quick.

1050
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,380
Sir, no worries.

1051
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,040
You try to hold him.

1052
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,160
I’ll find Director Wei.

1053
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,160
Okay.

1054
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,280
Director Wei.

1055
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,720
How is he?

1056
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,680
The heart starts.

1057
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,360
How many?

1058
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,360
178 per minute.

1059
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,080
And the blood pressure is 71 over 42.

1060
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,160
What medicines have you given him?

1061
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,880
We’ve injected two doses of Cordarone.
