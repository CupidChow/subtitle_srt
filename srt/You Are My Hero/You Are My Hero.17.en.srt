Mi Ka!

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,000
Don’t waste your time.

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,040
Don’t waste your time.

37
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,240
Stay with me for a while.

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,200
Stay with me for a while.

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,280
Okay.

40
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Xing Kelei.

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,320
Oxygen.

42
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,600
Oxygen.

43
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,360
I don’t need it.

44
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,960
I have something to say to you.

45
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,360
In the lavender garden last time,

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,080
my notebook

47
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,880
was found by you.

48
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,680
Actually, I have another notebook.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,600
I expected to read it to you.

50
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,960
But now I suddenly find

51
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,240
I…

52
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
I can even recite it.

53
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,560
Mi Ka.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,080
Mi Ka.

55
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,160
Colon.

56
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,560
I want to solemnly and warmly

57
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,200
invite you.

58
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,680
We two…

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,840
Listen.

60
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,880
Listen.

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,880
I beg you, listen to me.

62
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,040
I know I am not perfect.

63
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,480
But I wish to

64
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,080
build

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,880
an impregnable city for you.

66
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,880
Regardless of the rainstorms outside,

67
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,080
I hope to bring you

68
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,920
sunny days

69
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,640
so that you can bask in the sunshine

70
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,440
and live happily without worry

71
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,720
in flowers.

72
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,040
If you also love me a little bit,

73
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,600
please promise me

74
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,160
to be strong this time

75
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,120
and leave here.

76
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,160
Mi Ka, you must leave here.

77
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,920
Sorry,

78
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,360
I’m not sure I could.

79
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,240
Xing Kelei!

80
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,040
Xing Kelei!

81
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,800
You must leave here.

82
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,000
Xing Kelei!

83
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,960
Xing Kelei!

84
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,400
Xing Kelei!

85
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,480
Xing Kelei!

86
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,560
Captain Xing.

87
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,360
Captain Xing.

88
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
You wake up, Captain Xing.

89
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,160
Where is Dr. Mi?

90
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,920
The doctor…

91
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,280
The doctor said your right hand is okay.

92
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,400
Where is Dr. Mi?

93
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,840
Oxygen was severely undersupplied
in the gallery then

94
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,440
and she put the oxygen mask on you.

95
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,280
And then...

96
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,120
What happened then?

97
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,600
Tell me what happened then!

98
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,240
Then she…

99
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,800
Say something.

100
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,720
I am here.

101
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,400
You spoke so loudly.

102
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,960
It seems you have recovered well.

103
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,440
What a moron!

104
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,440
Captain Xing, I must tell you.

105
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,800
Captain Shu immediately

106
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,470
rushed over without hesitation

107
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,440
once he knew you were
injured and unconscious.

108
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,480
You don’t know how anxious he was!

109
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,760
You should have made it more clear.

110
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,400
No.

111
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,840
You were too anxious then.

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,880
You hung up

113
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,840
before I finished my words.

114
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,400
Yes.

115
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,120
But it was

116
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,120
very dangerous then.

117
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,840
You…

118
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,240
If we had arrived a little later,

119
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,960
you wouldn’t have been here

120
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,880
after you fainted away.

121
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,560
Stop it!

122
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,760
Stop it!

123
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,240
Dr. Mi and Captain Xing

124
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,120
are people of great fortunes.

125
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,280
You seem idle.

126
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,360
Go out.

127
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,480
We… we are just worried about you.

128
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,240
Zhuo Wenjing is back in Jiangning now.

129
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
She just called and asked

130
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,200
about your conditions.

131
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,240
Over?

132
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,200
No… you…

133
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,280
Get out. Hurry up!

134
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
I want to be with you.

135
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,040
I don’t need you. Just get out.

136
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,640
I still have something to say to you.

137
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,600
That is enough.

138
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,800
Don’t keep talking about it.

139
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,120
Shu Wenbo.

140
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,360
Are you silly?

141
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,360
You three!

142
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,240
Get out of here right away.

143
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,080
Crazy guys.

144
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,560
Sit down.

145
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,920
Put on the clothes.

146
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,200
Thanks.

147
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,120
You are welcome.

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,880
How are you?

149
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,600
Are you hurt?

150
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,800
I am okay.

151
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,320
Does what you said

152
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
still count now?

153
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,880
What did I say?

154
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,840
I seemed to hear

155
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,200
someone saying she loved me,

156
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,880
and she had loved me for long.

157
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Weren’t you in a coma then?

158
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,760
I could still hear the words

159
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,360
that I wanted to hear.

160
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,480
Er…

161
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,640
How about what you said?

162
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,240
I…

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,120
I love you.

164
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,160
Can you be my girlfriend?

165
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,720
Anyway, if you…

166
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,000
if you refuse to accept me,

167
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,800
I presume

168
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,280
it is hard for you to get married.

169
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,520
Can you cooperate?

170
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,240
I can’t date

171
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,640
myself anyway.

172
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,000
Can you be my girlfriend?

173
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,560
Yes.

174
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,640
Wish a good cooperation with you.

175
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,800
I will

176
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,880
give my girlfriend a present.

177
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,720
A present.

178
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,120
Distinguished Mr. Special Police,

179
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,400
first of all, please accept

180
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,840
my highest salute.

181
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,920
Thank you for

182
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
protecting us with your life

183
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,800
in the rescue action
of the jewelry shop.

184
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,440
Although it seems to be a nightmare,

185
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I feel I am very lucky.

186
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,520
I wish to

187
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,640
say thank-you again here.

188
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,680
Mi Ka.

189
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,520
I saved you once

190
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,600
and you saved me once, too.

191
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,600
It is a return for your favor.

192
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,780

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,840
I don’t want you to love me

203
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,880
out of gratitude,

204
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,800
but the way I am.

205
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,360
The one I love is Xing Kelei.

213
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,000
Very soon our medical team

214
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,800
will go back to Jiangning tomorrow.

215
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,120
I am really reluctant to leave here.

216
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,240
Dr. Chen,

217
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,560
you are welcome

218
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,840
to stay here.

219
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,560
Just forget it.

220
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,520
Doesn’t Captain Shu

221
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,160
wish to stay here

222
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
and participate in the reconstruction?

223
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,520
But some people

224
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,520
are really reluctant to leave.

225
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,000
You also know about it?

226
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,280
I am Mr. Know-it-all
of the Emergency Department.

227
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,360
What do you know?

228
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,920
You don’t know it?

229
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,240
I don’t know.

230
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,760
After Xing Kelei was injured,

231
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,680
Dr. Mi

232
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,440
checked his ward eight times a day

233
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,240
and took his temperature all the time.

234
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,240
They look at

235
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,360
each other differently

236
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
now.

237
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,040
In what way is it different?

238
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
There is something more in it.

239
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
What is that?

240
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
Love.

241
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,680
Love in their eyes.

242
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,480
My goodness!

243
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,920
What a joke of love

244
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,040
you have made!

245
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,160
I am leaving tomorrow.

246
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,840
The station notified me to return.

247
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,920
Take care of yourself on the way.

248
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,880
I will drive you to the airport

249
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,360
so you don’t have to make a transfer.

250
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,040
Won’t you go back?

251
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,480
I will participate
in the reconstruction.

252
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,800
I have contacted the project team

253
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,600
and I must wait for them.

254
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,440
I didn’t expect you were reliable

255
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,680
when you were serious.

256
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,240
I still have many more merits.

257
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,280
Just find them patiently.

258
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,640
Don’t be carried away

259
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,360
by flattery.

260
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,640
What are you doing?

261
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,040
You caught a cold immediately

262
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,200
after I took away your scarf?

263
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,240
How is that possible?

264
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,800
I… I am so strong.

265
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,480
You are just eye candy.

266
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,310
Drink it. Just drink it.

267
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,310
I am afraid you keep complaining

268
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,800
about me as the cause of your cold.

269
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,600
For me?

270
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,320
Don’t beat around the bush.

271
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,680
I know you do care about me.

272
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,120
You are nothing more than a chatterbox.

273
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,680
Will you drink it or not?

274
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,280
It doesn’t matter if you won’t drink.

275
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,200
I’ll drink.

276
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,040
It’s hot.

277
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,760
I got my ankle sprained some days ago

278
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,160
and it feels painful when I am seated.

279
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,680
Xia!

280
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,480
Captain Shu.

281
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,000
Madam.

282
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,520
Sir and Madam.

283
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,520
They say you will leave tomorrow.

284
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,200
I have woven two pairs of gloves.

285
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
Please accept them as a gift.

286
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,110
Take it.

287
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,960
Madam.

288
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,760
Don’t mention it.

289
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,280
It is just our job.

290
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,120
You don’t have to say thank-you.

291
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,680
The gloves look so nice.

292
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,120
Just accept them.

293
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
They were woven personally

294
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
as a return to our help.

295
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,720
Yes, just accept them.

296
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,640
Okay.

297
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,640
Thanks, madam.

298
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,560
You are welcome.

299
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,720
Madam.

300
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,480
I am reluctant to leave you.

301
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,880
You must

302
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,960
take good care of yourself.

303
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,520
I will come back to visit you.

304
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,840
I am

305
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,320
reluctant to let you go, too.

306
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,360
You two are really kind-hearted.

307
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,560
You two must stay together.

308
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,660
Okay.

309
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,520
We have to leave now.

310
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,760
Madam,

311
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,040
let’s take a photo together.

312
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,590
Okay.

313
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,160
-Come on.
-Come on.

314
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,040
Come on, come here.

315
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,920
Just help us take a photo.

316
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,680
Go and take the photo.

317
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,920
Come on, madam, stand in the middle.

318
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,510
Okay.

319
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,440
Come on, be ready.

320
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,480
Three, two, one.

321
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,200
Cheese!

322
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:03,920
How is it?

323
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,680
Let me check it.

324
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,200
Great.

325
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,720
Good job.

326
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,120
A good photograph indeed.

327
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:11,720
Is it

328
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,880
a new merit of mine?

329
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,440
Be modest.

330
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,360
Don’t feel conceited upon flattery.

331
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,680
Madam,

332
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,280
let’s be WeChat friends.

333
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,830
Okay.

334
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,600
I will export the photo

335
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,520
and send it to you.

336
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,200
Okay, thanks!

337
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,360
Okay.

338
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,280
We have to go now.

339
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,280
Bye!

340
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,960
Let me see you off, madam.

341
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,760
Okay.

342
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,400
Go.

343
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,480
Bye!

344
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,030
Bye!

345
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,540
Bye, madam.

346
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,280
I thought

347
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,720
Xia was just an ordinary girl

348
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,520
in the city

349
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,400
who loves good food and taking selfies.
.

350
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,200
But she really

351
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,280
impressed me this time.

352
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,840
She was sparkling all over

353
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,600
when she was

354
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,760
in a hurry to offer a hand.

355
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,360
Do you know what I was

356
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,600
thinking at that moment?

357
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,400
What?

358
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,120
I must be her boyfriend.

359
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,720
You already refused her.

360
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,200
Are you okay with me courting her?

361
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,760
I am not qualified to comment on it.

362
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,720
Just go and ask Xia personally.

363
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,280
I believe we will make a good couple.

364
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,840
We match each other in many ways.

365
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,360
We both love
eating, playing and having fun.

366
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,440
We look out of tune normally,

367
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,000
but we are reliable at critical moments.

368
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,440
I believe she must

369
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,920
be interested in me too,

370
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,120
although she may not recognize it.

371
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,400
Otherwise she wouldn’t
have been a constant dissident of me.

372
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,960
Do you agree?

373
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,280
How can I know

374
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,720
what is going on between you?

375
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,280
What a dummy!

376
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,660
(Medical Rest Room)

377
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,560
Er…

378
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,640
you take care.

379
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,200
I have to go now.

380
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,480
You too.

381
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,600
Take care on the way.

382
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,520
Let’s go.

383
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,160
I have to go now.

384
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,920
Bye.

385
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,480
Bye.

386
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,920
Drive carefully on the way.

387
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,200
Okay.

388
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,360
Shu Wenbo,

389
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,160
call me when you are back in Jiangning.

390
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,600
I have something to tell you.

391
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,960
Let me do it, Dr. Shao.

392
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,680
Thanks.

393
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,840
Let me do it.

394
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,480
Let me do it. Put it here.

395
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,920
Remember to change the medicine.

396
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,800
-Never have the wound…
-Never have the wound infected again.

397
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,160
I see.

398
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,320
Bye!

399
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,120
Wait until I’m home.

400
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,040
Okay. Take care.

Don’t move

441
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,440
your right hand freely.

442
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,760
Otherwise, it won’t recover well.

443
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,520
I think I have almost recovered.

444
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,600
Can I take it off?

445
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,400
It feels very uncomfortable.

446
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,640
You can.

447
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,200
Let’s consult Dr. Mi.

448
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,560
We don’t have to.

449
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,520
Bye!

450
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,720
I just received a notice.

451
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,800
We will return to Jiangning next Monday.

452
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,560
We will possibly arrive in the evening.

453
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,680
The signals aren’t very good here.

454
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,920
It must be envying us.

455
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,160
What are you doing?

456
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,560
Nothing. I am doing exercises.

(Schedule of Emergency Surgery)

458

Dr. Mi Ka is on a leave tomorrow.

00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Mi Ka, Mi Ka!

460
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,800
Can I change the shift
with you tomorrow?

461
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,720
I bought a concert ticket

462
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,120
three months ago.

463
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,760
No, I have plans tomorrow.

464
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,720
It doesn't matter when you bought the ticket.

465
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,080
What matters is that her boyfriend is back.

466
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,960
You knew it all.

467
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,680
I am a forecaster.

468
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,320
Chen Tao, do you have a crystal ball?

469
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,160
I know something about divination.

470
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,160
You are also a gourmet.

471
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,760
You enjoy your meals the best

472
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,240
every day.

473
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,320
People would think

474
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,320
the dishes of our dining hall
are delicious

475
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,280
by watching you eat.

476
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,800
Emergency treatment is a hard job

477
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,880
and I must have enough food for it.

478
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,840
How about

479
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,360
a Yakult after the meal?

480
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,080
It helps you digest.

481
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,360
Chen Xiaoyan,

482
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,800
you finally sound reasonable this time.

483
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,120
Can you…

484
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,320
Don’t even think about it.

485
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,840
I have to go to the airport tomorrow.

486
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,360
With Xu Yanshan?

487
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,680
You have courted her since college days.

488
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,280
You are both a driver

489
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,400
and an errand boy for her.

490
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,680
When will you become her boyfriend?

491
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,040
Does it have anything to do with you?

492
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,360
I don’t care so long as I am pleased.

493
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,480
Can’t find someone to change shift?

494
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,800
Just watch the live broadcast.

495
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,600
Go buy one for yourself if you like it.

496
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,040
What did he say to you?

497
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,200
Who?

498
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,560
Dr. Mi,

499
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,480
it is him who is dating you.

500
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,680
What will he say to me?

501
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,640
Haven’t you two

502
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,120
conspired to

503
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,880
move something to my home?

504
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,680
Do you like it?

505
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Yes.

506
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,080
That is enough.

507
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,960
He hasn’t said anything to you?

508
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,160
Do you want to know it?

509
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,000
Go and ask him yourself.

510
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,160
What a moron!

511
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,480
Go to hell.

512
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,080
Do you think

513
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,800
I should prepare something

514
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,080
for Xing Kelei before he comes back?

515
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,440
For instance,

516
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,200
reserve seats at a restaurant

517
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,240
or make something for him,

518
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,560
or pick him up at the bus terminal?

519
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,920
What are you doing?

520
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,880
Silence.

521
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,040
You are done for.

522
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,120
You are terminally ill.

523
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,440
To put it simply,

524
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,400
you’re worn out after you fall in love.

525
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,640
I am okay. You are ill.

526
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,240
I am serious.

527
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,000
You can treat patients

528
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,320
but you can’t treat yourself.

529
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:24,880
But

530
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,080
you are lucky enough to have me.

531
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,120
I can cure you.

532
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,960
Thanks!

533
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,600
Do you want to know the diagnosis?

534
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,760
Go... go ahead.

535
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,920
Are you looking for signals?

536
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,400
Don’t waste your time. It’s useless.

537
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,360
There were signals just now.

538
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,400
Buddy,

539
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,440
it is in the mountains.

540
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,600
Normally a man

541
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,680
must be in a hurry

542
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,400
to call his would-be wife

543
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,680
instead of his mother.

544
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,120
What are you talking about?

545
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,280
My advice is that if you make
too many calls,

546
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,400
you will lose her in the end.

547
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,720
Man,

548
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,080
I still have some more advice for you.

549
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,880
My principle is that

550
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,000
you can be active before dating

551
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,560
but never after dating.

552
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,840
Why?

553
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,400
Do you start up a business

554
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,160
before you maintain your business?

555
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,320
She must be waiting for your actions.

556
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,320
So you must take actions voluntarily

557
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,880
and tell her that you

558
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
can’t go.

559
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,680
Am I out of my mind?

560
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,720
Man,

561
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,480
surprise, okay?

562
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,120
You must pretend you don’t care

563
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,920
and he will give you
a pleasant surprise.

564
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,440
If you act like you care too much,

565
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,480
you will just startle him.

566
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,280
Why?

567
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,560
It is Xia’s Law.

568
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,080
Normally,

569
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,120
a woman is dissatisfied

570
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,920
with a man

571
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,320
for his indifference.

572
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,080
But normally a man…

573
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,920
Oh, no, it is for a woman.

574
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,680
Normally a man would

575
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,760
feel very satisfied

576
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
with a woman,

577
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,080
do you know why?

578
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,760
For her indifference to him.

579
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,280
To put it simply,

580
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,640
it is kind of insanity.

581
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,000
If I tell you

582
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,000
you have a billion dollars,

583
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,080
do you feel very happy?

584
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
But if I tell you

585
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,520
you have lost a billion dollars

586
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,640
and get a billion dollars again,

587
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,200
do you feel even happier?

588
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,960
What nonsense!

589
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,320
It is not nonsense.

590
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,800
It is Lu Feng’s Law.

591
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,320
Listen.

592
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,680
I have no fewer experiences with girls

593
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,720
than you.

594
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,280
Yes.

595
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,800
But it is a pity that

596
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,160
such experiences

597
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
aren’t dating experiences.

598
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,960
Have you ever held the hand of a girl?

599
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,920
You were just saying it.

600
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,080
I know

601
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,840
the truth is normally

602
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,680
unacceptable.

603
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,760
It’s your first time in a relationship,

604
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,160
trust Xia and it will pay off.

605
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,680
Put down your cell phone.

606
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,760
Don’t contact him voluntarily.

607
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,600
If you show too much care

608
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,160
about him,

609
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,040
he won’t care about you.

610
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,720
What you have to do now

611
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,840
is only one thing.

612
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,600
What is that?

613
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,440
On the first few dates

614
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,800
after you become lovers,

615
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,960
make yourself stunning

616
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,640
and make him feel that

617
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,840
he still owes you much

618
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,120
whatever he may give you.

619
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,200
I don’t believe you.

620
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,640
I think you are out of your mind

621
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,880
because you look as if

622
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,040
you are

623
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,040
acting as a lunatic.

624
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,680
Love is just a play.

625
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,280
If you are too active,

626
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,640
it will just become a solo

627
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,200
and you will get bored with it alone.

628
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,480
Trust me,

629
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,040
be cold before you show your care.

630
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,200
She will be deeply moved

631
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,960
and run into your arms.

632
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
You should consider it carefully

633
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,840
if you want to be an ignorant girl.

634
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,000
Sew your grapes.

635
00:33:53,220 --> 00:34:01,060
(Xing Kelei)

636
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,760
If you show

637
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,120
too much care about him,

638
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,080
he won’t care about you anymore.

639
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,480
Hello?

640
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,320
Hello.

641
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,710
Have you woken up?

642
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,760
Have you arrived?

643
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,000
Yes, I have.

644
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,280
Okay.

645
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,080
If I tell you

646
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,840
you have a billion dollars,

647
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
do you feel very happy?

648
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,560
But if I tell you

649
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,280
you have lost a billion dollars

650
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,400
and get a billion dollars again,

651
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,230
do you feel even happier?

652
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,880
But I have something to do at work

653
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,480
and can’t go back home.

654
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,190
Will she be very disappointed?

655
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,000
I will also work a night shift today.

656
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,720
So I am also busy tonight.

657
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,920
So

658
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,840
let’s just focus on our work.

659
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,000
Yes.

660
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,760
Don’t disturb each other.

661
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,960
Er… You…

662
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,800
Take care of yourself.

663
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,240
You…

664
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,040
You take care, too.

665
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,080
Okay, that is it.

666
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
What did I say?

667
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,400
Why did you cheat Dr. Mi?

668
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,440
Moreover,

669
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,720
Captain Hao said
your shoulder was injured.

670
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,960
Just rest for a few more days.

671
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,160
What?

672
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,280
I remember Chen Tao told me

673
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,760
she wasn’t on duty today.

674
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,120
What happened?

675
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,560
She must have said so purposefully

676
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,000
to exempt my uneasiness.

677
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,840
How can you get so much information

678
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,200
from just a single sentence?

679
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,240
Is it so surprising to you?

680
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,080
It seems I must

681
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,480
be well prepared for it.

682
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,560
You’re amazing.

683
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,240
Xiaoyan,

684
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,960
have you found anyone
to take your shift?

685
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,640
I am available tonight.

686
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,160
I can change shift with you.

687
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,440
Not bad.

688
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,140
(Emergency)

689
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,120
Two patients of cerebral hemorrhage
were received last night

690
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,160
and they’re under observation now.

691
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,640
Two other patients suffered
from traumas.

692
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
One was drunk.
He fell downstairs and got bruised.

693
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,240
The other is a delivery man

694
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,800
who drove too fast
and fell off his bike.

695
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,200
His leg received three stitches

696
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,640
but no entorrhagia was found.

697
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
They have gone back.

698
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,960
If the patients of cerebral hemorrhage

699
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,280
are okay, transfer them to neurosurgery.

700
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,160
Okay.

701
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,960
You are dismissed.

702
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,360
Mi Ka,

703
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,280
please stay.

704
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,840
Director He.

705
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,920
Mi Ka.

706
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,800
Considering your specialty,

707
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,800
we’ve decided to transfer you back
to neurosurgery department.

708
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,720
I’m just keeping you informed

709
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,200
to inquire about your opinions.

710
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,400
I…

711
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,400
Why are you looking at me?

712
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,920
Your opinions are needed.

713
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,880
It is not easy to have you

714
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,000
at neurosurgery.

715
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,280
Considering your specialty,

716
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,960
we certainly hope

717
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,080
your knowledge can be fully utilized.

718
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,080
Director Shao has communicated with

719
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,960
the leaders about your performances

720
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,240
at the earthquake rescue.

721
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,480
We all appreciate your efforts.

722
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,600
I am certainly very happy I can be back.

723
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,000
So I will handle

724
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,680
all the other issues.

725
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,240
Director He.

726
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,800
We are so busy here.

727
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,240
How can you take away

728
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,760
my people at this moment?

729
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,440
Haven’t I been helping

730
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,160
with the shortage of staff

731
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,400
at the Emergency Department?

732
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,480
Come on,

733
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,840
you must find a substitute for me.

734
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,920
Somebody like her

735
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,320
who works twice
as efficiently as others.

736
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,040
Okay,

737
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,280
Director Wei.

738
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,720
I will manage and find a solution.

739
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,920
Bye!

740
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,360
Bye, Director He!

741
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,480
Director Wei.

742
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,240
What?

743
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,560
It is good to return to Neurosurgery.

744
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,400
It was a pity to quit halfway.

745
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,760
Do your best.

746
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,000
It’s not yet declared.

747
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Go to receive patients there.

748
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,080
Okay.

749
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,320
It is on me.

750
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,400
Okay.

751
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,600
Why?

752
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,320
Director Shao must have helped me

753
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,520
greatly for my transfer

754
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,800
back to neurosurgery.

755
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,560
I really don’t understand

756
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,720
why telling the truth

757
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,680
can earn a cup of coffee.

758
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,360
Thanks!

759
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,680
You can choose not to tell the truth,

760
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,520
right?

761
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,760
So I owe you my thanks.

762
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,480
Give me a cup of Vanilla latte.

763
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,440
Vanilla latte?

764
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,720
Only milk and sugar.

765
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,880
It’s not healthy.

766
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,880
But I feel good with it.

767
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,920
What are you drinking?

768
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,040
Black coffee.

769
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,440
I feel good with it, too.

770
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,080
Very special.

771
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,440
Good to see you so happy.

772
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,640
Do your best when you are back.

773
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,240
Okay.

774
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,000
Thanks.

775
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,640
What is most important for a gourmet

776
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,120
is to choose the right beef.

777
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,760
Kobe Wagyu

778
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,720
is famous for its tender meat

779
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,200
with evenly distributed marble textures.

780
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
You don’t need any cooking skills

781
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,440
and you can even eat it in a raw state.

782
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,520
Side dishes,

783
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,920
carrot,

784
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,920
onion and potato are a must.

785
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,320
Appetizers are also very important.

786
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,280
Salmon and butter

787
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,080
with lemon juice.

788
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,400
Avocado and crab

789
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,480
together with Spanish ham.

790
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,080
Which one is better?

791
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,360
The same.

792
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,960
You’ve bought a lot.

793
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,640
Of course.

794
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,240
I must fill my stomach.

795
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,080
I have ordered a bottle of wine for you.

796
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,360
It will be delivered
to your home tonight.

797
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,200
Take it easy.

798
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,400
Cash on delivery.

799
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,400
Although I am very rich,

800
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,280
I will feel happier
if you can pay the bill.

801
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,840
Okay.

802
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,720
Next time.

803
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,000
It will be on me next time.

804
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,800
Next time?

805
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,560
Didn’t you say you would cook for me

806
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,640
so you asked for my advice?

807
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,040
Who said that?

808
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,400
Thank you for your time

809
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,960
as my aide.

810
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,480
You asked her out?

811
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,440
I said be cold before showing your care.

812
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,840
You don’t have to be in such a hurry.

813
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,040
I don’t want to follow your advice.

814
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,240
It is too late.

815
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,040
Bye!

816
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,040
I didn’t drive.

817
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,800
You shall at least take me back.

818
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,040
It hurts.

819
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,920
I haven’t started.

820
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,520
Doctor,

821
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,760
I am afraid I can’t stand it.

822
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Can you use anesthetic on me?

823
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,640
Just two stitches.

824
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,160
Be a man.

825
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:16,880
Frankly,

826
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
it will be even more painful

827
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,360
to use anesthetics.

828
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,720
You need several injections and

829
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,600
it’ll be even more painful.
It is up to you.

830
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,360
I see.

831
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,920
Go... go ahead.

832
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,560
How were you hurt?

833
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,280
My goodness!

834
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
You can’t tell?

835
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,240
It is a chop in a fighting.

836
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,840
A smart guy never

837
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,280
resorts to physical violence.

838
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,120
Why?

839
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,080
As a philosopher says,

840
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,280
if you engage in a battle against

841
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,520
an adversary

842
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,920
who is more powerful,

843
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,360
it shows you are so silly.

844
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,640
If your adversary is weaker

845
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,320
but dares to fight with you,

846
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,480
it shows he is tougher than you.

847
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,200
You will suffer in both cases.

848
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,320
What you said

849
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,480
sounds reasonable.

850
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,040
Who is that philosopher?

851
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,760
A philosopher called Mi.

852
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,920
A philosopher called Mi?

853
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,510
Yes.

854
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,070
Okay.

855
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,560
It is wrapped up.

856
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,240
Never allow your wound to touch water

857
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,240
and take anti-inflammatory drugs for
three days.

858
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Thanks, doctor.

859
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,800
Mi Ka.

860
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,560
Can I add your WeChat,

861
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,280
doctor?

862
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,760
When do you go back home at night?

863
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:25,400
I…

864
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,440
He wants to add my WeChat.

865
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,320
What?

866
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,080
Add her WeChat?

867
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,320
She has a boyfriend.

868
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,880
Her boyfriend is a policeman.

869
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,040
So what? Just a police…

870
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,400
Policeman?

871
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,400
Sorry.

872
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,960
Good job, Dr. Mi.

873
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,760
You are almost a showgirl
in our department.

874
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,880
Thank you!

875
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,720
You didn’t wash your hair?

876
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,200
Your hair is too oily.

877
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,120
Does it have anything to do with you?

878
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,880
It is a night shift.

879
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,480
I don’t have to wash my hair.

880
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,160
I will wash it tomorrow morning

881
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,520
to save some shampoo.

882
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,680
Aren’t you on the day shift today?

883
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,640
I will do it again for Chen Xiaoyan.

884
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,520
How could

885
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,040
Chen Xiaoyan do that!

886
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,160
Xing Kelei will come back today.

887
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,040
So what?

888
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,200
Do I need to

889
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,880
welcome him with wide open arms?

890
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,880
He didn’t say he wanted to see me.
