20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,800
Do you think Shao Yuhan asked you

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,080
to join the emergency department

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,600
because you did wrong?

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,920
Yeah, I did do wrong.

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,000
Do you have to join
the emergency department

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,160
just because you did wrong?

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,240
Have you ever thought about that?

27
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,200
I bet never.

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,640
Renxin Hospital

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,080
has around 1,000 emergency room visits

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,440
on a daily basis.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,440
Those who can’t register
with outpatient department,

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,000
who are turned down by pharmacies,

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,640
who are not admitted by the ward,

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,360
who are not free during the day,

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,200
all flock to the emergency room.

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,240
Working in the emergency department
is like fighting a war.

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,440
No time to delay.

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,920
Explosive situation.

39
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,440
Frivolous quibbling.

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,800
Those who’re slow in reaction

41
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,280
and can’t rise to the occasion

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,280
are not able to cope with the job.

43
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,560
How long do you think

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,600
you can hang in there?

45
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,200
As long as it needs me to.

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,760
We’ll see if Shao Yuhan

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,200
is right about you.

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
What does that mean?

49
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,600
Shao Yuhan does everything

50
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,040
for a reason.

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,960
You should think about it.

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Thanks, Director Wei.

53
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,240
Hi, Director Shao.

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,440
Director Shao.

55
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,480
Mi Ka.

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,680
Are you off duty?

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,360
Yes.

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,640
Do you have time tonight?

59
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
I want to treat you to dinner.

60
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,040
Tonight?

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,680
Sure.

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Do you like spicy food?

63
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,120
It’s fine to me.

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,000
Then, I’ll call the shots.

65
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,630
OK.

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,600
Thanks for coming.

67
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,160
Coming, coming.

68
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
Drink. Drink.

69
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,080
Come on.

70
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,840
Dare you play finger-guessing game?

71
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,400
Sure.

72
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,440
Ready?

73
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,920
Rock, paper, scissors.

74
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,080
Rock, paper, scissors.

75
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,800
Scissors.

76
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,440
Rock, paper, scissors.

77
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,200
Sit.

78
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,160
Director Shao.

79
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,000
Are you always

80
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,400
formally dressed?

81
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,680
Formally?

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,320
Kind of.

83
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,280
Isn’t doctor

84
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,480
a rigorous profession?

85
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,360
I think if I’m formally dressed,

86
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,560
when patients see me,

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,200
they’ll get the impression

88
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,000
that I’m reliable and trustworthy.

89
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,560
But it easily

90
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,040
creates distance.

91
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
I can’t change my habit.

92
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,800
Come on. Come on.

93
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,920
Do you often

94
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,400
have dinner at such restaurants?

95
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,000
I don’t have much money

96
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,510
to invite you to a fancy restaurant.

97
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,040
So I want you to soak up

98
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,070
the atmosphere of the restaurants

99
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
I usually dine in.

100
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,280
Besides, you’ve been abroad

101
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,320
for a long time.

102
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,920
You need to mingle with us.

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,840
I think so, too.

104
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,160
Why do you invite me to dinner?

105
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,720
I misunderstood you before.

106
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
Now I got it.

107
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Your decision

108
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
makes sense.

109
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,240
I make many decisions every day.

110
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,720
Which decision

111
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,120
are you talking about?

112
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,800
Anyway, I just want to reassure you.

113
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,320
I won’t

114
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,760
let you down.

115
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,960
And

116
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,440
no matter which department I’m in,

117
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,520
I won’t give people

118
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,480
any chance to say

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Shao Yuhan’s intern

120
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,720
is incapable.

121
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,120
Isn’t it exaggerated?

122
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,760
I didn’t teach you for long.

123
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,960
In my opinion, even if

124
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,800
you become the backbone

125
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,760
of some department in the future,

126
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,120
it doesn’t have much to do with me.

127
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,840
You’ve learned a lot from Wei Lan.

128
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,000
The credit is hers.

129
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,600
I want to ask you a question.

130
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,480
Can I?

131
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,280
Sure. Sure.

132
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,800
Sir.

133
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,640
Coming.

134
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,960
We want a brain.

135
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,800
What flavor would you like?

136
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,160
Raw.

137
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,240
Raw?

138
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,440
Thanks.

139
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,360
Recently,

140
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,720
I read some cases

141
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,200
of mixed gliomas.

142
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,160
Usually, the focal lesions are closely

143
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,840
joint with the brain tissue.

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,400
What’s the most important thing

145
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,040
to remove them?

146
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,000
Don’t I come to dinner
at your invitation?

147
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,080
Just give me an extra lesson.

148
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,680
You should know

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,320
mixed gliomas

150
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
are actually oligodendrogliomas

151
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,480
and astrocytomas.

152
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,320
85% of them occur in

153
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
cerebral medullary substance.

154
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,960
They grow toward the cerebral cortex.

155
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,200
Yeah.

156
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,480
They grow infiltratively

157
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,040
with the normal brain tissue.

158
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,120
There’s no clear boundary.

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,280
Sometimes,

160
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,640
oligodendrogliomas

161
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,320
are with calcification

162
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,680
and hygroma.

163
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,600
So during the operation,

164
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,480
while you’re removing a glioma,

165
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,240
you must be very careful

166
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,240
not to damage the functional area.

167
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,200
Here.

168
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
Got it?

169
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,920
Sir.

170
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,880
Coming.

171
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,360
Please cook the brain for us.

172
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
Make it the spiciest.

173
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,480
You dissect brains every day.

174
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,960
Have a taste.

175
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,680
OK.

176
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,480
Try this, too.

177
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,600
Don’t bother.

178
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,560
I’ll help myself.

179
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,920
I don’t eat much.

180
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,000
Thanks.

181
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,360
No.

182
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,720
I must treat you well.

183
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,440
Yummy.

184
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,480
Eat.

185
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,480
What’re you looking at?

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,520
You ordered so many kebabs.
Why don’t you eat?

187
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,440
You’ve come so far

188
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,560
to eat kebabs.

189
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,960
Honestly,

190
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,320
it tastes just so-so.

191
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,280
Why don’t we eat
near the special police base?

192
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,280
You talk too much.

193
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,080
Eat.

194
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,800
Isn’t that Dr. Mi?

195
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,520
What a coincidence.

196
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,080
That’s a nice car.

197
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,960
Is that Dr. Mi’s boyfriend?

198
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
I don’t think so.

199
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,800
He must be a taxi driver.

200
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360
I don’t think a taxi driver

201
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,440
would drive such a fancy car.

202
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,400
She is polite to the taxi driver.

203
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,080
Mi Ka.

204
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,760
Captain Xing, why’re you here?

205
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,480
We happened to pass through.

206
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,840
We’re having dinner here.

207
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,560
Captain Shu is here, too.

208
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,600
Do you want to join us?

209
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,400
No, thanks. I’ve had dinner.

210
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,790
Your base is

211
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,550
far from here.

212
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,120
Why do you come here for dinner?

213
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,240
They make nice kebabs here.

214
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,910
The beef is really fatty. So…

215
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,720
Well, who’s the driver

216
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,880
that took you home?

217
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,240
He isn’t a driver. He’s Director Shao.

218
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,560
Shouldn’t he be busy?

219
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,760
Never mind.

220
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,460
Well,

221
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,840
I invited Director Shao for dinner

222
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,360
in a small restaurant

223
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,840
I usually dine in.

224
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,880
Well,

225
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,760
don’t I owe you a meal?

226
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,480
Shall we go there next time?

227
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,280
Will you treat me?

228
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,160
If yes, I’d like to

229
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,960
go to a better restaurant.

230
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,480
OK. That’s on me.

231
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,960
OK. It’s a deal, then.

232
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,520
I’ll take the early shift tomorrow.

233
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,400
I gotta go.

234
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,480
Bye-bye.

235
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,010
Bye-bye.

236
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,560
Take it.

237
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,800
No. I’m almost home.

238
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,840
You keep it.

239
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,320
Bye-bye.

240
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,880
It turns out you asked me to

241
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,680
eat kebabs here

242
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,320
in order to run into Dr. Mi.

243
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
No. It’s a coincidence.

244
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,040
It really doesn’t taste good.

245
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,360
I agree with you.

246
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,600
It tastes like beef jerky.

247
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,320
Shall we take the leftovers

248
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,760
to Li Nian and other guys?

249
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,320
It’s not tasty,

250
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,240
yet we take the leftovers to them.

251
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,520
Fine.

252
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,040
It’s kind of a token of our regard.

253
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,360
Sir, please pack up the leftovers.

254
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,320
Yes.

310
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,000
Kid,

311
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,520
you’re so enthusiastic.

Don’t go to the expense.

313

Wenbo will take care of it.

314
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,200
Yeah.

317
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
is in a bad location.

318
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,880

Why don’t we cancel it?

320
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,520
I booked a short term

321
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,560
homestay for you.

322
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,600
You can cook your own meals there.

323
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,600

Why shouldn’t I know?

332
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,040

00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,400
but I’m afraid I’ve troubled you much.

350
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,520
No.

351
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,640
It’s a deal, then.

352
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,800
Please move. Step aside.

353
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,600
Please step aside.

354
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,640
Move. Move.

355
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,040
Director.

356
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,040
What was happening?

357
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,520
She was said to roll down the stairs.

358
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,480
There’re wounds in her head.

359
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,360
Her parents were not at home.

360
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,480
Her neighbor called the ambulance.

361
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,880
The patient is losing consciousness.

362
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,000
Why did she fall?

363
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,680
I don’t think

364
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,800
she simply fell.

365
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,600
Mumu.

366
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,760
Who saw my daughter?

367
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,760
Mu… Mumu.

368
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,840
Hi, is this your daughter?

369
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,000
Mumu. Mumu.

370
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,840
Mumu. Mumu.

371
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,640
What happened to you, Mumu?

372
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,880
Wake up, Mumu.

373
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Did she drink anything?

374
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,680
She…

375
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,160
She drank Dichlorvos as a drink.

376
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,360
Hurry. Get the emergency room ready.

377
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,240
Inform the pharmacy.

378
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,520
We need large amounts of atropine.

379
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,040
Yes.

380
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Go. Go. Hurry.

381
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,420
(District Two of the ER)

382
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,680
Here we are.

383
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,280
OK.

384
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,440
Come, Mum.

385
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,000
I’ll take it.

386
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,040
Wait for me for a moment.

387
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,920
I’m going to park the car.

388
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,680
OK. OK.

389
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,320
Take care.

390
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,440
Look. Why didn’t you stop her
from buying so many things?

391
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,080
Son,

392
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,400
you’re good.

393
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,480
You’ve been fooling me.

394
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,600
No girlfriend, no marriage, huh?

395
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,360
Mum.

396
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,600
We’re not

397
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,680
what you think we are.

398
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,240
Xia and I are just friends.

399
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,520
Are you just friends?

400
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,040
If you’re just friends,

401
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,640
why does she

402
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,040
take so much trouble?

403
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,840
She is just warm-hearted.

404
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
She’s generous to everyone.

405
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,960
You’re playing the fool, aren’t you?

406
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,600
Can’t you read

407
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
the girl’s mind?

408
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
What’s her mind?

409
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
She has a crush on you.

410
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,920
She wants to be with you.

411
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,520
With tall, rich and handsome

412
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,560
Captain Xing in our team,

413
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,880
why does she chase me?

414
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,680
I have self-knowledge.

415
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,600
What makes you think that?

416
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,440
You’re even more conservative than I am.

417
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,000
Times have changed.

418
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,960
Anyway, I…

419
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,800
I don’t like her.

420
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,800
I can’t stand her

421
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,120
of making a fuss about small things.

422
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
How dare you!

423
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,240
After I get home,

424
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,440
I’ll burn some paper money

425
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
for your grandpa,

426
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,800
and tell him you have a girlfriend.

427
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,360
No.

428
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,320
Our family will grow in size.

429
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,720
Tell you what,

430
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,000
I want the girl to be
my daughter-in-law.

431
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,000
If you can’t keep her,

432
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,360
you don’t come home, either.

433
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,680
Wow, wow…

434
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,280
Little girl,

435
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,200
can you hear me?

436
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,440
Can you hear me?

437
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,360
Yes.

438
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,280
I can hear you.

439
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,920
What’s your name?

440
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,360
Mumu.

441
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,120
Mumu.

442
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,680
Mumu, how old are you?

443
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,000
Nine.

444
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,960
Nine.

445
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Mumu, don’t sleep.

446
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,160
Don’t sleep. Be a good girl.

447
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,840
It hurts.

448
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,240
Director, shall we ask the blood bank
to get blood ready?

449
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,040
Yes.

450
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,280
Prepare for gastrolavage.

451
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,280
Prepare for operation

452
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,040
of CRRT, too.

453
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,040
After the gastrolavage,

454
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,600
apply nasal feeding
with activated carbon.

455
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,080
Doctor.

456
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,920
My, my daughter…

457
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,120
Does my daughter wake up?

458
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,760
She received gastrolavage.

459
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,400
But she is deeply

460
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,160
poisoned.

461
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,080
She isn’t out of danger yet.

462
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,760
Doctor.

463
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,640
I’m begging you.

464
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,240
Please save my daughter.

465
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,720
I’ll donate my blood.

466
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,120
I’ll do anything.

467
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,520
We know exactly how you feel.

468
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,840
But Dichlorvos

469
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,040
is highly toxic,

470
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,640
and your daughter is young.

471
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,760
We’ll try our best to save her.

472
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,440
You have to be prepared, too.

473
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,640
Why did your daughter drink pesticide?

474
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
I’m a single father.

475
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,350
I have to work every day.

476
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,590
She is usually

477
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,720
at home alone.

478
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,680
She must…

479
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,960
What the bottle in the corner

480
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,920
contained is Dichlorvos.

481
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,830
She drank it as a drink.

482
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,310
The patient needs to be

483
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,160
transferred to ICU

484
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,200
for monitoring.

485
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Crying is useless.

486
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,280
The medical expenses will be high.

487
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,640
Raise money first.

488
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,320
There’s still hope.

489
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,280
After all,

490
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,320
you haven’t lost her yet.

491
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,040
The medicine

492
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,320
is far from enough.

493
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,840
Director Wei,

494
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,400
atropine is in small dose.

495
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,440
We don’t have much in stock.

496
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,160
Those’re all we have in the pharmacy.

497
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,240
I’ve asked other hospitals

498
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,040
to deliver more to us.

499
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,760
But it’s rush hour now.

500
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,200
Hurry up.

501
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,080
We’ve tried our best.

502
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,440
Thanks.

503
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,760
How is it going?

504
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,760
These’re all we have.

505
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,560
Director Wei,

506
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,560
I reckon these’re

507
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,480
one hour’s dosage.

508
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,880
These are far from enough.

509
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,040
What about the test results?

510
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,760
Active cholinesterase

511
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,960
dropped to 20%.

512
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,320
Severe pulmonary edema occurred.

513
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
The patient shows
respiratory dysfunction.

514
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,160
Give her all the medicine.

515
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,000
Manman, get the syringe.

516
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,000
The patient is seriously poisoned.

517
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,560
Give her 30 mg medicine
for the first time.

518
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,640
Apply sustained medication.

519
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,360
Apply a dosage
every five to ten minutes.

520
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:31,870
Yes.

521
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,400
Mi Ka.

522
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,680
One atropine injection

523
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,640
is only 0.5 mg.

524
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,600
If the patient can’t

525
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,160
reach atropinization,

526
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,520
will you keep doing it till tomorrow?

527
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,680
Ask all the medics

528
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,000
who’re in the lounge

529
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,040
to come and help.

530
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,720
(Inpatient Department)
How many pounds have you gained?

531
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,800
Nonsense.

532
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,680
-No pounds gained.
-10 pounds, right?

533
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,320
-10 pounds, right?

534
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,000
-Be careful. I am wounded.
-I must’ve guessed right.

535
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,760
You get on the car first.

536
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,160
I’m going to say goodbye to Dr. Mi.

537
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,710
OK.

538
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,320
Hurry up. The emergency room needs help.

539
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,560
Let’s get more people.

540
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,200
Yes.

541
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,040
I’ll send these first.

542
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,720
OK.

543
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,920
Director.

544
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,240
After the first application of medicine,

545
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,680
her lung rale isn’t reduced.

546
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,880
Mumu.

547
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,000
Mumu.

548
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
The patient is in a coma.

549
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,520
Brain edema may occur.

550
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,840
Director.

551
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,000
This is the patient’s
liver function test report.

552
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,800
Let me see.

553
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
Cholinesterase activity

554
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,520
doesn’t rise.

555
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,600
The transaminase value is close to 400.

556
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,480
It’s dangerous
if she shows hepatic failure.

557
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,600
Zhou Zhe, ask for more medicine.

558
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,560
Yes.

559
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,240
Check how many boxes you have.

560
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,840
Yes.

561
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,360
Is this enough?

562
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,520
Yes. Yes.

563
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,720
Hurry up.

564
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,000
Xing Sir.

565
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,240
What’s happening?

566
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,040
There’s no time to explain.
We’re saving a life.

567
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,640
Is the second dosage

568
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,220
of medicine ready?

569
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,120
Here. It’s here.

570
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,400
But there’s not much left.

571
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,880
What should we do? We…

572
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,960
We need 3,000 bottles altogether.

573
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,720
Now…

574
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,200
Now there’re only 500 bottles.

575
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:41,840
We’re having the medicine

576
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,840
delivered from other hospitals.

577
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,440
But there’s heavy traffic
all over the city.

578
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,240
The medicine couldn’t
be delivered in time.

579
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,280
Send me the address.

580
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,000
Give me an hour.

581
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,120
I’ll get the medicine.

582
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,360
Send him the address quickly.

583
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:56,880
Yes.

584
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,040
Hello, Li Nian.

585
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,840
Ask Luo Ting to take Xiaochao back.

586
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,200
The hospital desperately needs
the medicine.

587
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,040
I’ll send you the address.

588
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,400
Contact the command center.

589
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,400
Ask the police cars nearby

590
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,520
to bring all the medicine here.

591
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,900
(Inpatient Department)

592
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,560
Look carefully.

593
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,280
Is there any medicine left?

594
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,810
OK.

595
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,880
Xixi, do you have more?

596
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,720
No.

597
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,800
Is there any medicine?

598
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,000
No.

599
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,040
Mi Ka.

600
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,520
Make a call and ask

601
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,280
where the medicine is now.

602
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,240
The patient shows hepatic failure

603
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,560
and passes into a coma.

604
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,040
These’re 300 bottles.

605
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,480
Another 1,000 bottles
will be here soon.

606
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,760
Manman, here.

607
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,360
Yes.

608
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,200
Here it is.

609
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,920
You can stop breaking the bottles now.

610
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,360
Mumu’s test results get better.

611
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,080
Cholinesterase activity

612
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,280
rose to 70%.

613
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,120
The little girl is amazing.

614
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,080
She survived.

615
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,800
We saved her life.

616
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,360
Great.

617
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,440
Great.

618
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,160
-Fantastic.
-Wonderful.

619
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,320
We did it.

620
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,240
We saved her life.

621
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,840
Great.

622
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,880
Director Wei is here.

623
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,880
Director Wei is here.

624
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,920
Thanks, everyone.

625
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,760
Thanks for saving Mumu.

626
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,040
You’ve had a long flight.

627
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,320
Thank you, Sir.

628
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,160
Thank you, Sir.

629
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,600
Well done, everyone.

630
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,040
Great.

631
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,480
Why don’t you rent an apartment

632
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,320
near your hospital?

633
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,200
Rents are high near our hospital.

634
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,040
My job doesn’t pay much for now.

635
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,240
With my present salary,

636
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,720
if I rent an apartment nearby,

637
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
it must be very old.

638
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,480
I have to use one bathroom

639
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,800
with other tenants.

640
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,200
Why don’t you find a roommate?

641
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,800
I have a roommate now.

642
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,320
I used to live with

643
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,200
one of my friends,

644
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,400
Ye Xiaoman.

645
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,280
But she went abroad.

646
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,960
I feel it’s a luxury

647
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,320
to have the apartment

648
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,200
all to myself.

649
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,920
If you often

650
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,680
go home in the middle of the night,

651
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,000
you must be careful while taking a taxi.

652
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,720
Last time I rescued a girl

653
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,520
who was kidnapped

654
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,400
while taking a taxi.

655
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,600
So,

656
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,760
should I get off now?

657
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,280
Flight number, UA086.

658
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
Arrive at 1:40 PM tomorrow.

659
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,280
Let’s go, sir.

660
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,840
Why do you come back suddenly

661
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,840
without telling me in advance?

662
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,240
Next time when you pick someone up,

663
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,120
please wait at the exit.

664
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,040
Are you kidding me?

665
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,240
You just sent me a location
at the parking lot

666
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,600
and didn’t help carry my luggage.

667
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,120
Don’t you have a driver?

668
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,440
Why do you have to trouble me?

669
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,080
So what?

670
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,720
Do you feel wronged?

671
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,480
No.

672
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,120
I’m pleased.

673
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,240
Where’s your luggage?

674
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,560
The driver took it back.

675
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,280
What?

676
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,320
Do you want me to take two elevators

677
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,920
to come here with my luggage?

678
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,840
You win.

679
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,040
Hop in.

680
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
Could you please

681
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,440
take off the sunglasses?

682
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,320
There’s no sun.

683
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,520
When will you leave?

684
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,880
Xing Kelei.

685
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,040
Are you really my brother?

686
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,920
I just arrived. I’m not home yet.

687
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,240
And you’re anxious to ask when I leave.

688
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,760
I’ll let you know when I decide.

689
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Did you send the message to everyone?

690
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,360
Why should I do that?

691
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,440
Do I need to let the whole world know

692
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,040
I’m coming back?

693
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,320
I clean your apartment

694
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,920
twice a week,

695
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,280
regardless of the weather.

696
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,160
What do you think?

697
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,680
Is it like a model room?

698
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,200
Not bad.

699
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,960
You deserve a medal.

700
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,520
You won’t be here long.

701
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,840
Why don’t you stay in a hotel?

702
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,840
I’m getting older.

703
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,600
I feel nostalgic for my home, OK?

704
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,880
OK.

705
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,040
So, what would you like to eat?

706
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,840
It’s on me.

707
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,000
I’m going to a party tonight.

708
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,200
If you want to have dinner with me,

709
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,760
you must wait. Are you clear?

710
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,600
Three days later. Make an appointment.

711
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,080
You came back suddenly this time.

712
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,640
Did mum and dad ask you
to be their advance party?

713
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,320
They will be back
at the end of the year.

714
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,600
I’m back on business.

715
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,040
Our company will launch

716
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,200
a new product in China.

717
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,440
I’m back to make some preparations.

718
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,400
OK.

719
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,720
I have to go now.

720
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,280
Dine with me in a couple of days.

721
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,520
OK.

722
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,080
I saw Mi Ka’s name.

723
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,920
Mi Ka. Mi Ka is on the list, too.

724
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,080
Look at this.

725
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,400
No.

726
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,500
(Commendation Notice)
Look, Mi Ka. Your name is on the list.

727
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,410
(Commendation Notice)
You’re good.

728
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,640
Dr. Mi, you’re good.

729
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,280
Great.

730
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,120
Good job.

731
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,560
Yes. Look. It’s great.

732
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,200
Look, the second one is you.

733
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,360
She’s excellent.

734
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,560
Right?

735
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,520
Someone is missing from the list.

736
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,720
Really?

737
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,840
Who is missing?

738
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,360
Mi Ka told me.

739
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,080
She saw you

740
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,440
helped out in the emergency room.

741
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,400
Since when doctors need commendation

742
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,400
because of saving lives?

743
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,800
In that case,

744
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,120
we must be criticized.

745
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,400
Honestly,

746
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,320
I was surprised that day.

747
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,560
At that time, I was

748
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,480
at the end of my rope.

749
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,880
But Mi Ka was calm in the hour of peril.

750
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,720
She was the first one
to sit down and break bottles.

751
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,920
I have to say,

752
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,520
the calmness she had shown

753
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,760
was really like you.

754
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,720
Come on.

755
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,400
How come a girl is like me?

756
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,800
I didn’t mean her appearance.

757
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,320
I’m talking about the feelings. Got it?

758
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,840
I just

759
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,040
want her to know

760
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,240
a doctor

761
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,680
should be more rational.

762
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,520
I don’t agree with that.

763
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
Our hospital is called Renxin Hospital.

764
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,160
Ren means benevolence.

765
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,240
It’s doctors’ instinct
to treat and cure patients.

766
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,240
That’s beyond reason.

767
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,760
But Mi Ka got it.

768
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,160
It’s precious.

769
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,320
Hello.

770
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,480
Brother.

771
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,840
What?

772
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,280
Only 3,000 yuan?

773
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,640
It’s not enough.

774
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,400
I’m in short of over 40,000 yuan.

775
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,480
I’ve been borrowing money.

776
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,480
Stop the treatment?

777
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,480
How could I do that?

778
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,280
The doctors said

779
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,120
stopping treatment

780
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,600
would cause sequela.

781
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,640
I’m begging you.

782
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,680
I have only one daughter.

783
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,880
Could you help me, please?

784
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,680
Hello?

785
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,680
Hello?

786
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,920
Mi,

787
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,160
do you rent the apartment or not?

788
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,920
If you can’t pay a year’s rent
at one time,

789
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,630
I’ll rent it to other people.

790
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,190
Sir.

791
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,230
Dr. Mi.

792
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,920
I’ll lend you the money.

793
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,000
Dr. Mi.

794
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,880
I’ve changed the code.

795
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,800
666666.

796
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,360
Take good care of Mumu.

797
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,960
Don’t worry about paying back.

798
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,680
No.

799
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,120
Don’t worry. Goodbye.

800
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,040
Here.

801
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,480
Dr. Shao.

802
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,680
Why’re you in such a hurry to leave?

803
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
At the seminar,

804
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,320
everyone was interested

805
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,040
in your speech.

806
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,400
We’d like to communicate with you

807
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,560
at the reception.

808
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,880
I have two surgeries tomorrow.

809
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,840
I should go back and have a rest.

810
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,720
-Yeah.
-See you next time.

811
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,760
-OK.
-See you next time.

812
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,320
Goodbye.

813
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,080
Thanks.

814
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,440
You got on the wrong car.

815
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,160
When did you come back?

816
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,600
A few days ago.

817
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Were you having dinner here?

818
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
I just listened to your speech.

819
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,400
I’m leaving now.

820
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,080
You drive the same car as mine.

821
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,000
I remember when you were abroad,

822
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,560
you drove such a car.

823
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,560
Aren’t you driving the same car, too?

824
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,040
I have to go now.

825
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,800
Goodbye.

826
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,480
You have so many things.

827
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,520
We should

828
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,040
ask Shu Wenbo for help.

829
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,040
You’re always talking about
asking Shu Wenbo for help.

830
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,400
He is busy enough.

831
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,480
We shouldn’t trouble him.

832
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,440
What should you do, then?

833
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,320
Where do you live?

834
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,800
Why don’t you live with me?

835
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,040
Buy a small bed.

836
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,600
There should be…

837
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,960
Do you have room for it?

838
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,480
I suppose so.

839
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,160
Your place is far from the hospital.

840
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,200
Honestly, it’s also too small.

841
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,640
I decide

842
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,760
to go back to the hospital.

843
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,600
I’ll live in the duty room
for a couple of days,

844
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,280
during which
I can look for an apartment.

845
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,840
As for my things,

846
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,520
could I stuff those

847
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,440
in your place for a few days?

848
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,440
OK.

849
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,520
Let’s move.

850
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,280
Move.

851
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,720
Let’s go.

852
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,480
You deserve it.

853
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,120
You want to be a good person.

854
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,400
You must suffer.

855
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,080
I’ve been vegan recently.

856
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,600
The drumstick is greasy.

857
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,760
I don’t know why I bought

858
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,280
so much food this morning.

859
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Don’t waste it.

860
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,320
You’re so kind to me.

861
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,320
I’ll keep it in my mind.

862
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,000
When I make a great success,

863
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,080
I must repay you.

864
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Chen Tao and I

865
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,760
have some money.

866
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,040
Why don’t you take it to pay your rent?

867
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,440
No, thanks.

868
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,320
The apartment was rented out.

869
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,640
I think it’s nice

870
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,480
to live in the duty room.

871
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,200
Free WI-FI, right?

872
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,600
Free hot water.

873
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,040
When I take shower at night,

874
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,120
water flows with great force.

875
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,680
I don’t have to worry about

876
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,640
the problems like

877
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,720
the drain being clogged.

878
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
It’s really nice.

879
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,040
It isn’t a long-term solution, though.

880
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,560
You can live with me.

881
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,520
No, you live with your mum.

882
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,400
It’s not convenient.

883
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,640
Thanks,

884
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,520
dear.

885
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,360
I live in there just well.

886
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,920
Don’t worry. Eat.

887
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,480
So,

888
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,400
what was the Glasgow Coma Scale score

889
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,320
of the patient when he was

890
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
first sent to the hospital?

891
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,240
The patient’s skull size was normal.

892
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,560
The right temporal apex was swollen.

893
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,800
But he could answer questions.

894
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,960
He knew what he was saying.

895
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,760
Five points for verbal response.

896
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,240
Two pupils were of
the same shape and size,

897
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,720
sensitive to light.

898
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,320
He could open eyes by himself.

899
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,960
Four points for eye opening.

900
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,720
But the patient felt resistance

901
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,520
in his neck.

902
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,040
The right limb’s activity was normal.

903
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,600
The left limb had a tingling sensation,

904
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,600
but it could bend.

905
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,600
Three points for body motion.

906
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,080
Left Babinski sign was positive.

907
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,840
It was a mild consciousness disorder.

908
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,320
Director Shao,

909
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,160
did you have the millet gruel
this morning?

910
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,400
Did you cook the millet gruel?

911
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,280
Last time you said
you got stomach upsets.

912
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,880
So I bought some millet

913
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,080
and cooked millet gruel for you.

914
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,040
Jia Li came to
drop some paperwork just now.

915
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,680
He just finished an operation
and didn’t eat anything.

916
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,720
So I asked him to have the gruel

917
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,400
you elaborately cooked.

918
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,360
Oh, really?

919
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,320
If you don’t like

920
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,360
millet gruel,

921
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,760
I have a soybean milk maker at home.

922
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,840
Home-made soybean milk

923
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,960
should be healthier.

924
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,680
No, thanks.

925
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
I don’t like to

926
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,040
trouble people.

927
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,240
No trouble at all.

928
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,360
No. Really.

929
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,080
Thanks.

930
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,360
No hurry.

931
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,200
Take your time.

932
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,680
I bought a lot of bananas.

933
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,200
Here.

934
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,600
Slowly. Have some water.

935
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:53,920
Here.

936
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,440
Have some.

937
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,520
Director Shao.

938
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,360
Xia.

939
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,040
Do you come to see Wenbo?

940
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,400
Shu Wenbo has ignored me

941
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,320
for days.

942
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,000
He didn’t reply my message on WeChat.

943
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,520
We do have many tasks recently.

944
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,520
He just went out.

945
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,720
Really?

946
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,440
No wonder.

947
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,800
The other day when Mi Ka moved,

948
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,360
I tried to ask him for help.

949
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,840
I asked if he had time,

950
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,840
but he didn’t answer me.

951
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,720
We had to move on our own.

952
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,080
It almost broke our arms.

953
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,160
Move?

954
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,600
Why did she move?
