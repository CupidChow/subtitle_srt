Captain Xing, get on board!

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
He’s rushing you.

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,880
It’s OK.

just like me.

33
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,440
Little did I think

34
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,440
you’d take that unattractive man

35
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,720
so seriously.

36
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,560

37

Xing Kelei

38
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,720
asked me out for dinner today.

39
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,160
He said he’d make it up to me today

40
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,880
for leaving me alone at the entrance of

41
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,000
the lavender garden last time.

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,400
Guess what happened?

43
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,920
He said he had to
go back to his training base tonight,

44
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,440
so I suggested we meet somewhere

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,280
near his base out of kindness.

46
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,560
And then he asked a bunch of

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,720
his colleagues to come along.

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,520
They’ve also got a female member
in their special police unit.

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,400
She seemed to be

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,520
quite a good one.

51
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,160
It seemed even Shu Wenbo lost to her

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,400
when he played a game against her.

53
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,000
And the special policewoman

54
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,040
proposed a toast to me

55
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,080
and asked if I am

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,560

I’d say it is not square dance

102

there was something weird tonight?

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,000
Did you find that too?

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,920
Yes.

114
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,440
So what…what was going on?

115
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,480
There was something wrong

116
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
when we were having dinner tonight.

117
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,680
What was wrong?

118
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,280
I think

119
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,800
it was because of Zhuo Wenjing.

120
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,080
Zhuo Wenjing?

121
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,840
Yes.

122
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,160
Now a policewomen was suddenly added

123
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,440
to our special police unit.

124
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,440
Don’t you think

125
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,760
there must be something wrong

You are a block of wood indeed.

129
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,440
Captain Xing, I haven’t finished. You…

130
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,160
Did you see how Captain Xing

131
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,520
acted toward Dr. Mi today?

132
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,960
Didn’t you find out anything?

133
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,000
Captain Xing wants to court Dr. Mi.

134
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,880
You could see that too?

135
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,240
I’m not blind.

136
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,880
Anybody sitting around the table

137
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,120
could see that.

138
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,240
Do you think

139
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,080
Dr. Mi likes Captain Xing?

140
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,480
No.

141
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,800
Didn’t she deny it in public?

142
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,920
What’s more,

143
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,200
when Captain Xing treated her
to some crabs,

144
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,680
she insisted on not eating them.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,560
Obviously

146
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,120
she didn’t want to
get close to Captain Xing.

147
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,120
Dr. Mi was also to blame.

148
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,920
The crabs were so expensive,

149
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,160
and I ended up eating them all.

150
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,040
But I don’t think you have a point.

151
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,000
Why?

152
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,480
You must

153
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,200
see through the appearance
to perceive the essence.

154
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,760
Let me ask you.

155
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
Where did we have dinner tonight?

156
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,520
In a restaurant.

157
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,400
Crap.

158
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,960
Of course in a restaurant.

159
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,720
Or on a shooting range to eat bullets?

160
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,960
I mean,

161
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,000
is the restaurant

162
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,280
quite a long way from Dr. Mi’s hospital?

163
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,400
What does that say?

164
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,910
It says she cared a lot
about the dinner.

165
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,790
And she didn’t act weird

166
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,790
until she saw us.

167
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,250
Why can’t I

168
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,480
clear this level?

169
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,960
You…

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,880
You must clear this up first.

171
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,520
After you clear it up…

172
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,640
Who’s that?

173
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,600
Li Nian.

174
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,040
Captain Xing.

175
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,480
Cap… Captain Xing,
is there an assignment?

176
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,440
Come out.

177
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,760
Captain Xing.

178
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,520
What were you talking about?

179
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,760
Nothing much.

180
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,640
We were playing Anipop.

181
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,920
Come on. Go on.

182
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,280
Captain Xing, I’m in the wrong.

183
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,120
I will not shoot my mouth off anymore.

184
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,120
Just now you said

185
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,280
Dr. Mi actually

186
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,680
looked forward to the dinner,

187
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,120
and she started to act weird
when she came.

188
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,200
And then?

189
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,000
And then…

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,640
And then the crabs were served.

191
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,480
Aren’t you gonna tell me?

192
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,920
I will. I will. I will.

193
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,240
And then she saw Zhuo Wenjing

194
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,920
and a bunch of us third wheels.

195
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,600
You intended to

196
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,720
dine with her alone.

197
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,800
Not only was there a bunch of people,

198
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,000
but also a pretty girl.

199
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,080
It’s just like

200
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,800
when Mi Ka asked you to dine with her,

201
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,560
she brought along a handsome guy

202
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,320
and told you

203
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,920
he was her colleague
and you’d have dinner together.

204
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
What would you think?

205
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,000
What would I think?

206
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,720
Wasn’t it because of you?

207
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,400
You said you’d dine with us together.

208
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,120
Well…

209
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,760
So you mean

210
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,000
she was actually very keen

211
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,120
to dine with me alone?

212
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,840
Yes.

213
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,380
(I’m sorry. I got home long ago.
I fell asleep just now.)

214
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,840
I’m so sorry for what happened today.

215
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,680
I said I’d dine with you alone

216
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,480
and made you come a long way to be here,

217
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,560
but didn’t see you home in the end.

218
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:58,460
(You’ve apologized
many times for this today.)

219
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,880
Captain Xing,

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,800
I’ve watched in a movie

221
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,920
that when a girl says it’s OK,

222
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,840
it’s not OK;

223
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
when she says it doesn’t matter,
it does matter.

224
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,850
Piss off!

225
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,040
Good night.

226
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,180
(Mi Ka)

227
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,720
Xing… Xing Sir.

228
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,160
I’m no longer your instructor.

229
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,800
I’m used to (calling you that way).

230
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,560
Well, did you get wet in the rain?

231
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,320
No.

232
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,640
This seems to be the second time

233
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,080
I’ve left you in the rain.

234
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,720
It seems so.

235
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,280
I…I promise

236
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,800
there will not be a third time.

237
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,440
It’s OK if there’s a third time.

238
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,480
I…

239
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,760
I thought you wouldn’t give me

240
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
a third opportunity.

241
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,640
It’s because of the special nature

242
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,640
of our jobs.

243
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,600
I hear from senior doctors

244
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,840
at the hospital that

245
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,160
they often get a call and leave

246
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,840
in the middle of a date.

247
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,040
It’s quite normal.

248
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,280
For…for our next date,

249
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,360
you can stand me up as you like.

250
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,560
As long as you like.

251
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,560
Was it…

252
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,160
a date between us?

253
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,360
Well…

254
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,600
We missed a formal date.

255
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,600
When do you have time?

256
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,200
I’m on day shift today.

257
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,560
I’ll be on swing shift tomorrow
and the day after tomorrow,

258
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,440
graveyard shift after that,

259
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,600
and then I can take two days off.

260
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,720
Then,

261
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,360
how about the day after tomorrow
in the afternoon?

262
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,240
OK, that’s settled then.

263
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,160
Go…go to bed early.

264
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,480
You too.

265
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,440
Good night.

266
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,640
Good night.

267
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,400
You…

268
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,600
What’s up, Xia?

269
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,900
What’s the matter with you?

270
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
You…you…you, don’t come over.

271
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,040
What the heck did I do?

272
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,240
You bastard!

273
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Why am I a bastard?

274
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,680
Hello, sir.

275
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,200
These are the coldrine capsules for you.

276
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,280
You are even laughing.

277
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,760
I slept next door last night.

278
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,560
This is

279
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,600
your room card.

280
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,040
And this is mine.

281
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,040
You got drunk.

282
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,560
I was afraid there would be
something wrong with you at night,

283
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,960
so I took your room card with me.

284
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,640
Then…

285
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,480
Then you…

286
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,080
You got drunk at my bar

287
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,920
and I didn’t know where you live,

288
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,680
so I had to

289
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,920
check you into a hotel room.

290
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,160
What…what about my clothes?

291
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,120
A hotel maid changed the pajamas

292
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,840
for you.

293
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,240
I also tipped her.

294
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,200
Really?

295
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,640
Sorry.

296
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,720
I’m drawing a blank.

297
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,400
I can’t remember anything.

298
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,280
If you really feel sorry,

299
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,080
just have the breakfast

300
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,440
I’ve specially prepared for you.

301
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,480
Well, did I

302
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,680
say anything weird

303
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,280
or do anything weird last night?

304
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,200
When you got drunk, you were quite...

305
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,800
Quite cute.

306
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,880
Did you prepare all these?

307
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,040
Or else?

308
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,960
I didn’t expect you’d be a homebody.

309
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:37,980
Why?

310
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,480
Am I that unreliable?

311
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,360
Yes.

312
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,560
You usually look like

313
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,880
a playboy

314
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,080
who’s very unreliable.

315
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,980
I just didn’t expect

316
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,400
you could take care of people.

317
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,840
That’s because

318
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:49,470
I usually go with

319
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,400
members of the field rescue team

320
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,840
to do field rescue work.

321
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,800
To take care of the rescued in the wild,

322
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
I have to be able to do everything

323
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,840
and do everything.

324
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,080
Over time,

325
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I can do a little bit of everything.

326
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,240
Field rescue team?

327
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,600
I’m impressed.

328
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,760
Are you?

329
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Just wait and see.

330
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,360
There will be

331
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,240
more and more opportunities

332
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,560
for me to impress you later on.

333
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,350
I’m full.

334
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,310
Drink this.

335
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
It was windy yesterday.

336
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,720
In case you catch a cold later

337
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,070
and feel unwell.

338
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:24,920
I’m OK. I’m OK.

339
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,520
Actually I’m really OK.

340
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,160
I’m sure.

341
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,960
Thank you so much though.

342
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,480
How are you gonna thank me?

343
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,840
Treat me to dinner next time.

344
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,140
Yes.

345
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,400
Of course, I must.

346
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
I’ve got to go to work.

347
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,560
Let me give you a ride.

348
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,640
No, thanks. No, thanks.

349
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,680
Well,

350
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,120
just take what happened last night

351
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,640
as a secret between us.

352
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,720
OK, a secret between us.

353
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,660
(Outpatient Service)

354
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,640
Keep an eye on his body temperature.

355
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,320
Morning.

356
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,240
Mi Ka.

357
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,080
Aren’t you on swing shift?

358
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,360
You’ve come so early.

359
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,440
Director Shao is giving a lecture.

360
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,560
I’ll go and attend it.

361
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,840
You are really a loyal fan

362
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,650
of Director Shao.

363
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,440
You haven’t missed a single lecture.

364
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,200
Director Shao is so busy,

365
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,320
yet he keeps giving a lecture

366
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,360
to resident doctors every month.

367
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,840
Whoever doesn’t attend it is a fool.

368
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,200
That’s true indeed.

369
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,800
Who did you say is a fool?

370
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,880
Two cups of latte please.

371
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,040
Yanshan.

372
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,400
You’ve bought one already.

373
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,360
I was going to buy one for you.

374
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,680
This is for Director Shao.

375
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Director Shao?

376
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,360
Earthquake!
Earthquake!

377
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,160
Earthquake!

378
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,720
Run!

379
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,680
-Run! Run!
-Go.

380
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,280
Be quick. Be quick. Be quick.

381
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,920
Be careful!

382
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,840
-Get out of here!
-Go!

383
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,600
Earthquake.

384
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,760
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

385
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Hi, mom.

386
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Is everything all right at home?

387
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,760
Good to hear.
Good to hear.

388
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,080
Make sure you and my dad stay safe

389
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,160
at home in the next few days.

390
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,840
Linan County

391
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,960
is not near from here.

392
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,120
Why is there such a strong tremor?

393
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,560
It’s an M7.8 earthquake anyway.

394
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,440
The news says

395
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,360
the roads are collapsed.

396
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,800
It’s pretty damaging.

397
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,640
What’s going on?

398
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,080
Are you OK?

399
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,440
I’m OK, I’m OK.

400
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,040
Let me in.

401
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,400
You can’t go in now, sir.

402
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,080
Be quick. Be quick. Be quick.

403
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,400
No pushing. Be careful.

404
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
You can’t go in now.

405
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,760
It’s very dangerous, OK?

406
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,160
Watch out for your safety.

407
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,560
Doctor. Doctor.

408
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,920
What’s going on?

409
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,920
Why…was everything shaking just now?

410
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Was it an earthquake?

411
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,840
It was an earthquake.

412
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,120
But it was in Linan County.

413
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:33,750
It’s over 1,000 kilometers

414
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,470
from here.

415
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,840
We’ll be fine here.

416
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,600
But everybody is running.

417
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,440
News from the TV station

418
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,480
says we only feel

419
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,320
a slight tremor here

420
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
which will not be destructive.

421
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,600
Don’t worry.

422
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,840
It’s so far,

423
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,600
but the tremor is so strong.

424
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
Is…is it very damaging?

425
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:48,980
Yes.

426
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,040
Please lie in bed first.

427
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,160
I’ll let you know ASAP

428
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,520
if anything comes up.

429
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,480
Here. Here.

430
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,520
The old lady’s health

431
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,520
is really failing.

432
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,200
Look.

433
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,160
The old lady can’t take it

434
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,360
given her current condition.

435
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,840
This is Wei Lan.

436
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,160
OK.

437
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,800
A meeting at the hospital office?

438
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,000
I’ll be right there.

439
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,560
You must stay in the hospital.

440
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,480
Chen Tao!

441
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,200
Come here.

442
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
What’s the matter, Director Wei?

443
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,440
Control the patients’ emotions.

444
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,680
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

445
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,360
OK.

446
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
This is a disastrous emergency.

447
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,640
This is also the first time to dispatch

448
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,320
formed units of special police
to help with the rescue.

449
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,240
Be quick to dispatch

450
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,040
the Tiger Assault Team

451
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,960
as an advance team

452
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,400
to the quake zone tonight.

453
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,800
Aye, got it!

454
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,080
Xing Kelei,

455
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,680
notify all members of
the Tiger Assault Team

456
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,680
to assemble immediately.

457
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,520
Hello, boss.

458
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,600
OK. OK. OK.

459
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,440
I got it.

460
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,040
Put off your work for a while.

461
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,800
Put it off for a while.

462
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,360
Let’s go to have a meeting.

463
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,280
Be quick. Be quick. Be quick.

464
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,120
Captain Ren.

465
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,880
We don’t have enough

466
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,600
hydraulic entry tools.

467
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,520
We need some more
to be transferred here.

468
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,000
OK. I’ll go to transfer them right away.

469
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,590
OK.

470
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,560
Wenbo.

471
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,880
The disaster area has a complex terrain.

472
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,240
Make sure everybody

473
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,080
is lightly equipped.

474
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,360
What’s more, I heard

475
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,480
the local food supply

476
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,400
is very scarce.

477
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,340
Prepare at least

478
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,280
ten days’ food for everyone.

479
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,960
I see.

480
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,240
OK, everyone.

481
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,800
Attention!

482
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,240
Just now Linan County

483
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,120
was hit by an M7.8 earthquake.

484
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,160
The headquarters have issued

485
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,400
a warning order

486
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,760
which orders our unit

487
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,880
to arrive in the quake zone

488
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,160
quickly by air

489
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,800
for disaster relief.

490
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,160
Xing Kelei,

491
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,720
please announce

492
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,200
the departure time and disciplines.

493
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,680
At 6pm this evening,

494
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,480
60 assault team members

495
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,240
will assemble
and set out for the airport

496
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,640
in groups of five.

497
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,720
Luo Ting will be in charge of
the radio station

498
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,920
and the Inmarsat phone.

499
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,120
The rest of you

500
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,320
must carry with you a pistol,

501
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,320
a flashlight,

502
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,520
rescue ropes,

503
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,440
a walkie-talkie,

504
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,320
a shovel and three days’ food.

505
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,280
The Logistics Support Department will

506
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,320
deliver hydraulic entry tools,

507
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,840
fireproof suits and life detectors.

508
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,840
Is that clear?

509
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,840
Yes!

510
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
Comrades, when you are
in the quake zone,

511
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,720
be ready to follow the deployment

512
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,200
of the disaster relief headquarters.

513
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,280
Do your best to fight against danger
and save lives.

514
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,400
Aye!

515
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,360
OK.

516
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,960
Give a call to your own family.

517
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,640
Dismiss!

518
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Aye!

519
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,560
Hi, mom.

520
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,600
I’m fine.

521
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,000
Have you watched the news?

522
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,720
Don’t worry. Don’t worry.

523
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,480
Rest easy.

524
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,840
OK, OK.

525
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,780
(Mi Ka)

526
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,740
(Keyao)

527
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,920
Hi, Keyao.

528
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,680
Just now

529
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,400
Linan County was hit by

530
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,480
an M7.8 earthquake.

531
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,560
I hereby announce

532
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,760
the immediate activation

533
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,040
of our hospital’s emergency rescue plan.

534
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,720
We must do our best to coordinate with
disaster relief efforts.

535
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,560
Everybody is to stop taking a leave.

536
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,600
We’ll dispatch doctors and nurses
from all departments

537
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,120
to form a medical rescue team

538
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
and set out immediately

539
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,520
for the quake zone.

540
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,920
Director He, please announce

541
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,160
the list

542
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,960
of the medical team members.

543
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,760
OK.

544
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,000
Head of each department,

545
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,040
please take them down.

546
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,800
Orthopedics: Wang Jian, Du Peng,

547
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,680
Zhu Haobing, Gu Hongfeng.

548
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,160
General Surgery: Li Chenjie, Wang Jie,

549
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,640
Wang Xiya, Wang Li.

550
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,960
Emergency Surgery: Wei Lan, Zhou Zhe,

551
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,680
Chen Tao, Chen Xiaoyan.

552
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,080
Neurosurgery: Jia Li, Lin Zhijie,

553
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,680
Wang Mao, Xu Min.

554
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,280
Now we are very short of hands.

555
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,160
Apart from people on the list,

556
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,200
director of each department, please

557
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,600
take the initiative to mobilize staff.

558
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
On the premise of

559
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,200
normal functioning of your department,

560
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,520
enlist as many

561
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,200
rescue volunteers as possible.

562
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,440
Send the list of volunteers

563
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,280
to the hospital office

564
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,440
in half an hour.

565
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,600
President Zhang,

566
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,520
the main types of post-quake injuries

567
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,600
are bone injuries, traumas

568
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,760
and cerebral traumas.

569
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,160
So, for neurosurgery,

570
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,560
I can lead a team to go there.

571
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,560
That’s great!

572
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,880
Director He,

573
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,600
work with Director Shao

574
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,240
to make a list of

575
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,800
medical equipment and medicines.

576
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,120
Director Chen,

577
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,640
arrange the Logistics Department

578
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,840
to coordinate with their work

579
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,040
and get the vehicles ready.

580
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,920
OK.

581
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,960
Doctors of each department,

582
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,360
please hand over your work at hand,

583
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,040
gather at the hospital and set out

584
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,040
in two hours.

585
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,280
Thank you for your hard work.

586
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,240
Dismiss.

587
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,080
Let’s take care of each other.
Thank you.

588
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,600
No problem.

589
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,860
(M7.8 Earthquake Hit Linan County)

590
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,200
Look at these images.

591
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,560
Oh my gosh! Look, oh my gosh.

592
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,880
Look, the roads are collapsed.

593
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,800
Too bad.

594
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,560
I didn’t know it’s so damaging.

595
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,720
It’s such a damaging earthquake.

596
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,080
Yes, look here.

597
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,360
Look at this news.

598
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,560
Well…

599
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,440
Look at this news.

600
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
Mom, pick up the phone quickly.

601
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,200
There’s such a huge casualty

602
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:47,980
in this earthquake.

603
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,160
Yes.

604
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,280
Why is it so damaging this time?

605
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,840
Look at this.

606
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,720
Are you OK?

607
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,240
Be quiet, guys.

608
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,440
I heard Director Shao

609
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,640
will lead a rescue team there.

610
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,680
-Really?
-Really?

611
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,280
Yes.

612
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,920
Keep an eye on Qu Bing.

613
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,440
OK.

614
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,160
It seems you are very concerned

615
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,480
about the earthquake, aren’t you?

616
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It’s the same with our hospital.

617
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,560
So an emergency plan is activated

618
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,720
to send rescue teams
to the quake zone.

619
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,160
Now I’m going to read

620
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,200
a draft list of

621
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,400
members of the rescue team.

622
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,480
Jia Li,

623
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,680
Lin Zhijie,

624
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,840
Yang Minru,

625
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,760
Huo Yicheng,

626
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,640
Wang Mao,

627
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,400
Xu Min.

628
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,520
Anybody else who wants to go?

629
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,710
Director Shao,

630
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,320
I grew up in Linan.

631
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,560
I’m familiar with the local environment.

632
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,480
I’d like to go.

633
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,200
OK.

634
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,640
Director Shao, I’m in.

635
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,000
Director Shao, me too.

636
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,920
Director Shao, me too.

637
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,720
OK.

638
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,840
Director Shao, count me in.

639
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,640
And us.

640
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,360
And me.

641
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,840
OK, let’s go together.

642
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,880
All right.

643
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,760
Please arrange and hand over

644
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,600
your work at hand

645
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,560
and go home to pack up.

646
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,440
We’ll gather at the hospital at 6pm

647
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,160
and set out for the airport.

648
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,080
OK, got it. OK.

649
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,680
Xu Yanshan,

650
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,520
sort out

651
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,920
our patients’ information

652
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,480
and give it to Dr. Huang.

653
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,320
-OK.
-OK.

654
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,600
The list of

655
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,280
members on the rescue team

656
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,160
is set already.

657
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,320
From our department, it’s

658
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,800
me, Zhou Zhe,

659
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,440
Chen Tao and Chen Xiaoyan.

660
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,080
But we are still short of hands.

661
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,280
Who else can go?

662
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,680
Lan, I’m in.

663
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,600
OK.

664
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Manman, don’t go.

665
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,360
Your wedding day is coming next week.

666
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,880
What’s more, we can go

667
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,520
and we need people here too.

668
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,160
Zhou Zhe, although you are on the list,

669
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,180
your wife

670
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,480
just came out of the maternity ward
a couple of days ago.

671
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,480
Don’t go this time.

672
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,320
I’ll get someone to cover you.

673
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,400
Don’t worry, Director.

674
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,320
She’s also a doctor.

675
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,480
She can understand.

676
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,320
Chen Tao?

677
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,680
I must be able to go.

678
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,930
OK.

679
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,640
Chen Xiaoyan?

680
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,520
No problem.

681
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,600
OK. Anybody else?

682
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,520
Count me in.

683
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,360
I’m going too.

684
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,720
Director Wei, I’m going too.

685
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,600
OK.

686
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,440
Chen Tao,

687
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,440
put together

688
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,080
a list in a while

689
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,920
to see who we’ve got

690
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,160
and hand it in to the hospital office.

691
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,720
OK.

692
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,560
All members of the rescue team,

693
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,360
hand over your work ASAP

694
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,720
and go home to pack up.

695
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,480
We’ll gather at 6pm

696
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
and set out for the airport.

697
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,160
Aye. Aye. Aye.

698
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,600
Mi Ka.

699
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,960
Keyao.

700
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,120
I was just about to go to the hospital
to see you.

701
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,200
What’s up?

702
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,600
Are you going to Linan for the rescue?

703
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,160
Yes.

704
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:07,800
I’m gonna pack things up

705
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,840
and set out soon.

706
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,760
Kelei called just now

707
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,320
to ask me

708
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,480
to give you this first aid kit.

709
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,080
Thanks.

710
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,560
Keep yourself safe there.

711
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,280
By the way,

712
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,080
is Director Shao going too?

713
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,600
Yes.

714
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,000
He’s the leader of the team.

715
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,600
Make sure to take care of yourselves.

716
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,680
Just let me know

717
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,080
if you need me for anything.

718
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,440
I have a lot of resources

719
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,240
in medicinal supplies.

720
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,100
OK.

721
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,840
Rest easy, Keyao.

722
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,380
OK.

723
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,900
I’ll go and pack up.

724
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,570
-OK, go ahead.
-Thanks.

725
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,880
Everybody, dress right!

726
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,200
Eyes front!

727
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,240
At ease.

728
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Attention!

729
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,800
A moment later,

730
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
all our gears

731
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,600
will be on the second vehicle,

732
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,080
and we’ll board the first vehicle

733
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,360
to go to the site of the quake zone.

734
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,640
We must rescue more casualties

735
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,880
at the earliest time possible.

736
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,000
Is that clear?

737
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,200
Yes!

738
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,120
Everybody,

739
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,080
pack your things up!

740
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,600
Don’t panic,

741
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,120
guys.

742
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,400
It should be

743
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,280
a small aftershock just now.

744
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,280
We are still

745
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,480
some distance away from Linan County,

746
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,960
so we are in no great danger.

747
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,360
The shock

748
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
has woken you up, as I can see.

749
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,400
So, let me brief you.

750
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,480
The place

751
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,440
we are going to

752
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,480
is a medical base camp

753
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,520
set up by the relief headquarters
in Qiushan County.

754
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,120
That’s the nearest place

755
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,240
our bus can reach

756
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,760
to the epicenter,

757
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,240
Linan County.

758
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,200
The medical base camp

759
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,640
was built with mobile cabin units

760
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,120
provided by the army.

761
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,160
Apart from us,

762
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
medical staff

763
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,200
from other hospitals

764
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,400
will come later

765
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,960
to work with us.

766
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,120
The medical base camp

767
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,360
is actually

768
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,480
a triage center.

769
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,760
Based on

770
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,040
the degree of injuries

771
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:32,960
of the casualties we take in,

772
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,880
whether it’s mild or severe,

773
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,840
it decides on whether to send them

774
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,440
to other hospitals for treatment

775
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
or receive treatment

776
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,680
on the medical base camp.

777
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,560
So,

778
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,320
when we arrive there,

779
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,120
Director Wei will lead ER doctors

780
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,280
to start the work

781
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,440
of triage

782
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,280
and basic rescue on the frontline.

783
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Others

784
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,840
should adjust the equipment

785
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,880
and arrange shifts upon arrival.

786
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,080
Hope

787
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,520
our whole team

788
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,800
can start work tomorrow morning

789
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,720
to treat the casualties.

790
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
(Earthquake Relief Command Center)

791
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,040
Chief Commander,

792
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,360
Captain of special police detachment
of Jiangning City,

793
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,200
Hao Yicheng,

794
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,400
leading the first batch of

795
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,000
the Tiger Assault Team members,

796
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,840
a total of 60 people,

797
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,680
to report to you.

798
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,320
Thank you for your hard work,
Captain Hao.

799
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,680
Thank you.

800
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Are you all settled?

801
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,960
Yes.

802
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,640
We stay in five tents in total.

803
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,240
Please give instructions
on the assignments.

804
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,000
OK.

805
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:27,840
There’s one more thing

806
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,200
I’d like to stress.

807
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,680
Once you are in the quake zone,

808
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,680
be sure to keep yourselves safe.

809
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,840
Only when we are safe

810
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,400
can we save more people.

811
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,680
When you work at the hospital,

812
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,240
you have a very huge workload.

813
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,120
It’s very hard work.

814
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,320
But the upcoming work

815
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,080
ahead of us

816
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,560
is only going to be heavier and harder.

817
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,520
Find time to take a break during work

818
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,200
to preserve your energy.

819
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,360
Is that clear?

820
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,320
Yes!

821
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,520
Is that clear?

822
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,000
Yes!

823
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:48,220
(Earthquake Relief)

824
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,520
The mobile cabin hospitals
have just been built here.

825
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,640
A lot of equipment and devices

826
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,960
have just been delivered as well.

827
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,530
Every day

828
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,380
we have so many casualties

829
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,200
in need of treatment that

830
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,240
we don’t even have time for surgeries.

831
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,760
It’s certainly not OK

832
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,480
to work in such a messy condition now.

833
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,240
We must set up

834
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
an effective triage system,

835
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,320
so that we can

836
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,680
allocate all limited medical resources

837
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,600
to the casualties

838
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,600
in need of emergency treatment.

839
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,600
Medical evacuation,

840
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,320
a very important part

841
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,720
which we must pay more attention to.

842
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,920
So far,

843
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,790
all the roads

844
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,560
from here to Linan County

845
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,440
are cut off.

846
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
Advance troops have

847
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,880
entered the quake zone

848
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,800
to unblock the roads.

849
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,760
Now supporting medical workers

850
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,560
are also arriving in succession

851
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
from all over the country.

852
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,360
Your first task

853
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,040
is to ensure the establishment

854
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,000
of the medical base camp here.

855
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,920
Got it.

856
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,200
This is the nearest medical base camp

857
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,760
to the epicenter.

858
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,680
With successive evacuation of victims,

859
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,800
a lot of casualties will be sent here.

860
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,000
You guys need to help to keep the order.

861
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,240
While ensuring the casualties’

862
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,960
orderly medical treatment,

863
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,360
make sure to protect the safety
of medical workers,

864
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,630
equipment and medicines.

865
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,190
Aye.

866
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,880
We are a county-level hospital.

867
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,080
We don’t have much experience

868
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,000
in this field.

869
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,120
When the earthquake struck,
buildings collapsed

870
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,400
and we were left dumbfounded.

871
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,520
Some new devices

872
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,630
have just been sent here,

873
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
but we don’t know how to use them.

874
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,150
So, it’s really good

875
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,400
that you could come.

876
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,000
Let’s do it this way, Director Tao.

877
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,150
Let’s follow the plan we worked out

878
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:33,960
on our way here.

879
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,540
OK.

880
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,560
Let’s try to redesign

881
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,280
the functional zone

882
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,230
by making some adjustments.

883
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:39,860
And we’ll

884
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:40,840
readjust the equipment

885
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,000
we’ve brought here.

886
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
OK, no problem.

887
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,880
Director Wei,

888
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,320
triage is a somewhat difficult job.

889
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,630
But I’ll leave it to you. Thank you.

890
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,400
No problem.

891
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,280
Go and have a look first.

892
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,820
OK.

893
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,670
Let’s go in to have a look.

894
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,630
Let’s go.

895
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,340
We’ll adopt

896
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,240
the three-tier pre-check rating scale.

897
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,760
We’ll have wristbands in three colors.

898
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,320
Red, yellow and blue.

899
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,520
Red is for cases of the most urgency

900
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,720
which require an immediate surgery

901
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,280
and continuous monitoring
of vital signs.

902
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,480
Yellow is for urgent cases

903
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,880
which require treatment

904
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,200
in two hours

905
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,320
and monitoring of vital signs

906
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,840
every half an hour.

907
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,800
Blue is for non-urgent cases

908
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,520
which can wait more than 2 hours

909
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
for treatment.

910
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:19,530
Meanwhile,

911
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,960
the wristbands also include

912
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,480
a patient’s name, age,

913
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,440
gender, cause of injury

914
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,680
and all other information.

915
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,760
Most important of all,

916
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,040
make sure to assess

917
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,360
whether the patients
have infectious diseases.

918
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,240
Director Tao has marked off

919
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,160
an infectious isolation area.

920
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,960
Once a case is found,

921
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,120
send them to the isolation area at once.

922
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,040
Chen Tao, Mi Ka,

923
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,200
Xiaoyan, Dr. Fang,

924
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,120
the four of you

925
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,800
take three nurses each

926
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,920
to form four teams

927
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
for the first shift.

928
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,320
I’ll arrange others

929
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,240
for the following shifts.

930
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,080
When the casualties come,

931
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,440
you must do pre-check and triage

932
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,600
immediately.

933
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,760
The pre-check and triage station
is right in front of the entrance.

934
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,760
Remember,

935
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,320
you must not let casualties

936
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,000
who haven’t gone through
pre-check and triage

937
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,160
enter the treatment area.

938
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,120
Director Wei.

939
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,640
Director Wei,

940
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,760
we have another two busloads
of casualties.

941
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,000
They are said to be 40 or 50 people.

942
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,440
Let’s go and have a look.

943
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,560
Help me!

944
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,960
Doctor, help me quickly.

945
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,960
Doctor, doctor, help!

946
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,920
Be careful. Be careful.

947
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,600
Help me!

948
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,280
Easy does it. Easy does it.

949
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,480
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

950
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,840
Lay it down in place and don’t panic.

951
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,920
Just line up in place to wait.

952
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,320
Stay there first.

953
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,400
Director Wei, we are here to help.

954
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,640
That’s great. That’s great.

955
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,520
We need them

956
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,520
to stay in place

957
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,200
to wait for our doctors

958
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,360
to do pre-check and triage.

959
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,440
OK, I see.

960
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,240
Don’t panic, everyone.

961
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,040
Listen to me.

962
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,600
Now you are panicking so much

963
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,480
that the doctors can’t

964
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,800
give you medical treatment.

965
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,080
All casualties

966
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,000
gather in this area.

967
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,480
Priority is given to severe cases.

968
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,760
Mi Ka, Chen Tao!

969
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,200
Bring the triage wristbands.

970
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,520
Other doctors,

971
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
follow me to the waiting area first.

972
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,320
OK.

973
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,520
Go first.

974
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,320
Be quick.

975
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,840
Where’s the doctor?

976
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,040
Doctor, come to save me first.

977
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,580
Watch out. Watch out.

978
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,560
Is she feeling dizzy?

979
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,120
She’s not.

980
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,000
Does she feel like vomiting?

981
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,920
No, no.

982
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,160
Is she allergic to medications?

983
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,360
No. No. No.

984
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,120
Send her to mild trauma.

985
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,640
OK.

986
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,320
Go. Be careful.

987
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,000
What’s up?

988
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,680
Captain Xing!

989
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,520
Here, pick her up.

990
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,320
Carry her over.

991
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,240
We have an assignment now.

992
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,200
The headquarters ask us to go.

993
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,680
OK.

994
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,440
OK.

995
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,640
Thank you, doctor.

996
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,040
Take care.

997
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,280
Take care.

998
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,840
Roads and bridges

999
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,280
leading to the epicenter Linan County

1000
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,960
are all collapsed and severely damaged.

1001
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,560
The headquarters have organized troops

1002
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,680
to enter from multiple locations on foot
for the rescue.

1003
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,000
But about 90 kilometers

1004
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,280
from here to the west,

1005
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,800
the six villages

1006
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,080
near Wufang Mountain

1007
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,080
under the jurisdiction of Linan County

1008
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,160
are still blind spots

1009
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
with no escaped victims

1010
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,240
or

1011
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,840
news of losses caused by the disaster.

1012
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,360
Therefore, the headquarters ask us

1013
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,760
to set up an assault squad.

1014
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,520
Xing Kelei,

1015
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,720
lead staff to enter the area on foot

1016
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,880
and open up life channels

1017
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,360
to relay disaster information.

1018
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,480
Meanwhile,

1019
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,120
you have

1020
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,120
an even more important task, which is

1021
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,360
to look for the right locations

1022
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,320
for air-dropping relief supplies

1023
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,000
when the roads

1024
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,640
are blocked at the moment.

1025
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
OK, got it.

1026
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,520
Everybody, pass through quickly.

1027
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,520
My husband is still in there!

1028
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,720
Be quick to save him!

1029
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,600
Xu Ke!

1030
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,120
Xu Ke, hold on.

1031
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,040
Her legs are badly injured

1032
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,000
with foreign matter in her head.

1033
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,840
Xu Ke…

1034
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,200
Come on. Come on!

1035
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Go on. Come on.

1036
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,720
Hold tight.

1037
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,560
One by one.

1038
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,200
Go in.

1039
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,280
Easy does it. Go in.

1040
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,400
Easy does it, easy does it.

1041
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,440
He’s still alive!

1042
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,840
He has dilated pupils.

1043
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,920
Get him on the ambulance quickly.

1044
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,680
Be quick.

1045
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,760
Go.

1046
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,520
If you

1047
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,720
have swelling in your arm

1048
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,640
or

1049
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,520
feel unwell,

1050
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,080
come back to see me again.

1051
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,160
OK, thanks.

1052
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,600
OK.

1053
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,840
Thank you, doctor.

1054
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,720
What’s her condition?

1055
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
The injured woman’s name is Lin Ling.

1056
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,760
Her head was hit by a hard object

1057
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
with an insertion of foreign matter.

1058
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,880
We’ve done

1059
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,680
a simple dressing of her wounds.

1060
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,920
Get her ready for the surgery.

1061
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,400
OK, go.

1062
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,320
What’s his condition?

1063
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,200
The injured man’s name is Xu Ke.

1064
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,320
He had been under a heap of ruins

1065
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,280
for 15 hours.

1066
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,480
He has a dilated pupil in his left eye

1067
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,520
and wounds on his head.

1068
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,360
He might have been hit by heavy objects

1069
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,360
or may have intracranial hematoma.

1070
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,240
He needs to have

1071
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,160
a CT scan ASAP.

1072
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,920
Arrange a surgery.
Send him to Director Shao.

1073
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,430
Go.

1074
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,000
OK.

1075
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:48,980
Director Shao,

1076
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,640
a patient had been buried

1077
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,760
under a heap of ruins for 15 hours.

1078
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,400
He has a dilated pupil in his left eye

1079
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,760
and got hit in the head
by heavy objects.

1080
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,920
He’s very likely to have
intracranial hematoma.

1081
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,000
Did he have a CT scan?

1082
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,040
It’s been scheduled.

1083
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,080
Chen Tao,

1084
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,160
go and tell Director Wei

1085
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,480
that we are short of hands here

1086
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,080
and Mi Ka has to stay for a surgery.

1087
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:06,880
OK.

1088
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,080
Yanshan.

1089
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,280
You’ll probably have more work to do.

1090
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,280
There’s

1091
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,720
an intracranial hematoma surgery.

1092
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,600
Work with Mi Ka

1093
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,520
to help Jia Li.

1094
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,400
OK.

1095
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,520
Let’s go.

1096
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,720
Get ready two units of red blood cells.

1097
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,270
OK.

1098
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,800
Dr. Jia, here is the scan.

1099
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,160
Severe craniocerebral trauma,

1100
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,840
acute subdural hematoma,

1101
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,120
cerebral contusion and laceration,

1102
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,280
skull base fracture

1103
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,360
and formation of tentorial hernia.

1104
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,400
Get ready for the surgery.

1105
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,320
OK.

1106
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,000
The patient’s heart rate
and blood pressures dropped,

1107
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,920
with a heart rate of 34

1108
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,160
and blood pressures of 80 and 60.

1109
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,760
The patient is dying.

1110
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,640
There’s too much blood.

1111
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,160
Yanshan, draw it with me.

1112
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,960
Yes.

1113
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,640
The blood pressure is too high.
I can’t see clearly.

1114
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,480
The blood is stopped.

1115
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,080
But the diffuse brain swelling

1116
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,920
is getting worse.

1117
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,680
There’s not much hope.

1118
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,960
The cranium needs to be sealed quickly.

1119
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,720
The patient’s heart rate is dropping.

1120
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,880
I can’t get her blood pressures.

1121
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,560
The patient’s heart stopped beating.
