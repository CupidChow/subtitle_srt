20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,960
How is that girl doing?

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,320
She’s much calmer now.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,840
The staff of
the rehabilitation department

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,880
are making a

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,920
training plan for her.

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,400
Lift it up with your hand.

26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,320
See.

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,760
This is 1000 cc.

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,080
It equals to one kilogram.

29
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,040
It’s the same weight

30
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,840
as the pistol you used.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,240
Your hand is not shaking.

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,000
Are you saying

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,400
that it was all mental

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,880
when my hand was shaking?

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,400
I think it is.

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,440
You are mentally convinced

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,400
that the surgery would

38
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,680
have a negative impact on

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,560
the strength and stability

40
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,200
of your hands.

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,240
You’ve been giving yourself

42
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,640
such a message.

43
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,560
You care a lot about it

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,120
and you are eager to recover.

45
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,480
So when you picked up the gun,

46
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,400
your hand would shake automatically.

47
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,920
But look,

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,680
when you were
in the concert hall yesterday,

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,680
you still had the instinct.

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,600
You still had a lot of strength.

51
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
From now on,

52
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
the most important thing is

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,600
to stop thinking about your hands.

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,160
Just relax, all right?

55
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,360
Put your hands here.

56
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,400
Why?

57
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,440
Except for keeping your mind relaxed,

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,520
it’s also important

59
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,800
to keep your muscle relaxed.

60
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,000
Your hands are going to hold the gun.

61
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,000
You need to protect a lot of people.

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,520
You can’t get hurt again.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
Let me give you a massage, too.

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,800
I don’t need it.

65
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,440
The surgeon’s hands are more valuable.

66
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,680
Come on.

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,120
Xia.

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,520
I found an experienced master

69
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,320
and fixed the camera for you.

70
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,640
It’s fixed?

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,600
Isn’t this lens discontinued?

72
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,800
He stocked up on some lenses.

73
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,960
Where did you find

74
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,880
such an experienced master?

75
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,120
He is right down my apartment.

76
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,920
Go ahead and try it.

77
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,720
Okay, I’ll try it.

78
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,760
Thank you.

79
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,560
Song, well...

80
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,880
I also have

81
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,600
an old Leica camera.

82
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,120
Ask the master

83
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,480
and see if he can also

84
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
fix it for me.

85
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,800
He only helps Xia.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
He won’t fix it for you.

87
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,600
Why not?

88
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Captain Shu got it done.

89
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,200
I forgot.

90
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,720
Xia...

91
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,830
I...

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,760
How did Shu Wenbo get

93
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,680
my camera?

94
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,040
I... He...

95
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,480
It’s not him, I...

96
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,200
Actually...

97
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,720
I’m asking you that how he got it?

98
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,240
I stole it, Xia.

99
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,920
You...!

100
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,640
Xia.

101
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,560
I don’t think you should

102
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,560
blame Captain Shu.

103
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,080
He is just worried

104
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,000
that he can’t fix it by himself.

105
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,320
So he didn’t let me tell you.

106
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,520
He doesn’t want you to worry.

107
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,960
He went to every store

108
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,320
in the digital mall

109
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,600
and finally found it.

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,480
The master

111
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,640
is Captain Shu himself.

112
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,840
What do you mean?

113
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,000
Do you think I’m stupid?

114
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,440
Xia...

115
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,780
(Lu Feng)

116
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,440
Xia, I have something for you.

117
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,640
I sent it to the bar.

118
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Go to get it tonight.

119
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,880
I don’t have time. Just leave it there.

120
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:20,960
No.

121
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,880
It’s fresh food. It will spoil
if you leave it there.

122
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,000
Just go get it.

123
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,520
I’ve told them about it.

124
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,840
Does your boss

125
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,160
have something for me?

126
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,960
Yes.

127
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,760
Well, Miss Ruan.

128
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,600
Have a seat.

129
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,280
I’ll get it.

130
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,820
Okay.

131
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,800

132
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,160
Come on.

133
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,360
Please.

134
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,520
I didn’t order it.

135
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,160
You only order this
every time you are here.

136
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,720
Our boss specially instructed us

137
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,760
to send you one for free.

138
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,080
Please enjoy it.

139
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,160

that I was attracted to you

161
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,640
There has never been a girl

who can attract all my attention

163
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,880
like you.

164
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,360
You flustered me

165
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,360
and that’s why I was so impulsive.

166
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,440
I...

167
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,160
I don’t know what my chances

168
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,520
of success are in this way.

169

177
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,680
Say yes!

178
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,080
Lu Feng.

179
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,760
I’m sorry.

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,320
I always thought

181
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,120
a playboy like you

182
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,200
must do everything just for fun.

183
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,840
I didn’t expect you to be
so serious this time.

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,640
I want to thank you.

185
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,200
Thank you for liking me.

186
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,200
Thank you

187
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
for everything you did for me.

188
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,200
Thank you a lot.

189
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,640
But...

190
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,440
I...

191
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,880
I can’t accept you.

192
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,720
Because the person in my heart

193
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,800
is not you.

194
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
You are a very good person.

195
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,720
So I think

196
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,200
you deserve a girl

197
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,200
who will treat you

198
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,720
wholeheartedly.

199
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,120
So...

200
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,960
So I’m just

201
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,280
a nice guy to you.

202
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,920
I am sorry.

203
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,480
Is Shu Wenbo that good?

204
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,600
Do you

205
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
like him that much?

206
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,040
It has nothing to do with him.

207
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,560
A relationship is not
a multiple-choice question.

208
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,080
The answer is not fixed.

209
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,640
No one can be someone’s stand-in.

210
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,560
Keep the flowers for

211
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,360
the girl who deserves you.

212
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,680
You came early today.

213
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,520
Yeah.

214
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,880
I’m the one who waits for you
every time, right?

215
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,440
Let’s start.

216
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,320
What do we practice today? Side kick?

217
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,480
Okay.

218
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,440
Kick two targets.

219
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,160
Okay.

220
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,360
Come on.

221
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,600
Remember the key I told you.

222
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,000
Your head must be clear.

223
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,840
Come on.

224
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,200
You are doing well. Come on.

225
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,280
Nice.

226
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,040
Come on.

227
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,160
Xia!

228
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:08,800
Stop!

229
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,840
Stop! Stop! Stop!

230
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,920
Stop!

231
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,520
What are you doing?
Are you going to kill me?

232
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,880
Yes, I want to kill you.

233
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,520
You rejected me

234
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,000
but you fixed the camera for me.

235
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,880
I...

236
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,640
What do you mean?

237
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,880
I don’t mean anything.

238
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,040
I just want to make you happy.

239
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,040
Make me happy?

240
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,080
Yes.

241
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,680
Don’t you think you are funny?

242
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,000
You made me cry

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,800
a lot of times.

244
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,160
Now you are telling me
that you want to make me happy.

245
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,080
Shu Wenbo,

246
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,880
why are you pretending to be a nice guy?

247
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,200
I’m not.

248
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,480
You are not?

249
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,160
Then what do you mean?

250
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,000
You told me

251
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,320
that we are good friends.

252
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,400
Then you clung to
your brother and told him

253
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,000
you like me.

254
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,480
You even want to give me to Lu Feng.

255
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,360
What are you taking me for?

256
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,200
A ball?

257
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
I’m not!

258
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,040
Then why are you

259
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,560
kicking me around?

260
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,320
Shu Wenbo.

261
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,120
I hate you.

262
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Xia!

263
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
What’s wrong with you?

264
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,200
What happened?

265
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,110
-Are you okay?
-How did this happen?

266
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,120
How are you?

267
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,160
-Are you all right?
-How are you?

268
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,920
It looks serious.

269
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,160
I don’t know. He is bleeding.

270
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,280
It looks like someone fell down.

271
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,000
Wake up.

272
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,280
He is bleeding.

273
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,040
Make a way.

274
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,880
Hurry up.

275
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,040
Call an ambulance.

276
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,960
Hurry up.

277
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,040
He is bleeding from the head.

278
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,440
There may be a concussion.

279
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,280
Contact his family now.

280
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:06,840
Okay.

281
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,240
Hello, is it the hospital?

282
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,520
Come on, hold him.

283
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,880
Put this under him.

284
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,160
Here.

285
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,480
I’m waiting for you at the door.
Have you arrived?

286
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,600
Hello, Uncle.

287
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,960
Xiaotong fell down.

288
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,040
We have called an ambulance.

289
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay.

290
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,960
Come on, press it.

291
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:49,420
(Shao Yuhan)

292
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,480
Excuse me!

293
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,720
Everyone, make a way!

294
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,120
What’s the situation of the injured?

295
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,600
He jumped up and fell to his head.

296
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,240
He is in a moderate coma now.

297
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,920
I have simply stanched the blood

298
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,680
for him.

299
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,720
Okay, thank you.

300
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,840
Slow down. Be careful.

301
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,160
Hang in there.

302
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,360
Excuse me.

303
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,360
Excuse me.

304
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,840
Sorry.

305
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,960
I can’t see the show today.

306
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,600
It’s alright.

307
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,880
We can listen to it next time.

308
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
I’ll take you home.

309
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,720
Make some food. I’m hungry.

310
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Me?

311
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,280
Have you decided?

312
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,120
I’ll make do with instant noodles.

313
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,000
Wait here.

314
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,680
Is my cooking better?

315
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,760
Much better.

316
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,920
Are you full?

317
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,040
Yes.

318
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,600
Good.

319
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,880
No.

320
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,760
I should learn to make more dishes.

321
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,200
Otherwise I can only

322
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,320
make instant noodles for you.

323
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,120
You’ve made

324
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,280
so many delicious dishes for me.

325
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,400
I think I have heard of this
a lot of times.

326
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,040
When will you start learning?

327
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,320
Right now.

328
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,800
Forget it, I’ll do the cooking.

329
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Okay.

330
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,320
There are some words that you
don’t need to take them seriously.

331
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,080
I will take anything you say seriously.

332
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,680
I’ll clean it up.

333
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,000
I’ll do it.

334
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,840
Just go back.

335
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,000
I’ll stay here for a while.

336
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,560
Don’t stay here.

337
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,440
Go back and rest.

338
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,160
Let me sit here for a while.

339
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,560
I don’t want to go back.

340
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,880
I mean,

341
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,350
don’t you need to get up early?

342
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,000
Go back to sleep.

343
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,440
I told you that I don’t want to go back.

344
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
I want to stay here for a while.

345
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,720
No.

346
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,400
Your sister will worry about you.

347
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,440
My sister?

348
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,200
My sister doesn’t worry about me at all.

349
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,960
I mean it.

350
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,960
Really.

351
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,280
Or she will call the police.

352
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,240
Why are you tugging me?

353
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,160
Just go.

354
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,800
Your clothes.

355
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,760
Call the police?

356
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
I am the police.

357
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,520
Raise your hands.

358
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,480
Be good, here.

359
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,120
Okay.

360
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,800
Look,

361
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,360
my sister would be glad
when I’m not at home.

362
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,600
Go back home.

363
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,120
Good night!

364
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,920
Good night.

365
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,200
I don’t believe

366
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,360
I can’t go back to my own home.

367
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,020
(The product needs to be installed
on the load-bearing wall)

368
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,560
Load-bearing wall.

369
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,520
Why are you staying up

370
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,600
so late?

371
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,400
I’m working

372
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,440
for my future happy life.

373
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,960
You haven’t slept either.

374
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,960
What are you doing?

375
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,760
I have a reunion

376
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,480
with my foreign classmates.

377
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,160
Will Shao Yuhan be there?

378
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,520
I guess.

379
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,120
Then you are going to remember

380
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,880
your famous

381
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,120
love story.

382
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,720
What are all these things

383
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
you bought?

384
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
You are changing the subject.

385
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,600
I just want to ask you,

386
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,760
which one is the load-bearing wall

387
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,360
in your house?

388
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,880
I want to install it.

389
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,840
Xing Kelei, listen,

390
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,840
you can’t even touch

391
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,120
a skirting line in my home.

392
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,320
Then I have to install it
in my own home.

393
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,200
Well.

394
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,800
Do you really want to move back

395
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,200
and live with Mi Ka?

396
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,040
How do you know it?

397
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,560
Who am I?

398
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,840
Do you think this will work?

399
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,280
Try it.

400
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,880
Okay, I’ll try it.

401
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,440
I bought the device

402
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,400
to exercise my finger strength.

403
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,360
But Xing Keyao doesn’t let me

404
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,560
do anything to her apartment.

405
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
She asked me to put it in my place.

406
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
I’ll go there tomorrow?

407
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,440
She replied immediately. See?

408
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,320
I’m important indeed.

409
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,840
Good. Good for you.

410
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,120
Good luck.

411
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,600
What do you mean?

412
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,840
Wash your forehead. There.

413
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
You have pimples.

414
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,680
Silly girl.

415
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,520
Have you been going

416
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,920
really well with Xing Kelei?

417
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,040
Yes.

418
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,280
The phone is overflowing

419
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,600
with hormones now.

420
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,560
I mean, is it really good

421
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,520
to laugh unscrupulously

422
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,440
in front of

423
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,880
a single person?

424
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,240
Sorry, I can’t help it.

425
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,000
I’m so happy.

426
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,480
However,

427
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,920
I think you two

428
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,680
are going to take a step further.

429
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,800
Don’t talk nonsense.

430
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,520
Let me ask you,

431
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,240
did he say he wanted to move back?

432
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,480
Yes, he just told me

433
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,280
that he is not going to go back.

434
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,840
I...!

435
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,080
You kept me from

436
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,880
such important news for so long?

437
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,040
Do you have a problem with your head?

438
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,080
How did you answer him?

439
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
I...

440
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,600
I just pretended that I didn’t hear it.

441
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,240
And he just let it go.

442
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,320
Missy, attention.

443
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,280
You are

444
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,600
about to enter the next stage

445
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,760
of your relationship

446
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
called the climax.

447
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,080
What does it mean?

448
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,000
Next,

449
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,400
Xing Kelei is going to find
all kinds of reasons

450
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,560
to show up in front of you,

451
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,080
look at you fervently

452
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,800
and try to hug you all the time.

453
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,680
What’s more,

454
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,760
moving back to your house,

455
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,660
no,

456
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,000
moving back to his house

457
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,840
is on his agenda now.

458
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,680
Let’s wait and see.

459
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,600
Go away.

460
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,120
One last piece of advice for you.

461
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
From tomorrow,

462
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,520
please dress like a woman.

463
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,520
When did I ever dress not like a woman?

464
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,880
When did you dress like a woman?

465
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
Remember my advice.

466
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,800
Do you hear me?

467
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
Bye.

468
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
One last piece of advice for you.

469
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,360
From tomorrow,

470
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,160
please dress like a woman.

471
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,720
Morning.

472
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,600
Morning.

473
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,840
You are

474
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,160
jumping rope so early.

475
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,160
It’s morning exercise.

476
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,200
Are you going to

477
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,800
install the fitness equipment today?

478
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,600
The house is a little messy.

479
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,360
It’s okay. I’ll clean it up.

480
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,760
Listen,

481
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,960
next,

482
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,680
Xing Kelei is going to find
all kinds of reasons

483
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,600
to show up in front of you,

484
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,040
look at you fervently

485
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,120
and try to hug you all the time.

486
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,440
Nothing.

487
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,560
I...

488
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,520
I gotta go to work.

489
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,000
Bye.

490
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:28,960
Mi Ka.

491
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,680
Chen Tao.

492
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,320
-Morning.
-Director Wei.

493
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,240
Morning.

494
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,520
You are so pretty today.

495
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,960
Do you have a date?

496
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,480
When is she not pretty?

497
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,640
Seriously.

498
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,280
Am I only pretty when I have a date?

499
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Okay, I was wrong.

500
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,680
Yeah.

501
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,000
But you’ve been really pretty recently.

502
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,080
A woman in love

503
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,160
is shining with love.

504
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,080
She is coming. She is coming.

505
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,360
She is coming with love.

506
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,240
She is coming.

507
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,360
Okay, I see.

508
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,280
I’ll go back to the office now.

509
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,000
Mr. Shao.

510
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
Please choose a topic

511
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,520
for the lecture on Friday
for the residents.

512
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
Friday...

513
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,240
This one.

514
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,920
Okay.

515
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,080
I’ll do the PPT first

516
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,960
and show it to you later.

517
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,800
Keep it simple.

518
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,040
You can go to work.

519
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,200
Okay.

520
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,200
Yi Qian.

521
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,000
Mr. Shao, please sign this.

522
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,000
Let me pick up the phone first.

523
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,080
Sorry.

524
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,420
(Yi Qian)

525
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,520
Hello.

526
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,480
Hello, Yuhan.

527
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,120
The school reunion I told you last time

528
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,200
is settled.

529
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,200
Let’s meet this Friday

530
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,360
and discuss about it.

531
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,000
This Friday?

532
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,160
When would the class

533
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,800
end usually?

534
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
It usually starts from

535
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,920
six to seven thirty after work.

536
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,120
Seven thirty.

537
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,400
I have something else

538
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,200
to do during that time.

539
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,520
I won’t join you.

540
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
You won’t join us?

541
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,880
I told Xing Keyao

542
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,000
that you will come.

543
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,640
She cleared her schedule

544
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,480
for the weekend.

545
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,800
If you don’t come,

546
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,960
how should I explain to Xing Keyao?

547
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,080
Well,

548
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,640
who cares how you would
explain to Xing Keyao?

549
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,800
What does it have to do with me?

550
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,480
Don’t get me involved, okay?

551
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,120
I have to get you involved.

552
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,440
If I get other people involved,

553
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,960
would you be happy about it?

554
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,120
All right, I’ll be there.

555
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,240
But I’ll be late.

556
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,360
Okay, see you then.

557
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,920
Okay, see you then.

558
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,960
Forget it, I’ll hang up.

559
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,520
Come here. Come here.

560
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,920
Come on.

561
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Do you think

562
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,800
that Mr. Shao’s brows

563
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
unknitted suddenly?

564
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,920
They invited

565
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,120
Mr. Shao to a meal,

566
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,440
Mr. Shao rejected them.

567
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
But Mr. Shao decided to go

568
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,240
after he knew that person
would also come.

569
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,080
I think

570
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,440
Mr. Shao should change his phone.

571
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,120
You’ve heard

572
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,240
all his secrets.

573
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:25,920
-Really?
-Who is that?

574
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,120
Stop gossiping. Go to work.

575
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,520
It’s done.

576
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,400
Okay.

577
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,000
Captain Xing, try it.

578
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,000
Is it okay?

579
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,760
Yes.

580
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,400
Okay, thank you.

581
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,640
We will leave if there is nothing else.

582
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,480
Okay, thank you.

583
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,320
Thank you.

584
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,040
It took me so long to train again,

585
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
I’m not as good as before.

586
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,920
Don’t worry, take your time.

587
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,640
Look,

588
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,320
you need to be strict with me.

589
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:02,920
Think about

590
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,200
how I treated you before.

591
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,440
We are not the same type.

592
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,920
I’ll do it in a scientific way.

593
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,440
I’m asking you to

594
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,680
be strict with me.

595
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,760
Can you do it?

596
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,600
Yes!

597
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,320
Come on.

598
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,320
Suspension for 15 minutes.

599
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,760
Are you still a human?

600
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,640
15 minutes is very scientific.

601
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,040
I mean, there are all kinds of equipment
in the team

602
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,440
and you can exercise with us.

603
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,000
Why do you have to

604
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,920
use a board to train at home?

605
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,440
Do you really not know it?

606
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,560
I don’t.

607
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,360
It’s for love.

608
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,160
What does it have anything
to do with love?

609
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,000
Think about it.

610
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,080
You are exercising here.

611
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,160
Mi Ka went to work.

612
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,720
You two can’t stay together.

613
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,600
Then I’ll do it after she comes back

614
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,480
from work.

615
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,800
That will work.

616
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,480
That will work?

617
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,880
Why not?

618
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,720
Captain, according to
the previous rules,

619
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,600
you are punished to do it
three times longer.

620
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,640
All right, I’ll do it.

621
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,600
Say whatever

622
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,100
you want to say right now

623
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,610
and don’t say anything

624
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,230
after you go up there.

625
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,960
I’m finished.

626
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,440
Wait and see.

627
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,400
See what?

628
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,000
Me and Mi Ka.

629
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,360
Aren’t you and Mi Ka going well?

630
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,320
What’s there to see?

631
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,680
What a dumb rock.

632
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,480
Hang in there.

633
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,240
You dress like a woman today.

634
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,400
Honey!

635
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,440
What brings

636
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,520
a fairy here?

637
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,320
I’m here to see

638
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,720
if what I said last night

639
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,800
is accurate.

640
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,480
Does every sentence I said

641
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,480
come true?

642
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,080
Well done, Xing Kelei.

643
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,960
You got many tricks to play.

644
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,960
All right, I’m starving.

645
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,160
I’m going home to eat.

646
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,320
Going home?

647
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,120
What’s there to eat?

648
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,720
Order takeaway?

649
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,400
I’ve decided what to order.

650
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,960
Let’s go, there must be
something delicious.

651
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,480
What do you want to eat?

652
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
I’ll order it now.

653
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
How about hot pot?

654
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,280
Whatever.

655
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,880
What’s wrong?

656
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,360
I saw Shu Wenbo.

657
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,360
Where?

658
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,080
The one in front of us.

659
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,480
Do you see him?

660
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,280
What’s wrong with you?

661
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,480
Nothing.

662
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,240
I just don’t want to see other people.

663
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,560
That’s annoying. Why would I

664
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,000
see him?

665
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,680
Forget it, I’m not eating.

666
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,640
I should go.

667
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,360
The thought of

668
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,760
him stayed at your house

669
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,880
would make me uncomfortable

670
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,520
if I go to your house.

671
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,800
You can’t stay at my house now?

672
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,560
Do you hate him that much?

673
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,800
I don’t hate him.

674
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,400
It’s...

675
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,720
It’s very complicated.
I don’t know how to say it.

676
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,960
Anyway, I don’t

677
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,840
want to see other people right now.

678
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,320
I don’t want to see anyone.

679
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,120
Especially men.

680
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,760
Men should walk away

681
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
and stay far away from me.

682
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,040
I just want to

683
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,480
stay alone comfortably.

684
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,280
What... what about me?

685
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,280
Okay, I’ll walk away.

686
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,640
I’ll walk away.

687
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,360
-I’ll walk away.
-I’ll walk away.

688
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,680
Call me

689
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,560
as soon as you feel better.

690
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,120
I’ll stay with you for some time.

691
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,120
I’m leaving.

692
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,400
Poor thing.

693
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,800
Xing Kelei.

694
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,000
Get down now, you will be exhausted.

695
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,840
You are sweaty now.

696
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,680
Why don’t you go back and take a shower?

697
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,080
You sweat a lot.

698
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,200
You’ll catch a cold
if you don’t take a shower.

699
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,600
Yeah, I sweat a lot.

700
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
I’ll catch a cold if I go out now.

701
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,040
Well...

702
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,120
I’ll take a shower here.

703
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,720
Here?

704
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,360
But you don’t have

705
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,880
any clothes for changing.

706
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,440
I brought some.

707
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,880
Well, order some food.

708
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,920
Xing Kelei.

709
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,480
Don’t use this to train anymore.

710
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,400
It’s too hard.

711
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,560
How is it?

712
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,720
Well...

713
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,600
What’s going on here?
Is today the New Year’s Day?

714
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,840
There are many meat dishes.

715
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,240
You’ve been

716
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,480
training hard to recover,

717
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,800
I want you to have some nutritious food.

718
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
Then I’ll wish you
a happy new year early.

719
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,320
May you be happy forever

720
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,080
and walk into the sunset
with your boyfriend together.

721
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,240
May you get rich

722
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,000
and grow up early.

723
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,440
Let’s eat.

724
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,120
Oh, right.

725
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,400
There is a soup.

726
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,360
Did you make a soup?

727
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,040
You still don’t trust me.

728
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,080
No.

729
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,840
I’ve ordered so many dishes.

730
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,960
But you still made a soup for yourself.

731
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,440
We only lack a soup.

732
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,360
It’s a coincidence.

733
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,760
You’ve been good to yourself.

734
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,880
No, I have to learn to cook.

735
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,840
I did this to recover sooner.

736
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,840
The people need me.

737
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,000
Just get better soon.

738
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,440
Can you

739
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,760
put down the thing in your hand?

740
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,040
Eat first.

741
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,480
Don’t be in a hurry, all right?

742
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,480
They said it will take a few days.

743
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,200
It will take some time to recover.

744
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,480
How about this,

745
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,000
I used to train you.

746
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,400
Now let’s change our roles.

747
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,640
You can supervise me.

748
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,280
Okay.

749
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,960
I’m willing to do it.

750
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,120
Does it mean

751
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,400
I can ask you

752
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:28,980
to do anything?

753
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,600
I don’t think it’s good.

754
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,200
Shameless.

755
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,720
Then I’m Instructor Mi.

756
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,280
Yes.

757
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,760
Greet me.

758
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,320
Say hello, Instructor Mi.

759
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,480
Hello, Instructor Mi.

760
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,080
Say Instructor Mi,

761
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,280
you’re so beautiful.

762
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,560
Instructor Mi, you are so beautiful.

763
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,920
Sincerely?

764
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,440
Right?

765
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,640
Put it down.

766
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,520
All right.

767
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,280
Let’s eat.

768
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,360
Dr. Mi.

769
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,080
I’ve been feeling

770
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,670
that my body is
a little swollen these days.

771
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,000
Is this

772
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,630
a black reaction after the surgery?

773
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Take a look.

774
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,520
It’s a normal postoperative reaction.

775
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,320
Come on, take a look.

776
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,280
It’s just

777
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,920
I feel like my body

778
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,920
is in pieces.

779
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,040
You went too far.

780
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,480
The food is in the refrigerator.
Remember to eat.

781
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,880
Who is this?

782
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,800
What did you do to my sister?

783
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,640
Speak normally.

784
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,120
Go away.

785
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,560
Speak normally.

786
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,440
Is that a tribute to youth?

787
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,800
Do you also think

788
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,040
I’m not like myself right now?

789
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,200
My sister is pretty indeed.

790
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,120
You can still wear

791
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,000
the old skirt.

792
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,520
I’m holding my belly back.

793
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,880
Kelei.

794
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,200
Looks like your plan

795
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,160
is going to succeed.

796
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,600
You came back later every day.

797
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,120
Are you going to move out

798
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,670
next week?

799
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,160
It’s killing me.

800
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,400
The tree desires stillness
but the wind will not cease.

801
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,320
I desire to go home
but she doesn’t understand.

802
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,560
She doesn’t understand.

803
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,240
She doesn’t understand? Just tell her.

804
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,560
I did.

805
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
How did you say it?

806
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,960
I was lying here, and I said

807
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,120
I don’t want to go home.

808
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,360
I don’t.

809
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,160
What was that?

810
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,520
Then how should I say it?

811
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,320
Keyao.

812
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,080
Help your brother.

813
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,320
I have a school reunion tomorrow.

814
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,480
I’ll go to have a beauty sleep.

815
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,480
I mean,

816
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,680
is your classmate more important
than your brother?

817
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,680
Yes.

818
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,120
Will Shao Yuhan be there again?

819
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,240
None of your business.

820
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,600
I was wondering

821
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,000
why you dressed indecently.

822
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,920
Stop it.

823
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Well...

824
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,360
Figure it out by yourself.

825
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,560
Why is Shao Yuhan still not here?

826
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,360
Yeah, we wait for him every time.

827
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,720
Yi Qian, where is the lady’s room?

828
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Go out and turn left.

829
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,880
I’m going to the lady’s room.

830
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,880
Okay.

831
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,120
Long legs.

832
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,000
You look good on this dress.

833
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,000
But you wear too little.

834
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,920
Look what they are wearing.

835
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,760
Right?

836
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,160
Can you take care of yourself?

837
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,520
That’s it.

838
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,720
It looks good. Let’s go.

839
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,640
-Let’s go.
-Where?

840
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,000
Let’s go.

841
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,800
It looks good no matter
how you wear it.

842
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Let me dress you up

843
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,400
when you go out next time.

844
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,880
What are you thinking about?

845
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,960
Nothing.

846
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,560
Why don’t you go inside?

847
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,880
It’s a little stuffy inside.

848
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,160
I’m here for some fresh air.

849
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,800
What was your class today
that made you late?

850
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,840
The class someone

851
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,120
hated the most and found most difficult

852
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,560
when she came to the academy first.

853
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,400
I got good grades.

854
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,440
Was there any class

855
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,200
that I found difficult?

856
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,080
Were your grades better than mine?

857
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,560
I mean, aren’t you too old

858
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,400
to play such a trick?

859
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,560
It’s a school reunion today.

860
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,520
We should eat together.

861
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
It’s not your date.

862
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,840
You guys...

863
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:51,840
Come on.

864
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,520
You got to show us some love.

865
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,520
The water is sweet when you are in love.

866
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,360
Now I see it with my own eyes.

867
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,920
We’ll have this soup.

868
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,680
Let’s make Mr. Shao healthier.

869
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,720
-No pepper.
-No pepper.

870
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Okay.

871
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,720
Are you still teaching

872
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,960
the residents?

873
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,760
Yes. It’s the tradition of Renxin.

874
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,040
Every resident

875
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,680
needs to attend clinical lectures
every year.

876
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,040
No less than 20 lectures.

877
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,920
Clinical lectures.

878
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,480
Didn’t you have

879
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,440
a clinical lecture for Professor Wan

880
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,400
when you were his assistant?

881
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,920
You just...

882
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,760
Yeah.

883
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,880
He spoke quickly and fiercely.

884
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,000
It was my first time
to ask him a question.

885
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,280
And I cried because he scolded me
with a sullen face.

886
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,080
All of our classmates

887
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,880
knew it back at that time.

888
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,240
Is Mr. Shao still so strict

889
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,560
when you are teaching?

890
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,040
Every time

891
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,040
I think about

892
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,800
how you cried,

893
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,000
I won’t be

894
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,000
that strict with them.

895
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,560
It’s better to be gentle.

896
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,040
Where’s Wei Lan?

897
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,560
She is on duty today.

898
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,920
I mean, you are in the same hospital.

899
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,720
Don’t you know it?

900
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,360
Our hospital is very big.

901
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,040
You

902
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
only care about

903
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,680
what you want to care.

904
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,920
I mean, who will attend

905
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,760
the school reunion?

906
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,440
Anyone who can come will come.

907
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,800
Almost everyone.

908
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,600
What can we do?

909
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,720
That’s

910
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,760
what I want to tell you.

911
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,200
I’ll take care of

912
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,600
errands like

913
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,280
picking up people

914
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,800
and something like that.

915
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,640
You guys just

916
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,400
help me find

917
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,040
some old stuff,

918
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,000
like our

919
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,000
homework and photos

920
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,600
of that time.

921
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,440
It would be better

922
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,080
if there is any video.

923
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,200
I remember you

924
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,360
you had a digital camera

925
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,480
and you took a lot of photos.

926
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,400
I’ll look for it.

927
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,600
Don’t take too long.

928
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,840
You’d better

929
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,520
give it to me tomorrow.

930
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,920
I’ll get someone to edit it

931
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,600
just like how they do in the TV show.

932
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,680
Then I’ll play it

933
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,800
on the spot.

934
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,560
It’s in such a hurry.

935
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,360
How can I give it to you tomorrow?

936
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
I have no time to find it.

937
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,880
I’ll try it.

938
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Two days.

939
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,680
Okay, I’ll find it for you.

940
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,760
Come on, Yi Qian.

941
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,880
Okay, let’s have a drink,

942
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,560
Come on, let’s have a drink first.

943
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,840
Long time no see.

944
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,840
Come on.
