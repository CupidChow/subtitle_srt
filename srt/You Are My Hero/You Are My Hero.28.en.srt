What’s so shiny?

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,160
Sorry for drooling.

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,880
What’s wrong?

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,200
Are you not feeling well?

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,760
Why am I so uncomfortable?

25
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,840
What’s wrong?

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,320
You are good at acting.

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,120
Considering

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,240
that you are my boyfriend,

29
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,720
even if you fake it,

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,440
I’ll still give you a massage.

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,880
-Okay, nice.
-Are you comfortable now?

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,520
Comfortable.

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,680
Looks like we’ve

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,880
come at a bad time.

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,360
That’s right.

36
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,160
Then we’re leaving.

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,480
Leave the soup.

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,000
You cooked the soup long enough.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,600
Did you have a heart-to-heart talk?

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,120
Good friends never do that.

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,320
We only talked about cooking, all right?

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,800
What?

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,160
Don’t you have hands?

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,480
I have a girlfriend.

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,520
Why should I drink it by myself?

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,040
You are really like a baby now.

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,040
It’s sweet.

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,200

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,000
your brother’s love?

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,320
Are you jealous?

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,040
Just kidding.

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,680
Sit up straight. I’ll feed you.

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
I can’t do this.
I can’t stand it anymore.

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,720
I’ll become green-eyed with you.

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,600
Yeah, I got to go.

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,640
I’ll come to see you another day.

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,920
I am leaving.

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,040
Go ahead and leave.

59
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,920
I have no time for you.

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,040
Oh no.

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,680
I promised my friend

62
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,480
that I’ll track the entertainment news.

63
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,280
I’m going to be late.

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,680
Why there’s no taxi?

65
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,880
It’s not easy to get a taxi right now.

66
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,960
I shouldn’t have

67
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,360
sent the car for maintenance.

68
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,800
If you are in a hurry,

69
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,960
I can give you a ride.

70
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,520
Okay, thank you.

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,140
Let’s go.

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,320
What’s wrong? Are you okay?

73
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,560
Ba! Ba! Ba!

74
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,480
Sorry.

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,160
Sorry, excuse me.

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,160
Sorry, excuse me.

77
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,080
Excuse me.

78
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200

79
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,200
Ba!

80
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520

81
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,120

Stay! Don’t go!

84
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,440
Don’t go!

85
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,960
I’m done.

86
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,110
All right.

87
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,440
How is it? Did you get it?

88
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,880
Yeah, the angle is really good.

89
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,960
Thank you.

90
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,760
No problem. I only lifted a finger.

91
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
You did

92
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
lift a finger.

93
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,280
I got to go.

94
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,000
I have something to do tonight.

95
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,240
Me too.

96
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,560
I’ll treat you to dinner another day

97
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,480
to thank you.

98
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,120
It’s okay. No thanks necessary.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,560
You are right.

100

101

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,080
It’s good.

174
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,080
Will Aunt be with you?

175
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,320
She just finished the operation.

176
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,760
I don’t want her to be too tired.

177
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,280
I just don’t want you to leave.

178
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
After you get there,

179
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,880
can I make a video call

180
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,160
or something else

181
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,040
when I want to talk to you?

182
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,160
As long as it doesn’t bother you.

183
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,440
I’ll be busy with my schoolwork.

184
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,880
But if you want to talk to me,

185
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,200
I can still

186
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,280
save some time for you.

187
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,040
It’s just that our time

188
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,240
is different and you might
need to stay up late.

189
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,280
It’s okay.

190
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,960
I can move my schedule to fit yours.

191
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,280
Well, I’ll get in the car.

192
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,680
Remember to contact me on WeChat.

193
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,440
Okay. Okay.

194
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,480
Mr. Shao.

195
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,200
Did you get Xing Kelei’s

196
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,600
test results?

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,720
Yes.

198
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,800
How is it?

199
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,680
I got good news

200
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,480
and bad news.

201
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
Which one do you want to hear first?

202
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,760
Are there any other problems?

203
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,120
The bad news is

204
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Xing Kelei’s good days of

205
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,040
getting waited on hand and foot

206
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
are going to end.

207
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,840
You mean

208
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,880
he can be discharged?

209
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,040
Yeah.

210
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,320
Oh my god.

211
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,680
Your sense of humor is too scary.

212
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,040
I just want to make a joke

213
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,000
and see your reaction.

214
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,000
Listen,

215
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,480
although Xing Kelei

216
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,280
is ready to be discharged,

217
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
he can’t return to the team right away.

218
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,480
Considering

219
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,440
his job,

220
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,400
I suggest he rest at home

221
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,440
at least for one month.

222
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,060
Okay.

223
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,760
During this time,

224
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,680
he can do some

225
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,400
restorative exercise.

226
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,840
But don’t do it excessively.

227
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,480
Come back for examination
half a month later.

228
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,480
If there are symptoms of

229
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,120
nausea, dizziness or tinnitus,

230
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,440
come to the hospital right away.

231
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,280
Okay.

232
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,120
You are a doctor.

233
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,240
You need to keep an eye on him.

234
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,880
I will. Thank you, Mr. Shao.

235
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,000
But

236
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,640
I’m afraid he will act to be brave

237
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
and insist on going back to the team.

238
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,040
Can you talk to him for me?

239
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,880
Me?

240
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,900
Okay.

241
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,240
Thank you, Mr. Shao.

242
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,000
Doctor.

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,880
I came from the county nearby.

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,960
My wife just gave birth
to our second child.

245
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,400
She had a headache
a few days after giving birth.

246
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,680
The left part of her body

247
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,320
can’t move these days.

248
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,920
And she can’t think clearly today.

249
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,720
Which department should we see?

250
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,320
The neurosurgery.

251
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,160
Where’s your wife?

252
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,840
Over there.

253
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,240
Dear!

254
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,000
Move!

255
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,520
Move! Move!

256
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,080
Be careful.

257
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,520
Be careful.

258
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,600
Turn.

259
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
-The family member should wait outside.
-Leave.

260
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,440
The family member can’t go in.
Wait outside.

261
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,470
Dear...

262
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,580
Is it ready?

263
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,120
Yes.

264
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,480
200 joules, get ready. Move.

265
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,760
Again.

266
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,300
Come on.

267
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,880
How is it?

268
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,980
Again.

269
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,280
The sinus rhythm is restored.

270
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,560
What’s the situation?

271
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,680
She is twenty-nine years old

272
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,680
and just gave birth to a second child.

273
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,880
There is weakness of the left limb

274
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,960
38 days later after the delivery.

275
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,120
She suffered from
unawareness for one day.

276
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
She came from a county nearby

277
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,040
and took a car to our hospital

278
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,960
which spent four hours.

279
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,960
Ventricular fibrillation
occurred ten minutes ago.

280
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,080
We just rescued her.

281
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,640
Do a CT

282
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,440
and an MRI.

283
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,320
Are you suspicious of
a cerebrovascular disease?

284
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,320
The possibility of
a cerebral hemorrhage is high.

285
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Her symptoms are not mild.

286
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,640
Notify Mr. Shao to come down
for consultation.

287
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,400
Okay.

288
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,920
Did you see it?

289
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,160
She just nodded at you.

290
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,160
Are you sure it’s me?

291
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,160
Well done.

292
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Excellent job.

293
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,280
Cavernous hemangioma

294
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,960
with bleeding on the right Pontine.

295
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,080
The bleeding is pressing against
the brain stem.

296
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,560
If it doesn’t stop,

297
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,680
it will lead to death.

298
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,880
Do you see it?

299
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,320
This tumor is on the surface
of the brachium pontis.

300
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,000
There is a chance for surgery, but...

301
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
It can be risky.

302
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,160
Is there any operating room available
this afternoon?

303
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,340
No.

304
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,880
We can only do the operation at night.

305
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,160
Then let’s do it tonight.
We can work overtime.

306
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,400
Okay, I will prepare it.

307
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,520
Go to thank the staff

308
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,600
of the operating room

309
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,520
and the anesthesiologist.

310
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,520
Okay, got it.

311
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,480
Thank you.

312
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,440
They have two children.

313
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,880
One is two-year-old.

314
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,160
The other is just one month old.

315
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,160
What?

316
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,040
Give it to me. Put it down.

317
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,900
Sit over there.

318
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,320
Sit down.

319
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,080
Let me pack it.

320
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,600
I hope you can

321
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,840
keep treating me in this way.

322
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,760
Then I can

323
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,200
sit all the time at home

324
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,160
like a lord.

325
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,760
No problem.

326
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,000
I can break your legs

327
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,600
and then you can sit forever.

328
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,800
Why are you talking

329
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,920
like my sister?

330
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,360
Isn’t this

331
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,880
your family culture?

332
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,880
Are you saying

333
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,160
you are more like my family member?

334
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,520
I’m willing to become one.

335
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,160
Oh my goodness.

336
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,220
Keyao.

337
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,200
The door is open. Behave yourselves.

338
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,600
Didn’t I tell you

339
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,320
not to pick me up?

340
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Of course you don’t

341
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,080
want me to pick you up.

342
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,600
What a third wheel I am.

343
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,680
You are really not here to pick me up.

344
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,960
Well,

345
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,960
the operation was successful.

346
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,080
We should thank

347
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,800
the chief of surgery.

348
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,460
Yes.

349
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,040
We should thank him.

350
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,080
Yes.

351
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,640
Mr. Shao just finished the consultation.

352
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,080
He should be in the office now.

353
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,200
Yeah?

354
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,920
Well,

355
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
I’ll go to say hello to him

356
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:52,870
and thank him.

357
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,440
Yeah. That’s right.

358
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,240
-Yes.
-Okay.

359
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,400
Well...

360
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,800
Go ahead,

361
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,360
I’ll leaving.

362
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,000
Take your time.

363
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,400
Okay.

364
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
Did I wake you up?

365
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,600
It’s okay.

366
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,280
I’m a little tired.

367
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,760
I just took a nap.

368
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,960
Do you have a troublesome case?

369
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,960
Kind of.

370
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,440
Brain stem hemorrhage.

371
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,880
The position of

372
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,390
the Cavernous hemangioma is not bad.

373
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,200
There is a chance for surgery.

374
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,720
But the postoperative symptoms
will be severe.

375
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,560
It’s rare for you to be nervous
before surgery.

376
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,600
I’m not nervous.

377
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,280
I’m just a little anxious.

378
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,200
Perhaps it’s because

379
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,280
she is a mother of two children.

380
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,680
One of her children

381
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,400
is only one month old.

382
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,720
When we were in college,

383
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,280
I remember you told me

384
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,760
that doctors can’t control

385
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,600
the life and death of patients.

386
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,400
You can only try your best.

387
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,480
I believe you.

388
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,120
Thank you.

389
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,480
What time is the operation?

390
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,290
Eight o’clock.

391
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,200
If you have time,

392
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,160
can you stay with me for a while?

393
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,640
Do you want a cup of coffee?

394
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,640
Unfortunately,

395
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,120
the ground coffee just ran out.

396
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,080
I brought some.

397
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,280
The peripheral brain tissue is icteric.

398
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,640
We are near the bleeding position.

399
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,080
I will start to

400
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,800
separate the tumor from the brain.

401
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,240
What’s the situation?

402
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,640
The heartbeat is only 30.

403
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,320
It gets normal. It’s 60 now.

404
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,880
It’s the brain stem reflex.

405
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,040
I’ll try to separate it
from another place.

406
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,360
The brain stem is a place

407
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,360
where transmitters
are most concentrated.

408
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,880
It’s like the bus of

409
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,640
the telecom bureau.

410
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,440
If you damage a little bit of it,

411
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,640
it will affect a large area.

412
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,000
Mr. Shao, let me wipe your sweat.

413
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,640
Do you see the tumor?

414
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,400
It’s like a mulberry.

415
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,320
A part of it protrudes
into the brain stem.

416
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,040
Change to the fine stripper.

417
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:21,990
Cotton.

418
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,080
Dr. Shao.

419
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,880
You are amazing.

420
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,240
Did you sleep well?

421
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,260
I...

422
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,480
I wasn’t sleeping.

423
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,200
You weren’t sleeping?

424
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,000
How many times I’ve told you

425
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,400
to not sleep in the car

426
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,120
with the engine on?

427
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,160
It’s dangerous.

428
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,400
I have a cold.

429
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,080
I got a little sleepy
after taking cold medicine.

430
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,440
You can sleep in the dorm.

431
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,640
But I’m waiting for you.

432
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,600
Don’t do this next time.

433
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,760
I’m worried about you.

434
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,920
Okay?

435
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,720
How many times I’ve told you

436
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,920
to not sleep in the car

437
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,580
with the engine on?

438
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,200
It’s dangerous.

439
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,720
I kept the sunroof open.

440
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,560
Why do you stay in the car?

441
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,560
I have a cold

442
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,440
and I was having a rest.

443
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,000
How is the operation?

444
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,840
Very successful.

445
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,120
Well,

446
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,240
I’m hungry.

447
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,070
Hungry?

448
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,720
The restaurants nearby

449
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,880
are all closed

450
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,840
right now.

451
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,360
How about going to my office

452
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:28,940
and I’ll make noodles for you?

453
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,800
Okay.

454
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:30,990
Let’s go.

455
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,360
Let it boil for a while.

456
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,160
Any drinks?

457
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,000
Black coffee.

458
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,080
It’s too late for black coffee.

459
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,160
I have a

460
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,400
conference call from Germany later.

461
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,960
Wait for me.

462
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,520
It’s a little hot, be careful.

463
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,520
Why does it smell like this?

464
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,680
Didn’t you say that you have a cold?

465
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,960
Don’t drink black coffee. Have this.

466
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,600
I’m fine.

467
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,480
Follow the doctor’s advice.

468
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,120
The Vienna Symphony Orchestra

469
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,960
will come here to perform next week.

470
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,920
I can get some tickets.

471
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,240
Do you want to go together?

472
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,240
If I’m not too busy

473
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,560
next week,

474
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,880
we can go together.

475
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,020
Okay.

476
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,200
It should be done.

477
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,200
Isn’t the heat too high?

478
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,000
The...

479
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,120
The stuffing is coming out.

480
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,880
Can you not meddle?

481
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,320
Go to sit over there.

482
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,080
Is this still glutinous rice ball?

483
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,280
It’s obviously soup now.

484
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,880
Did you put the fermented
glutinous rice in it?

485
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,000
Stop telling me what to do.

486
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,280
Just wait for it.

487
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,900
Here you are.

488
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,200
Sesame glutinous rice balls
in rice wine.

489
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,600
I saw the sesame.

490
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,480
Where are the glutinous rice balls?

491
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,080
Here.

492
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,960
Isn’t this just a bowl of sesame paste?

493
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
-Very good.
-You don’t like it?

494
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,320
It’s good. It’s good.

495
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,600
It’s not bad to have some watery food.

496
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,400
You just had surgery.
It’s good for your stomach.

497
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,600
It’s difficult for you

498
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,880
to digest

499
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,040
too much solid food.

500
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,160
Can you get one more bowl?

501
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Doesn’t it mean

502
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,000
that I need to wash one more bowl?

503
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,160
That makes sense.

504
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,870
Right?

505
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,460
Yes.

506
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,200
Give it to me.

507
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,640
All right.

508
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,040
You have this.

509
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,920
I won’t.

510
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,200
Do you think I’m fat?

511
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,600
No. When did I ever say that?

512
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,240
Just now.

513
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,160
No. Not at all.

514
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,160
Hurry up and eat.

515
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,200
Let me feed you.

516
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,820
No.

517
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,480
You just got discharged,
I should help you eat

518
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,760
-and take care of you.
-This is too sweet.

519
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,510
Come on.

520
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,390
Hurry up.

521
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,890
Eat it.

522
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,640
Then you will also have a fat belly.

523
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,160
Are you feeding a pig?

524
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,280
And we will be a better match.

525
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,020
All right.

526
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:54,880
Are you finished?

527
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,520
Let me do it.

528
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,200
Let me do it.

529
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,080
Let me do it.

530
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
It has been many days

531
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,730
after the surgery.

532
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,640
I should use my hands now. Come on.

533
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,280
Don’t.

534
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,560
You will have a lot of chances

535
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,520
to express yourself in the future.

536
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,320
Let me do it.

537
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,160
In the future?

538
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,920
When? How long?

539
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,200
Well,

540
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,160
a long time later.

541
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,480
Go to watch TV.

542
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,640
All right.

543
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,760
Nice shot!

544
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,560
Stop watching it.

545
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,640
You just had the operation.

546
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,320
You can’t get too excited.

547
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,960
I’ll get more excited
if you don’t let me see it.

548
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,680
Oh my god.

549
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,640
They won!

550
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,360
Excellent!

551
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,840
Nice shot!

552
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,000
Look! Look!

553
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,630
Look.

554
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,360
They won! They won!

555
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,910
They won!

556
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,400
Can you stop shaking me?

557
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,200
Sorry.

558
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,840
How do you get more excited than I do?

559
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,600
I’m sorry. You are not dizzy, right?

560
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,310
I am not dizzy.

561
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,360
Are you dizzy?

562
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,800
I am not dizzy.

563
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,480
Watch the game.

564
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,600
I am fine.

565
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,520
You are not uncomfortable, right?

566
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
I’m not uncomfortable.

567
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,960
I’m so happy.

568
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,960
Nice shot!

569
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,640
Come on.

570
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,920
I mean,

571
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,840
can you be more reliable?

572
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
You promised her.

573
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,280
Why should I do it for you?

574
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,280
No.

575
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,240
It’s really not my fault.

576
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,920
I thought I would have time today

577
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,520
when I promised her.

578
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,760
Who knows Luo Ting

579
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,200
would change shift with me?

580
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,720
I need to be on duty today.

581
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,800
Where’s Luo Ting?

582
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,560
Luo Ting has guests today.

583
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,440
He can’t leave.

584
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,040
Just go there for me.

585
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,600
My cousin is still waiting.

586
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,680
She said

587
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,960
she will pay

588
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,800
two hundred yuan for an hour.

589
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,120
Just teach her something about

590
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,920
self-defense,

591
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,880
taekwondo,

592
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,680
and Sanda.

593
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,920
That’s all you need to teach her.

594
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,560
You...

595
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,880
She was followed by a pervert recently.

596
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,000
Do you bear to see

597
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,800
an innocent young girl

598
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,080
be persecuted?

599
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,680
I mean, which cousin is she?

600
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,840
Why haven’t I heard of her before?

601
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,240
I have a lot of cousins.

602
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,920
Which one do you want to know?

603
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,800
All right, I’ve arrived.

604
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,140
I mean,

605
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,640
when did Xia

606
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,280
become your cousin?

607
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,880
Why are you here?

608
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,120
Where’s Li Nian?

609
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,440
He has something else to do.

610
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,800
He asked me to come.

611
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,360
Do you want to learn taekwondo?

612
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,360
Someone is stalking you?

613
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,960
I’m not sure.

614
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,920
There is a pervert

615
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,280
who called himself my fan.

616
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,440
He sends me a lot of disgusting messages

617
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,160
on Weibo every day.

618
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,920
The important thing is

619
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,160
he even knows my home address.

620
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,800
It’s too scary.

621
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,080
Just call the police.

622
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,040
I don’t think they will make it a case.

623
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,560
He hasn’t made any move.

624
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,040
I don’t know who he is.

625
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,040
Can the police

626
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,800
protect me 24 hours a day?

627
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,040
I guess he is just

628
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,000
a perverted internet troll.

629
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,640
I told Li Nian

630
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,040
that I will pay him 200 yuan
for an hour.

631
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,780
No need.

632
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,240
Of course I won’t pay you.

633
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,120
We are good friends.

634
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,240
For a beginner like you,

635
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,480
I will teach you about
free sparring first.

636
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,240
Draw your right leg back.

637
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,320
Shift all the weight backwards.

638
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,640
Protect your cheeks with your hands.

639
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,400
The cheek is

640
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,160
the most vulnerable part of the face.

641
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,560
Your opponent can easily
knockout you through it.

642
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,320
Use your waist to drive your thighs.

643
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,120
I’ll show it again.

644
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,240
Use your waist to drive your thighs.

645
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,880
I’ll do it slowly this time.

646
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Use your waist.

647
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,120
Kick.

648
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,520
Withdraw.

649
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
One, two, three.

650
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,310
Try again.

651
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,240
One, two, three.

652
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,120
Try again.

653
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,040
One, two, three.

654
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,440
Next we will practice front kick.

655
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,760
Still the same way to do it.

656
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,240
But the direction is different.

657
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,800
Look how I do it.

658
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,040
Try to do it. Come on.

659
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,960
One, two, three, kick.

660
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,320
Take it back.

661
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,800
One two three, kick.

662
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,440
Take it back.

663
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,000
One of the most vulnerable parts

664
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
of the human body is the throat.

665
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,240
Another place is...

666
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,560
Well...

667
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,720
Well,

668
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,680
let’s have a practice.

669
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,840
Come on. Try it.

670
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,440
Won’t I kick you?

671
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
It’s okay. Empty your mind.

672
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,560
Kick here.

673
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,350
Okay?

674
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,760
One, two, three.

675
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,600
Nice.

676
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,080
One, two, three.

677
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,080
Harder!

678
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,080
Kick here.

679
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:56,600
Harder!

680
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,040
Sorry.

681
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,110
I’m fine.

682
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,000
Let’s do it again.

683
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,360
Come on.

684
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,750
Harder.

685
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,320
One, two, three. Go.

686
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,280
Nice.

687
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,400
One, two, three. Go.

688
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,290
Great.

689
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
Your tendons are not relaxed enough.

690
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,080
So you can’t use your strength well

691
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,880
and kick the target accurately.

692
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,160
Let me stretch your tendons.

693
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,000
It hurts.

694
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,560
Don’t you often do yoga?

695
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,920
I never stretched here.

696
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,760
Come on, relax.

697
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,080
Hang on.

698
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,760
Your knees.

699
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,950
Your knees.

700
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,000
Well...

701
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,200
Sorry.

702
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,640
I didn’t do it on purpose.

703
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,520
You need to stretch your legs...

704
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,320
Come on, get up first.

705
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,120
I think

706
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
we’ve practiced enough today.

707
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,750
Okay.

708
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,480
I’ll leave.

709
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,240
Well...

710
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,720
Just take it as a goodbye kiss

711
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,240
between good friends.

712
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,000
Don’t worry about it.

738

I’m leaving.

739
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:00,960
Bye.

740
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,230
She is lucky indeed.

741
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,840
She can be saved from

742
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,670
such a severe cerebral hemorrhage.

743
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,440
It’s just that her right hand

744
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,130
will have functional impairment.

745
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,320
The people from the Orthopedics said

746
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,150
that it’s hard for her to fully recover.

747
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,080
I heard that she is

748
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,960
a piano player.

749
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,360
Isn’t there such a saying

750
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,400
that you never know

751
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,800
whether tomorrow

752
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,760
or accident will come first?

753
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,000
How is Xing Kelei doing?

754
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,920
I think he is recovering well.

755
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,040
Good.

756
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,840
Remember you still have some days off.

757
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,440
You can take a rest.

758
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
Thank you, Mr. Shao.

759
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,150
I will handle it.

760
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,000
Wenbo.

761
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,400
Well, I’ll go back tomorrow

762
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,710
and get trained with you.

763
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,230
So soon?

764
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,190
Don’t you need to rest
for a few more days?

765
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,480
I’ve rested for a long time.

766
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,960
Training

767
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,630
is the best rest for me.

768
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,710
That’s the deal.

769
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,440
I’m back!

770
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,960
I’ll hang up.

771
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,840
It’s late.

772
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,880
I have a patient

773
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,800
with serious brain trauma.

774
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,640
I just finished the operation.

775
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,920
I heard you say on the phone

776
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,360
that you are going back to the team?

777
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,160
Well,

778
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,520
the combat is about to start.

779
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,000
I’ve rested for a long time.

780
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,640
It’s time to go back.

781
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,640
Why don’t you

782
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,600
discuss with me first?

783
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,360
Well,

784
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,720
I’m discussing with you now.

785
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,600
You’ve called the team

786
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,640
and packed your stuff.

787
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,400
Is that discussing with me?

788
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,000
You’re notifying me.

789
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,000
Are you angry?

790
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,320
No.

791
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,720
You are angry.

792
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
It’s all on your face.

793
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,760
Mr. Shao said

794
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,920
you’d better rest for
more than one month.

795
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,400
Why don’t you listen to him?

796
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,680
I think I’m good now.

797
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,560
Look at my body.

798
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,800
Look,

799
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,000
I can even lift you up.

800
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,560
Look.

801
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,170
Here we go.

802
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,160
Put me down.

803
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,160
I’m serious now.

804
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I will take care of

805
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,520
my own body.

806
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,720
I’m worried.

807
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,160
Once you start training,

808
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,960
you won’t remember what Mr. Shao said

809
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,200
and you won’t remember me.

810
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,840
It’s for sure that I won’t remember him.

811
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,960
But I will remember you.

812
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,400
You are not serious at all.

813
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,680
I will always remember

814
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,520
that you worry about me.

815
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,280
Let me go.

816
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,480
All right?

817
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,920
All right?

818
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,000
If anything goes wrong,

819
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,800
you must let me know

820
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,240
in the first time.

821
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,440
Don’t make me worry.

822
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,920
I’m really concerned.

823
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,040
Captain Hao.

824
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,720
You’re back.

825
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Next training program

826
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,000
is ten-meter shooting!

827
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:40,920
March forward!

828
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:58,920
Captain Shu.

829
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,320
Captain Hao, please check the target!

830
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,200
Return of the king.

831
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,960
It’s impressive.

832
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,960
Salute!

833
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,360
Welcome Captain Xing back!

834
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,200
This shooting practice is creative.

835
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,240
It can be kept.

836
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,880
Down!

837
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:23,990
How are you?

838
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,480
You have rested for three weeks.

839
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,680
Your hands must be itchy now.

840
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,360
You know me the best.

841
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,800
I haven’t used it for a long time.

842
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,160
I guess it’s mad at me.

843
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,240
Don’t worry, take your time.

844
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,120
You still got time.

845
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,120
You will get the feeling back

846
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,960
a few days later.

847
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
We will eat out tonight.

848
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,880
My treat!

849
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,040
Yes!

850
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,400
Dismiss!

851
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,120
If anything goes wrong,

852
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,480
you must let me know in the first time.

853
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,480
Don’t make me worry.

854
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,760
Come in.

855
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:53,800
Captain Xing.

856
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,540
Captain Xing.

857
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,960
You are here.

858
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,810
What’s wrong?

859
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,520
Nothing.

860
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,600
I haven’t seen you since the meal.

861
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,520
Well, Captain Xing,

862
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,040
why don’t we

863
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,680
play a game together

864
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,560
tonight?

865
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,160
I’m not playing.

866
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,040
I need to make a call.

867
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,320
All right.

868
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,200
Do what you got to do.

869
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,700
(Xing Kelei)

870
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,000
Hello.

871
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,170
Hello.

872
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,480
Are you busy?

873
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,680
I’m watching the surgery video.

874
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,600
How are you feeling now?

875
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,560
I want to ask you something.

876
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,720
Go ahead.

877
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,360
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

878
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,000
When I shot today,

879
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,440
somehow my hands

880
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,200
started to shake.

881
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,880
Could it be

882
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,880
the aftereffect of the surgery?

883
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,520
Pituitary adenoma won’t

884
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,320
cause hands shaking generally.

885
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,440
Do you have

886
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,360
any other discomforts?

887
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
What about your eyes?

888
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,640
My eyes are fine.
Only my hands are shaking.

889
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,640
The operation was definitely successful.

890
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,560
Well,

891
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,640
come to the hospital tomorrow.

892
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,600
I’ll take you

893
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,480
to see Mr. Shao.

894
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,740
All right.

895
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,680
I’ll hang up.

896
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,880
Hold on.

897
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,080
I’m happy that you tell me directly

898
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,080
about your problem

899
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
and you didn’t carry it on your own.

900
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,440
I promised you.

901
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,440
Of course I will keep my words.

902
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,520
Promise me, relax, okay?

903
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,920
Okay, don’t worry.

904
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,320
Good night.

905
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,700
Good night.

906
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,020
(Outpatient)

907
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,880
The MRI shows no problem.

908
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,720
Which means your pituitary tumor...

909
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,040
Mi Ka knows it,

910
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,400
it’s a technical term,
you don’t know it.

911
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,480
To put it in a simple way,

912
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,720
the bad thing

913
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,520
in your head

914
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,120
has been removed.

915
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,240
But my hands

916
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,080
are still shaking when I hold a gun.

917
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,840
The brain is very complicated.

918
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,560
It controls a lot of nerves.

919
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,080
Although it’s very unlikely,

920
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
I still can’t give you

921
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,840
a 100% guarantee

922
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,920
that this operation

923
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,200
hasn’t affected

924
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,520
your upper limbs nerves at all.

925
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,520
Is there any way

926
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,680
to improve it?

927
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,120
Relax and have more rest.

928
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,280
Let’s observe it for a while.

929
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,880
Is there any rehabilitation training

930
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,360
or something like that?

931
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,840
You can do finger push-up

932
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,160
or lift dumbbells.

933
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,280
It will help your recover

934
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,840
the strength of your upper limbs,
especially your hands.

935
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,320
But I suggest you do it moderately.

936
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,400
After all,

937
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,520
you haven’t fully recovered yet.

938
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,280
Can he go back to the team

939
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,040
for training?

940
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,840
He can.

941
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,280
But make sure to do it
gradually without rushing.

942
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,360
Give your body

943
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,920
some time to adapt to it.

944
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,680
I know

945
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,200
you are in a hurry.

946
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,600
But there is a saying

947
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,600
that two steps forward, one step back.

948
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,360
Sometimes your mental

949
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,480
anxiety or tensions

950
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,960
can also make your hands shake.

951
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,320
Don’t pay too much attention
to your hands.

952
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,480
They will be fine in a while.

953
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,840
Got it.

954
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,480
Thank you, Mr. Shao.
