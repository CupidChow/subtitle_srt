Why didn’t you call Xing Kelei

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,680
after the accident?

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,160
He can help you.

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,000
My brother is a special policeman.

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,400
I can’t rely too much on him.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,640
Right.

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,600
The work of a special policeman

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,840
is similar to the doctors’.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
We always stand by.

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Uh,

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,560
I thought you were doing good

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,600
in the medical research center abroad.

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,400
Why did you come home

33
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,760
to practice clinical medicine?

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,320
I just missed the place.

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,080
I got too many memories here.

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,480
If one

37
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,680
starts to reminisce,

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,200
it marks he’s getting old.

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
I don’t want to deny it,

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
but to be honest,

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,640
it does feel different

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,480
from before.

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,720
What have you been up to lately?

44
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I’m thinking about

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,040
being the agent of

46
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,800
a new type

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,160
of aneurysm clip.

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,280
But I haven’t touched

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,000
practical medical equipment
for years.

50
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,600
If you have time,

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,640
could you have a look
and give me some advice?

52
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,550
OK.

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,320
Just email me the information.

54
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,400
Thanks.

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,240
You’re welcome.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,760
And I owe you

57
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,240
a formal apology.

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,200
I got you wrong last time

59
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,280
in Linan.

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,960
I thought you were making a show

61
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,360
in the name of disaster relief.

62
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,920
In fact,

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,360
you did many things

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,360
and I now know.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,540
Oh, yeah?

66
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,320
I didn’t know

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,280
you thought that way.

68
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,800
My bad.

69
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,880
It’s been 7 years,

70
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,840
so, I assume we

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,280
all have changes in our lives.

72
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,240
But many things on you

73
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,080
remain the same.

74
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,430
(Xing Kelei)
Are you awake?

75
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,900
(Mi Ka: Don’t worry.
I won’t stand you up.)

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,830
15 minutes, wait at the door.

77
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,220
(15 minutes? That’s too rushed.)

78
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,240
You’re home, sister.

79
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,400
A-dozen-hour flight was exhausting.

80
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,960
I want some noodles before
I go to bed.

81
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,760
I, uh, I...

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,880
I’m going to...

83
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,800
Be out in a rush?

84
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,440
Out for a jog.

85
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,200
A jog?

86
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,000
Why do you wear perfume?

87
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,960
Nah, it’s the smell of detergent.

88
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,720
Keyao.

89
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,680
You’re out for a jog?

90
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,520
We’re going to...

91
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,360
I’m going to throw away
the garbage.

92
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,880
The garbage.

93
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,600
You’re well dressed.

94
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,120
We can’t be

95
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,000
too casual in our lives.

96
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
See you around.

97
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,400
All right.

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,920
I’m not going to eat anything.

99
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,080
Go to jog.

100
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,960
Why didn’t you let me tell
my sister

101
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
that we’re in a relationship?

102
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,520
Captain Xing,

103
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
can you run

104
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,720
at the speed of mine?

105
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,760
You’re so weak.

106
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,800
I should revoke

107
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,520
your certificate of completion.

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,920
You don’t keep

109
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,560
your word.

110
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
I really should reconsider

111
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
our relationship.

112
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,520
What’s the relationship between us?

113
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,880
Is it so hard to open our relationship?

114
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,200
You don’t want to face it
and forbid me from opening it.

115
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,760
Can’t you let me get prepared?

116
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,920
The ugly wife will meet
the in-laws, anyway.

117
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,200
Who is an ugly wife?

118
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,960
Let me prepare myself.

119
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,200
What?

120
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,320
This is better.

121
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800

Listen to my command,

125
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,080
ready...

126
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,120
I can’t jog anymore.

127
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,200

No.

130
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,240
Wait.

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,960
Shouldn’t you be reluctant to
part with me?

176
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,840
You’re supposed to cherish

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,960
the time that you spend with me.

178
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,760
The time is short,

179
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,200
so, we need to hurry.

180
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,360
It’s only 6:00 AM.

181
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,840
I need to be at work at 7:00 AM.

182
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,800
The ward-check starts at 7:30 AM.

183
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,640
If I’m late, Director Shao will...

184
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
He hates running late the most.

185
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Director Shao again.

186
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,440
This is my first day
to get back to Neurosurgery.

187
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,720
I can’t make mistakes.

188
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,720
OK.

189
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,600
Are you finished?

190
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,720
I’m just about to start.

191
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Can you pack your food?

192
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,520
Sorry, please pack our food.

193
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,360
You don’t mind
driving and eating, do you?

194
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,200
Here.

195
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,040
You’re back, Dr. Mi.

196
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,800
Here’s your cup of coffee.

197
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,350
Thank you.

198
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,200
Thanks.

199
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,760
You’re welcome.

200
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,160
Guys, come to get your coffee.

201
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,800
Here, four for you.

202
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,400
You decide who gets what.

203
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,200
Thank you, Dr. Mi.

204
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,640
Dr. Jia, Dr. Zhang.

205
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,620
Yanshan.

206
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,360
Here’s your coffee.

207
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,480
Dr. Jia.

208
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,440
Thanks.

209
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,320
Dr. Zhang.

210
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,560
-Here.
-You’re so kind.

211
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,200
Mi Ka,

212
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,800
are you happy about officially

213
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,470
re-joining Neurosurgery today?

214
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,520
I am.

215
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,240
Please give me

216
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,160
more instructions.

217
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,960
No problem.

218
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,120
You flatter me.

219
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,680
We need your instructions.

220
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,210
I...

221
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,200
You and Director Shao

222
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,080
worked together at the earthquake area

223
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,400
and managed to finish

224
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,280
the impossible

225
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,240
operation,

226
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,560
which amazes the whole hospital.

227
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,600
You were composed

228
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,160
and finished the congestion surgery
within 2 hours.

229
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,840
Right?

230
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,920
I alone can’t

231
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
take all the credit.

232
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
Plus, everybody helped.

233
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,280
She’s awesome.

234
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,500
She seized the golden opportunity.

235
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,720
We can cover each other’s shift.

236
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,080
We’re going to be late. Let’s go.

237
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,040
It’s about time. Go.

238
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,360
-The meeting will be on.
-It’s about time.

239
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,980
Go.

240
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,040
The operation was finished
late last night.

241
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,570
You worked hard.

242
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,200
Is everyone here?

243
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,030
Yes.

244
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,160
The meeting begins.

245
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,120
Please briefly state the condition of

246
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,960
every patient of yours

247
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,280
and your surgery plans.

248
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,480
Chen Dandan is going to

249
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,480
have aortic aneurysm operation.

250
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,520
My suggestion for her family is

251
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,560
interventional surgery.

252
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,320
Tell us why

253
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,160
you suggest an interventional surgery.

254
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,960
Because the aneurysm

255
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
is at a tricky spot.

256
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,120
Craniotomy can be quite tricky.

257
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,440
And the aneurysm isn’t very big,

258
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
so, I think

259
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,920
interventional surgery is safer.

260
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,960
Xu Yanshan,

261
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,320
is a stent needed?

262
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,240
I don’t think so.

263
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,840
A single duct and a spring ring

264
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,340
will do.

265
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,000
Because the neck

266
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,240
of her aneurysm

267
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,240
is thin,

268
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,800
the spring ring

269
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,920
can be bent into the shape of a basket.

270
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,000
Dr. Jia Li discussed it

271
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,080
with me yesterday.

272
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Yanshan and I are

273
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,160
working on the patient together.

274
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,920
OK, pass. Next.

275
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,200
I’ve got a patient who has

276
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,980
carotid artery stenosis.

277
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,520
He’ll have the operation today.

278
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
His carotid bifurcation

279
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,760
is high

280
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,960
and the old-aged patient

281
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,000
has many other underlying diseases.

282
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,080
Carotid endarterectomy is highly tricky.

283
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,840
And during the operation,

284
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,640
there will be more complications,

285
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,480
so, a stent is needed.

286
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,160
DAPT will be adopted
after the operation.

287
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,730
Over.

288
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,160
Stent is OK,

289
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,080
but beware of

290
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,440
the syndrome of normal pressure
perfusion breakthrough.

291
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
Use tranquilizer and operate
depressurization if necessary.

292
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
You are right.

293
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,000
This is the key of the operation.

294
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,480
I’ll pay attention to that.

295
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,560
I will, too.

296
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,800
You’re being modest.

297
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,400
Anything else?

298
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,240
Two brain hemorrhage cases.

299
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,200
Will operate puncture.

300
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,080
OK.

301
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,160
If there’s nothing else,

302
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,080
prep yourself

303
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,920
and start checking the wards.

304
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,520
She is the patient who had
aortic aneurysm operation yesterday?

305
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,520
Let me pass, Mi Ka.

306
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,160
OK.

307
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,360
Her consciousness
started to blur earlier today.

308
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,000
Body temperature?

309
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
37.5 Celsius.

310
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,240
Liao Lingling?

311
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,760
Liao Lingling?

312
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,840
Turn on MRI

313
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,720
to detect hydrocephalus.

314
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,290
OK.

315
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,010
Here.

316
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,840
Liu Meirong, age 57.

317
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,280
She was hospitalized due to
sudden diminution of vision.

318
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,920
No vomit, headache

319
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,880
or dizziness.

320
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,880
She had MRI in her hometown.

321
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,440
It shows space-occupying lesions
in the sellar region.

322
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,520
Your opinion?

323
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,760
A CT scan first

324
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,160
to identity whether it’s

325
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,120
craniopharyngioma
or hypophysoma,

326
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,120
then do a follow-up

327
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,760
hypophyseal hormone check.

328
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,480
Mi Ka?

329
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,920
Why does Yanshan suggest

330
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,760
a CT scan?

331
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,120
Step forward.

332
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,320
Because a CT scan

333
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,120
can tell if

334
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,320
the tumor is calcified.

335
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,360
If it is,

336
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,360
then it’s craniopharyngioma.

337
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,840
We can make preparations

338
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,680
before the operation

339
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,440
to identity the condition of
sphenoid sinus

340
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,120
and sellar region.

341
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,240
But I suggest an additional

342
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,280
enhanced MRI

343
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,960
to confirm

344
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,240
the aggressiveness of the tumor.

345
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,200
OK, a CT scan

346
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,960
and an enhanced MRI.

347
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,680
Doctor,

348
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,240
will you operate on me?

349
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,640
We need to see the reports.

350
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,520
But don’t worry.

351
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,240
It’ll be a small operation.

352
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,960
Well done.

353
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,120
Thank you, director.

354
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,280
Yanshan knows everything

355
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,920
about the patients.

356
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,060
She...

357
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,000
She doesn’t even need to
look at the medical records.

358
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,240
Before the ward-checking,

359
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,560
a doctor must know

360
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,560
her patients well.

361
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,880
This is the very basic requirement.

362
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,360
If you can’t do that,

363
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,280
you can go back

364
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,520
to being an intern.

365
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,880
Director Shao is right.

366
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,760
We must work harder.

367
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,000
You have many patients.

368
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,360
Let Mi Ka handle some.

369
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,320
OK.

370
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,920
Let’s go to the office.

371
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,760
OK.

372
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,680
They are newly hospitalized.

373
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
You ask them about
their medical histories,

374
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,440
genetic diseases

375
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,400
and allergies.

376
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,240
Then you collect their X-ray films

377
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,040
before they were hospitalized here.

378
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,960
OK.

379
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,880
That’s it?

380
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,960
You’re just here.

381
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,200
You need to do the basic work.

382
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,520
Mi Ka.

383
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,440
That’s unfair.

384
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,440
Why did she

385
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,880
talk to you in that tone of voice?

386
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,120
And

387
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
medical history enquiry is something

388
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,160
interns should do.

389
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,680
Director Shao ordered her

390
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,400
to let you handle some patients,

391
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,000
not let you be her assistant.

392
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,480
She may be busy.

393
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,080
I’ll do what she asked me to do.

394
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,680
How’s your morning?

395
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,590
So so.

396
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,110
See? You’re back in Neurosurgery.

397
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,760
Everything’s different.

398
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,310
You get to eat on time.

399
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
Unlike me. I’m counting.

400
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,800
The old nun has

401
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,200
blamed me 7 times in the morning.

402
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,640
I can't get along with her.

403
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,200
Have you ever thought about

404
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,760
examining yourself?

405
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,000
She’s your step-mom or
step-sister?

406
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,560
Oh, where is Yanshan?

407
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,480
Why isn’t she with you?

408
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,360
Yanshan is busy.

409
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
And you’re not busy?

410
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
You’re sitting on the bench, are you?

411
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,160
Yanshan has to be busy,

412
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,160
right?

413
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,280
There are so many patients.

414
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,080
She needs to attend to them

415
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,560
and she has to write her thesis

416
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,480
to win her appraisal.

417
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,160
Can’t she give herself a break?

418
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,360
Dr. Zhang,

419
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,200
what’s the purpose of passing
the appraisal system

420
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
in Neurosurgery Department?

421
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,600
It’s quite helpful.

422
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Every year, Neurosurgery Department
resident doctors

423
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,560
have the chance to study abroad.

424
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,080
If one gets an A in the appraisal,

425
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,640
he or she will be prioritized.

426
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,080
That’s great.

427
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,080
Sure.

428
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,240
Mi Ka.

429
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,960
I remember

430
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,800
you’ve been doing experiments

431
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,000
and writing... About what again?

432
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,160
About the treatment effects

433
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,240
on intracranial infected patients

434
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,000
and the distribution of pathogenic
bacteria in their cerebrospinal fluid

435
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,400
after craniocerebral operations.

436
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,880
What is it going on?

437
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,400
Pretty close to the completion.

438
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,080
But I need more data analysis.

439
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,080
I had been busy in the ER

440
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,960
so, I didn’t have time.

441
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,760
I think you should

442
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,680
be serious about it.

443
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,160
You have a good chance.

444
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,320
Director Shao thinks highly of you.

445
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,600
I’ll finish my paper

446
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,880
but about the appraisal...

447
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,720
I just re-joined the team.

448
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,280
I don’t think

449
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,920
I deserve the opportunity.

450
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,120
Finish your paper first.

451
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,360
I believe in you.

452
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,360
Thank you. Thanks.

453
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,160
I believe in you, too.

454
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,160
You should.

455
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,680
I’m out.

456
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,080
Where are you?

457
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,160
Turn left.

458
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Lockstep.

459
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,160
You’re too loud.

460
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,720
I’m right here. You didn’t see me?

461
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,000
If you were doing an operation,

462
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,320
you wouldn’t cut the
wrong part, would you?

463
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,400
I’m a different person

464
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,840
when I’m wearing my uniform.

465
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,320
If there’s anything wrong with you,

466
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,120
I can cut you up.

467
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,840
There is, actually.

468
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,360
Help me extend

469
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,520
the life line.

470
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,680
Up here?

471
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,240
Stop smirking.

472
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,480
Only two hours left.

473
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,240
Get in the car.

474
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,680
What two hours?

475
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,360
I told you this morning

476
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,760
that I have to go back to
the force by 10:00 PM.

477
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,040
Do you have to stay in the dorm

478
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,920
other than weekends?

479
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,080
There’s one way.

480
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,020
What?

481
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,120
You cut up

482
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,080
my life line.

483
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,240
Why are you standing still?

484
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,440
Get in, get in.

485
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,560
Hey, I... I...

486
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,720
I don’t know how to drive.

487
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,600
This is my seat.

488
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,280
Sorry, sorry.

489
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,760
Since you are so kind

490
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,160
to pick me up,

491
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,800
I’ll buy you dinner.

492
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,840
Anything you like.

493
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,720
Anything I like?

494
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,760
Food stall.

495
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,360
Food stall?

496
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,960
Pick a large restaurant, OK?

497
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,440
Just the one where you and

498
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,760
Director Shao dined.

499
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,240
That’s not a food stall.

500
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,560
That’s a small canteen.

501
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,210
I don’t care.

502
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,800
I want to eat in that canteen, then.

503
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,640
Why are you

504
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
so insistent?

505
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,360
I must!

506
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,360
All right, all right.

507
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,480
The canteen it is, then.

508
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,280
You help me save money.

509
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,240
I’m happy.

510
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,600
What would you like to eat?

511
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,000
My treat. Order whatever you like.

512
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,010
No.

513
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,400
I’ll order

514
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,200
the same dishes you ate

515
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,640
with Director Shao.

516
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,000
You want the dishes that

517
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,320
I ate with Director Shao?

518
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,520
Are you sure?

519
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,240
Yeah.

520
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,400
Is this what you ate?

521
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,360
Raw brain?

522
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,680
Brain sashimi?

523
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,680
Exotic, right?

524
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,160
Eat it, then.

525
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,560
No, no, no.

526
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,520
I must leave

527
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,320
the special dish to you.

528
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,040
I’ll be eating

529
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,720
the normal stuff.

530
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,200
You’re a girl.

531
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,840
You shouldn’t eat so much.

532
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,160
You think I’ll get fat?

533
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,320
No, no. I’m afraid

534
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,840
they can’t be digested easily.

535
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,920
My digestive system is fine.

536
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,040
You think I’ll get fat.

537
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,760
No.

538
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,840
You think I’m fat, right?

539
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,840
I like plump girls, but

540
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,200
I’ll help you eat some.

541
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,520
There’s so much.

542
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,720
All right,

543
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,120
you either eat this

544
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,000
or finish all

545
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,120
the rest

546
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,920
dishes here.

547
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,960
Don’t waste any food.

548
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,680
No problem.

549
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,280
You eat some.

550
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,480
No, I’m trying to lose weight.

551
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,800
I don’t want you to dislike me.

552
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,400
I can’t eat any.

553
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,560
Can’t eat any?

554
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,880
Come in.

555
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,800
You just finished training,
didn’t you?

556
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,480
I ate too much.

557
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,680
I’m too full.

558
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,960
Aren’t you careful with
your calorie intake?

559
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,360
Nowadays, girls

560
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,560
like to try everything,

561
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,720
but they just take one bite.

562
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,840
I...

563
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
You don’t understand.

564
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,320
Why do you want to see me?

565
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,160
This is the schedule for

566
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,240
tomorrow’s exchange with
Black Panther Assault Team.

567
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,800
Put it there.

568
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,680
OK.

569
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,800
White peach flavor.

570
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,560
I remember Mi Ka

571
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,520
likes the flavor.

572
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,150
Come on,

573
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,360
it’s just sugar-free fizzy drink.

574
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,640
Come on,

575
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,640
try it. It tastes quite good.

576
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,580
I-I’m good, Captain.

577
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,670
Hey, just white peach flavor.

578
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,080
I-It has nothing to do with Dr. Mi.

579
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,460
OK.

580
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,000
Go do your stuff.

581
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,480
See you, Captain.

582
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,140
Bye-bye.

583
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,160
You just finish the exercise
and now you’re jogging?

584
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,760
You seem spirited.

585
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,720
I ate too much for dinner.

586
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,440
You always eat a lot.

587
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,720
What happened to you?

588
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,120
Be honest with me,

589
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,040
do you think I’m fat?

590
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,720
No.

591
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,320
A round face means good fortune.

592
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,760
Is my face round?

593
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,800
I think my chin is pointed.

594
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,080
Yeah, pointed, pointed.

595
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,120
Did Xing Sir call you

596
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,440
a fat girl?

597
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,640
No.

598
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,960
He thinks I’m too lean.

599
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,960
He wishes that

600
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,360
I eat more.

601
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,320
What are you worried about?

602
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,680
I’m not.

603
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,960
I have high standard

604
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,840
for myself.

605
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,120
OK, OK.

606
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,830
Great.

607
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,400
I’ll speed up.

608
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,190
Come in.

609
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,540
Come here.

610
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,040
I’ll introduce.

611
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,880
He’s Zhuang Zhiwen, the captain

612
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,240
of Black Panther Assault Team.

613
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,200
This is the captain

614
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,440
of Tiger Assault Team,

615
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,240
Xing Kelei.

616
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,280
Hi, Captain Xing.

617
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,080
Hello, Captain Zhuang.

618
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,120
Kelei will schedule the

619
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,920
training in the following days.

620
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,680
Black Panther and Tiger

621
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,600
are the best assault teams

622
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,680
across the province.

623
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,640
The experience exchange can

624
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,640
go a long way to each team.

625
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,440
Thank you, Captain Xing.

626
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,720
My pleasure, Captain Zhuang.

627
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,070
Hello?

628
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,320
OK, I’ll be right there.

629
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,760
You keep chatting.

630
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,680
I’ve heard that Tiger always

631
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,160
implements the most intensive
training projects.

632
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,240
I’m ready to be impressed

633
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,480
during the experience exchange.

634
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,480
The comrades speak highly of us.

635
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,440
We’re overrated.

636
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,240
I’m a straightforward guy.

637
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,240
I don’t casually
compliment others.

638
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,800
Please don’t mind.

639
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,280
I like to hear sincere comments.

640
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,680
If you see any problems,

641
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,560
please don’t hesitate to tell me.

642
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,550
This?

643
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,520
The biggest risk during a
pituitary microadenoma operation

644
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,000
is hemorrhage.

645
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,080
Busy?

646
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,640
What?

647
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,140
Yanshan,

648
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,200
I’ve CT scanned

649
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,200
and MRI scanned

650
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,200
the kid who has
extradural hematoma.

651
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,880
Her hematoma has diminished.

652
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,360
I’ll tell Zhang Yang

653
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,240
to discharge her.

654
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,320
OK, OK.

655
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,020
Mi Ka,

656
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,400
we’re discussing a case.

657
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,360
You can stay

658
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,200
if you’re interested.

659
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,810
OK.

660
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,560
We’re talking about

661
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,200
how tricky hemorrhage can be

662
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
during a

663
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,160
pituitary microadenoma operation.

664
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,000
The blood will squirt after a cut,

665
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,760
like cutting an artery.

666
00:26:58,970 --> 00:26:59,480
What do we do

667
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,440
if that happens?

668
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,880
We stop the bleeding

669
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,920
while scraping away the
microadenoma.

670
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,240
See.

671
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,120
Considering the location
and the size

672
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
of her microadenoma,

673
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,800
if it happens,

674
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,840
I’d use gun-shaped titanium forceps

675
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,520
to stop the bleeding.

676
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,720
What if there’s a leakage of

677
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,680
cerebrospinal fluid during the operation

678
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,120
and the opening is huge?

679
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,320
We can use sandwich patching method.

680
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,400
First, three layers of patches

681
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,840
and fill the opening

682
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,560
with white fascia.

683
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,840
Once there’s a leakage,

684
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,640
the patient’s nasal cavity

685
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,640
must be monitored after the operation.

686
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,760
See if there’s clean snot

687
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,760
or if she has a fever.

688
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,440
Watch the operation tomorrow.

689
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:34,910
OK.

690
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,200
Is the enhanced aneurysm clip
a new product?

691
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,720
I’m studying it for a friend.

692
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,040
I’m off.

693
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,650
Go.

694
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,320
Project 1,

695
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,960
one-hundred-meter
double assault rifle shooting,

696
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,440
kneel and shoot

697
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,400
the two eggs hung on the holder.

698
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Gunners are graded based on
hit rate and speed.

699
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,440
All right.

700
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,160
Ready.

701
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,280
One, two, three.

702
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,520
All four eggs got hit.

703
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,440
Tiger, 2 seconds.

704
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,800
Black Panther, 2.5 seconds.

705
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,530
Back to the line.

706
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,480
0.5 second faster.

707
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,560
How did you pull it off?

708
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,720
This one

709
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,520
is about how well

710
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,040
two gunners work together.

711
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,040
I have discussed it

712
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,000
with Luo Ting in the morning.

713
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,560
I aim at the bottom of the egg.

714
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,920
When Luo Ting fires,

715
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,160
I fire.

716
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,520
That’s how we’re 0.5 second faster

717
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,200
than them.

718
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,000
Yanshan,

719
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,920
although Mi Ka left

720
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,960
Neurosurgery for a while,

721
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,120
she’s still capable enough

722
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,640
to handle some patients on her own.

723
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,920
Director Shao, I’m just...

724
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,760
I know. I know.

725
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,760
I know you’re responsible,

726
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,480
but sometimes,

727
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,400
you can share some of your work

728
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,040
with your colleagues

729
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,360
so that you’re less pressured.

730
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,240
Keep what I said in mind.

731
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,440
Director Shao.

732
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,320
Yanshan,

733
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,960
I have something to tell you.

734
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,680
Are you free tonight?

735
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,560
Yeah.

736
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,720
I got two tickets

737
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,880
for Grass Music Festival.

738
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,200
Your favorite bands will perform.

739
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,480
Let’s enjoy it, shall we?

740
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,520
OK.

741
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,080
It’s a deal.

742
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,200
8:30 PM tonight.

743
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,120
I’ll wait you at the

744
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,040
Vienna Plaza.

745
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,640
Fine. I’m going back to work.

746
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,440
This is the windmill target

747
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,840
that Captain Shu built.

748
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,960
Two rows,

749
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
ten target points.

750
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,000
When it spins,

751
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,800
two points

752
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,200
may overlap.

753
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,200
But you don’t score if you
hit the red one in the front,

754
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,160
instead, you lose score.

755
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,960
You score only when you

756
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,600
hit the yellow one at the back.

757
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,680
That’s how we improve

758
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,400
our concentration

759
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,040
and stress tolerance.

760
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,800
You’ve worked hard on

761
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,000
how to torture your teammates.

762
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,200
Perspiration on the drill ground

763
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,680
is better than bleeding
on the battleground.

764
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,800
Absolutely agree.

765
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,600
Tiger has fancy training projects.

766
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,840
What do you think?

767
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,440
It seems OK.

768
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,800
It doesn’t seem

769
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,000
that hard.

770
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,280
You’ll find out.

771
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,880
How about a match?

772
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,360
OK.

773
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,480
Five bullets for each.

774
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,400
Yellow, you score.
Red, you lose score.

775
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,720
With same number of targets,

776
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,880
who spends less time wins.

777
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,120
Spin the targets.

778
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,840
5 out of 5, 5 seconds.

779
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,760
Spin the targets.

780
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,360
4 out of 5, 5 seconds.

781
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,360
Interesting.

782
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,440
But I wonder if

783
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,040
it’s helpful for real battles.

784
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,720
It is helpful.

785
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,760
It’s about time.

786
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,680
Let’s have lunch

787
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,360
and carry on in the afternoon.

788
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,320
OK.

789
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,380
Luo Ting.

790
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:21,990
Here.

791
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,800
Let’s go, Captain Zhuang.

792
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,920
Black Panther is really good.

793
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,960
So what?

794
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,400
We won.

795
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,440
You did nothing

796
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,800
but spoke a lot.

797
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,670
Hey,

798
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,280
Captain Xing.

799
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,680
Zhuang Zhiwen

800
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,480
questioned you.

801
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,320
I think he tries to challenge you.

802
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,320
It doesn’t matter.

803
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,400
Captain Hao told me
to be friendly.

804
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,840
Control yourselves, especially you.

805
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,680
C-Captain Xing, are you in a rush?

806
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,060
(Mi Ka: I’m home.)

807
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
Wait for me. I’m coming!

808
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,040
Finished.

809
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,840
Did you see that?

810
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,480
He was smirking when texting.

811
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,440
What was he smirking about?

812
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,800
I don’t know.

813
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,720
I don’t know, either.

814
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,400
Whose keys are these?

815
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,920
The keys to Captain Xing’s office.

816
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,560
I’ll give them back.

817
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,680
Eat.

818
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
After seeing how Captain Xing eats,

819
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,360
I feel full.

820
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,790
Done.

821
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,560
Look.

822
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,630
I’m done, too.

823
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,400
Exactly the same time.

824
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,400
It only took me 10 minutes.

825
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,960
Took me 10 minutes as well.

826
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,840
OK.

827
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,280
A draw

828
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,320
between the surgeon

829
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,280
and the special police officer.

830
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,360
You have a strong desire to win.

831
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,040
A strong-minded woman.

832
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,710
What are you mumbling about?

833
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,880
Nothing.

834
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
Why do you practice

835
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,630
to peel raw eggs?

836
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,320
Human’s meninges structure

837
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,880
are similar to egg membrane,

838
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,000
which is very delicate.

839
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,960
One mistake

840
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,320
may cause brain tissue damaged.

841
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,040
So, a surgeon must

842
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,960
be able to

843
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,840
peel an egg

844
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,150
with its membrane intact.

845
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,600
The smallest mistake

846
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,000
can cause one’s life to end.

847
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,760
You’re great.

848
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,040
Thank you.

849
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,560
Why are you practicing

850
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,160
beading the rice?

851
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,160
As a sniper,

852
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,400
concentration

853
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,200
matters the most.

854
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,440
Our targets are generally

855
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,880
far-away and small.

856
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,240
So, it isn’t easy

857
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,760
to focus on one point.

858
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,000
It’s one way

859
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,840
to practice.

860
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Awesome.

861
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,760
Oh,

862
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,960
Keyao said

863
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,200
you treasure

864
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,320
the LEGO figures

865
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,960
in your room a lot.

866
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,320
They got stories.

867
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,960
What stories?

868
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,440
Just those

869
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,400
puberty stuff.

870
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,840
Are you interested?

871
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,630
No.

872
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,120
Tell me about them.

873
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,880
I thought you weren’t interested.

874
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,560
Do you miss me?

875
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,400
You’re too blunt.

876
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,520
I’m embarrassed.

877
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,280
Why don’t you go in?

878
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,760
What’s happening?

879
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,200
Let me see.

880
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,520
What do you mean?

881
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,560
You miss me

882
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,040
or you don’t.

883
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,280
A little bit.

884
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,200
Just a little bit?

885
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,720
Yeah, a little bit.

886
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,160
What about you?

887
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,800
Do you miss me?

888
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,920
I do.

889
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,680
Tough guy gets soft.

890
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,440
Gross.

891
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,210
I miss you a lot.

892
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,960
Stop pushing, stop pushing.

893
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,880
I’m not pushing.

894
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,640
Captain Shu, stop.

895
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,800
Luo Ting, stop jostling.

896
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,720
I’m not.

897
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,840
C-Captain Xing.

898
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,440
FaceTime?

899
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,800
Hello, Dr. Mi.

900
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,000
Hello.

901
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,160
What are you doing?

902
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,920
I’m here to drop the keys.

903
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,760
No...

904
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,840
We’re all here to drop the keys.

905
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,160
You left your keys at the canteen.

906
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,680
Uh, you do your thing.

907
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,320
I won’t bother you.

908
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,600
No, no, Dr. Mi.

909
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,600
-We’re off work.
-Bye-bye.

910
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,950
She hung up.

911
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,440
Uh, Captain Xing,

912
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,240
we’re going to leave.

913
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,360
You get some rest. Go.

914
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,280
What did you hear?

915
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
Captain Xing, Captain Xing, come on.

916
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,440
What are you doing?

917
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,400
Please no, Captain Xing.

918
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,200
Captain Xing, no.

919
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:21,800
Captain Xing.

920
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,360
Captain Xing, no, no.

921
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,120
Captain Xing.

922
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,300
(Shao Yuhan)

923
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,960
The enhanced aneurysm clip

924
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,800
is quite good.

925
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,840
Its force is 40% stronger

926
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,280
than that of regular clip.

927
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,190
Thanks.

928
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,920
I’ll buy you a meal
some other day.

929
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,840
Because I have other things

930
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,840
to ask you.

931
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,320
I have many operations
to supervise lately.

932
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,400
What about coming to see me
in the hospital?

933
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,880
OK.

934
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,680
I’ll go to see you
at lunchtime tomorrow.

935
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,080
Come here.

936
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,160
Quickly.

937
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,640
Look how beautiful it is.

938
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,270
OK.

939
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,760
Go.

940
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,200
Come here, come here.

941
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,440
It looks pretty.

942
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,360
I’ll take a picture of you.

943
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,680
Not necessary.

944
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,920
It looks good, though.

945
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,920
Director Shao.

946
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,640
Come in.

947
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,760
What?

948
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,760
The data of the patient

949
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,640
on bed 3 are stable now.

950
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,480
He’s taken the medicine and
fallen asleep.

951
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,240
I’ve input the data into the computer.

952
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,520
OK, you can be off work, then.

953
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:32,960
What else?

954
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,040
I got nothing better to do
after work.

955
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,080
Do you need

956
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,960
my help?

957
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,600
ICU.

958
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,160
The vital signs

959
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,360
of the patient

960
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,080
are stable.

961
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,880
Keep him under observation.

962
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,760
If there is no problem,

963
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,560
transfer him to a regular ward tomorrow.

964
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,220
OK.

965
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,280
Director Shao,

966
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
have you had dinner?

967
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,300
No.

968
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,240
How about we...

969
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,760
Have dinner together?

970
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,880
OK. Eat what?

971
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,840
I’ll eat whatever you eat.

972
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,270
Let’s go.

973
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,280
OK. I’ll see you at the cafe.

974
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:04,960
Keyao.

975
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,520
Sorry, I’m late.

976
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,360
I just finished the operation.

977
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,920
It’s OK. I have just arrived.

978
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,520
I ordered a cup of americano for you.

979
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,400
I see that. Thanks.

980
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,840
Let’s talk about business.

981
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,960
Just like what I told

982
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,840
you in WeChat,

983
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,760
as a doctor, I can say that

984
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,560
the enhanced aneurysm clip

985
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,440
is great.

986
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,200
It’s well designed

987
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,200
and features strong force.

988
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,680
But from commercial perspective,

989
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,470
I don’t know.

990
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,640
So, I can’t give opinions.

991
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,840
You need to make a decision on you own.

992
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,280
I’ve decided to be the agent.

993
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,960
I’ve sent someone to deal with it.

994
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,040
Since you’ve made up your mind,

995
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,040
does my opinion matter anymore?

996
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,920
Oh, I thought you came to see me

997
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,800
about some other stuff.

998
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,960
Take a look at this.

999
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,200
You know

1000
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,360
Spider College, right?

1001
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,240
I do.

1002
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,480
A neutral academic platform.

1003
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,480
On the one hand,

1004
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,360
they promote medical studies

1005
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,800
and practical application of skills;

1006
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,840
on the other hand,

1007
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,280
they sell the equipment and machines

1008
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
that they produce.

1009
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,560
They intend to establish a branch

1010
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,400
in China and are looking for

1011
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,720
suitable cooperative enterprises.

1012
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,960
You want to cooperate with them?

1013
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,760
I’d like to hear your thoughts.

1014
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,680
My thoughts?

1015
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,240
Well, Spider College

1016
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,480
has branches all over

1017
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,560
the world,

1018
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,920
especially in those
regions and countries

1019
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,560
with highly advanced medical levels.

1020
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,880
My opinion is,

1021
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,440
it’ll be great if

1022
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,880
you can cooperate with them.

1023
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,520
It helps you develop your business.

1024
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,880
You and I have the same idea.

1025
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,480
They plan to work with

1026
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,600
the top experts

1027
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,720
and medical organizations in China

1028
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,720
to help them deliver

1029
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,760
the world first-class training.

1030
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,360
If

1031
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,000
Renxin is willing to work with them,

1032
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,320
I believe the hospital will make

1033
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,520
further improvements both

1034
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,200
academically and clinically.

1035
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,600
We surely would like to work with them.

1036
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,680
But you should know that

1037
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,920
to work with them, we

1038
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,080
have to spend a lot of money

1039
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,040
to purchase their

1040
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,000
equipment and machines.

1041
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,160
Their equipment is

1042
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,480
worth buying anyway.

1043
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,440
Since it’s a cooperative relationship,

1044
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,320
mutual-benefit is what

1045
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,320
both parties are after.

1046
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,040
You’re quite persuasive.

1047
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,320
But you know,

1048
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,520
the president manages budget,

1049
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,480
not me.

1050
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,920
Don’t worry.

1051
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,240
I’ll do whatever I can to help you.

1052
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,560
Thank you.
