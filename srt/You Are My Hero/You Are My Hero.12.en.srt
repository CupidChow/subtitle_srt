20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,840
How can you drive that way?

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,840
It’s unsafe.

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,080
-Do you know…
-I will use the parking space.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,840
Just go away.

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,430
What?

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
How could you speak that way?

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,680
You almost hit my car.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,520
The space…

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,800
I saw the space first.

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,520
How could you be like that?

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,360
You saw it first?

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,320
Call it. Will it answer you?

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,360
Don’t touch me.

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,360
What’re you doing?

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,480
What?

35
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,360
Don’t hit him.

36
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,440
Can you be reasonable?

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,200
Go to hell!

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,160
Can you be reasonable?

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,440
What? Stop hitting!

40
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,760
Stop!

41
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,240
Stop!

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,640
Hello, 110.

43
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,680
Stop!

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,840
Stop!

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,720
Stop hitting! Dear!

46
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,280
110. Someone is hitting my husband.

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,360
Please come quickly.

48
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,240
Stop!

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,920
Don’t hit him.

50
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,560
Go on. Hit him.

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,480
-Stop!
-Go on.

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,090
Stop!

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,760
What do you want?

54
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,040
Stop!

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,360
Someone is hitting my husband.

56
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,680
Please come quickly.

57
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,320
Stop!

58
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,120
Mind your own business.

59
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,800
Don’t move.

60
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,240
She’s cool!

61
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,680
It’s a restricted knife.

62
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,880
Please call the police.

63
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,920
I already called the police.

64
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
Thank you.

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,880
They don’t need us now.

66
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,160
Dear!

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Get up!

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,040
Dear!

69
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,320
Come on.

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,240
Are you alright?

71
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,840
Baby!

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,560
Dad.

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,480
Don’t cry. I’m here.

74
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,130
What’s going on?

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,320
Hi, I called the police.

76
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,360
They hit my husband.

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,040
The lady

78
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,080
-helped us just now.
-Dad.

79
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,160
Dear.

80
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,360
Are you alright?

81
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,080
Dear.

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,920
Give me your hand.

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,560
Dad.

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,640
Dear. It’s OK, baby.

85
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,720
-Hello. Miss.
-Hello.

86
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,380
The thing is,

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,900
the two people

88
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,120
keep restricted knives

89
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,360
and I subdued them.

90
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,760
Thank you for helping.

91
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,760
But we still need you

92
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
to go to the police station with us

93
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,760
to take a statement.

94
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,320
No problem.

95
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,280
This way, please.

96
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,040
You two,

97
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,160
come with me, too.

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,160
OK. Thank you.

99
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,680
-Be careful.
-Dad.

100
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,320
Dad.

101
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,080
It’s OK. I’m here.

102
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,720
Mum.

103
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,200
The girl

104
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,640
looks gentle and quiet.

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
But she’s agile.

106
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,680
She must be a peer

107
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,200
with very professional skills.

108
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,660
(I was expecting to search data
for the paper.)

109
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,860
(But the computer is down.)

110
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,940
One. Two. Three. Four.

111
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,940
(I was expecting to search data
for the paper.)

112
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,360
(But the computer is down.)
One. Two. Three.

113
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,210
One. Two. Three.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,680
Kelei.

115
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,760
Captain Hao.

116
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,840
OK. Come with me.

117
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,200
I’d talk to you. Come on.

118
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,560
The running target

119
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,760
you designed

120
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,360
is good for the training.

121
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,480
The branch came for exchange

122
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,720
and also tried that

123
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,760
after they went back.

124
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,480
After hearing that, their captain

125
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
asked if

126
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,630
we still have

127
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,400
similar special equipment

128
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
to share with them.

129
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:55,960
They can’t

130
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,760
just ask for me about that.

131
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
They are my secret weapons.

132
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,800
Secret weapons?

133
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,760
The improvement of

134
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,840
combat capability

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
is a good thing

136
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,320
for the whole police force.

137
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,120
You can’t hide them privately.

138
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,480
I was just kidding.

139
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,880
Please don’t take it seriously.

140
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,280
Here is the way.

141
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,880
Make a document about

142
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,280
the training equipment we developed

143
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,840
and the training ways.

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,080
We will arrange a lesson

145
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,280
for you to share it.

146
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,280
Got it.

147
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,480
Who is it?

148
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,840
Coming.

149
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,080
Mi Ka.

150
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,920
What brings you here?

151
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,020
Keyao.

152
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,880
I bought too many cherries.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,280
So I got some for you.

154
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,120
Thank you.

155
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,720
Kelei is in special training.

156
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,200
I don’t think he’ll be back
in over ten days.

157
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,960
I know. He told me that.

158
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,400
You still want to see if he is in,

159
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,120
right?

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,530
No.

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,960
I’m just taking you the cherries.

162
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,320
Thank you.

163
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Then I’m leaving.

164
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,320
Mi Ka.

165
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,640
I want to talk to you.

166
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,960
Let’s go to your place.

167
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,960
Come in.

168
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
He didn’t allow me

169
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,600
to get in before.

170
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,520
Come in.

171
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,880
How is it?

172
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,200
Do you think

173
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,240
Xing Kelei is childish?

174
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,720
He even plays toys as an adult.

175
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,080
Somewhat.

176
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,240
All these

177
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,720
are his soldiers.

178
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,440
He always leads his soldiers

179
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,280
to simulate here

180
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
the scene of robbery

181
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,160
and sand-table exercise.

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,880
It can be played in that way?

183
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,160
There are many ways.

184
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,920
Is your computer down?

185
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,280
You can use this one.

186
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,000
The password is

187
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,280
ielekgnix.

188
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,040
How do you know my computer is down?

189
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Kelei told me that.

190
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,890
He said you need

191
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,200
to search data for your paper.

192
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,920
Then…

193
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,640
How did he know that?

194
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,560
About that,

195
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
you’d better ask him.

196
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,320
He’s straight.

197
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,840
But he can also be

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,160
extremely meticulous,

199
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,600
especially for people

200
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,360
or things he cares about.

201
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,520
Well. Go ahead.

202
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,360
I’d leave now.

203
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,790
Thank you, Keyao.

204
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,000
Do not touch

205
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,280
his soldiers.

206
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,080
He will ask for compensation
if you break any of them.

207
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,520
Those are like his lifeblood.

208
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,880
OK.

209
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,160
My mistake.

210
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,080
I didn’t mean to hit it.

211
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,760
OK. Help me with that.

212
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,560
And remember to put him on a drip.

213
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,440
Pay attention to her body temperature.

214
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,210
OK.

215
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,680
Come on. Team One. Ready.

216
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,560
Go!

217
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,420
(To Xing Kelei
Are you sleeping?)

218
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,080
Let’s suppose the victim is here.

219
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,560
We observe him from here

220
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,800
and go down from here.

221
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,400
Then these two can rappel.

222
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,480
He can be seen

223
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
from both points here.

224
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,040
Why are you

225
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,960
eating the hot pot again?

226
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,830
Why not eat

227
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,120
celebrity food in the canteen?

228
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,760
You are not here.

229
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,960
It’s none of your business.

230
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,320
It’s you.

231
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,960
Are you used to my computer?

232
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,280
Mi Ka.

233
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,880
Mi Ka.

234
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,760
What’s wrong?

235
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,320
Seems your spirit has freed.

236
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,160
Xiaoman.

237
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,840
Do you know anything about Lego?

238
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,240
How to play it?

239
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,880
It’s so hard for me.

240
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,240
Dr. Mi. See you tomorrow.

241
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,640
See you.

242
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,160
Mi Ka.

243
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,160
Director Shao.

244
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,920
Get on.

245
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,800
What’s wrong?

246
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,160
What’s the matter?

247
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,240
Tell me.

248
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,640
Maybe I can help.

249
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,320
No. I’m just a bit tired.

250
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,680
Tired?

251
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,480
Working in emergency makes you tired?

252
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,280
Right?

253
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,440
No.

254
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,600
The weather is bad recently.

255
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,160
It’s always cloudy.

256
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,120
I’ve been on multiple shifts.

257
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,840
It’s hard for me to see the sun.

258
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,160
And my computer is down.

259
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,680
A lot of important information is lost.

260
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,440
I only finished half of the paper,

261
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,680
but it gets stuck.

262
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,080
What’s your paper about?

263
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,960
It’s about the study on distribution

264
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,080
of CSF pathogenic bacteria and treatment

265
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,320
effect of severe intracranial infection

266
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,160
after cranial operation.

267
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,480
I can’t help in the weather.

268
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,840
But about the paper,

269
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,080
I can give you some

270
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,440
effective advice.

271
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,360
Thank you, Director Shao.

272
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,120
Here we are.

273
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,960
Thank you, Director Shao.

274
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,440
Be careful.

275
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,960
Thank you.

276
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,760
My pleasure.

277
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,420
Bye-bye.

278
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,000
Bye-bye.

279
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
The website I just sent

280
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,040
to you

281
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,520
has many data

282
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,840
and papers.

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,920
You can have a try

284
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
if you need.

285
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,080
OK?

286
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,800
♪I have a Living Buddha♪

287
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,720
Oh.

288
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,840
During the day off

289
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,110
after your training,

290
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,200
let’s go to the suburbs.

291
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,840
Prepare some beer and barbecue.

292
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,520
We can have a picnic.

293
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,040
You’ve changed your hobby?

294
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,720
Don’t say that.

295
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,040
Xia, you know her, right?

296
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,760
Xia?

297
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,880
What’s up?

298
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,720
Last time you asked me

299
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,800
to pick Dr. Mi up.

300
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,520
Xia was with her.

301
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,760
We met.

302
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,640
And then?

303
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,800
Nothing special.

304
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,560
I like her. So I want to chase her.

305
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,760
Xia…

306
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,600
I know.

307
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,360
She’s chasing Wenbo.

308
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,240
But according to her words,

309
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,440
she chases Wenbo

310
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,800
for she never met such a man

311
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,760
who ignores her like Wenbo.

312
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,920
She is unwilling to submit.

313
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,160
It’s kind of betting.

314
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,280
How about you, Wenbo?

315
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,600
Do you like her?

316
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,320
If not,

317
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,960
I will chase her.

318
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,800
I have nothing to do with her.

319
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,310
(It’s OK. The fever is gone.)

320
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,350
(That’s fine.)

321
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,800
(Go to the school)

322
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,350
(and pick up Niannian.)

323
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,560
(Why?)

324
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,640
(It’s her birthday today.)

325
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,440
(So what?)

326
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,360
(It’s none of my business.)

327
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,840
(Do you forget it)

328
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,680
(or you never remember it?)

329
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,160
What they said in the play

330
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,680
does make some sense.

331
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
(Pay more attention to your girlfriend.)

332
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,080
(You know what?)

333
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,320
(It’s me who helped you)

334
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:43,950
(during the new year holiday.)

335
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,320
Here. Eat more.

336
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,640
It’s so delicious.

337
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,480
You are here alone

338
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,280
and don’t know

339
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,600
how to take care of yourself.

340
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,480
The dishes I made are delicious, right?

341
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,200
Yes.

342
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,890
Here you are.

343
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,880
Well.

344
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,520
You finished?

345
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,320
Yes.

346
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,560
I have to go back to the base.

347
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,480
Did you buy the cinema tickets

348
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,400
I asked you to buy?

349
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,320
Yes.

350
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Why do you suddenly
want to watch a film?

351
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,920
Mum.

352
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,120
It’s boring for me

353
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
to stay at home alone.

354
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,920
You don’t accompany me often.

355
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,920
It’s weekend.

356
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,840
So I want you to watch a film with me.

357
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,080
Give me the ticket.

358
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,160
Why?

359
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,120
I will pick you up.

360
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,920
Right?

361
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,720
Don’t bother.

362
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,480
I need to

363
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,130
buy things

364
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,560
for my friends on Saturday.

365
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,880
You go there by yourself.

366
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,160
What if you get lost?

367
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,560
What are you talking about?

368
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,760
I didn’t get lost

369
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,640
when I came here.

370
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,440
It’s really a long way.

371
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,800
But you were lost last time

372
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,840
when you bought vegetables.

373
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,280
I just arrived here at that time.

374
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,400
I was unfamiliar with it.

375
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,680
Give me the ticket. Quickly.

376
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,560
Don’t get it lost.

377
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,360
OK. I see.

378
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Well, I’m leaving. Mum.

379
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,760
See you.

380
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,880
See you.

381
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,200
Xia.

382
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,400
She hasn’t arrived yet.

383
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,440
Hello, mum.

384
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,760
It will start soon.

385
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,720
Where are you now?

386
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,440
I get in first?

387
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,720
Do you know how to get in?

388
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,640
Well, please calm down.

389
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,640
I will get in first.

390
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,840
OK.

391
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,320
See you.

392
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,600
Excuse me. Thank you.

393
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Thank you.

394
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,440
Thank you.

395
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,600
Thank you.

396
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,280
Xia?

397
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,280
Shu Wenbo?

398
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,760
Why are you here?

399
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,200
I see.

400
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,840
Your mum arranged it for us.

401
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,960
My mum is officious.

402
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,920
Take it as

403
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
falling in with her wishes

404
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,080
and accompanying me to watch the film.

405
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,960
I’m not a spider woman.

406
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,840
I won’t do anything bad to you

407
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,960
in the cinema.

408
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,720
Which one would you like?

409
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,480
No, thanks.

410
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,800
-Thank you.
-Pick one.

411
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,240
No. Thank you.

412
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,200
Thank you.

413
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,400
What’s wrong with you today?

414
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,120
Why are you like a cold fish?

415
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,730
If my mum

416
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,080
bothers you again with such things,

417
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,480
just ignore her.

418
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,080
I don’t think she bothered me.

419
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,480
I feel it’s great.

420
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,400
Xia. I think…

421
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,760
I know what you want to say.

422
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,800
You will surely say,

423
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,000
Xia,

424
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,480
I don’t think we are well-matched.

425
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,200
I don’t want to listen.

426
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,160
Whether we’re matched or not,

427
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,800
it’s up to me.

428
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,880
No. I…

429
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,400
Think it over.

430
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,680
It starts.

431
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,360
Take it.

432
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,440
Why me?

433
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,560
You take it, and then

434
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
it’ll be nice for me to eat.

435
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,120
Just put it here.

436
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,760
Put it here and you can have it.

437
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:25,500
(Meng Dongxing VS Luwei Weiwei)

438
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,040
Take one.

439
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,520
Eat it.

440
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,640
No. Thanks.

441
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,040
I’d say it frankly.

442
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,760
My mum misunderstood

443
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,720
my intention.

444
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,360
It makes you misunderstand.

445
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,520
I’m sorry for that.

446
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,520
What are you saying?

447
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,080
Xia.

448
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,920
I know city girls like you

449
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,560
always like new things

450
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,360
and seek for exciting things.

451
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,000
That’s why you pursue me.

452
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,960
You are actually very clear

453
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,720
men with my conditions

454
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,480
are not your liking.

455
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,920
You haven’t met

456
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,120
the man you can’t reach.

457
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,360
So you are persistent.

458
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,760
Actually, I don’t fit you

459
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,680
-very well.
-Lower…

460
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,000
What’s wrong with you?

461
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,160
That’s what you think about me?

462
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,040
I’m a slattern

463
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,710
in love

464
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,240
in your eyes?

465
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,440
No, Xia.

466
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,960
-I want to say I…
-Say no more.

467
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,960
I see.

468
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,960
Yes.

469
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,560
I am that kind of person.

470
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,720
I won’t keep after you anymore.

471
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,680
Bye-bye.

472
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,280
Xia.

473
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,200
A letter of thanks from the other force.

474
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,920
Take a look.

475
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,320
We write this letter

476
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,960
to express our sincere gratitude.

477
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,600
Since we’ve got a letter of thanks,

478
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,240
it means

479
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,360
I finished the task well.

480
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,280
It’s fine.

481
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,840
Can I ask for

482
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,400
a paid leave?

483
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,360
Shu Wenbo has a holiday now.

484
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,640
You still want to leave?

485
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:00,920
It’s because Shu Wenbo

486
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,520
didn’t go home during the new year.

487
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
His mum seldom came here.

488
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,920
So he needs to accompany her.

489
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,040
Exactly.

490
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,600
You said you’d substitute, right?

491
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,160
I don’t mean

492
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,280
a real vacation.

493
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:11,910
I mean

494
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,480
we don’t have tasks

495
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,200
these nights.

496
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,440
Can I go out for dinner to satisfy

497
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,920
an appetite for good food?

498
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
It’s OK for dinner

499
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,000
if you are not on duty.

500
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
Come back after that.

501
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,640
OK.

502
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,760
By the way,

503
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
some newbies

504
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:26,840
will come for trial

505
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,200
tomorrow.

506
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,800
We want to keep several.

507
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,120
Go pick the better ones

508
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,000
and leave them.

509
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,160
OK. No problem.

510
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
Mr. Lu. You haven’t come for long.

511
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,520
So I’m here today.

512
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,400
So,

513
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,160
this evening…?

514
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,040
Excuse me, Miss.

515
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,560
Let’s cancel it.

516
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,920
Xia.

517
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,680
Xia.

518
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,200
What’s wrong?

519
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,680
What’s wrong?

520
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,360
Can you hear me?

521
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,840
What’s wrong?

522
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,600
Crossed in love.

523
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,040
That’s

524
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,560
what’s going on.

525
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,480
It’s my fault.

526
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,240
We played basketball last time.

527
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,520
I misunderstood Shu Wenbo.

528
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,640
I said the words to him.

529
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,120
Forget it.

530
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,000
It’s a sore point for him,

531
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,320
like a mine.

532
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,000
If it weren’t for you,

533
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,240
there would be some other fuse

534
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,760
igniting it.

535
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,080
What will you do then?

536
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,360
What can I do?

537
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,000
It almost kills me.

538
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,680
Should I

539
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,680
go for him?

540
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,000
It’s impossible.

541
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,700
I didn’t expect

542
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,200
you are so frank and generous.

543
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,920
It’s different from what I expected.

544
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,600
What do you think of me?

545
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,040
We are not that familiar.

546
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,280
I’d like to invite you to dinner

547
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,680
and be familiar with you quickly.

548
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,440
OK.

549
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,680
I don’t want to

550
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,560
have dinner alone.

551
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,520
Stand at ease.

552
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,240
Attention.

553
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,840
Salute.

554
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,440
After salute.

555
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,840
Xiaochao was transferred
to a civil position.

556
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,000
So

557
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,600
we will select some

558
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,560
new members.

559
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,560
Let me introduce you

560
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,240
the new ones for the trial.

561
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,800
Cui Zhihao.

562
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,520
Yes!

563
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,440
Xu Ning

564
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,080
Yes!

565
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,520
Zhuo Wenjing.

566
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,160
Yes!

567
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:09,960
Zhuo Wenjing

568
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,760
is the only female special police

569
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,400
among the newbies this time.

570
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,440
She’s excellent.

571
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,960
Wenjing.

572
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,440
Introduce yourself.

573
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,080
Hello, everyone.

574
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,320
I’m Zhuo Wenjing.

575
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,440
Graduated from Beijing Sport University.

576
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,240
I was a shooter before.

577
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,440
I was specially recruited
to the police force.

578
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,320
For rifle,

579
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,800
my score for basic shooting is,

580
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,120
rifle, prone position, 200m,

581
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,360
100 shots, 1,000 rings.

582
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,040
Rifle, standing position…

583
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,670
Captain Xing.

584
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,280
200m.

585
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,140
-I remember you were
-50 shots.

586
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,440
-the shooting champion.
-500 rings.

587
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,600
She will catch up with you.

588
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,040
It’s said our team

589
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,300
-are full of undiscovered talents.
-You forgot Captain Shu.

590
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,190
Hope we can have an opportunity

591
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,500
-Wenbo.
-to learn from each other.

592
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,680
We have an opponent in the trial.

593
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,640
Words are nothing but wind.

594
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,560
We will see

595
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,000
after competing.

596
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,600
No problem.

597
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,000
Captain Shu performs better

598
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,240
than he used to do.

599
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,320
There won’t be a problem.

600
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,680
So amazing.

601
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,360
Halt!

602
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,320
Turn left.

603
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,760
I’m announcing the result of the match.

604
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,520
First,

605
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,800
Zhuo Wenjing.

606
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,920
Second,

607
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,320
Shu Wenbo.

608
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,000
Third, Xu Ning.

609
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,840
Fourth, Song Huaxia.

610
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,040
Fifth, Cui Zhihao.

611
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,960
Sixth, Li Yongning.

612
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,280
Uh…

613
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,960
How is it possible?

614
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,440
Zhuo Wenjing and Shu Wenbo

615
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,440
finished the match accurately
at the same time.

616
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,400
But Zhuo Wenjing still accurately hit

617
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,920
on the target at last

618
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,720
when the third target fell off.

619
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,560
So the winner of today’s match

620
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,720
is Zhuo Wenjing.

621
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,440
Amazing!

622
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,400
You are in good state today.

623
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,960
Anyway, Zhuo Wenjing

624
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,360
is really amazing.

625
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,280
Yes.

626
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,480
She still could accurately hit

627
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,840
on the target at last

628
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,960
when the third target fell off.

629
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,120
It’s really cool.

630
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,040
If it were me,

631
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,400
maybe I couldn’t

632
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,360
do a better job.

633
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,840
She is just a lady.

634
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,480
But she defeated me.

635
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,240
Captain, I’m sorry.

636
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,400
I lost face of the old members.

637
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,120
You know,

638
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,720
she must have made greater efforts

639
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,720
for such achievements.

640
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,720
Losing out to people like her

641
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,680
doesn’t mean losing face.

642
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,100
(Arms Room)

643
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,200
Captain Xing.

644
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,040
Captain Xing.

645
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,440
Captain Xing.

646
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,520
Congratulations.

647
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,560
Thank you.

648
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,680
Wenbo is one of the best

649
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,920
in our team.

650
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,760
But you defeated him as a newbie.

651
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,160
You are really awesome.

652
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,480
Winning him is not that great.

653
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,270
The one who can win you

654
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,480
is the real best.

655
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,240
We are not athletes.

656
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,360
We do team work.

657
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,200
Anyhow, if you want to compete,
you can tell me at any time.

658
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Except for today.

659
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,440
Welcome to Tiger.

660
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,360
These are typical cases.

661
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,720
They’re not universal.

662
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,440
But be sure you will

663
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,320
read them carefully.

664
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,720
They will be helpful in operation.

665
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,630
OK?

666
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,560
-OK.
-You can take them.

667
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
-Thank you, Dr. Shao.
-It’s OK.

668
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,000
Director Shao.

669
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,040
Thank you.

670
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,360
The website is really useful.

671
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,080
Of course.

672
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,040
Or I wouldn’t share it with you.

673
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
How is your paper going?

674
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,120
I haven’t been in Neurosurgery recently.

675
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,320
So there are not enough cases.

676
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,640
I’m in Neurosurgery.

677
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,360
I just have

678
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,720
some related cases.

679
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,680
You can use the data

680
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,560
for reference.

681
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,570
If it’s OK,

682
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,640
you can come with me and take them.

683
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,700
(Xing Kelei)

684
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,040
It’s OK.

685
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,120
Answer the phone.

686
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,960
Send your paper to me later.

687
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,160
I will check if the cases

688
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,080
fit your paper.

689
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,000
-Keep in touch.
-OK.

690
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,720
Thank you, Director Shao.

691
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,760
I’m leaving then.

692
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,440
Go ahead.

693
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,600
Hello, Xing Sir.

694
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,200
Dr. Mi.

695
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,520
Are you on duty today?

696
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,480
No.

697
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,800
Let me treat you to dinner.

698
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,240
You are in special training, aren’t you?

699
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,120
It’s OK to have dinner outside.

700
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,480
I can go back to the base after dinner.

701
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,840

near the base.

703
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,320
It’s convenient for you.

704
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,040
Thank you.

705
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,040
Tell me what you want.

706
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,960
Then I will make a reservation.

707
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,400
OK. Deal.

708
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,720

I’m sorry.

730
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,360
The traffic is too heavy.

731
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,630
I got off on the way

732
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,860
and ran here for 2 km.

733
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,560
Do we still have time?

734
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
When will you go back?

735
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Take it easy. We have time.

736
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,670
I intended to eat with you alone.

737
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,840
But…

738
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,880
Let’s get in first.

739
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,200
It’s really cool.

740
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,520
You gave ground to me.

741
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
Lucky for me.

742
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
No, it’s not like that.

743
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,440
This is Mi Ka, Dr. Mi.

744
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,600
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

745
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,120
Sit down.

746
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,760
Finally you are here.

747
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,690
-We are starved.
-OK.

748
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,680
Everyone is here. Let’s start.

749
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,360
OK. Let’s eat.

750
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,280
Eat.

751
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,320
Pass on the water.

752
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,360
I intended

753
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,000
to eat with you alone.

754
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,710
As it happens,

755
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,160
three new colleagues
are dining together.

756
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,400
-I’m sorry.
-It’s OK.

757
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,120
It’s alright.

758
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,640
Zhuo Wenjing.

759
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,080
You defeated Captain Shu

760
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,200
once you came.

761
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,840
Will you

762
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,400
drink with Captain Shu?

763
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,320
I will propose.

764
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,600
For her skills,

765
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,720
she’s the top

766
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,320
in our team,

767
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,360
let alone policewoman.

768
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,240
Come on. A toast to you.

769
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,360
Thank you.

770
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,040
You two newbies

771
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,240
should drink together, right?

772
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:49,900
-Yes.
-Cheers.

773
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,080
-Drink together.
-What are you doing?

774
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,700
Cheers.

775
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,120
What are you laughing about?

776
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,150
No.

777
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,000
Nothing. It’s just…

778
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,800
They drink water like it’s alcohol.

779
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,960
They still need to work at night.

780
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,800
So they can’t

781
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,800
drink alcohol.

782
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,280
Every time I want to eat with you alone,

783
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
things became like this.

784
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,800
I’m sorry.

785
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,520
It’s OK.

786
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,120
Well,

787
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,200
for the meal you should treat me,

788
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,280
I’ve forgotten it.

789
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,040
Just focus on your own business.

790
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,640
Captain Xing.

791
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,080
On behalf of the newbies,

792
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,080
it’s a toast to you.

793
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,720
I’ve heard a lot about you.

794
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,360
Champion of three contests

795
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,640
of public security system.

796
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,320
One first-class merit.

797
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,640
Three second-class merits.

798
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,360
The Tiger Assault Team led by you

799
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,640
is the example

800
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,560
of special police nationwide,

801
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,360
no matter in practice

802
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,840
or in training.

803
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,720
It’s a great honor for us

804
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,160
to work with you.

805
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,480
I hope you will help me in work.

806
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,160
OK.

807
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,920
I will propose a toast, too.

808
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,080
-Together.
-Cheers.

809
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,920
OK.

810
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,080
Tiger Assault Team.

811
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,480
The brave fears nothing.

812
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,640
Cheers.

813
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,480
Dr. Mi.

814
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,320
I’m Zhuo Wenjing.

815
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,400
I’d toast you.

816
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,600
You are

817
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,600
Captain Xing’s girlfriend, right?

818
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,040
No.

819
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,280
He used to be my instructor.

820
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,040
OK.

821
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,440
Uh…

822
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,760
Dr. Mi is our

823
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,000
good friends.

824
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:44,960
We are quite familiar.

825
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,000
In the case

826
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,960
the fan kidnapped the star,

827
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,840
Dr. Mi helped us

828
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
a lot.

829
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,200
Right?

830
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,320
Yes.

831
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,040
Come on. Let’s eat.

832
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,800
Eat.

833
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,520
The crabs are great.

834
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
Come on. Each of you, take one.

835
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,720
It’s male.

836
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,600
I mean it.

837
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,800
All are male.

838
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,800
Every time Captain Xing treats us,

839
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,320
we can have very delicious food.

840
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,760
We’d better have the crabs
when it’s hot.

841
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,920
Dr. Mi.

842
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,320
Why don’t you eat?

843
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,960
I’m not used to

844
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,520
eating crabs like this.

845
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,800
Let me do it.

846
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,120
To do what?

847
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,800
To shell the crab.

848
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,280
No, thanks. Just eat.

849
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,680
Cheers.

850
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,400
Peach flavor.

851
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,040
Rose flavor.

852
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,280
Matcha flavor.

853
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,880
Which one do you like on earth?

854
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,200
Bixin.

855
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,720
Your heart.

856
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,760
My heart.

857
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,160
Of the same mind.

858
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,320
Heart beats as one.

859
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,440
Damn Shu Wenbo.

860
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,280
Why

861
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,320
can’t you understand my mind?

862
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,380
(Xing Kelei)

863
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,140
(Lu Feng)

864
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,280
Do you have a target tonight?

865
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,920
What?

866
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,320
I don’t want one anymore.

867
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,920
What?

868
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
Change your hobby?

869
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,120
Shut up!

870
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,720
What are you talking?
Watch your mouth.

871
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,360
I only have one girl in my heart now.

872
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,720
Horrible.

873
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,920
Do you meet your true love?

874
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,040
Sir.

875
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,440
The lady near the counter

876
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,400
has drunk for three rounds.

877
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,920
She’s been crying while drinking.

878
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,360
They are worrying

879
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,880
so will you please go and take a look?

880
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,240
What can I do for you?

881
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,840
-Pour the wine.
-Sir.

882
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,640
That’s her.

883
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,480
Pour wine for me.

884
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,800
Go on with your work. I will handle it.

885
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,360
Give her

886
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,760
a glass of honey lemonade.

887
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,800
Warm.

888
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,280
Hey, you.

889
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,960
What’s wrong?

890
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,640
What’s the trouble?

891
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,800
Tell me about it.

892
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,600
There is no trouble.

893
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,200
Because of Shu Wenbo?

894
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,440
For him?

895
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,160
Do I need to?

896
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,040
Shu Wenbo,

897
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,400
dumb blockhead!

898
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,480
Miss!

899
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,080
Don’t be like that.

900
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,320
You are kind of famous.

901
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,360
We’ll be dead ducks if we’re shot

902
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,560
with videos uploaded to the website.

903
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,880
Dead duck?

904
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,240
Who is a dead duck?

905
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,200
Shu Wenbo, you scoundrel!

906
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,640
He’s the dead duck.

907
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,920
He’s the dead duck.

908
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,760
Here you are. Drink it.

909
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,160
You will feel better tomorrow.

910
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,640
I don’t drink honey water.

911
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,440
-I’m not a underage girl.
-No.

912
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,720
-I don’t drink it.
-It’s not honey water.

913
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,280
Whisky with honey.

914
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,040
Hot.

915
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,960
Nice.

916
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,800
What’s wrong?

917
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,680
It has no taste of spirit.

918
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,280
Even the alcohol is bullying me.

919
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,600
Shu Wenbo, you scoundrel!

920
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,680
He bullied me.

921
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,360
He bullied me.
