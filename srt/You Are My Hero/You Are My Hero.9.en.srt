20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,600
Xia,

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,200
come to see Wenbo again?

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,400
He hasn’t talked to me

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,640
for several days.

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,200
He didn’t text me back, either.

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,760
We’ve got many missions today.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,760
He’s about to go.

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:01,920
Really?

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,640
That explains.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,960
When Mi Ka moved out,

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,680
we had wanted to ask him for help.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,240
I asked him if he was able to help,

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,080
but he didn’t reply.

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,080
She and I were nearly worn out

34
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,360
when moving out.

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,360
Move?

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,800
Why did she move?

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,360
Mi Ka,

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,400
she’s a little fool.

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
She lent all her money to patients

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
for paying medical expenses.

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
Then she didn’t have enough money

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,040
to pay the rent.

43
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,360
Where’s she living now?

44
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,240
In the duty room of the hospital,

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,440
for the time being.

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,760
I wanted to lend her some money

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,840
for the rent,

48
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,720
but she refused.

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,920
She insisted that

50
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,280
she wouldn’t borrow any money,

51
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,640
unless she had to.

52
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,000
You’re her close friend, aren’t you?

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,760
She still doesn’t accept your help?

54
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,040
We’re close friends.

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,480
When we were in the middle school,

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,040
we were deskmates.

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,760
But I know her very well.

58
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,960
She doesn’t like

59
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,440
complaining.

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,960
She only tells her families good news

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,080
and never tells them bad news.

62
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,560
So,

63
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,960
I must find her
a cheap and convenient flat

64
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,080
as soon as I can.

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,360
I gotta go, Captain Xing.

66
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,240
Take a message to Shu Wenbo for me.

67
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,680
It was my fault last time.

68
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,920
And I won’t do that again.

69
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,240
What about getting a new boy?

70
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,400
I won’t!

71
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,920
He’s my cup of tea.

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,850
What...

73
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,680
So many bags...

74
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,600
Are you going to live here?

75
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,680
I haven’t found a place to live yet.

76
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,440
It’s been a week.

77
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,160
What have you got?

78
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,640
I’ve nearly searched

79
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,040
all communities in the city.

80
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,960
If I were fired,

81
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,680
I could even work
as a real estate agent.

82
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,080
Good idea.

83
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,000
But seriously,

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
you haven’t found
even a single suitable flat?

85
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,480
They’re either too expensive or too far.

86
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,800
I found one which seemed to be good.

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,520
But the decoration turned out

88
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,560
to be so poor.

89
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,560
If I decorate it again,

90
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,800
it’ll cost the rent of a month.

91
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,760
I won’t take it, then.

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,640
I’ve got one for you.

93
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,480
Your flat?

94
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,720
No, it belongs to a friend of mine.

95
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,680
He wants to lease it out.

96
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,120
Would you like to have a look?

97
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,840
How much is the rent?

98
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,830
I can’t pay a high one.

99
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,720
Don’t always mind the rent.

100
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,160
Having a look doesn’t cost any money.

101
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,280
Hurry up.

102
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,080
I’ll be waiting for you out there.

103
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,960
Let’s go after you get changed.

104
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,660
-Now?
-I’ll go get changed.

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,240
Be quick.

106
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,840
I’ll be waiting at the gate.

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,760
Be quick.

108
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,680
I think it’s near.

109
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,640
The surroundings look pleasant.

110
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,300
Yeah.

111
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,240
The location is good, too.

112
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,520
It’s also near our hospital.

113
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,360
Building No. 9, Section 3?

114
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,920
Building No. 9, Section 3.

115
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,520
Isn’t it your friend’s flat?

116
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,240
You haven’t been here before?

117
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,480
No. He just bought it.

118
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
Let me help you.

119
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,720
No, no, no.

120
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,560
There. Over there.

121
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,160
See? See?

122
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,360
Unit 2, Unit 2.

123
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,880
Your friend gave you the key

124
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,840
without any concern?

125
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,520
It’s easy

126
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,360
to check the flat at any time.

127
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,160
He entrusted me with the rent thing.

128
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,360
What do you think of it?

129
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,920
This is a small loft.

130
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,240
Two floors.

131
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,160
Look at the first floor.

132
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,680
The sitting room, kitchen and toilet.

133
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,280
Look at the kitchen.

134
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,280
I am eager to own it.

135
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,160
Look.

136
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,840
You can make breakfast

137
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,960
instead of ordering the take-out.

138
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,840
This flat looks better

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,840
than those I visited.

140
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,960
You bet!

141
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,360
It’s a bright flat,

142
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,800
with a big French window.

143
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,880
The traffic is convenient, isn’t it?

144
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,840
It’s in a good location.

145
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,360
Go east

146
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,040
and you’ll find the shopping mall.

147
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,680
It’s only three stops from our hospital.

148
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,040
You saw the greening.

149
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,240
Isn’t it nice?

150
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,760
The landlord said that

151
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,720
he wanted to let out

152
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,480
the bedroom on the second floor.

153
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,120
He doesn’t often live here.

154
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,160
You sort of rent the whole flat

155
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
at a price of renting a bedroom.

156
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,920
Isn’t it good? What a bargain!

157
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,160
It’s a good flat.

158
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,320
But the rent is 3,500.

159
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,560
That’s a bit expensive.

160
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,680
Expensive?

161
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,800
Don’t you know

162
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,280
how much we earn every month?

163
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,080
Fine.

164
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,120
I’ll ask him

165
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,760
if he can make it less.

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,600
Do it, please.

167
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,330
Okay.

168
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,360
This study isn’t for rent.

169
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,640
Don’t open it.

170
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,520
It’s for storing
the landlord’s favorite things.

171
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,000
You friend won’t come back,

172
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,640
will he?

173
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,560
No, no.

174
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,440
He...

175
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,440
He doesn’t want to move things out

176
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,560
and he stores them in the study,

177
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,000
using it as a storehouse.

178
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,840
Never mind.

179
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,720
Fine.

180
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,640
He wants to lease out

181
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,600
the bedroom on the second floor.

182
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,320
Let’s go upstairs and have a look.

183
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,980
Fine.

184
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,360
He texted back.

185
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,120
3,000 at least.

186
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,000
It’s the best he can offer.

187
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,600
That’s fine.

188
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,520
It’s just

189
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
within my budget.

190
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,560
Okay.

191
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,640
But,

192
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,570
he’s got a condition.

193
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,520
What’s it?

194
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,960
You rent

195
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,720
only one bedroom.

196
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,440
But you’ll clean

197
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,520
the entire flat.

198
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,480
Also, he won’t pay for the utilities.

199
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,280
You shall pay for them.

200
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,680
No problem.

201
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,800
I live alone.

202
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,400
I rent only one bedroom,

203
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,080
but I should

204
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,480
clean the flat.

205
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,280
There’s no problem.

206
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
Well,

207
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,680
-deal.
-Deal.

208
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,320
I’ve made the first business.

209
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,400
Good, isn’t it?

210
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,930
It is.

211
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,360
It’s a deal, then.

212
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,560
Pay the rent

213
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,840
from next month.

214
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,920
My friend said that

215
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,920
you could bring your luggage here

216
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,920
these days

217
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,840
and move in.

218
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
You can’t sleep well

219
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,800
in the small room of our hospital.

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,960
It’s so nice of him.

221
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,520
Please take my gratitude to him.

222
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,640
What does he do?

223
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,320
What does... does he do?

224
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,280
Sort of a civil servant.

225
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,240
I saw

226
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,080
much fitness equipment

227
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,240
in his room.

228
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,600
I thought he was

229
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,440
an athlete or a soldier.

230
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,720
A civil servant sits

231
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,600
all day long.

232
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,880
I told him that

233
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,640
it wasn’t okay

234
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
and he should exercise more.

235
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,840
Well,

236
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,680
he doesn’t want to go to the gym.

237
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,560
Then he bought the fitness equipment

238
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,880
in his room

239
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,400
and exercised at home.

240
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,320
Shall I meet him?

241
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,760
For the contract thing,

242
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,360
right?

243
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,880
Doesn’t he need

244
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,200
to confirm with me?

245
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,150
No.

246
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,320
He trusts me.

247
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,960
Besides,

248
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,960
you’re my classmate and colleague.

249
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,910
I can always find you.

250
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,240
So,

251
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,880
you don’t need to pay the deposit.

252
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,800
Every month,

253
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,920
transfer the rent to me.

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,280
And I’ll transfer it to him.

255
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,200
See?

256
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,120
I helped you a lot, didn’t I?

257
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,080
Yes.

258
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,240
Let me treat you to dinner.

259
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,680
Don’t bother.

260
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,880
You’re short of money.

261
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,800
If you want to thank me,

262
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,040
when I need to change shifts,

263
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,400
do me a favor, then.

264
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,280
No problem.

265
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,540
-Let’s go.
-Go.

266
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,600
Well, Captain Xing,

267
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,880
may I say something?

268
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,840
We’ve completed the mission.

269
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,160
Why don’t we go back?

270
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,400
I’ve been driving for three laps.

271
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,560
Shall we get out of the car

272
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,160
and do some running?

273
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,040
Stop talking, could you?

274
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,800
Thanks.

275
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Stop! Stop the car.

276
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,240
Dr. Mi.

277
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,320
Dr. Mi.

278
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,880
Why are you here?

279
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,160
I recognized you in the car.

280
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,280
Well,

281
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,240
I’m doing a mission nearby.

282
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,840
I hear that

283
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,120
you’re looking for a flat, right?

284
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,220
-Yes.
-I’m... I’m familiar with this area.

285
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,320
Shall I recommend you some?

286
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,110
Don’t bother.

287
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,360
I’ve found one.

288
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,110
It’s near here.

289
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
Near... near?

290
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,000
The rent must be high.

291
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,240
I met

292
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,360
a very good landlord.

293
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,520
I’m very lucky.

294
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,840
He spared me of the deposit.

295
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,240
The rent is low, too.

296
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,280
It’s so lucky of you.

297
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,840
You’ve met a nice guy.

298
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,360
May that guy be blessed
with life-long luck.

299
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,520
I’ll express my gratitude to him.

300
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,200
Which estate do you live in?

301
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,080
Shall we help you

302
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,900
to carry these things back?

303
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,000
No, thanks. It’s near.

304
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,320
Zijin Estate.

305
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,080
Zijin?

306
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,760
Isn’t it our...

307
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,160
What happened? Here’s dirt on your coat.

308
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,200
Where’s the car?

309
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,560
Why did you...

310
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,880
Why did you always hit him?

311
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,080
I didn’t.

312
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,000
I gotta go. I’ll leave you alone.

313
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,360
See you.

314
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,320
Bye-bye.

315
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,040
Come on, Captain Xing,

316
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,280
why did you hit me?

317
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,920
Must I have a reason for that?

318
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,200
No.

319
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,040
Stop nagging.

320
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,720
There you are.

321
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,280
You’re always punctual.

322
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,730
I’m not late, am I?

323
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,330
No.

324
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,960
A cup of whisky?

325
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,880
No.

326
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,720
I drove here.

327
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,000
A glass of water, please.

328
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,210
-Thank you.
-Here’s your water. Please enjoy it.

329
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,030
You’re welcome.

330
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,840
What a coincidence that day!

331
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,400
I never expected
to meet you at the party.

332
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,080
You nearly got into the wrong car.

333
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,960
It’s been years

334
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,680
and you still drive that car?

335
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,120
It’s simply a means of transportation.

336
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,040
Well...

337
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,480
It bothers to change another one.

338
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,440
I have to get used to it.

339
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,160
Never mind.

340
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,800
I had planned to meet

341
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,360
Ms. Wei and Yi Qian first.

342
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,320
I didn’t expect to see you first.

343
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,480
When did you come back?

344
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,120
About two months ago.

345
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,800
I’ve been back for two months.

346
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,760
Didn’t you say
you had something to tell me?

347
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,100
Yes.

348
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,720
Look at this.

349
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,640
What’s it? Let me have a look.

350
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,920
It’s the new product line

351
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,440
of our company.

352
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,480
To put it simply,

353
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,560
it’s a planning system
for neurosurgery operations.

354
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,240
It helps doctors

355
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,960
to choose the best tools

356
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,200
and the optimal approaches.

357
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,880
It also offers operation simulations.

358
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,840
I’ve heard of it before.

359
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,400
Such a system

360
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,440
has a good market potential.

361
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,000
But the competition is fierce, isn’t it?

362
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,960
Yes.

363
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,920
The planning system

364
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,800
we’ve made

365
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,840
has been authorized

366
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,920
by FDA.

367
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,560
It’ll be integrated with navigation.

368
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,880
Chinese market is

369
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,360
our most important market.

370
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,800
I come back this time,

371
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,120
to find some reliable

372
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,120
neurosurgery doctors

373
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,120
to use our products first.

374
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,680
You want me to endorse your product?

375
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,520
I simply want you

376
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,440
to know about our product.

377
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,200
Fine, know about it.

378
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,680
After that,

379
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,800
I’ll reply to you, all right?

380
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
But to be honest,

381
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,040
I can’t guarantee you

382
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,240
the result.

383
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,240
I know. Business is business.

384
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,240
I’ve got full confidence

385
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,000
in our product.

386
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,360
Don’t worry.

387
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,720
I won’t

388
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,200
embarrass you

389
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,280
because we’re old friends.

390
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,390
I simply

391
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,800
need you

392
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,080
to judge our product

393
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,440
as a professional

394
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,360
neurosurgery doctor.

395
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,040
Okay.

396
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,640
I’m relieved, then.

397
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,410
I’ll reply to you later.

398
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,840
Thank you.

399
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,060
You’re welcome.

In old days,

406
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,800
we often listened to this song

407
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,120
in the bar

408
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,680
near our school.

409
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,080
You know what?

410
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,480
What made you impressive was that

411
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,560
you could write essays in the bar.

412
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,520
It happened years ago.

413
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,840
I don’t really remember.

414
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,440
Didn’t you say

415
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,280
you had something to do?

416
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
If you did,

417
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,040
you could leave.

418
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
I must leave now.

419
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,600
I’ll reply to you after I read it.

420
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,400
Okay.

421
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,400
Bye-bye.

422
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:24,940
Bye-bye.

423
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,960
Don’t drink too much.

424
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,720
Another glass of wine.

425
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,400
Another glass of wine, please.

426
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,860
(Outpatient)

427
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Time for breakfast!

428
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,160
Enjoy it.

429
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,160
You freaked me out.

430
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,000
It’s for me?

431
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,960
Yanshan,

432
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,880
I’ve heard of it.

433
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,440
You’re Mr. Shao’s most capable assistant

434
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,480
in Neurosurgery Department.

435
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,520
Don’t exaggerate.

436
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,160
As long as you work hard,

437
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,520
Mr. Shao will see that.

438
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,320
You’re the best.

439
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,040
Drink this.

440
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,160
In case it’s too cold,

441
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,920
I’ve warmed it.

442
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,280
How does it taste?

443
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,880
Tastes great.

444
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,800
It’s my favorite drink.

445
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,640
I’ll buy it for you every day.

446
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,360
You want it more, don’t you?

447
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,320
No, no.

448
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,880
Don’t touch it!

449
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,520
Seriously? You hit me so hard.

450
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,360
I sent you a dozen messages yesterday

451
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,840
to invite you to dinner.

452
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,610
But you didn’t reply.

453
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,120
So, this is what you were working on?

454
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,200
Who did you make it for?

455
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,800
Me?

456
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
No.

457
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,790
Yanshan,

458
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,280
it didn’t always happen

459
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,280
when I had no morning shift.

460
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,440
I got up very early this morning

461
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,840
to make breakfast for you.

462
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,770
Look!

463
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,360
I’ve got big dark circles.

464
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,650
Then work hard

465
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,480
and go to bed early.

466
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,730
Leave, leave, leave.

467
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,540
Go, go.

468
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,400
Mi Ka!

469
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,600
You’re so early?

470
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,750
Morning.

471
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,670
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

472
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,400
You bought breakfast

473
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,480
for Yanshan again?

474
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,360
I bought breakfast for myself
and then for her.

475
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,280
Then?

476
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,640
Oh,

477
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,560
how’s your flat?

478
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,120
Good.

479
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,360
I just need to buy

480
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,880
some small things.

481
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,480
For example?

482
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,360
For example, a mat

483
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,240
and a hanging iron machine.

484
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,320
Sure.

485
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,560
What do you mean?

486
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,680
You’ll buy them for me?

487
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,360
I... I’ll buy breakfast.

488
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,720
Breakfast...

489
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,320
You’re fine, madam.

490
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,280
Stay for recuperation.

491
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,320
Don’t worry.

492
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,560
Zhang Yang,

493
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,360
patient on Bed No. 3 is still in danger.

494
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,200
She’s got a high intracranial pressure.

495
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,920
Arrange all the checks

496
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,000
in the way

497
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,720
I just instructed you.

498
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,000
Come to me in case of any problem.

499
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,240
Get to work.

500
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:16,990
Got it.

501
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,600
Xu Yanshan,

502
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,320
come to my office.

503
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,400
Jia Li told me that

504
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,760
you came to office this morning, right?

505
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,120
I found you were too busy

506
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,360
to have breakfast every morning.

507
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,760
I then made some biscuits for you.

508
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,680
Yesterday, how much time did you spend

509
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,680
writing medical records?

510
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,240
About an hour.

511
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,120
Have you spared time

512
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,640
for the check this month?

513
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,440
I read books whenever I’m free.

514
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,120
Free?

515
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,840
How much time did you spend

516
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,480
making the biscuits?

517
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,240
Jia Li!

518
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:05,960
Mr. Shao,

519
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,320
what do you want me for?

520
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,960
Here’s something for you.

521
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,240
Go share the biscuits

522
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,080
with others.

523
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,120
They look delicious.

524
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,760
Zhao and I haven’t had meals yet.

525
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,680
Thank you, Mr. Shao.

526
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,680
Invest your energy and time in

527
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,240
what they should be invested in.

528
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,640
I know.

529
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,080
Don’t always say it.

530
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,800
Do it, instead.

531
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,520
Otherwise, you’ll move no one

532
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,200
but yourself.

533
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,840
I’ll work hard, Mr. Shao.

534
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,800
Don’t you get to work?

535
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,680
Yanshan,

536
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,440
for either the organic light food,

537
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,720
millet gruel,

538
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,560
or the biscuits,

539
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
thank you.

540
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,800
Get to your work.

541
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,000
Why is here a mat?

542
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,360
A hanging steam iron?

543
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,000
Hello, Mi Ka?

544
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,080
What’s up?

545
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,480
Why is here a hanging steam iron?

546
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,320
Well,

547
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,720
the landlord left it

548
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,760
in his old flat.

549
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,440
He doesn’t need it.

550
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,000
You need one, don’t you?

551
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,960
Keep it, then.

552
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,960
What about the mat?

553
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,320
It was in the shoe cabinet.

554
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,080
You didn’t see it.

555
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
I took it out for you.

556
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,440
What a coincidence!

557
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,520
What’s the problem with that?

558
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,720
You know what?

559
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,200
You’re an odd girl.

560
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,480
When such good things happen,

561
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,400
you doubt a lot.

562
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,320
Besides,

563
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,480
you don’t live there for free.

564
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,880
You pay the rent

565
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,560
and do the cleaning, don’t you?

566
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,560
I just feel odd.

567
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,960
I get exactly what I want.

568
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,320
I’ve got a visitor.

569
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,400
I’ll hang up.

570
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,030
See you.

571
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,240
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

572
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,480
What a nice landlord!

573
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,320
Any problem with your neck?

574
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,290
No.

575
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,800
After some massage, it’ll be fine.

576
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,620
(Massager)

577
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,600
Massager?

578
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,060
(Electric Cooker)

579
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,080
Chan Tao,

580
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,160
did you tell the landlord that

581
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,680
my electric cooker was broken?

582
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,040
Answer me.

583
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,720
A new electric cooker

584
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,880
has been delivered to me today.

585
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,040
Is it from the landlord?

586
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,760
I told him about it.

587
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I think it’s from him.

588
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,240
What a nice man he is!

589
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,720
Please take my gratitude to him.

590
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,200
Or would you like to

591
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,960
give me his number?

592
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,520
I’ll... I’ll call him

593
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,520
to say thank you.

594
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,880
No, no, no.

595
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
I’ll thank him for you.

596
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,480
Well, remember to do so.

597
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:23,540
(Chen Tao: She told me that
she ran out of masks.)

598
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,720
It’s a deal, then.

599
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,600
Rent my flat to Mi Ka

600
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,840
and I’ll buy you meals for this week.

601
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,880
I can do that.

602
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,040
But since you want to help her,

603
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,200
why don’t you tell her directly?

604
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,920
None of your business.

605
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,800
Also,

606
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,640
tell me

607
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,040
if she needs anything.

608
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,680
One month!

609
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,760
I’ll buy you meals for one month.

610
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,080
No problem.

611
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,480
But let’s make a deal.

612
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,960
You must buy me meals

613
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,640
as soon as the flat is let out.

614
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,180
Fine.

615
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,040
Which one shall I choose?

616
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,040
I’ll take this one.

617
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,240
What are you doing?

618
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,000
Well,

619
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,920
I’ve got dry skin lately.

620
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,040
I’ll do some moisturizing.

621
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,760
Xia,

622
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,720
I think I met a freak.

623
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,080
It could be a coincidence

624
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,560
for once or twice.

625
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,080
But four or five times?

626
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,640
More than that.

627
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,000
That’s so weird.

628
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,600
Yes.

629
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Almost every time
when I needed something,

630
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,320
I got it the next day.

631
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,240
Sometimes it was delivered.

632
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,160
Sometimes it was put in the flat.

633
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,960
Is your landlord

634
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,640
peeping at you?

635
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,280
Peeping at me?

636
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,840
When you told me that

637
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,760
you would rent this flat,

638
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,760
I felt something wrong.

639
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,240
What a big bargain!

640
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
You pay a low rent for such a big flat.

641
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,640
See?

642
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,960
The landlord knows

643
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,880
whatever you do.

644
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,560
There must be something fishy.

645
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,760
Do you know there may be someone placing

646
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,960
mini spy cameras in hotel rooms?

647
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,960
You mean

648
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,760
the landlord can even hear

649
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,680
what we’re talking about?

650
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,120
I think

651
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,960
the landlord

652
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
must have some secrets

653
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,360
he can’t tell.

654
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,280
No way.

655
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,520
I only mentioned that

656
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,720
I needed some masks

657
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,760
in the hospital.

658
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,680
Xiao Xiao said I had dry skin.

659
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,040
Then I told Chen Tao that

660
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,890
I needed some masks

661
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:41,430
for moisturizing.

662
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,260
Who... who did you tell?

663
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,310
-Chen Tao.
-Chen Tao?

664
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,080
Oh, I know!

665
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,200
It’s Chen Tao.

666
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,160
What do you mean?

667
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,840
He likes you and wants to pursue you!

668
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,880
What are you talking about?

669
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,240
Come on.

670
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,480
Think about it.

671
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,880
It makes sense.

672
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,000
Chen Tao rented the flat to you

673
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,160
at a low price.

674
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,720
He knows where you live

675
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,200
and he knows the password.

676
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,640
He also knows

677
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,600
what you need.

678
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,360
Then, he moved

679
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,040
all the things here for you.

680
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,680
No, no, no.

681
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,640
Chen Tao likes Xu Yanshan.

682
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,520
Everybody knows that.

683
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,760
Also,

684
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,720
Chen Tao doesn’t have a flat.

685
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,360
He lives with his parents.

686
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,960
It can’t be his flat.

687
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,720
He rented it from his friend, then.

688
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,280
You two work in the same department

689
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,640
and get along every day.

690
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,400
Maybe,

691
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
he falls in love with you.

692
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
He pursues Xu Yanshan

693
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,640
as a cover-up.

694
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,280
He actually likes you.

695
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
No way?

696
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,880
I only treat him as a friend.

697
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,240
I feel a bit weird.

698
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,360
I’ll talk with him tomorrow

699
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,560
about this.

700
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,840
Good morning. Come on!

701
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,200
It’s for me?

702
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,960
I bought this for Xu Yanshan,

703
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,920
but she said that

704
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,760
she already had had breakfast.

705
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,560
Then I took it back.

706
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,520
You haven’t had breakfast, I guess.

707
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,600
Don’t waste it.

708
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,240
Enjoy it.

709
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,040
I know!

710
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,800
It’s Chen Tao.

711
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,480
He likes you and he wants to pursue you!

712
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,520
Why are you staring at me?

713
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,200
Do you want anything

714
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,960
from me?

715
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,280
Let me make myself clear.

716
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,360
I’m not going to be in love

717
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,360
in recent years.

718
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,640
Drink this.

719
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,360
It’s for digesting.

720
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,720
Drink it.

721
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,520
-It’s your favorite dish.
-I don’t want it.

722
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,240
Have some.

723
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,400
Let me get you some.

724
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,440
I don’t want it.

725
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,120
Eat it.

726
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,240
Would you like a steamed bun?

727
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,040
No.

728
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,560
What about some fruits?

729
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,480
A banana or apple?

730
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,360
Apple, please.

731
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,040
Fine.

732
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,360
It’s the biggest one.

733
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,830
Thanks.

734
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,800
You don’t want a banana?

735
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,570
No.

736
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,160
Yanshan,

737
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,600
Mr. Shao

738
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,800
didn’t mean to hurt you.

739
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,160
Everybody fails

740
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,000
to do a perfect job.

741
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,160
I’m often scolded,

742
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,800
but I still work as I usually do.

743
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,760
Don’t worry about it.

744
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,360
That’s not the same case.

745
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,080
You’re too sensitive.

746
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,240
You should learn from Mi Ka.

747
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,960
What?

748
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,120
You can bear with a lot.

749
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,680
What else?

750
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,680
You also have a special charm

751
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,080
that makes others

752
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,760
fail to notice your gender.

753
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,240
You reacted very quickly

754
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,760
in the last round.

755
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,560
You’ve made notable progress
in recent trainings.

756
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,760
Just so-so.

757
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,840
You look...

758
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,440
Mi Ka just said that

759
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,560
she wasn’t going to be in love

760
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,120
in recent years.

761
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,080
You look proud...

762
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,520
What happened?

763
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,120
What are young girls

764
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,920
thinking about?

765
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,000
In one’s twenties,

766
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,680
one wants nothing, but working.

767
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,680
Isn’t there a problem?

768
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,280
That’s just like you, Captain Xing.

769
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,040
Yes, yes.

770
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,320
Captain Hao planned

771
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,200
to introduce you a girl,

772
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,840
but you refused.

773
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,640
He was pissed off.

774
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,600
Yeah.

775
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,320
Everybody knows you’re a love insulator.

776
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,520
Want more training?

777
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,120
I assure you.

778
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,000
Chen Tao doesn’t like me.

779
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,200
But I still think

780
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,400
there’s something wrong with the flat.

781
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,400
So,

782
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,000
I’m a bit scared.

783
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,240
Then I want you to come

784
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,760
and live with me for a couple of days.

785
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,320
I can stay, of course.

786
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,280
But the problem

787
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
won’t be solved.

788
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,480
I can ask him

789
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,640
to check the landlord for you.

790
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,240
If you want to see him,

791
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,800
don’t pretend you want it for me, okay?

792
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,480
I do want to help you.

793
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,440
Thank you, then.

794
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,340
(Ruan Qingxia)

795
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:25,710
Hello?

796
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,320
Come immediately.

797
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,630
Something happened.

798
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,600
What happened to you?

799
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,710
Don’t panic.

800
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,560
I may have a big case.

801
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,560
Where are you?

802
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,960
Who’s around?

803
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,040
Stay where you are.

804
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,520
I’ll be right there!

805
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,120
Come on. Be quick.

806
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,720
What happened? What happened?

807
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,030
-Be quick.
-What happened?

808
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,160
You know what?

809
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,760
There’s something wrong
with the landlord.

810
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,690
Landlord?

811
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,320
Yes.

812
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,120
He might be a freak.

813
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,600
You mean Captain Xing is a freak?

814
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,520
What... what are you talking about?

815
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,680
Come on.

816
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,760
This is

817
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,520
Captain Xing’s flat.

818
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,080
How come he’s your landlord?

819
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,200
No.

820
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,920
He’s... he’s my landlord.

821
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,360
You mean it’s Xing Kelei’s flat?

822
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,320
Yes.

823
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,890
What...

824
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,360
Fine, I see.

825
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,480
Thank you.

826
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,120
Captain Xing,

827
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,480
why are you staying here

828
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,440
even when you’re not on duty lately?

829
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,360
I’d love to.

830
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,160
None of your business.

831
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,480
I’m caring for you.

832
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,440
Hello?

833
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,840
Mi Ka said there was
a power failure in the flat

834
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,080
and she didn’t know why.

835
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,400
She is on the night shift tonight.

836
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,240
If she goes back to the dark home alone,

837
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,520
she would be scared.

838
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,040
All right.

839
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,400
I’ll take care of it.

840
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,200
Captain Xing,

841
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,960
where are you going
in the middle of night?

842
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,720
None of your business.

843
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,960
You’re right.

844
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,840
Anyway, drive safe!

845
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,760
You’re really the landlord?

846
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,240
Don’t you want to explain

847
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,480
why you’re here?

848
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,400
Why are you here?

849
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,760
You... why...

850
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,240
Why are you in my flat?

851
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,200
I rented this flat.

852
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,480
The flat is unoccupied,

853
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,640
so I rented it out to make some money.

854
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,720
What’s the problem with it?

855
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,560
For such a simple reason?

856
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,720
Yes.

857
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,400
Then why did you

858
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,080
deliver the things to me?

859
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,000
To satisfy the tenant.

860
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,640
I didn’t ask for them.

861
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,920
It simply means

862
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,320
I offered good service.

863
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,560
How about this?

864
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,240
Ask Chen Tao about it.

865
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,240
I didn’t know

866
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
you rented my flat.

867
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,920
Otherwise,

868
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,720
I wouldn’t have bought those things.

869
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,200
Why do I bother to ask again?

870
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,160
I asked him.

871
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,560
But he didn’t tell me
you were the landlord.

872
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,520
You did?

873
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,920
Don’t focus on the food!
Do you remember what I told you?

874
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
No matter what happens,

875
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,520
you mustn’t tell her that

876
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,360
I’m the landlord!

877
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,040
Even if she finds it out,

878
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,320
deny it as far as you can!

879
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,600
Good, Captain Xing.

880
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,840
It’s quite considerate of you.

881
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,760
You’ve predicted

882
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,640
whatever would happen.

883
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,240
Sure. I’m professional.

884
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,960
I asked Xing Kelei.

885
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,840
It’s his flat,

886
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,960
but he didn’t know I rented it.

887
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,760
Seriously?

888
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,280
What a coincidence!

889
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,800
Chen Tao said the same thing.

890
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,960
I think that’s true.

891
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,480
What if Xing Kelei

892
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,440
colluded with Chen Tao

893
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,720
to trick you?

894
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,720
Trick me?

895
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,560
For what?

896
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,320
For you!

897
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,400
Me?

898
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,160
I’m not you.

899
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,200
You’re the famous and pretty host.

900
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:54,920
Right?

901
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,200
But I’m nobody,

902
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:56,960
but a mere doctor.

903
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,960
What does he want from me?

904
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,240
Don’t underestimate yourself.

905
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,480
Chen Tao said that.

906
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,640
He said it was sometimes hard

907
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
to recognize my gender.

908
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,240
I don’t want

909
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,640
to flatter myself.

910
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
You don’t?

911
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,600
You keep thinking
about the special policeman

912
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,600
for quite a long time.

913
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,440
They’re both special police.

914
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,200
Why don’t you just

915
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,830
get together with Xing Kelei?

916
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,280
They’re...

917
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,320
They’re two different men!

918
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,960
No one can replace the other.

919
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,000
You don’t want a boyfriend

920
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,040
for years.

921
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,960
Are you really waiting

922
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,680
for the special policeman?

923
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,480
Nonsense!

924

(Duty Roster of Emergency Surgery)

925
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,280
Mi Ka,

926
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,320
do you remember

927
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,440
you said you owed me

928
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,160
for the rent thing?

929
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,270
You want to change a shift?

930
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,380
(Happy Forever)
-Yes!

931
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,840
Tonight, there’s a fans meeting

932
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,240
of Xuan Meiqi.

933
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,240
It took me great efforts

934
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,160
to buy the ticket.

935
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,520
But I was told to be on duty just then.

936
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,880
Who’s Xuan Meiqi?

937
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:27,720
It’s she.

938
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,320
She’s very popular on the internet.

939
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,560
I don’t know her.

940
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:32,960
You don’t know her?

941
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,920
It doesn’t matter.

942
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,320
Mi Ka,

943
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,120
I didn’t tell you that

944
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,240
the flat belonged to

945
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,880
Captain Xing.

946
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,920
It was kind of my fault.

947
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,480
But after all, you managed

948
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,240
to rent such a good and cheap flat.

949
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,360
Please do me the favor.

950
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,080
Don’t you fear that Yanshan would think
you love another girl

951
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,480
when she knows?

952
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,560
She’s too busy to care about me.

953
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,160
Mr. Shao has a very important operation

954
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,400
in recent days.

955
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,720
She’s too busy sorting out files

956
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,920
to notice me.

957
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,680
Besides,

958
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,240
I spent half of my monthly salary

959
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,880
on this ticket.

960
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960
The ticket scalper earned a lot.

961
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,120
If I didn’t go, it would be a waste...

962
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,400
All right. All right.

963
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,600
I’ll be on duty for you. Go ahead.

964
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,920
Love you, Mi Ka.

965
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,880
Don’t.

966
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,060
(Suguo Superstore)

967
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,040
Madam,

968
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,680
-what happened?
-There you are.

969
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,120
I went out

970
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,000
for some shopping.

971
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,080
But there are too many roads
in the city.

972
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,440
Just walking for a while,

973
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,360
I get lost.

974
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,360
Where’s Wenbo?

975
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,880
Why isn’t he accompanying you?

976
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,000
He’s too busy to accompany me.

977
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,080
Madam,

978
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,360
you live right behind the supermarket.

979
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,240
In the building behind it.

980
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,600
Behind it?

981
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,720
The older I become,

982
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,960
the shorter memory I have.

983
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,880
After walking for a few laps,

984
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,320
I can’t even find the way back home.

985
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,000
Look.

986
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,120
I’ve bought so many things.

987
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,720
They’re too heavy.

988
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,920
I can’t walk quickly.

989
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,240
-Look, I...
-It’s okay.

990
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,600
Let me walk you home.

991
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,440
Okay.

992
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,040
No obvious intracranial hemorrhage,

993
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,820
right?

994
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,080
Transfer him to our department
for observation.

995
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,640
Take over the patient.

996
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,840
Mr. Shao, come for the consultation?

997
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,610
Yes.

998
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,280
I hear that

999
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,880
there will be a tumor resection surgery
in a day or two.

1000
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,000
May I go

1001
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,880
-and learn from observation?
-Sure.

1002
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Anytime you want.

1003
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,080
Thanks, Mr. Shao.

1004
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,440
Are you used to the work in ER?

1005
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,680
Yes.

1006
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:56,910
Get back to your work.

1007
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:57,470
Okay.

1008
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,560
Mr. Shao!

1009
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,080
What?

1010
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,880
Mi Ka doesn’t work

1011
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,880
in our department now.

1012
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,440
Can she observe the operation?

1013
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,520
Why can’t she?

1014
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,560
There’s no distinction in doctors.

1015
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,520
Whoever wants to observe my operations

1016
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,240
can come at any time.

1017
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,840
Understand?

1018
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,080
Also,

1019
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,080
Mi Ka just works in ER
for the moment.

1020
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,280
It doesn’t mean she won’t come back.
