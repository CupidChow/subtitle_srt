=Episode 14=

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,120
His heart rate and blood pressure drop.

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,920
Heart rate 34.

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,240
Blood pressure 80, 60.

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,000
The patient is dying.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,880
Too much blood.

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,280
Yanshan, suck it with me.

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,320
Yes.

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,720
Too much blood.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,000
I can’t see clearly.

29
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,840
The bleeding stops,

30
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
but diffuse brain swelling

31
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,240
becomes more severe.

32
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,040
He’s doomed.

33
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,360
Close the skull now.

34
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,240
His heart rate drops.

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
No blood pressure.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,600
No heartbeat.

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,680
Epinephrine.

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,920
Defibrillator, hyperensort.

39
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,040
Ready for Defibrillation.

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,560
200 Joule.

41
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,380
(Epinephrine)

42
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,000
You’ve tried your best.

43
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,840
He has no sign of life at all.

44
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,440
Announce his death.

45
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,440
Death time: 3:31 pm.

46
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,080
Jia Li and Yanshan,
deal with the corpse.

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,240
Mi Ka.

48
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,640
Mi Ka!

49
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,760
Come with me.

50
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,720
A foreign matter lies in
the left forehead,

51
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,200
close to the arteria cerebri anterior.

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,000
It should be penetrated from the

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,320
the top of the eye socket diagonally.

54
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,040
It’s close to the aorta. Very dangerous.

55
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,320
Coronal incision.

56
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,080
Watch the arteria cerebri anterior,

57
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,440
repair anterior skull base,

58
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,920
and prevent CSF leakage.

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,440
What’s the repair material?

60
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,600
Peel the periosteum of the skull

61
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,640
completely

62
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,800
and take it as patching material.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,680
Okay.

64
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,720
Got it?

65
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,280
Yes.

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,040
Start the operation.

67
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,620
Let’s go!

68
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,580
(IN OPERATING)

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,440
Too much blood. It’s swollen again.

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,160
Use one more aspirator.

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

72
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,200
Normal saline, gauze.

73
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,040
Protect the wound surface.

74
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,560
Well done!

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,560
The brain stops swelling.

76
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,000
Let’s continue.

77
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,240
How do you feel?

78
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,520
Yanshan.

79
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,080
What’s wrong?

80
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,640
Just now...

81
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Just now...

82
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,840
The blood...

83
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,480
was spouting out...

84
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,320
I...

85
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,000
I didn’t do it intentionally.

86
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,240
I...

87
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,280
I didn’t know that would happen.

88
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,720
Yanshan, it’s not your fault.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,280
Don’t think too much.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
There was so much blood.

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
So much blood.

92
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,640
Yanshan.

93
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
It’s our first time

94
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,760
to meet such a thing.

95
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,000
As doctors,

96
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,560
we will face this a lot.

97
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,320
Just do your best.

98
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,160
Foreign matter removed.

99
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,840
What’s his blood pressure?

100
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,440
120, 60.

101
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,160
Operation completed. Close the skull.

102
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,280
Yes.

103
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,480
Yanshan.

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,240
Mi Ka.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,280
What’s wrong?

106
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,640
It’s all my fault.

107
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,080
It’s all my fault.

108
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,600
I... I’m useless.

109
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Have you calmed down?

110
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,440
Get prepared for work.

111
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,480
Sorry, Director Shao.

112
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,320
We want to control our emotions,

113
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,240
but,

114
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,600
we’re not used to it.

115
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,280
It’s normal for you to have emotions.

116
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,400
But, learn to

117
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,800
control it quickly.

118
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,400
At such times,

119
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,120
emotions are useless, got it?

120
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,440
Yes.

121
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,440
Go have a meal now.

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,320
We’ll have patients soon.

123
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,240
Go!

124
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:40,940
(China Health)

125
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Captain Xing.

126
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,120
You’re back.

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,040
Luo Ting, I kept two for you.

128
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,120
Okay.

129
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,960
Here, Nian.

130
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,000
Thank you.

131
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,360
Go to bed after the meal.

132
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,690
Yes. Yes.

133
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,560
Director Shao.

134
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,760
Still upset?

135
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,400
You must be stricken

136
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,840
when meeting this kind of situation

137
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,080
suddenly.

138
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,720
In front of a disaster,

139
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,920
you may feel you’re useless.

140
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,840
When will a doctor

141
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,720
feel useless?

142
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,200
When you find

143
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,400
you’ve learned a lot,

144
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,720
but at last,

145
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,120
you can’t resist

146
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,440
fate.

147
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,880
I had such feelings, too.

148
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
I know it.

149
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,320
But even so,

150
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,240
we can’t give in.

151
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,280
We can’t.

152
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,040
If fate beats you,

153
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,200
try to fight back,

154
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,360
resist it as much as you can.

155
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,720
Gradually,

156
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,480
maybe at a moment,

157
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,120
it will stop

158
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,400
frustrating you.

159
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,240
That’s it. Very simple.

160
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,080
Why should we

161
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,920
work so hard?

162
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,240
To realize our value as doctors.

163
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,800
To help these

164
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,440
suffering patients,

165
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,840
fight against fate,

166
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,840
bargain with it,

167
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,640
avoid death,

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,320
and take them back

169
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,680
from the hands of death.

170
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,640
Dr. Zhang,

171
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,440
a patient in Orthopedics Department

172
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,840
needs operation now.

173
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,200
Do you see it?

174
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,280
Everyone is busy.

175
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,000
No time for being upset, right?

176
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,160
Oh, right.

177
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,480
Give you some warmth.

178
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
When you have no time to eat,

179
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,480
contain it in your mouth.

180
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,560
It’s useful.

181
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,600
Let’s eat it

182
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,560
and save more people.

183
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,280
Come on!

184
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,420
(To Xing Kelei
Where have you been?)

185
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,240
Mi Ka!

186
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,160
Come with me now.

187
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,280
Come on!

188
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,000
Send him to OR II.

189
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,320
-Go!
-Go, come on!

190
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,520
Here.

191
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,760
Send him to Director Wei.

192
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,340
Okay.

193
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,840
Go.

194
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,560
Here.

195
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,520
Pack your things. Get ready to go.

196
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,320
Come on. Wake up. Time to go.

197
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,360
Time to go.

198
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,120
Captain Xing, look over there.

199
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,240
Police.

200
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,320
Do... do you have food?

201
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,360
Come on, come here.

202
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,040
There are police here.

203
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,800
Come here.

204
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,880
They have food.

205
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,040
Food.

206
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,600
Thank you! Thank you!

207
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,320
Slow down, slow down.

208
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,960
Where are you from?

209
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,440
We’re from Maocun Village.

210
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,920
The... The mountain

211
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,960
collapsed.

212
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,560
Many houses were buried.

213
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,040
We had been waiting for days.

214
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,160
There was no food.

215
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,960
We had no way but to run out.

216
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,560
Then we found that

217
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,080
the road collapsed, too.

218
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,200
There are

219
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,120
many old people

220
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,560
who can’t walk a long distance.

221
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,840
They’re still waiting there.

222
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,760
Are there another

223
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,560
five villages near yours?

224
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,520
Yes. Yes.

225
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,160
It’s not far away. All destroyed.

226
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,760
Someone from Licun village

227
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,760
came to our village for food.

228
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,080
But we don’t have any, either.

229
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,480
He’s from Licun Village.

230
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,440
Yeah, I’m from

231
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,320
Licun Village.

232
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,600
We’ll go to Licun Village.

233
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,920
Can you show us the way?

234
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,960
Let me do it.

235
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,040
You little kid.

236
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,800
Don’t make trouble.

237
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,040
Look, sir.

238
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
I... I know there well.

239
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,800
They followed me here.

240
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,880
I’ll show you the way.

241
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,640
Good.

242
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,800
The rest of you

243
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,400
can go to Xiaobei Town.

244
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,640
You can have food there.

245
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,620
-Okay.
-Okay.

246
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,720
I’ll follow you back.

247
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,480
You come to help us.

248
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,920
We have nothing to fear.

249
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,650
-Yeah.
-Do you think so?

250
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,340
Nothing to fear.

251
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:26,510
Yes.

252
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,360
Okay.

253
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,280
If you want food,

254
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
go to Xiaobei Town.

255
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,040
If you want to go back, follow us.

256
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Sirs, this way.

257
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,880
Policemen are here! Village head!

258
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,160
Village head!

259
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,360
Policemen are here!

260
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,560
Policemen are here!

261
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,560
Village head!

262
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,080
This... This is Captain Xing.

263
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,920
You’re here. We’re saved.

264
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,640
How are the injuries in your village?

265
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,560
It’s not so bad,

266
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,600
just some external injuries.

267
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,200
I heard Yaogou Village

268
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,720
was buried.

269
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,800
The houses were buried completely.

270
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
There is no way to save them.

271
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,440
The roads were destroyed, too.

272
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,920
The whole valley was flattened.

273
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,480
How miserable!

274
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,680
The villagers who escaped from there

275
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,920
are all here now.

276
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,960
I see.

277
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,920
We’ll make a way

278
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,160
to send some food here.

279
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,400
Luo Ting, Li Nian,

280
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,640
go pitch some tents.

281
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,440
Yes.

282
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,560
You go find an open space

283
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,240
for an airdrop.

284
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,160
Yes.

285
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,000
Here are more.

286
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,760
Food for you.

287
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,560
They are

288
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,720
the villagers from Yaogou Village.

289
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,240
That’s all of them.

290
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,520
All the houses below this building

291
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
collapsed.

292
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,200
No one can stay there.

293
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,720
-It’s too dangerous.
-Captain Xing.

294
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,240
Captain Xing.

295
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,280
We found a

296
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,280
large flat area on the mountain.

297
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,320
It can be used for airdrop.

298
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,680
And we found two pieces of red cloth

299
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,200
at the village committee.

300
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,310
We can use them as a sign.

301
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,040
Yu Feng.

302
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,960
Follow the village head

303
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,110
to other villages for a check.

304
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,070
Yes.

305
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,480
Luo Ting! Li Nian!

306
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,070
Yes. Let’s go. Move.

307
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Move.

308
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,040
Xia.

309
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,360
We’ve met several aftershocks

310
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,000
on the way.

311
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,000
Aren’t you afraid?

312
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,400
Are you afraid?

313
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,120
If so, you can go back now.

314
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,320
I... I’m a man.

315
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,240
I’m afraid of nothing.

316
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,200
I’m just afraid

317
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,480
you can’t bear it on the scene.

318
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,880
Look, if not we’re lucky,

319
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,480
and met this tractor for the wounded,

320
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,280
we might have been walking

321
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,440
on the road.

322
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,600
Walk?

323
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,840
Even so, I’ll go there.

324
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,980
(Earthquake Relief)

325
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,040
Xia, are you alright?

326
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,440
Yes.

327
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,600
What’s up?

328
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Sir, what’s up?

329
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,720
The wheel is stuck.

330
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,800
Come to push it out. Come on!

331
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,400
Let’s go help. Come on!

332
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,960
Be careful.

333
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,920
The wounded stay still.

334
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,920
Have a good rest there.

335
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,720
What’s up?

336
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,160
The wheel is stuck.

337
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,040
Come to push it out.

338
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,520
-Come on.
-Let’s give a hand.

339
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,040
Come on. Push it. Push!

340
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,560
One, two, three!

341
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,840
One, two, three!

342
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,680
Oh, no, the tractor is too heavy,

343
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,480
and the wheel is stuck too deep.

344
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,800
The closest medical center

345
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,600
is in Qiushan County,

346
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,240
about three or four kilometers away.

347
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,120
What about this?

348
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,960
We carry the two

349
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,160
seriously wounded men there first.

350
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,840
The others stay there

351
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,320
with the driver,

352
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,280
waiting for other tractors.

353
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,150
-Okay.
-Okay.

354
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,820
Okay.

355
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,720
We have six people here

356
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,840
and two wounded men.

357
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,880
Who can help?

358
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,880
We can.

359
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,960
Yes, we can help.

360
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,760
Okay.

361
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,760
Let’s put the wounded

362
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
on the stretchers.

363
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,920
-Okay.
-Okay.

364
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,790
-Come.
-Okay.

365
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,960
Be careful.

366
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,120
Xia,

367
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,040
why not let me

368
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,000
carry your camera?

369
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,200
Your bag is heavy enough.

370
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,920
I can do it.

371
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,360
It’s... it’s nothing for me.

372
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,040
Captain Xing, we’re arriving.

373
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,600
Captain Xing, here it is.

374
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,840
It’s relatively open

375
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,800
and there are

376
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,160
no obstructions above five degrees.

377
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,160
Good.

378
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,440
Make a cross and
notify the command center.

379
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,560
Yes.

380
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,880
Captain Xing.

381
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
We can’t connect to

382
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,120
the maritime satellite phone.

383
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,240
Go to the mountain top

384
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,960
and use transceiver.

385
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,120
Yes.

386
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,000
You two move back first.

387
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,640
Move back.

388
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,080
Wait, wait a second.

389
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,640
Command center.

390
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,720
Command center.

391
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,720
Received.

392
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,560
Received.

393
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,560
Speak.

394
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,140
Captain Xing.

395
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,140
Report.

396
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,640
The first rescue group of

397
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,920
Tiger Assault Team of Jiangning City
has arrived

398
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,080
at Maocun Village, Linan County.

399
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,240
There are five villages here,

400
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,200
about 300 villagers are trapped,

401
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,960
90 percent of houses collapsed.

402
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,520
Yaogou Village

403
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,320
was completely buried in the mountain.

404
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,240
Some survivors

405
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,480
are staying in Maocun Village.

406
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,280
We need a large amount of water,

407
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,440
food and trauma medicine.

408
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,720
We’ve found an airdrop area

409
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,960
with the coordinate of

410
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
95°07’ E

411
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,520
and 32°22’ N.

412
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,520
Roger that.

413
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,680
Repeat the coordinate:

414
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,320
95°07’ E

415
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,200
and 32°22’ N.

416
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,760
Over.

417
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,640
Roger that. Take care.

418
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,720
Help! Help!

419
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,440
Anyone?

420
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,480
Help! Help!

421
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,320
Help! Help!

422
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,480
Anyone?

423
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,400
Help!

424
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,800
What’s the matter?

425
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,560
Someone is in a coma.

426
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,760
Dr. Chen’s head

427
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,880
was hit by a stone.

428
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,760
He’s been in a coma for a whole night.

429
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,840
Wait a moment.

430
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,200
We’ll come to you soon.

431
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,640
Just a moment.

432
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,840
We’re exploration crew
from Chinese Academy of Sciences.

433
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,880
Dr. Chen is our

434
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,640
irrigationist.

435
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,120
We were surveying in Linan

436
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,560
and met the earthquake.

437
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,960
We got separated with our team.

438
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,160
How did he hurt?

439
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,800
A stone fell off from the mountain

440
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,600
and hit his head.

441
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,240
He was awake at first.

442
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,040
Then he became confused.

443
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,560
He woke up for some time

444
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,200
and fell into a coma again.

445
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,760
Luo Ting!

446
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,720
Someone hurt his head seriously.

447
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,920
Ask Li Nian and Zhuo Wenjing

448
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,680
to take a stretcher

449
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,320
and a first-aid case here.

450
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,840
Okay. Okay.

451
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,720
Come on!

452
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,440
Okay.

453
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:44,920
Rise!

454
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,990
Watch out your feet!

455
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,240
-Come.
-Be careful.

456
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Be careful.

457
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,320
Watch out!

458
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,440
Watch behind! Watch behind!

459
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,040
Slow down.

460
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,880
Be careful.

461
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,720
Captain Xing.

462
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,960
I’ve got the news from the radio that

463
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,240
the west road from the base camp

464
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,800
to Long’er Valley has been cleared.

465
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,640
We can send him there.

466
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,480
There are cars.

467
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,920
Long’er Valley?

468
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,600
Long’er Valley is behind this mountain.

469
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
It’s not far as the crow flies.

470
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,040
Hurry up!

471
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,480
Come on. Three, two, one!

472
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,460
Come on.

473
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,400
Rise!

474
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,400
Captain Shu.

475
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,760
Command center calls you.

476
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,880
Okay.

477
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,480
See the man in a gray hoodie?

478
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,200
Watch him closely. Go.

479
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,120
Yes.

480
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,440
Xia.

481
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,480
Isn’t that Shu Wenbo

482
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,320
from the Tiger Assault Team?

483
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,560
I saw him in an interview.

484
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,840
They come to rescue.

485
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,160
There’s nothing strange.

486
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,000
Won’t you say hello to him?

487
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,280
Hurry to work.

488
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,320
Get familiar with the environment.

489
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,800
You shoot, I take photos.

490
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,560
Okay.

491
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,160
We have to make a rope bridge.

492
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,400
Come.

493
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,680
One, two!

494
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,600
One, two!

495
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,800
One, two!

496
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,880
One, two!

497
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,040
One, two!

498
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,200
One, two!

499
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,560
One, two!

500
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,200
One, two!

501
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,920
Be careful. Be careful.

502
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,280
Slippery road!

503
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
Watch your steps!

504
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,640
Keep the stretcher stable!

505
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,560
Wenjing! Wenjing!

506
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,640
Captain Xing! Zhuo Wenjing falls off!

507
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,560
Zhuo Wenjing!

508
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,760
Wenjing!

509
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Captain Xing, I’m here!

510
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,480
Be careful. Captain Xing.

511
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,600
Captain Xing. Be careful!

512
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,280
Wenjing!

513
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,400
Wenjing!

514
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,960
Captain Xing, I’m here!

515
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,040
Captain Xing, be careful.

516
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,560
Be careful.

517
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,640
How do you feel?

518
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
I’m fine.

519
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,440
It’s lucky some trees

520
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,760
blocked me,

521
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,120
or I’ll die or become disabled

522
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,080
falling off

523
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,440
from that height.

524
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,840
Can you move?

525
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,400
No, no, no.

526
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,320
I can’t do it. It hurts!

527
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,440
Luo Ting,

528
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,960
Wenjing can’t move now.

529
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,680
Listen.

530
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,440
You take Dr. Chen to Long’er Valley now.

531
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,840
There are cars.

532
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,520
Call a doctor to help.

533
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,480
Okay. Captain Xing.

534
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,280
Okay.

535
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,320
Shall I meet you there?

536
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,640
Don’t bother. Go now.

537
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,340
Okay.

538
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,440
Take care of yourself!

539
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
Keep away from water.

540
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:37,930
Thank you.

541
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,460
You’re welcome.

542
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,040
Thank you. Thank you so much.

543
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,920
Thank...

544
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,840
It’s you.

545
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,640
Captain Xing will come soon.

546
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,600
Don’t worry.

547
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,280
Doctor!

548
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,760
Captain Shu! Dr. Mi!

549
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,840
Come here now! Come here!

550
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,000
Qi, take care of things here.

551
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,440
What’s up?

552
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,480
Where did he get hurt?

553
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,120
And how?

554
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,800
Dr. Chen’s head was hit by a stone.

555
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,800
He was awake at first.

556
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,080
Then he became confused.

557
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,440
He woke up for some time

558
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,040
and fell into a coma again.

559
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,680
Dilated pupils and no consciousness.

560
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,520
Prepare for operation.

561
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,330
Go!

562
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,480
Go! Be careful.

563
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,040
Director Shao.

564
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,680
What’s wrong?

565
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,000
His head is hurt.

566
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,240
He was in a coma when discovered.

567
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,560
He woke up for some time

568
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,560
and fell into a coma again.

569
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,920
His left pupil has dilated

570
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,320
and he has lost consciousness.

571
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,520
It’s acute epidural hematoma.

572
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,270
Get blood bags.

573
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,800
Okay.

574
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,600
Look here,

575
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,640
fracture line

576
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,320
has extended to basis cranii

577
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,320
and transverse sinus.

578
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Open the bone flap at the original place

579
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,440
to avoid further damage

580
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,320
to the transverse sinus.

581
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,100
Got it.

582
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,690
Got it?

583
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,680
-Yes.
-Start the operation.

584
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,880
What’s the situation exactly?

585
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,120
When we took Dr. Chen here,

586
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,760
the road was too slippery.

587
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,320
Zhuo Wenjing fell off

588
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,160
from the cliff.

589
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,240
Where is she?

590
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,160
Below the cliff.

591
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,680
Not far away from Long’er Valley.

592
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,000
Captain Xing is watching there.

593
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,640
I’ll get the first-aid case.
Wait for me.

594
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,480
Okay.

595
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,440
What’s the situation?

596
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,500
(IN OPERATING)

597
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,240
The hematoma was cleared.

598
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,160
Hang the dura mater now.

599
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Operation completed.

600
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,680
Close the skull.

601
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,680
There, Dr. Mi.

602
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,240
There they are.

603
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,520
Give me the interphone.

604
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,800
Xing Kelei.

605
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,200
Can you hear me?

606
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,400
Yes.

607
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,880
How are you now?

608
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,560
She doesn’t bleed a lot,

609
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
but she can’t move.

610
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,440
Wait a moment. I’ll be there soon.

611
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,160
Can you come down by rope?

612
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,680
Don’t worry.

613
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,000
I can do it.

614
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,400
Be careful.

615
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,040
Does it hurt?

616
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,440
No.

617
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,120
And your belly?

618
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,600
It’s not, either.

619
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,720
No. It hurts.

620
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,920
Your waist is hurt, right?

621
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,000
I have to take it out.

622
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,840
The branch has

623
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,960
stuck with your

624
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,400
pants.

625
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,120
Or you may get infected.

626
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,920
Hold your horses.

627
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,520
Don’t be nervous.

628
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,320
Dr. Mi.

629
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,840
I want to wear dresses in the future.

630
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,600
Don’t worry.

631
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
Take it for me.

632
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,440
Come on.

633
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,600
Xing Kelei, get a scissor for me.

634
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,400
Okay.

635
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,280
Done.

636
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,080
Get someone to move her up.

637
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,160
Luo Ting, get ready to take her up.

638
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,320
Yes.

639
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,840
Tell them to pay attention to

640
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,160
her waist and her wound.

641
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,160
Okay.

642
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,280
Thank you, Dr. Mi.

643
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,480
Anesthetics have lost efficacy for long,

644
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,360
but he’s still in a coma now.

645
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,640
His left pupil has dilated.

646
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,260
Blood pressure rises.

647
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:47,880
High pressure 210,

648
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,840
Low pressure 120.

649
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,600
Pulse drops to 42.

650
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,640
He must have prolonged

651
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,360
distal hematoma.

652
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,600
Make a CT scan again.

653
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,480
Yes.

654
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,720
Come on, one, two, three!

655
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,760
Come on!

656
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,080
Here.

657
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,520
Transverse sinus has new hematoma.

658
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,600
It’s related to cranial pressure drop.

659
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,710
The wound is bleeding, too.

660
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,280
Do the second operation.

661
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,230
I’m expanding the patient’s bone window.

662
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,800
Machine.

663
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,520
Gelatin sponge.

664
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,880
Press the rupture of transverse sinus.

665
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,480
Press with cotton piece, too.

666
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,520
The bleeding can’t stop.

667
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,230
Add 400ml blood.

668
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,520
Cone gelatin sponge.

669
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,640
I’ll block the blood.

670
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,640
The bleeding stops.

671
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,020
(China Health)

672
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,560
Luo Ting,

673
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,320
I’ll meet you at the gate.

674
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,220
(Morphine hydrochloride injection)

675
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,760
Who are you?

676
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,720
The... doctor asked me here.

677
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,780
(Morphine hydrochloride injection)

678
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,400
What are you doing?

679
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,360
My leg is broken.

680
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,120
I have to get it to stop the pain.

681
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,360
Please forgive me.

682
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,160
He stole morphine.

683
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,680
Catch him.

684
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,560
He’s a drugster.

685
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,760
Send him to the police station.

686
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,800
Yes.

687
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,560
Captain Shu, thank you.

688
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,600
It’s my duty.

689
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,000
We’ve watched him

690
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,720
for several days

691
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,920
to catch him.

692
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,440
We’ve been patrolling here.

693
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,840
-Don’t worry, it’s safe.
-Okay.

694
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,280
Okay.

695
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,000
Are you alright?

696
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,040
-I’m fine. It’s lucky he’s here.
-Huh.

697
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,440
That’s good.

698
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,160
I have a question for you.

699
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,760
It’s like this,

we add a hot-line in our

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,040
contacted us

704
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,520
and planned to donate something.

705
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,640
So, I’d like to ask you.

706
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,360
Do you have any

707
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,800
medicine in urgent need?

708
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,560
I can release the news for you.

709
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,960
I’d better take you to

710
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,680
Director Chen.

711
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,800
He’s responsible for logistics.

712
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,890
He has the detailed list

713
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,650
of the medicine.

714
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,300
Good.

715
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,200
Let’s go.

716
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,760
How’s she?

717
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,560
The branch has been pulled out.

718
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,760
She’s fine.

719
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,760
Come, put her here!

720
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,680
Captain Shu, don’t worry.

721
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,280
I’m fine.

722
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,840
Don’t pretend to be strong now.

723
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,100
Wen Qin.

724
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,840
Coming!

725
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,920
Come on!

726
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,640
Let’s take her inside.

727
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,280
Okay.

728
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,760
To OR II.

729
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,680
Okay.

730
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,640
Xing Kelei. Xing Kelei.

731
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,160
Come to the command center now.

732
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,520
Yes, got it.

733
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,820
(BAISHI XIANG)

734
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:44,740
(IN OPERATION)

735
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,600
(Earthquake Relief)

736
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,360
Except medicines and materials,

737
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,840
I also brought some water and food.

738
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,800
The truck has enough space

739
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,080
to contain them.

740
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,280
Thank you. Ms. Xing.

741
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,160
These materials and medicines

742
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,920
are urgently needed.

743
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,240
I want to thank you

744
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,880
on behalf of the people here.

745
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,030
You’re welcome.

746
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,960
It’s within my ability.

747
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,920
Compared to what you do,

748
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,120
it’s nothing to mention.

749
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,000
Ms. Xing.

750
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,200
I arranged a place

751
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,900
for you to have a rest.

752
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,360
-Thank you.
-Someone will come

753
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,200
to take you there.

754
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,120
I have to go to work now.

755
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,160
Go ahead, please.

756
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,040
I’m leaving then.

757
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,940
-Okay, okay. See you.
-Okay.

758
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,820
Thank you!

759
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,120
Thank you.

760
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,240
Should I say

761
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,240
thank you, too?

762
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,040
Actually what we do

763
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,620
is the same in nature.

764
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,800
It’s just different in ways.

765
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,920
Don’t say thank you.

766
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,640
Okay. I won’t say it again.

767
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,960
I’ll keep it here.

768
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
I remember you always

769
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,960
take chocolates when

770
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,520
you do operations one after another.

771
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,760
So I brought you some chocolates,

772
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,240
and coffees, instant.

773
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,440
It’ll be convenient here.

774
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,680
I’ll keep it here.

775
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,240
Ms. Xing.

776
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,360
The reporter shot the scene

777
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
when you sent the materials,

778
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
and wants to ask

779
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,880
whether you can accept an interview.

780
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,280
Okay.

781
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Dr. Shao.

782
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,520
They also want to interview

783
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,160
medical workers here.

784
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,680
You’re the first batch to come here.

785
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,640
Could you please...

786
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,560
-accept the interview?
-No.

787
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,840
I have to work now.

788
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,680
Sorry.

789
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,720
You asked them to do so?

790
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,920
No.

791
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,240
They come to

792
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,120
shoot the scene of medical relief

793
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,040
and ask me

794
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,720
to arrange the interview.

795
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,800
Okay. I see.

796
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,400
Part of the road from earthquake center

797
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,280
to Linan is cleared,

798
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,520
but

799
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,000
the communication is still unconnected.

800
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,000
So, many wounded

801
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,600
and quake-affected people

802
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,640
can’t be sent here.

803
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,640
Considering this situation,

804
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,840
the command center plans to

805
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,560
send a medical team

806
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,920
with the rescue team,

807
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,760
and

808
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,200
call for some volunteers.

809
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,840
It’s good that

810
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,680
Director Wang comes.

811
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,720
He can take over my job.

812
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,340
And you

813
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,080
arrange some doctors

814
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,000
and nurses

815
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,000
to come with me.

816
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Okay. I’ll do that.

817
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,760
It’ll be a hard work.

818
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,360
So, tell everyone it’s voluntary.

819
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,080
I see.

820
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,760
Thank you!

821
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,410
Okay.

822
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,560
Ms. Xing.

823
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,840
Won’t you come back with us?

824
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,680
You go first.

825
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,640
I’ll stay and help.

826
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,320
Okay.

827
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,880
If there’s anything urgent

828
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,480
in the company,

829
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,520
call Alice.

830
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,080
I told her before I came.

831
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:01,650
Okay.

832
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,560
As for the medicines and materials,

833
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,280
I called some

834
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,040
of my friends.

835
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,000
Here are their contacts.

836
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,000
Mobilize as many as you can.

837
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:09,760
Okay.

838
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,160
Take care of yourself.

839
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,480
I’m leaving now.

840
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,160
Take care.

841
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:13,870
