20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,240
Keyao.

21
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,760
Sorry, I’m late.

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,680
I just finished the operation.

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,160
It’s OK. I have just arrived.

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,640
I ordered a cup of americano for you.

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,720
I see that. Thanks.

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,120
Let’s talk about business.

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,160
Just like what I told

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,120
you in WeChat,

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,000
as a doctor, I can say that

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,760
the enhanced aneurysm clip

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,720
is great.

32
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,360
It’s well designed

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,200
and features strong force.

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,960
But from commercial perspective,

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,720
I don’t know.

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
So, I can’t give opinions.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,040
You need to make a decision on you own.

38
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,560
I’ve decided to be the agent.

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,200
I’ve sent someone to deal with it.

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,360
Since you’ve made up your mind,

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,320
does my opinion matter anymore?

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,560
Oh,

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,200
I thought you came to see me

44
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,280
about some other stuff.

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,200
Take a look at this.

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,400
You know

47
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,560
Spider College, right?

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,520
I do.

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,680
A neutral academic platform.

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,640
On the one hand,

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,560
they promote medical studies

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,000
and practical application of skills;

53
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,080
on the other hand,

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,040
they sell the equipment and machines

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,440
that they produce.

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,720
They intend to establish a branch

57
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,600
in China and are looking for

58
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,960
suitable cooperative enterprises.

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,320
You want to cooperate with them?

60
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,000
I’d like to hear your thoughts.

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,920
My thoughts?

62
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,440
Well, Spider College

63
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,600
has branches all over

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,840
the world,

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,480
especially in those

66
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
regions and countries

67
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
with highly advanced medical levels.

68
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,200
My opinion is,

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,680
it’ll be great if

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,080
you can cooperate with them.

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,680
It helps you develop your business.

72
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,200
You and I have the same idea.

73
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,640
They plan to work with

74
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
the top experts

75
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,920
and medical organizations in China

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
to help them deliver

77
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,000
the world first-class training.

78
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,640
If

79
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,320
Renxin is willing to work with them,

80
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,680
I believe the hospital will make

81
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,720
further improvements both

82
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,520
academically and clinically.

83
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,880
We surely would like to work with them.

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,880
But you should know that

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,120
to work with them, we

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,440
have to spend a lot of money

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,200
to purchase their

88
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
equipment and machines.

89
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,640
Their equipment is

90
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,720
worth buying anyway.

91
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,720
Since it’s a cooperative relationship,

92
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,520
mutual-benefit is what

93
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,600
both parties are after.

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,400
You’re quite persuasive.

95
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,000
But you know,

96
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,720
the president manages budget,

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,080
not me.

98
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,000
Don’t worry.

99
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,880
Don’t worry.

100
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,760
I’ll do whatever I can to help you.

101
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,520
Director Shao.

102
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,440
Keyao.

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,120
Mi Ka.

104
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,040
Your morning is over?

105
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,120
I just finished draining cerebrospinal
fluid for the patient in Bed 7.

106
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,740
(SPIDER COLLEGE)

107
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,040
Is Keyao the friend

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,320
whom you talked about?

109
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,560
I asked him to do me a favor.

110
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,400
He helped me have a look at

111
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,360
the product because we’re old friends.

112
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,800
It’s no big deal.

113
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,480
I’m here to buy cakes.

114
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,040
Want one?

115
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,920
OK.

116
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,040
What flavor?

117
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
I’m fine with any flavor.

118
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,640
OK.

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,280
No cheese, though.

120
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,830
OK.

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,040
Come on, these are for you.

122
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,920
Come and get one.

123
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,470
-Morning.
-Morning.

124
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,030
More biscuits here.

125
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,550
Yeah.

126
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,080
-Here.
-Thanks.

127
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,940
What are you doing?

128
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,680
Director Wang.

129
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,960
My wife just came back
from her journey.

130
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,280
She asked me to give
the cheese biscuits

131
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,240
to everybody.

132
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,240
Here, take some.

133
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,120
Enough, enough.

134
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,800
-All right, all right.
-Grab more.

135
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,920
Too many. Thank you, thank you.

136
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,600
I’ll put some

137
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,720
in Director Shao’s office.

138
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,960
Don’t take all the biscuits.

139
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,960
No,

140
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,400
he never eats cheese.

141
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,840
He doesn’t eat cheese?

142
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,520
No.

143
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,040
He never ate cheese stuff

144
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,160
when living abroad for so many years.

145
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,120
No cheese, though.

146
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,520
Hurry up and have a look.

147
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,360
Chen Feifei

148
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,520
is freaking out in the ward.

149
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,440
Go, go, go.

150
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,440
I don’t care. I must be discharged.

151
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:02,960
The doctor said

152
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,640
you cannot be discharged

153
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,280
at the moment.

154
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,920
I don’t...

155
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,600
Feifei, stop.

156
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,040
Feifei, my baby.

157
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,560
Shut up.

158
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,480
Which doctor said it?

159
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,520
He can come to talk to me.

160
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,680
I’m perfectly fine.

161
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,400
Feifei…

162
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,120
Come on.

163
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,560
Stop gabbling.

164
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,520
Do you want the job or not?

165
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,440
No, I...

166
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,120
I just want you to be healthy.

167
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,960
I’m going to the rehearsal room,

168
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,680
got it?

169
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,560
You’re in bad condition, now.

170
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,280
You can’t rehearse.

171
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,960
What’s wrong with my health?

172
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,000
Get a cab for me now.

173
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,880
I can’t.

174
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,440
Stop.

175
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,480
-I can’t.
-Stop!

176
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,680
This is the hospital.

177
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,560
Don’t be so loud.

178
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,200
Who are you?

179
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,120
I’ll...

180
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,320
File a complaint against me?

181
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,040
See what you’re doing!

182
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Do you hope that

183
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,960
tonight’s news is all about

184
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,440
a web celebrity making a scene

185
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,520
and shouting at a doctor
in a hospital?

186
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,960
You…!

187
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,240
I don’t mind.

188
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,040
You keep making noises.

189
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,240
Your MRI,

190
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,040
CT and

191
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,200
X-ray all show that

192
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,160
there’s a nearly 3cm long

193
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,360
tumor in your spine.

194
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,840
We suspect it’s astrocytoma,

195
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,920
which is compressing your nerve.

196
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,640
So, you were feeling pain on the back
and myasthenic.

197
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,000
The doctor suggests an urgent operation

198
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,800
to confirm the nature of the tumor.

199
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,800
Nonsense.

200
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,400
Feifei.

201
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,320
When I came in,

202
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,720
I saw paparazzi out there.

203
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
Exaggeration is what they do.

204
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,320
Do you want to publicize
your disease

205
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,760
or stay here

206
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,960
and calm down?

207
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,800
Make your choice.

208
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,160
Xiaoxiao,

209
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,320
ask a janitor

210
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,200
to clean up the ward

211
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,160
in case others get injured.

212
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,840
OK.

213
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,040
Miss Chen, I’ll be honest with you.

214
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Your condition doesn’t look good.

215
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,240
If you let the tumor continue

216
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,560
compressing your nerve,

217
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,440
the worst possible result would be

218
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,240
paraplegia.

219
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,160
Please ponder over it.

220
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,760
When you’re calm,

221
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,240
let’s talk about

222
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,400
your treatment plan.

223
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
She needs to change her clothes.

224
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,040
I’ll come back with the medicine.

225
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,800
OK, OK.

226
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,200
I was shocked.

227
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,160
Chen Feifei

228
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,320
is a celebrity.

229
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,960
Yayan said “be extra

230
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,160
careful with her”.

231
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,240
Why did you dare to give her
a tough attitude?

232
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,200
Director Wei told me

233
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,040
that being a doctor is the same

234
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,400
as being a detective.

235
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,120
You must learn your patient,

236
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,880
know what she wants,

237
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,960
what she doesn’t want,

238
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,800
what she cares about,

239
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,960
and what she worries about.

240
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,280
Chen Feifei

241
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,280
is a celebrity, right?

242
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,320
I think negative news

243
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,720
is what she fears the most.

244
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,000
Although she’s only 23

245
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,200
and quite arrogant,

246
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,740
I think

247
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,040
deep down, she fears a lot.

248
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,960
So,

249
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,720
we have to keep her under control

250
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,040
and shut her up

251
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,320
using that trick.

252
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,000
You’re good

253
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,360
at dealing with her.

254
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,080
I met one or two

255
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,920
tricky patients every day

256
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,960
in the ER, right?

257
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,640
She’s Director Shao’s patient.

258
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,280
How about you follow up

259
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,560
her condition?

260
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,680
OK, no problem.

261
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,880
Thank you.

262
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
You’re welcome.

263
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,320
You helped me a lot.

264
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
See you around, then.

265
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,080
See you.

266
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,440
Other patients

267
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,680
are less tricky than her.

268
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,880
Also, she’s a celebrity

269
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,320
who isn’t cooperative.

270
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,360
More trouble will ensue.

271
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,760
Every patient

272
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,320
is the same

273
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,480
to me.

274
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,720
They make no difference.

275
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,920
Director Shao.

276
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,640
You two.

277
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,840
Deliver the report

278
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,670
to that department.

279
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,360
-OK.
-Got it?

280
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,550
Director Shao.

281
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,960
Come in.

282
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,880
Captain Hao.

283
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,760
Come.

284
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,000
Sit down.

285
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,440
I’m told that Captain Zhuang
has applied

286
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,720
for a drill

287
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,320
between Black Panther and Tiger

288
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,240
during the experience exchange.

289
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,720
It seems to be a drill

290
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,720
but he just wants to

291
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,200
compete with us.

292
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,440
You can make the decision,

293
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,400
can’t you?

294
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,840
If I did, that would be an order.

295
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,480
But I’m still thinking about it.

296
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,120
I’ve heard that Zhuang Zhiwen

297
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,760
doesn’t think his team
is inferior to yours.

298
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,960
How he thinks

299
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,960
doesn’t matter.

300
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,800
What matters is, they

301
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,760
can learn something

302
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,800
from the exchange and training.

303
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,080
You’ve become

304
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,120
quite slick now.

305
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,280
You can come up with

306
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,080
these diplomatic words.

307
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,080
I mean what I say.

308
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,040
Look. I never

309
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,680
hide anything in experience exchanges.

310
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,640
I always share everything

311
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,480
with others.

312
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,800
But of course,

313
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,360
it’s mainly because you’re bighearted

314
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,320
and see the big picture.

315
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,800
I know why

316
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,320
you butter me up.

317
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,480
It’s because you don’t think

318
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,440
they will win.

319
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,560
So? Will you take the challenge?

320
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,280
Yes.

321
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,960
You mustn’t lose. Mustn’t.

322
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,680
Don’t worry.

323
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,560
OK.

324
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,600
(Practice & Educational Training Center)

325
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,440
Now,

326
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,280
you will be simulating

327
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,120
a hostage rescue operation.

328
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
You have the map

329
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,520
of the building in your hand.

330
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,720
Your rescue method

331
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,440
and operation route

332
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,400
will be determined through a draw.

333
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,800
On the route,

334
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,000
you will run into the kidnapper
or the hostage.

335
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
(Hostage Kidnapper)
Score if you shoot the kidnapper.

336
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,480
The entire team loses
if you hurt the hostage.

337
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,280
During the drill,

338
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,800
there will be contingencies.

339
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Your ability to handle emergencies

340
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,120
will be tested.

341
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,400
The operation

342
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,520
must be finished within 5 minutes.

343
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,080
Understand?

344
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,400
Understood.

345

Xing Kelei, Zhuang Zhiwen.

346
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,720
Come here and draw lots.

(Rappelling assault)

348
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,040
Go.

349
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,880
Yes, Sir.

350
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,820
(Chen Feifei Famous Actress
Yue Opera Actress)

351
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,360
Mi Ka.

352
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,920
Director He.

353
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,760
I’ve heard about

354
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,320
what happened yesterday.

355
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,760
You know, even if you discharged her,

356
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,480
you wouldn’t take any responsibility.

357
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,160
But you actually looked for trouble

358
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,280
for stopping her from
leaving the hospital.

359
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,160
I understand that doctors

360
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,840
are to respect the patients’ choices,

361
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,600
but I think she’s in a bad condition

362
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,480
after reading her reports.

363
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,320
I think it’s necessary that

364
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,960
I told her

365
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,240
about the truth.

366
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,720
You’re reading through her information?

367
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,120
I just learned that

368
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,800
she studied Yue Opera.

369
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,760
She later chose to be
a web celebrity

370
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,600
and became famous

371
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,280
and started making TV shows.

372
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,760
Yeah.

373
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,600
You know, the public care about

374
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,920
what they want to care about.

375
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,200
Feifei’s teacher is a friend of mine.

376
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,760
Her life

377
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,120
is difficult.

378
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,240
She used to be an extra

379
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,920
and worked very hard

380
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,320
to earn the achievements.

381
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,040
I know her life isn’t easy.

382
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,000
I also know it’s cruel that she

383
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,680
has to drop everything

384
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,840
for her health.

385
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,240
But there must be something

386
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,560
more important than fame and prestige.

387
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,680
Do you think she rejects

388
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,800
an operation because she

389
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,720
doesn’t want to disappear while
her career is up and coming?

390
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,320
Or what?

391
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,400
Her acting is always questioned.

392
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,280
She got this role,

393
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,320
which suits her well.

394
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,280
She has worked

395
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,800
and prepared a lot

396
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,120
in hope of proving herself.

397
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,400
And she’s been supporting

398
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,320
her teacher’s benefit performance

399
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,320
in order to promote Yue Opera.

400
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,280
Some people may seem unfriendly

401
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,880
but deep down,

402
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,120
they all got a soft spot.

403
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,440
Maybe being unfriendly

404
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
is her best way

405
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,640
to protect herself.

406
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,680
What?

407
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,600
What happened?

408
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,040
Keep down. Move, move.

409
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,520
Clear.

410
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,520
Too hasty.

411
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,440
Zhang Qiang

412
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,800
shot the bomb and
triggered an explosion.

413
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,880
Out.

414
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,360
Captain.

415
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,800
Zhang Qiang, stay here.

416
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,800
The rest, follow me.

417
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,160
30 seconds left.

418
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,040
Out of the way.

419
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,800
You’re running out of time.

420
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,200
Seven, six, five,

421
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,600
Four, three, two...

422
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,120
The winner of the
simulative rescue operation

423
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,600
is Tiger.

424
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,120
When neither of you

425
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,240
could tell

426
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,920
the kidnapper,

427
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,840
Captain Xing Kelei

428
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,360
made a quick and correct response.

429
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,840
Good job.

430
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,640
You’re a decent rival.

431
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,760
I’ll see you in the competition.

432
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,080
The best vegetable-stuffed
steam bun in the world.

433
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,580
(Mi Ka: You eat more, then.)

434
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,600
What’s with the smirk on your face?

435
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,160
I’m in love.

436
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,760
How is Chen Feifei?

437
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,120
Exceptionally quiet.

438
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,630
For real.

439
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,200
It looks like you’ve kept
her under control.

440
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,800
What are you doing?

441
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
What are you doing?

442
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,360
Stay there.

443
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,520
Stop.

444
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,600
Delete the photos.

445
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,280
W-Why?

446
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,560
The freedom of the press
authorized me.

447
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,880
The freedom of the press, huh?

448
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,160
She has her privacy.

449
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,160
You’ve infringed

450
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
on her privacy.

451
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,520
What are you doing?

452
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,080
I’ll delete them.

453
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,480
Don’t touch me.

454
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,400
I’ll call the cops
if you don’t let go.

455
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,800
Will you let go?

456
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,020
(Xing Kelei)

457
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,060
(Mi Ka)

458
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,480
Hello?

459
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I’ll delete the photos.

460
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,100
(Deleting photos)

461
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,820
(Deleting photos)

462
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,160
I know it’s your job

463
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,200
and your life mustn’t be easy.

464
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,520
It’s fine you spread rumors
at ordinary times,

465
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,880
but she’s sick

466
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,720
and hospitalized.

467
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,560
You come here to do harm to her.

468
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,360
Isn’t it too much?

469
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,440
Please go away.

470
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,280
Are you OK?

471
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,920
Come on, I’ll take you to the ward.

472
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,000
Hello?

473
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,600
This is a private ward.

474
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,520
Not many people are here,

475
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
but the paparazzi can still catch you.

476
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,560
Ask a caretaker to accompany you

477
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,440
next time when you go to the garden.

478
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,880
It’s OK.

479
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,600
They’re now still interested in me,

480
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,760
soon,

481
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,680
no paparazzo will come.

482
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,040
Your name is...

483
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,680
I’m Mi Ka.

484
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,000
You’re in a much better state now.

485
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,920
What else can I do?

486
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,680
I’m already replaced.

487
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,200
My agent told me

488
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,480
that they replaced me
with someone new.

489
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
Dr. Mi,

490
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,880
look at the sunset.

491
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,560
Is it beautiful?

492
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,280
Yeah.

493
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,040
But it’s getting dark.

494
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,520
Beautiful things never last long.

495
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,000
When I wasn’t famous,

496
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,880
I got replaced very often.

497
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,760
I thought when I was famous,

498
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,080
it would be different,

499
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,720
but God has played a joke on me.

500
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,560
I’m a first-tier celebrity, but so what?

501
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,040
When the show is over,

502
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,400
the audience will leave eventually.

503
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,200
But as long as you’re alive,

504
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,480
there’s hope.

505
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,280
I know my body

506
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,520
and that the tumor

507
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,760
is in my spinal nerves.

508
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,120
It can’t be cleared.

509
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,120
If I’m unlucky,

510
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,520
I will be staying in bed

511
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,960
for the rest of my life.

512
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,720
Yes,

513
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,640
your astrocytoma

514
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,160
is infiltrative.

515
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,760
It can’t be entirely removed

516
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,840
in order to protect your nerves.

517
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
No doctor can

518
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,040
tell you that

519
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,520
it’s risk-free.

520
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,440
But your doctor

521
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
is the best

522
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,000
neurosurgeon.

523
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,680
He’ll minimize the risk.

524
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,200
Even if I agree to an operation,

525
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,360
so what?

526
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,760
My disease will relapse.

527
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,800
Am I supposed to have my spine

528
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,280
cut and stitched

529
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,280
over and over again?

530
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,960
What if it’s a benign tumor?

531
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,240
If it is,

532
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,720
it can be controlled using drugs.

533
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,840
It is too large now.

534
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,640
With it compressing your nerves,

535
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,360
you can’t stand due to the pain.

536
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,040
So, we need an operation
as soon as possible

537
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,080
to identify its nature.

538
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,280
Feifei,

539
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,640
sometimes, you only

540
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,000
get one chance in life.

541
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,320
If you miss it, then that’s it.

542
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,400
Paraplegia,

543
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,720
incontinence of urine and feces,

544
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,880
and surviving on machines.

545
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,200
Sometimes, I think

546
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,640
instead of going through
the miseries, why don’t I...

547
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,920
At least my dignity
as a human remains.

548
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,400
But you can’t give up

549
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,160
even there’s only a bit of hope.

550
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,640
Let me show you a picture.

551
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,240
This is a good friend of mine.

552
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,040
Her name is Ye Xiaoman,

553
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,680
Stage 3 glioblastoma.

554
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,320
She’s had several

555
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,520
craniotomies.

556
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,840
Once, she told me that

557
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,800
it was super, super, super painful,

558
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,360
but she still wasn’t willing
to leave this world.

559
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,040
Because she said

560
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,120
being able to breathe

561
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,840
was a wonderful thing.

562
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,440
How is she doing?

563
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,960
She’s hospitalized

564
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,760
in a medical academy abroad.

565
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,560
Maybe she can’t

566
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,920
live 30 or 40 years,

567
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,360
but at least a decade or
a couple of years

568
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,120
are fine.

569
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,960
Who decides

570
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,520
the lifespan of a person?

571
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,600
God?

572
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,760
But we didn’t do anything

573
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,400
to upset God.

574
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,920
Why us?

575
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,400
What beats you down the most

576
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,720
as a doctor?

577
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,320
You realize despite all the knowledge

578
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,400
that you’ve learned,

579
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,680
in the end,

580
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,040
you can’t overcome

581
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,400
something called fate.

582
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
A teacher of mine told me that

583
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,000
what beats us doctors down the most

584
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,840
is that despite all the knowledge
that we’ve learned,

585
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,440
we can’t overcome

586
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,120
something called fate.

587
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,760
But you have to fight back.

588
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,520
It slaps you in the face

589
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,080
and then you’re going to lie down?

590
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,080
Perhaps if you fight hard enough,

591
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,720
it’ll stop

592
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,360
torturing us.

593
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Maybe that’s what it means

594
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,160
to be a doctor.

595
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,320
To fight against fate along with
the patients.

596
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,160
To bargain with it.

597
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,080
It can’t hammer us down the ground

598
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,520
with one hit.

599
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,200
The sun is going down

600
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,800
on our side.

601
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,680
But on the other side of Earth,

602
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,360
the sun is just about

603
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,400
to come out in many places.

604
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,520
Chen Tao.

605
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,000
Chen Tao.

606
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,120
Why do you avoid me at the sight of me?

607
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,160
No. I didn’t see you.

608
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:14,800
You...

609
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,440
Are you going to say something to me?

610
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,520
Yanshan, you...

611
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,480
Wait.

612
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,720
Hello, mom.

613
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,120
I’m off work.

614
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,440
I’m coming to pick you up.

615
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,200
Wait for me.

616
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,360
What did you say?

617
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,520
Nothing.

618
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,280
Nothing?

619
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,520
Well, I’m off. Bye-bye.

620
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,760
Bye-bye.

621
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,640
What are you looking at?
She’s gone.

622
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,400
If I were you,

623
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,600
I’d tell her directly.

624
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,000
If she says yes, we’ll be together.
If not, I will change a target.

625
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,080
What should I tell her?

626
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,480
I’m not an expert.

627
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,680
I even haven’t got the entry ticket.

628
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,740
(Treatments for astrocytoma)

629
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,800
Hey, you’ve been staring at

630
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,600
the screen for half an hour.

631
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,560
What’s on your mind?

632
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,280
Nothing.

633
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,560
Sorry, mine.

634
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,920
Whose message are you waiting for?

635
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,040
Shu Wenbo?

636
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,840
I asked him out several times,

637
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,040
but he never replied.

638
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,800
Xing Kelei told me that

639
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,680
they are having an experience exchange

640
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,920
with another team,

641
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,000
so, they’re quite busy.

642
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,560
Did Xing Kelei send you

643
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,800
WeChat messages?

644
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,520
Yeah.

645
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,600
Well?

646
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,200
A man doesn’t contact you

647
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,320
for one reason.

648
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,840
That is, he just doesn’t
want to contact you.

649
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,840
You actually got a point.

650
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,120
But weren’t you

651
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,760
pretty close

652
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,600
at the earthquake region?

653
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,640
What happened?

654
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,360
I want to know, too.

655
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
I also think we

656
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,680
were pretty close at that time.

657
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,120
I thought he’d treat me differently

658
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,120
when we got back.

659
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,520
And now this!

660
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,680
You can ask him.

661
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,560
You were quite straightforward

662
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,160
in previous relationships,

663
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,680
weren’t you?

664
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,000
I think

665
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,440
that maybe every girl

666
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,440
will become unsure

667
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,920
and insecure

668
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,440
after meeting her hero.

669
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,560
I was straightforward

670
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,160
and imprudent. Why?

671
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,400
I didn’t care too much

672
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,240
about the relationships.

673
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,720
I’m timid now

674
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,720
because I don’t want to
end the relationship out of impulse.

675
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,440
Come here.

676
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,520
You pity me?

677
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,600
Do you think

678
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,080
I was too heartless

679
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,640
when breaking up with my exes?

680
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,040
It’s comeuppance.

681
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,720
Comfort you, and hug you.

682
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,440
I’m not used

683
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,760
to your behavior.

684
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,680
Xing Kelei taught you this, right?

685
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,000
No.

686
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,400
I let him lean on my shoulder.

687
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,200
You still act like a dude

688
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,560
when you’re with your boyfriend?

689
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,720
When he needs me,

690
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,560
I protect him.

691
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,640
Just like how I protect you.

692
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,520
What’s wrong?

693
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,800
Your chuckle means something.

694
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,200
What do you mean? Say it.

695
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,480
Be honest,

696
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,560
what stage are you at?

697
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,040
Have you kissed?

698
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,670
No.

699
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,190
No?!

700
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,880
Luo Ting.

701
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,400
Too slow.

702
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,400
All right, training is over.

703
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,320
Dismissed.

704
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,000
Captain Xing,

705
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,960
you’re going out at this time?

706
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,320
I’ll be right back. See you later.

707
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,840
If he intends to kiss you,

708
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,440
he’ll hint.

709
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,120
You must read his hints.

710
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,960
OK, OK.

711
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,720
You...

712
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,120
F-For example?

713
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,640
Look at me.

714
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,760
At first,

715
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,640
he’ll lean very close to you.

716
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,400
So close that you can

717
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,440
feel each other’s breath.

718
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,400
-I know.
-And then,

719
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,320
he’ll gaze at you affectionately.

720
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,800
You… You don’t have to demonstrate, OK?

721
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,040
-I… I understand.
-I need to teach you.

722
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,520
-I understand what you’re saying.
-I need to teach you.

723
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,960
Look at me.

724
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,200
And then,

725
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,720
he’ll lift your chin

726
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,560
and his nose will point up.

727
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,040
Aren’t you tired?

728
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,960
And then,

729
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,160
you, too, lift your chin,

730
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,320
keep your nose upward.

731
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:50,960
And...

732
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,280
Oh, you know you need
to close your eyes, huh?

733
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,760
Dummy.

734
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,720
Remember, you must...

735
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,880
For your first kiss,

736
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,560
you must wait for him

737
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,000
to kiss you, OK?

738
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,440
And

739
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,120
before you kiss,

740
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,800
you can’t eat smelly food.

741
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,320
I got it.

742
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,520
Got it?

743
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,560
Yeah, since you learn it,

744
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
let’s practice.

745
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,320
Idiot.

746
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,800
Xia, come on.

747
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,480
Xia...

748
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,240
Wait.

749
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,040
Xing... Xing Kelei.

750
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,840
What does he say?

751
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,760
He… He’s downstairs.

752
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,000
Go. Quickly, go.

753
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,560
I’m going to change my clothes.

754
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,280
See you around.

755
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:31,800
I...

756
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,640
I won’t see you off.

757
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,520
Do you have to rub more salt
into my wound?

758
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,520
I’ve got one and half an hour

759
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,360
before I go back to the force.

760
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,560
Let’s make it quick.

761
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,080
I’ll say first.

762
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,120
Uh,

763
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,120
I miss you.

764
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,280
I miss you, too.

765
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,000
One and half an hour.

766
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
I know where to go. Come.

767
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,160
W-Where are we going?

768
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,120
I came all the way

769
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,120
to eat this?

770
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,600
You still have to drive back,

771
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,800
so, you only got about one hour.

772
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,680
You’d be gone when
the dishes are served.

773
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,000
What can I eat here?

774
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,920
You have no clue. Come here.

775
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,360
I’ve got a special trick.

776
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,480
This tastes good.

777
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,720
Roasted chicken thigh rice ball.

778
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,800
If you ask me,

779
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,920
it’s Michelin-starred

780
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,760
rice ball.

781
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,640
Two rice balls.

782
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,360
And...

783
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,800
And fizzy water.

784
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,040
This one.

785
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,560
Hi, check out.

786
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,200
Hi.

787
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
And clear-soup Oden.

788
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,080
OK.

789
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,200
Please microwave

790
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,040
the two rice balls for us.

791
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,840
OK, please wait.

792
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,440
Let me give you a brief introduction.

793
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,600
We often miss our meals

794
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,960
because of operations,

795
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,000
so,

796
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,160
I’m very familiar

797
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,960
with these stuff.

798
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,280
It doesn’t taste oily

799
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,400
after it’s microwaved.

800
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,760
And clear soup is always

801
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,480
fresher than red soup.

802
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,520
Taste it.

803
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,080
It does taste good.

804
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,160
How old are you?

805
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,920
You still make a mess.

806
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,280
Xing Kelei,

807
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,560
let me ask you a question.

808
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,880
When we first met,

809
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,480
I

810
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,960
cried so hard

811
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,440
that my snot ran out.

812
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,560
Then we met for the second time,

813
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,960
I was a mess and looked dumb.

814
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,360
What do you like about me?

815
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,360
Everything about you.

816
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,160
Keyao?

817
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,560
-Night running?
-Night running?

818
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,960
My girlfriend.

819
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,160
“OK” what?

820
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,800
She’s my girlfriend. I mean it.

821
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,320
No one says you don’t mean it.

822
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,640
Xing Kelei,

823
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,120
come here.

824
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,920
Although our family

825
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,440
is open-minded,

826
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,920
we still need to

827
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,080
stick with the rules.

828
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,400
Xing Kelei will have a girlfriend

829
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,240
who is a normal person.

830
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,150
Keyao…

831
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,160
Alright, enough.

832
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,480
The entire world

833
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,320
knows you’re in a relationship now.

834
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,960
Go there.

835
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,640
Take your girlfriend home next time

836
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,120
and introduce her formally.

837
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,440
Yes.

838
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,880
Keep eating.

839
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,360
I won’t buy anything.

840
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,360
What do you want to eat?
I’ll buy some for you.

841
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,640
Whatever.

842
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,680
What was she doing

843
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,000
out here at night?

844
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,560
That was one way to meet my family.

845
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,920
You’re officially my girlfriend.

846
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,160
I… I’m home.

847
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,200
Five minutes left.

848
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,600
How about we take a seat?

849
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,440
OK.

850
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,720
Um,

851
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,520
I gave you sunflowers last time,

852
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,560
and you said I thought your face is big,

853
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,920
so, I’ve specifically

854
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,320
chosen smaller ones

855
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,840
for you.

856
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,600
G-Good enough?

857
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,520
Very small face.

858
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,160
Thank you.

859
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,520
Is this the alarm?

860
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,120
Uh...

861
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,560
I need to go back.

862
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,280
Just… Just hurry back.

863
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,840
Let go of my hand

864
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,920
so that I can get off the car.

865
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,280
I-I-I have...

866
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,920
You haven’t let go of me.

867
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,000
I’m off, then.

868
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,760
OK.

869
