How about we sit for a while?

00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,080
OK.

24
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,640
Uh…

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,440
Last time you said
I chose sunflowers on purpose

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,560
because your face is big.

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,600
So I…

28
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,960
I specially picked

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,280
baby’s breath

32
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,480
Is this one OK?

33
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,280
They have really small “faces”..

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,920
Thank you.

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,200
Is this

36
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,000

up.

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
You may go back now.

41
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,520

Dr. Mi.

77
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,640
Chen Feifei went for Mr. Shao.

78
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,080
She agreed to have an operation.

79
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,040
Really?

80
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,600
What did you say to her?

81
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,640
I didn’t say anything.

82
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
Maybe she figured it out herself.

83
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,360
You’ve been looking good recently.

84
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,280
Is it for me?

85
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,120
Or else?

86
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,880
You treated me last time.

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,880
It’s a return.

88
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,440
Thank you, Mr. Shao.

89
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,440
-Mr. Shao.
-Yanshan.

90
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,640
Chen Feifei’s operation

91
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,240
is difficult.

92
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,840
Come and help with Mi Ka.

93
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,200
-OK.
-OK.

94
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,440
Feifei.

95
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,200
You have to do several check-ups

96
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,480
to prepare for the surgery.

97
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,400
Could you let me finish this?

98
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,280
This was

99
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,080
our reporting performance.

100
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,080
You can’t see me in the pictures.

101
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,720
I was just a supporting actor.

102
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,640
Have you ever watched a Yue opera?

103
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,480
So I made a right choice
of changing my career.

104
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,920
Modern people have a rapid pace of life.

105
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,720
Things that can catch on

106
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,080
bring stimulation

107
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,280
to senses.

108
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,960
This kind of local opera

109
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,680
can’t be understood by modern people.

110
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,400
I don’t think so.

111
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,240
If someone can let me

112
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,680
watch that earlier,

113
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,440
I think I will like it.

114
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,360
Let’s go.

115
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Let’s do check-ups.

116
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,260
(Xing Kelei: It’s getting cold.)

117
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
(Wear more clothes.)

118
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,200
Boyfriend?

119
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,720
The man you take a fancy to

120
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,400
should be an excellent man.

121
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,720
There used to be a man

122
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,520
treating me like this before.

123
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,040
How about now?

124
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,160
He’s left.

125
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,160
After I fell ill.

126
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,120
It’s weird.

127
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,400
We used to

128
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,040
be together all the time before.

129
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,640
One day I suddenly found

130
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,080
that I’ve never

131
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,440
seen him clearly.

132
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
You may get lucky.

133
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,040
I have a boyfriend.

134
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,440
Let me bring you good luck in love.

135
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,960
How can we cut a bit more

136
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,440
without destroying

137
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,120
the nerve?

138
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Absolutely impossible.

139
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,960
The spinal cord

140
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,440
is full of nerves

141
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
while astrocytoma

142
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,240
has infiltrative growth.

143
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,720
There is no way to cut it clearly.

144
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,320
Don’t think of anything now.

145
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,800
Just adhere to one principle.

146
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,840
Cut as much as you can

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,480
within the warning range of nerves.

148
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,520
Moreover, Mi Ka,

149
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,240
don’t overthink

150
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,280
before the operation.

151
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,800
Remember three words.

152
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,240
Try your best.

153
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,400
OK.

154
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,720
Let’s start now.

155
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,680
Scalpel.

156
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,680
Monopolar electrosurgery.

157
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,120
Milling cutter.

158
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,120
Micro-scissors.

159
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,360
I’m cutting off the emergency membrane

160
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,320
to find out the tumor location.

161
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,160
Tumor is found.

162
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,840
Microstripper.

163
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,080
Tumor pliers.

164
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,080
Sample is found.

165
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,800
Send it for rapid diagnosis.

166
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,680
Bipolar.

167
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,680
Tweezers.

168
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,120
We are doing the operation and waiting

169
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,600
for the outcome at the same time.

170
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,480
Hello.

171
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,720
We have the laboratory report.

172
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,480
It’s malignant astrocytoma.

173
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,640
OK.

174
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,720
We got the result.

175
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,800
It means

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
the tumor can’t be fully resected.

177
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,760
Go on.

178
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,240
Try to cut more

179
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,920
while remaining the function.

180
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,160
Yanshan.

181
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,720
Watch the SEP.

182
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Once the indicator drops

183
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,490
below 50%,

184
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,160
tell it to me.

185
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,240
Otherwise,

186
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,240
it will cause irreversible influence

187
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,760
on the patient’s spinal cord.

188
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,600
OK.

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,320
It’s to 45%.

190
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,560
No more cutting.

191
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,440
Ready for suture.

192
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,360
Chen Feifei is awake.

193
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,960
How is she?

194
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,600
She asked me to give you

195
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,520
this letter.

196
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,120
She was smiling

197
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,760
while giving me this letter.

198
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,120
You should imagine her smile

199
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,640
on reading this letter.

200
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,040
OK.

201
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,480
Dr. Mi.

202
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
When you are reading this letter,

203
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,800
I know it must be because

204
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,680
the operation result isn’t as our wish.

205
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,600
Please forgive me for using

206
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,160
the way of writing a letter to tell you

207
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
my decision of giving up the
follow-up treatment.

208
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,920
Please allow me to leave

209
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,040
this world decently

210
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,120
with my beauty.

211
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,440
I’m very grateful

212
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,600
to meet you

213
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,920
at the end of my life.

214
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,560
You told me to fight back against fate.

215
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,920
Yes.

216
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
It wants to torture me
and make me suffer.

217
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,040
I won’t.

218
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,800
I will try to pursue joy

219
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,600
in the rest of time.

220
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,880
No matter it’s a month or a day.

221
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,280
I will make it worthwhile.

222
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,400
Thank you, Dr. Mi.

223
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,360
What’s wrong?

224
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,840
I quit.

225
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,040
I’m tired.

226
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,240
Hey.

227
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,200
You just quit without sweating.

228
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,040
You asked me to come.

229
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,040
I asked you to come

230
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,000
with Xia.

231
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,760
It’s boring for me to practice with you.

232
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,320
I’ve told you many times

233
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
that the one she likes is Shu Wenbo.

234
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,120
Do you mean you are better

235
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,960
friend with Shu Wenbo?

236
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,200
I’m his friend too.

237
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,480
We are competing fairly.

238
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,760
It’s not a problem.

239
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,600
Fine.

240
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
Except for sending me
the wedding invitation card,

241
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,280
don’t ask me for anything

242
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,920
between Mi Ka and you.

243
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,640
You just need to give the whip-round.

244
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,920
Seems everything

245
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,880
is going well.

246
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,040
That’s fine.

247
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,480
It’s time to enter the next step.

248
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
Next?

249
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,080
What is it?

250
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,600
You don’t need to ask me.

251
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,760
Seems you need a spanking.

252
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,640
What are you doing?

253
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,800
Can we talk

254
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,920
about something without injury?

255
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,800
The next step for example.

256
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,960
Say it.

257
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,760
Have a trip.

258
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,040
Trip?

259
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,000
Yes.

260
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Only trip can bring you an opportunity.

261
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,240
What are you thinking about?

262
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,360
I’m saying only trip

263
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,120
can bring you an opportunity

264
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,600
to know each other better and see

265
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,640
if you can mutually make a compromise.

266
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,080
What are you thinking about?

267
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,400
Go to a home stay nearby.

268
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,760
Keep away from the hustle and bustle.

269
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,040
It can purify

270
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,070
your dirty spirit

271
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,000
and also help you understand life.

272
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,240
Right.

273
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,760
It’ll be Mi Ka’s birthday.

274
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,200
That’s just a perfect time.

275
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,350
I know a place

276
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,920
that is fit for birthday trip.

277
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,960
At the top of the mountains,

278
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,920
making a solemn pledge of love.

279
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,000
That’s wonderful.

280
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,680
You went with your ex-girlfriend?

281
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,400
No, ex-ex-girlfriend.

282
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,520
It also has honeymoon suites.

283
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,720
Order one-room or two?

284
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,360
It’s up to you.

285
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,720
Inviting is not as good as encountering.

286
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,080
How about

287
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,600
we invited Xia to go together?

288
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,800
What?

289
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,360
No way.

290
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,000
You are kicking down the ladder.

291
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,000
Mi Ka.

292
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,120
-Mr. Yi.
-Come here.

293
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,240
You are here for Mr. Shao?

294
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,000
No.

295
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
One of my friend

296
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,560
has a cardiac surgery in Renxin.

297
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,440
I’m here to see him.

298
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,360
I’ve been too busy recently.

299
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,080
I don’t have time

300
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
to study in your party.

301
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,600
We didn’t have a party lately.

302
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,440
Why?

303
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,200
You know

304
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,080
how busy you are.

305
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,840
And Xing Keyao

306
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,360
takes Shao Yuhan’s time

307
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
for advice on medical devices.

308
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,800
So he really doesn’t have any time.

309
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,400
Mr. Shao pays great attention

310
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,280
to Keyao’s business.

311
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,520
Of course.

312
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,000
They used to be lovers.

313
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,720
Oh, no.

314
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,960
You didn’t know

315
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,960
their relationship before?

316
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,720
I don’t know it.

317
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,240
Don’t let others know

318
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
I told you this.

319
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,400
Here is the thing

320
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,160
between them.

321
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,200
In my opinion,

322
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,640
maybe they’ve never

323
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,520
given up each other.

324
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,080
Or maybe it’s because they fell in love

325
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,120
with each other after meeting again.

326
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,600
They’d rather keep silent

327
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,280
than speaking it out.

328
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,480
They just think of it

329
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,200
without telling each other.

330
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,800
We are all very anxious about it.

331
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,200
I really want to push him forward.

332
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,980
(Xing Kelei)

333
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,640
You have a three-day holiday.

334
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,920
I’m also on the annual vacation.

335
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,280
Let’s go have a trip.

336
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,800
Mr. Yi.

337
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,200
Can you do me a favor?

338
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
And the honeymoon room.

339
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,440
One room or two?

340
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,920
Decide it yourself.

341
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,840
For two people,

342
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,760
two bedrooms

343
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,320
seem to be a bit extravagant.

344
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,160
If we order a one-bedroom house,

345
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,760
I can sleep on the sofa.

346
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,520
However, if it’s a one-bedroom house,

347
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
maybe she will

348
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,000
misunderstand me. Will she?

349
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,940
(Mi Ka: I booked a big house.)

350
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,940
(You don’t need to
book the accommodation.)

351
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,080
(Xing Kelei)
Why a big house for only two of us?

352
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,640
(Mi Ka: Someone else will go, too.)

353
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,520
Someone else?

354
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,840
(Xing Kelei)
Who is that?

355
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,980
(Mr. Shao)

356
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,720
Dr. Mi.

357
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,720
Patient of bed No. 3 isn’t good.

358
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,480
You’d better go take a look.

359
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,120
OK. Coming.

360
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,540
(Mi Ka: Mr. Shao)

361
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,520
Can you stop laughing?

362
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,240
Sorry.

363
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,280
I don’t mean it.

364
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,040
But it’s really funny.

365
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,320
Is Mr. Shao her family head

366
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,440
or her pet?

367
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,110
Why does she

368
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,320
always take him?

369
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,880
Can you tell me why?

370
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,920
We are dating.

371
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,120
But she takes Shao Yuhan with her.

372
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,040
I…

373
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,920
I don’t know. You can ask her.

374
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,960
I dare not.

375
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,760
It appears that I’m a stingy person.

376
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,720
You are not a generous man.

377
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,120
You said it yourself.

378
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,040
Two people should be frank

379
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,560
on being together.

380
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
You are unsatisfied with

381
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,560
her behaviors today, aren’t you?

382
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,840
Yes.

383
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,960
Send her the text and tell her.

384
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,640
Send it.

385
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,240
Timid?

386
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,120
Fine.

387
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,880
Why did you

388
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,920
decide to invite

389
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,080
unrelated people

390
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,280
without my permission?

391
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,480
Uh…

392
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,400
I still can’t.

393
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,000
Forget it.

394
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,280
What?

395
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,600
It’s sent.

396
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:18,920
You…

397
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,840
I’ve sent it.

398
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,560
Don’t send it. I…

399
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,760
Uh…

400
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,040
It can’t be withdrawn.

401
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,720
I’m screwed.

402
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,280
Restrain your grief.

403
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,640
Here you are.
Take a haw to steady nerves.

404
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,960
Are you tired?

405
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,280
Give it to me.

406
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,000
When girls get mad,

407
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,040
firstly,

408
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,560
she acts as if nothing were on her mind.

409
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,800
But she gives you the cold shoulder.

410
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,320
She must have been getting angry.

411
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,400
What do you want to eat tonight?

412
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,320
You make the arrangement.

413
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,840
It’s all OK for me.

414
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,520
Second,

415
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,360
she keeps silent.

416
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,800
When a girl gets mad,

417
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,480
she says nothing.

418
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,520
Pretending to be a dumb.

419
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,080
There is a symbolic action of girls

420
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
when they are extremely angry.

421
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,320
She will turn away

422
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
with her back to you.

423
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,840
It’s a serious problem.

424
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,760
It means she refuses to communicate.

425
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,960
Then what should I do?

426
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,400
Make an apology.

427
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,680
When a woman

428
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,240
gets mad,

429
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,520
it’s utterly unjustifiable.

430
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,960
You only need to apologize.

431
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,800
I didn’t mean

432
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,360
to blame.

433
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,880
I just want to ask

434
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,720
why you

435
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,920
invited Mr. Shao.

436
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
It’s we two…

437
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,200
Can I

438
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,480
take a nap?

439
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,480
I’m sleepy.

440
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,080
Silly girl!

441
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,280
She sleeps every time she takes my car.

442
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,360
Is she that relieved on being with me?

443
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,800
Right.

444
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,680
I’m her “uncle special police”.

445
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,360
I fell asleep again.

446
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,360
Every time when I am in your car,

447
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,880
it’s easy for me to fall asleep.

448
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,840
It means I am at ease

449
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,840
when I’m with you.

450
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,360
What’s the time?

451
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,440
10:30 p.m.

452
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,720
I’m too tired.

453
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,560
I had four operations today.

454
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,760
Why didn’t you awake me?

455
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
We agreed to watch the film together.

456
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,240
I think looking at you like this

457
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,880
is more interesting than watching film.

458
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,600
I didn’t check my phone
in the afternoon.

459
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,320
All…

460
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,480
The whole afternoon?

461
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,920
No.

462
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,960
Don’t check it.

463
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:35,950
No way.

464
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,790
What if I miss

465
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,240
-something important?
-No.

466
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,020
(Xing Kelei: Why did you decide)

467
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,010
(to invite unrelated people)

468
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,380
(without my permission?)

469
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,480
I… I didn’t mean that.

470
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,880
I was just…

471
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,160
I was just asking for it.

472
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,360
No blame on you.

473
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,920
I’m sorry.

474
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,760
I shouldn’t have made my own decision

475
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,920
of inviting so many people

476
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,360
to go with us.

477
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,080
Love is about two people.

478
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,760
I should have discussed with you.

479
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,360
The… So I…

480
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,200
You won’t get mad, will you?

481
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,760
No.

482
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,000
But it’s true that

483
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,920
there is a special reason.

484
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,680
Mr. Shao

485
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,320
must go with us.

486
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,040
Why?

487
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,080
It’s partly because of you.

488
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,760
Me?

489
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,720
Shao Yuhan is my sister’s ex-boyfriend.

490
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,520
See?

491
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
You don’t know it, either.

492
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,280
I just know she

493
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,520
used to date someone.

494
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,240
But…

495
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,880
I know why she didn’t date others.

496
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,080
So she still loves Mr. Shao.

497
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,720
According to Mr. Yi Qian,

498
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
I suppose

499
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,360
they both love each other.

500
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
Neither of them has forgotten the other.

501
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,720
It’s really a pity, right?

502
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,280
Then what to do?

503
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,000
I have the same vacation

504
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,760
with Mr. Shao.

505
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,240
I intend to ask Mr. Shao out.

506
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,720
You may ask your sister out by lying.

507
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,800
Then she will definitely

508
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,240
rip my skin out.

509
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,920
Don’t worry. I will sew it on for you.

510
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,160
Thank you.

511
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,320
I will also ask Xia to go with us.

512
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,840
We will have more people.

513
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,080
It won’t be that embarrassing.

514
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,320
It’s like a coincidence.

515
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,240
What’s your opinion?

516
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,320
Well.

517
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,920
I will sacrifice.

518
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,840
What for?

519
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,880
You are rubbing my sister the right way

520
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,680
for not being bullied

521
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,680
after we get married, right?

522
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,120
What will you do to bully me?

523
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,640
Not me.

524
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,840
But my sister.

525
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,880
Of course I won’t bully you.

526
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
If your sister bullies me,

527
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,240
won’t you help me?

528
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,680
That’s the problem?

529
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,640
-Answer it.
-No.

530
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,080
Answer me.

531
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,920
What are you thinking?

532
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,600
Give it to me.

533
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,440
Peel it.

534
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,600
Reporter Xia.

535
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,480
Nice to meet you!

536
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,200
Nice to meet you, too!

537
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,920
I’ve finished the video

538
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,920
for the earthquake rescue last time.

539
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,160
I took it to Captain Hao.

540
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,600
Thank you for your hard work.

541
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,200
Do we have to be

542
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,200
so polite?

543
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,960
You refused me lately
when I asked you out.

544
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,400
Very busy with work?

545
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,920
Yes, I’ve been busy.

546
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,760
But I think

547
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,040
you are avoiding me on purpose.

548
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,280
I am not.

549
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,000
The…

550
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,160
It’s Mi Ka’s birthday this weekend.

551
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,520
Xing Kelei asked us to go on holiday

552
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,760
with Mi Ka in a home stay.

553
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,680
Will you go?

554
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,240
I…

555
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,400
I asked Xing Kelei for it.

556
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,080
He said you have time.

557
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,880
If you don’t go,

558
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,560
it means you are avoiding me.

559
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,120
Why need I

560
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,920
avoid you?

561
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,800
Right,

562
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,920
why do you have to

563
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,920
avoid me on purpose?

564
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,240
Do you mean I’m

565
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,600
different in your eyes?

566
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,600
You are afraid of seeing me.

567
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,920
I’m not.

568
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,400
Then go there.

569
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,600
Remember it.

570
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,920
I will pick you up at the weekend.

571
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,760
If you don’t come,

572
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,840
I will misunderstand that

573
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,240
I’m different from others

574
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,400
for you.

575
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,970
One, two, three, four.

576
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,630
-One, two, three, four.
-Xia.

577
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,320
Here you are.

578
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,440
Get on the car.

579
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,600
What?

580
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,960
Safety belt.

581
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,440
Thank you.

582
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,800
Here you are.

583
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,240
What’s it?

584
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,680
Open it and take a look.

585
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,920
It’s not salty this time.

586
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,000
I’ve tasted it.

587
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,760
You are allergic to eggs.

588
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,360
You remember it?

589
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,560
It’s OK. Please don’t worry.

590
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,320
I just tasted a very little
with my tongue.

591
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,520
Your mother taught me about it.

592
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,760
My mom called you again?

593
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,000
What did she say?

594
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,600
A lot.

595
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,400
I will tell you in the future.

596
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,000
Thank you.

597
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,440
How did you persuade Keyao

598
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,360
to go with us

599
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,400
for the trip?

600
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,240
I told her that

601
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,600
you want to marry me very much

602
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,600
and will make a proposal.

603
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,040
So she agreed.

604
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,360
How can you

605
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,840
flatter yourself

606
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,520
in such a good way?

607
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,800
Shameless.

608
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,160
It’s only for you.

609
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,960
Laugh.

610
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,480
Why are you laughing?

611
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
How could you speak out that words?

612
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,080
(Chen Tao)
I heard it’s your birthday,

613
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,320
Happy birthday.

614
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,240
Don’t take me as being disloyal.

615
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,240
I have a secret.

616
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,880
Captain Xing asked me

617
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,000
to sign a package

618
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,840
valuing thousands yuan for him.

619
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,160
I guess it’s for you.

620
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
There must be a surprise

621
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,000
for your romantic journey.

622
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,600
Pay some attention to it.

623
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,120
What?

624
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,480
You really want to make a proposal?

625
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,160
Here they are.

626
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,200
Xia.

627
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,880
Let me help.

628
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,640
I will park my car here.

629
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Drive your car.

630
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:44,960
OK.

631
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,200
How did he

632
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,240
finally make the decision?

633
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,000
It’s hard at beginning, right?

634
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,600
I won’t tell you.

635
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
No.

636
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,200
It’s a meeting

637
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,520
for you

638
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,520
in the name of my birthday.

639
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,320
Changed your mind?

640
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,520
What are you saying?

641
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,120
You know what I’m saying.

642
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,600
Look, you are laughing.

643
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,840
Why should I laugh?

644
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,840
Look how happy you are.

645
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,040
Let’s go. Get on the car.

646
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,360
Will you sit here?

647
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,000
It’s for you.

648
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,200
What brings you here?

649
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
Yi Qian

650
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,720
said he ordered a holiday house

651
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,920
for me to have a trip.

652
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,040
Just now he called and said

653
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,120
he couldn’t come for his enteritis.

654
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,680
How about you? What brings you here?

655
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,200
For holiday.

656
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,200
Holiday?

657
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,720
Where are you living?

658
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,000
This house.

659
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,480
How about you?

660
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,480
Yi Qian told me

661
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,400
it’s over against here.

662
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,160
They are coming.

663
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,960
They asked you to come?

664
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,600
What a coincidence!

665
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,720
Mr. Shao, you…

666
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,480
What brings you here?

667
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,360
Yi Qian asked me to come.

668
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,240
Then where is he?

669
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,520
You don’t know?

670
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,640
I don’t know.

671
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,400
He isn’t feeling well.

672
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,920
He doesn’t feel well?

673
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,240
Mr. Yi said he would

674
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,600
come here for holiday with us.

675
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,480
And we ordered

676
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,880
a whole house.

677
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,560
You are so familiar with Yi Qian?

678
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,960
You even invited him for your birthday.

679
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,960
No. He heard it on that day.

680
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,920
And we agreed to come together.

681
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,600
It’s lively with more people.

682
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,440
It’s coincidence.

683
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,480
Xing Kelei, don’t hit me.

684
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,800
It’s really a coincidence.

685
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,360
It’s fate, right?

686
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,160
Yes. It’s fate.

687
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,810
Fate.

688
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,220
-Look the hair of you two.
-Fate.

689
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,920
It’s fate.

690
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,600
Let’s go take the suitcases.

691
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,680
You may get in first.

692
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,120
It’s OK. We can wait.

693
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,920
It’s really nice.

694
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,200
It’s large and bright.

695
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,840
Look.

696
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,840
It looks nice.

697
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,560
Yes.

698
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,320
We can fish here.

699
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,120
There are four rooms.

700
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,800
One for Wenbo and I.

701
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,040
One for Mi Ka and Xia.

702
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,960
I’ll take it.

703
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,680
And you…

704
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,000
One for each?

705
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
I don’t care.

706
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,280
OK.

707
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,200
Thank you.

708
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,520
You don’t care?

709
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,080
Go anywhere at will in the afternoon.

710
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,240
I will make you dishes tonight.

711
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,160
OK. Keyao?

712
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,920
OK. You never cook at home.

713
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,080
There are many interesting things here.

714
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,960
There are bicycles built for two,

715
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,520
and also a land for vegetable growing.

716
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,240
-For two?
-What land?

717
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,240
There are also manors here.

718
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,360
You may walk around.

719
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,000
OK.

720
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,400
I will take the things back.

721
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,320
Let me help.

722
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,440
For two. Four legs.

723
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,520
I feel I’m destined

724
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,320
with your brother.

725
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,820
(Wenbo’s Mom)

726
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,000
Hello, Mrs. Shu.

727
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,400
How is it?

728
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,320
Did he agree?

729
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,200
I’ve told you.

730
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,920
My silly son

731
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
is a riddle.

732
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,680
He needs to be reminded

733
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,040
before he knows what to do.

734
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,760
If he likes you,

735
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,520
I can tell by having a look at it.

736
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,160
It won’t lie.

737
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,240
Qingxia.

738
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,080
Remember it.

739
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,080
He always ran

740
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,240
everywhere in our village

741
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,720
since his childhood.

742
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,160
Hit on what he likes

743
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,400
to force him to accept.

744
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,880
OK.

745
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,520
I see, Mrs. Shu.

746
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,200
I really like you.

747
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,360
You are the one.

748
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,440
I’m waiting for you to call me mother.

749
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:22,880
I see.

750
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,640
See you, Mrs. Shu.

751
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,600
Are you ready?

752
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,400
Xia.

753
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,640
Where

754
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,320
are your purple high-heeled shoes?

755
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,400
I’m going hiking.

756
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,640
The air here is nice.

757
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,360
Go hiking?

758
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,280
It’s a big sunny day.

759
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,680
Aren’t you afraid of being tanned?

760
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,920
No.

761
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,560
I like to go hiking.

762
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,360
Do you

763
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,680
need someone to accompany you?

764
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,680
Will you go?

765
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,280
OK. I will take something for it.

766
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,120
I’m waiting here.

767
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,920
OK.

768
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
Nice.

769
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,520
You turned the corner.

770
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,160
What’s wrong?

771
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,360
Are you tired?

772
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,640
No.

773
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,960
I often go hiking.

774
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,200
For going hiking,

775
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
shoes are very important.

776
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,680
Yours are a bit tough.

777
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,800
It will rub the feet.

778
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,760
It’s best to wear hiking shoes.

779
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,760
It will make you comfortable

780
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,640
on walking.

781
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,840
I don’t think my shoes are bad.

782
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,480
You shoes…

783
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,920
Quickly.

784
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,360
Your shoes don’t have a problem.

785
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,000
Let’s go.

786
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,960
Don’t tell me it’s a coincidence.

787
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,480
That’s a coincidence.

788
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,000
Do you have a lot of free time?

789
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,280
What is it in your mind?

790
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,000
Sunset glow.

791
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,120
Late-life love.

792
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,040
It’s no big deal. Just have a try.

793
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,400
That’s not sunset glow.

794
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,160
Mi Ka.

795
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,560
Mr. Shao.

796
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,160
Let’s go buy something.

797
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
There are a lot. Do we still need more?

798
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,200
We have a lot here.

799
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,480
But you didn’t buy anything

800
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,720
I want to eat.

801
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,120
What…

802
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,640
What’s it?

803
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,080
I forgot the sea-ear.

804
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,800
Answer me.

805
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,960
How’s your enteritis?

806
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
It’s Yi Qian.

807
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,120
There are so many things here.

808
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,800
Let me help you.

809
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
Yes. Put it here.

810
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,310
OK.

811
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,920
What did I say just now?

812
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
Buy some sea-ear.

813
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,920
God.

814
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,200
Only the sea food and poultry now.

815
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
Oh my God!

816
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,600
Is it too obvious?

817
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,640
Yes.

818
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,800
But we are creating

819
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,880
opportunities for them.

820
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,920
What will we do?

821
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,680
Take some pictures.

822
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,240
Do you have the phone with you?

823
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,000
No.

824
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,520
Then…

825
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,800
Let’s go for a drive.

826
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,880
No key to car too.

827
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,040
Why are we so pitiful?

828
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,440
Just

829
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,680
