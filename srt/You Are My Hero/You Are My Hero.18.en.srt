20

Gosh,

21
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,920
how does she live her life?

22
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,720
I’ve done so much already,

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,920
why don’t I do a full clean-up?

24
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,240
The time is just right.

25
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,720
(Chen Tao)
Captain Xing, my message is incorrect,

26
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,320
Mi Ka is on night duty tonight.

27
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,880
Chen Xiaoyan from our office

28
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,720
made her change the shift.

29
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,200
What a coincidence, huh?

30
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,560
Bro,

31
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,120
why do you cut the perfect steak

32
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,080
into pieces for hotpot?

33
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,560
Because I want no more steak with you.

34
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,000
Brilliant.

35
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,200
To put it simply,

36
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,840
someone tried too hard

37
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,040
and got stood up.

38
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,960
Because I took

39
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,200
someone’s bull-crap for it.

40
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,080
I thought you didn’t want my advice.

41
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,720
I told you to

42
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,830
be patient.

43
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,640
You just couldn’t wait.

44
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,390
You’ve broken my golden rule

45
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,440
of chasing girls.

46
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,560
Three days later,

47
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
please come back for a second check.

48
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Thank you, doctor.

49
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,040
Mi Ka,

50
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,840
I’m back.

51
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,120
I thought you were at the concert.

52
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,280
I don’t even want to talk about it.

53
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
The concert

54
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,000
was canceled due to force majeure.

55
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,480
What about you?

56
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,720
What about me?

57
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,960
Here I am, back to duty.

58
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,360
You can’t keep working nonstop

59
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,040
for 24 hours.

60
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,990
I’m OK.

61
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,280
I’ve got nothing to do, actually.

62
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,680
Go home.

63
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,000
Or you’d have arrhythmia.

64
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,320
OK, I’ll leave it to you.

65
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,520
I’m off.

66
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,170
OK.

67
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,030
Be safe.

68
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,840
OK, bye-bye.

69
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,080
What do you like about Mi Ka?

70
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,760
She’s at the hospital every day,

71
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,880
touching formalin.

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,000
When she sees a person,

73
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,480
she sees their internal organs.

74
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,920
You know what,

75
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,800
I like her because

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,640
she probably

77
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,560
has seen my heart.

78
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,960
Is she pretty?

79
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,080
She looks cute but kind of dumb.

80
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,720
Her disposition?

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
Xia totally beats her.

82
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,280
I think she’s quite pretty

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
and very graceful.

84
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,040
Who is that?

85
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,000
The red wine that I ordered.

86
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,000
You didn’t cancel it?

87
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,880
You’re paying, why would I cancel it?

88
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,580
Coming.

89
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,520
Mi Ka.

90
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,640
What card?

91
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,960
Can’t you pay via Alipay?

92
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,160
Captain Xing,

93
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,040
is this the kind of grace

94
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,600
that you talked about?

95
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,240
Dr. Mi,

96
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,120
you’ve been sewing wounds all day long,

97
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,800
did you wash your hands?

98
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,360
Mind your language.

99
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,840
It’s none of your business.

100
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,090
Guys,

101
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,080
who can sign for the package?

102
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,100
-Me.
-This guy.

103
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,560
I’m not an idiot.

104
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,360
Now that I’m not needed,

105
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,280
I’ll be off.

106
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,320
You owe me a nice dinner.

107
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,840
H-Have you had dinner?

108
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,240
Uh, I’ve boiling a hotpot in my house

109
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,240
and no one’s accompanying me.

110
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,320
How about

111
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,200
we have dinner together?

112
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,800
OK.

113
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,640
Please-please wait for me.

114
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,120
I need to go to the bathroom.

115
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,760
OK.

116
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,920
W-Where is Keyao?

117
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
She, uh, she’s on a business trip.

118
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,800
Are you feeling better?

119
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,440
Yes.

120
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,640
My cast will soon be removed.

121
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,720
Come to me if you feel uncomfortable.

122
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,040
I have something to ask you.

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,680
When did you recognize me?

124
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,040
When you stopped the car, I guess.

125
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,200
So when...

126
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,480
When did you start
having feelings for me?

127
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,000
The first time we met.

128
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,560
So why were you so hard on me

129
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,520
during the training?

130
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
I wasn’t hard on you.

131
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
I was a bit

132
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,360
stricter with you than usual.

133
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,160
That’s how I feel assured

134
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,600
once I’m not around you.

135
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,260
Let’s have dinner.

136
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,800
Um,

137
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,960
I thought you were on duty tonight.

138
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,040
Chen Xiaoyan didn’t need

139
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,120
a change of shift all of a sudden.

140
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,800
You said you

141
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,640
got something to do, right?

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,920
Canceled?

143
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,440
Here’s the thing,

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,040
I wanted to give you a surprise.

145
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,320
So I told you that I wouldn’t come back.

146
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,840
While in fact, I prepared

147
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,120
this candlelight dinner.

148
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,840
Look at the ingredients.

149
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,120
I was going to make steaks.

150
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,120
But you don’t look very disappointed.

151
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,280
I would.

152
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,400
The whole day,

153
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,760
I’d been telling everyone that

154
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,640
I couldn’t change my shift,

155
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,520
but then it hit me that

156
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,800
the nature of your job is special

157
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,400
and you might have emergent missions,

158
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,080
so I didn’t get my hopes too high.

159
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,760
For example, if I was

160
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,360
needed by ER right before

161
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
I got off work,

162
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,800
I wouldn’t get to leave, either.

163
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,640
So

164
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,600
this is the first time

165
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,720
I’m in a formal relationship,

166
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,760
1-  I don’t really know how to
express myself.

167
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,880
Right.

168
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,960
Me too.

169
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,600
Me too.

170
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,320
This is the first time for me.

171
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,720
So let’s not prepare

172
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
surprises for each other.

173
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,440
Because it’s prone to disappointment.

174
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,600
Yeah, that’s not cool.

175

Hello.

Sir, your package.

177
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,280
No one’s at home?

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,640
Wait a sec.

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,680
Sorry, your address is wrong.

180
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,440
I’ve been knocking
on that door for ages.

181
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,840
Sorry.

182
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,040
What gift should I give her?

183
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,880
(Detailed Images)
Rose?

184
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,800

186
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,520
No, no.

187
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,360

It seems OK.

188
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,840
Uh...

189
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,720
Uh...

190
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,280

191

192
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,080
Thank you.

193
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,840
I don’t think rose

194
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,760
or carnation

195
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,760

No, no.

No.

201
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,760
Because...

202
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,960
Because of warmth.

203
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,080
No.

one thing has caused your smile,

dopamine.

Such neurotransmitter

In order to work in the ER,

I got videos for you.

330
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,120
After you learn the tricks,

331
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,320
you can conjure flowers for girls.

332
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,920

You have my admiration.

335
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,000
I’ve dealt with all the registered
patients, right?

336
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,400
Anyone in the line?

337
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,960
What’s your problem?

338
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,160
It’s a good thing.

339
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,560
It means people are fine,

340
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,720
everything is OK.

341
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,120
Yes.

342

When the bottles are empty,

345
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
you’re allowed to eat dinner.

346
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,960
Got it?

347
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,880
Got it.

348
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,240
All right, you’re dismissed.

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,120
there’s too much water.

351
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,550
Hey!

352
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,880
Mi Ka.

353
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,280
Dr. Wei.

354
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,320
What are you thinking

355
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,000
on your own?

356
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,960
Have you eaten anything?

357
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,560
No. I’m not hungry.

358
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,000
Thanks.

359
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,760
An emergency operation

360
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,320
may require you to stand for five hours.

361
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,680
You need strength.

362
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,320
Yes.

363
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,800
Thank you, Dr. Wei.

364
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,560
You’re welcome.

365
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,520
I’ve got loads of this.

366
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,080
Not just for the energy bar.

367
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,040
I mean everything.

368
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,240
I’ve learned so much from you in the ER.

369
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,080
In the ER,

370
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,240
we may face

371
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,200
vital moments every day

372
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,400
and many unreasonable patients.

373
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,200
And no patient is expecting

374
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,960
to see a doctor in a fluster.

375
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,160
So I now know that

376
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,160
other than medical skills,

377
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,600
strong mentality

378
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,640
and strain capacity

379
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,920
are the basis of

380
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,400
becoming a qualified doctor.

381
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,680
On my first day in the ER,

382
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,280
I saw a boy

383
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,880
die of food allergy

384
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,160
with my eyes.

385
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,920
That was the first time I cried
in the ER

386
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,960
and the last time.

387
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,960
A doctor said to me,

388
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,960
when in the ER,

389
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,440
you need to learn to

390
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,720
control your emotions

391
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,840
because if you can’t,

392
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,520
your patient will panic.

393
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,800
The patients don’t need

394
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,280
your tears

395
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,160
but your help.

396
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,080
In every doctor’s heart,

397
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,840
there are both sunlight and a graveyard.

398
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,440
All the patients in the ER

399
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,440
are basically

400
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,520
at the doorstep of death.

401
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,840
The ER

402
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,920
may not be

403
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,880
the most academic department,

404
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,080
but it’s about life and death.

405
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,240
We must observe

406
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
the patients’ vital signs closely

407
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,520
so that they get to be transferred

408
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,240
and treated by other specialists.

409
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,360
But doctors don’t decide

410
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,320
whether a person lives or dies,

411
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,720
we can only

412
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,040
do our best.

413
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,400
Do our best.

414
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,440
I’ll remember these words

415
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,480
forever.

416
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,000
Dr. Shao.

417
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,520
Speak of the devil.

418
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,800
Am I the devil?

419
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,640
Yes.

420
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,200
We’re chatting about your

421
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,640
inglorious histories in the ER.

422
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,290
I’m off.

423
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,160
What were you talking about?

424
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,680
Dr. Shao,

425
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,080
you also worked in the ER before?

426
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,800
Just like you,

427
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,320
I was temporarily transferred
to the ER.

428
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,120
You were scheduled. Made any trouble?

429
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,920
1:20 PM.

430
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,240
Uh, I’m going back to work.

431
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,900
Come in.

432
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,280
You’re back even on leave.

433
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,000
You’re going to live here?

434
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,560
The competition is in six months,

435
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
I have to come.

436
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,600
You lack confidence in

437
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,640
yourself

438
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,400
or the boys?

439
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,960
I’m very confident.

440
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,400
But I can be confident

441
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,280
and work hard at the same time.

442
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,640
I made a right choice to

443
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,560
appoint you as the leader.

444
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,920
You mustn’t

445
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,860
disappoint me.

446
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,520
Trust me.

447
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,240
As for the participants

448
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,160
that Tiger will send,

449
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,880
you and Wenbo work hard on it.

450
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,440
Give me a plan

451
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,520
and training strategies.

452
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,400
OK.

453
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,430
Listen,

454
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,840
you don’t need to worry about

455
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,720
the special police exchange.

456
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,680
Your arm is still not recovered,

457
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,160
leave it to Wenbo.

458
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,100
But

459
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,200
you need to give technical advice.

460
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,960
I got it.

461
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,010
(Training project)
Windmill target strengthens

462
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,990
(Training members)
not only mentality

463
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,980
but also eyesight.

464
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,000
We can focus more on that.

465
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,280
We can combine it with real-combat

466
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,960
special drill in Tire Room,

467
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,160
which relieves the team members

468
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,200
of exhaustion in the training.

469
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,520
Have you got a name list?

470
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,640
I have.

471
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,280
Li Nian isn’t focused

472
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,360
but he’s got a good body.

473
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,040
He can participate in the
comprehensive physical competition.

474
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,560
Wenjing, rifles and pistols.

475
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,080
Luo Ting studies kickboxing,

476
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,000
so he’ll do that.

477
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,600
What about snipe competition?

478
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,560
Xiaochao was transferred,

479
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,840
so I’ll have to do that.

480
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,040
You?

481
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,960
Two guns a time.

482
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,480
Who’s your assistant shooter?

483
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,600
You.

484
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
We take turns.

485
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,680
Don’t want to?

486
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,240
It was two years ago

487
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,160
since the last time we cooperated.

488
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,080
But we won the first place

489
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,600
and we’ll win again this time.

490
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,480
Right.

491
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,400
Consider it’s done.

492
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,120
Are you available this week?

493
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,280
I got a lot of your photos here,

494
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,760
will you make copies?

495
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,840
We’re living in a high-tech world,

496
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,480
and she wants you to go make copies.

497
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
She just wants to see you.

498
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,120
Xia and I are just friends.

499
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,320
You can be more than friends.

500
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,600
I’ll go get the guns.

501
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,720
See you at the drill ground.

502
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,960
Are you going to be single forever?

503
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
(Shu Wenbo)

504
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
I’m busy this week,

505
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
please compress the files

506
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,720
and email it to me.

507
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,800
You seem upset.

508
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,280
The screen would crack.

509
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,680
Jogging?

510
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,680
I’m on a treadmill,

511
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,800
what do you think I’m doing?

512
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,400
Having snacks?

513
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,200
Uh-oh.

514
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,440
Bad luck for me.

515
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,360
Someone’s got turned down.

516
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,680
I know that

517
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,440
you like Shu Wenbo

518
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,240
but he doesn’t seem to like you back.

519
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,640
None of your business.

520
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,440
I just want to rescue you.

521
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,000
Why are you so persistent?

522
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,440
If you ask me,

523
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,840
I think girls should be all princesses,

524
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,320
waiting to be chased by men.

525
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,840
Those who chase after men

526
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,200
don’t end well.

527
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,240
Are you trying to tell me that

528
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,840
you’re going to chase after me?

529
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,040
Yeah.

530
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,920
Clever.

531
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,560
You got it right.

532
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,960
So?

533
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,160
Will you go on a date with me?

534
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,740
No.

535
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,250
Hello.

536
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:02,880
Hi.

537
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
Uh, Caesar Salad.

538
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,320
Caesar Salad.

539
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,880
32 yuan.

540
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,780
Sir, hi.

541
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,120
Hello, is the seat taken?

542
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,120
Thanks.

543
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,320
What the girl ordered.

544
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,360
32 yuan.

545
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,200
What are you doing here?

546
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,120
Dining.

547
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,680
Must you dine here?

548
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,440
What?

549
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,840
Do you own the place?

550
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,200
Miss,

551
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,320
your salad.

552
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,880
Thank you.

553
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,840
Please enjoy.

554
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,440
Sir, your salad.

555
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,360
I honestly think that we can give
each other a shot.

556
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,520
Chill.

557
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,480
Thank you.

558
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,840
Don’t you think we hit it off?

559
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,960
No.

560
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,160
Look,

561
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,920
we both like the

562
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,320
same branch drip coffee,

563
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,120
the same comedy show.

564
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,320
You like skydiving,

565
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,280
I like diving.

566
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,200
In the future,

567
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,440
I climb the mountains with you

568
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,480
while you dive
deep into the sea with me.

569
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,640
We’re meant for each other.

570
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,040
I don’t want to dive
deep into the see with you.

571
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,640
We gotta try first.

572
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,360
We might fail after we try,

573
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,920
but if we don’t, we’ll never find out.

574
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,240
Take Shu Wenbo as an example.

575
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,160
You two haven’t even started yet,

576
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,840
so there’ll be no good ending
for you two.

577
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,800
So, what do you think?

578
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
No one has ever

579
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,080
turned me down.

580
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,200
M-Miss,

581
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,400
should we change seats?

582
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,080
Sorry.

583
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,800
You should’ve proposed earlier.

584
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,440
I’ll drive you home.

585
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,120
No.

586
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,160
My car is right over there.

587
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,200
What car do you drive?

588
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,320
I’ll buy a same car.

589
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,120
Stop showing off your wealth, will you?

590
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,760
I got everything you have.

591
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,640
Why would I show off?

592
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,160
The whole world knows I’m rich.

593
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,680
I just want to drive the same car
that you drive.

594
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,440
Idiot.

595
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,160
Ruan Qingxia.

596
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,640
What now?

597
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,160
Brace yourself.

598
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,200
I’m going to chase after you.

599
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,720
No one has ever

600
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,880
turned me down.

601
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,280
And you won’t be the first.

602
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,440
Is that what Lu Feng said to you?

603
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,720
That creeps you out, too, right?

604
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
I once

605
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,040
said the same

606
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,080
silly stuff before.

607
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,960
What about Xing Kelei?

608
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,080
Why isn’t he

609
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,880
stuck with you 24/7?

610
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,280
Lu Feng wanted to see him.

611
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,440
Perhaps they wanted to talk about you.

612
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
Only you’re cheeky enough to say that.

613
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,320
If I were her, I would have punched you.

614
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,760
I was audacious.

615
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,440
What stage are you at?

616
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,280
Are you using the “three steps of love”

617
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,400
that I taught you?

618
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,000
You aren’t doing very well yourself

619
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,920
and you try to teach me?

620
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,320
My ex-girlfriends

621
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,600
are very sad,

622
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,320
which proves that I’m great.

623
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,880
I haven’t finished yet.

624
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,160
You didn’t hold hands?

625
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Uh...

626
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,240
You didn’t hold hands?

627
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,720
What?

628
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,360
Why would we hold hands
while eating hotpot?

629
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,030
What?

630
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,680
Although you look

631
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,840
quite goofy,

632
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,240
you still

633
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,840
got a cute face,

634
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
why didn’t he

635
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,080
do anything?

636
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,840
Does he have psychological problems?

637
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,640
You have psychological problems.

638
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,880
During the earthquake,

639
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,120
he held me.

640
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,000
At a life-and-death moment,

641
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,160
he does need to do something.

642
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,960
But his daily behavior

643
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,240
doesn’t make any sense.

644
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,920
The time wasn’t right.

645
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,520
We’ll hang out tomorrow.

646
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
I tell you what,

647
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
when you hang out tomorrow,

648
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,080
you must put the cast

649
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,760
back on your right arm.

650
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,320
Why?

651
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,360
To act like a poor patient

652
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,920
so that she’ll feed you.

653
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,040
If you go to a movie,

654
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,520
you must watch a horror movie

655
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,000
so that she’ll

656
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:47,880
get close to you

657
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,080
and then

658
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,720
you can spontaneously put your arm

659
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,240
around her shoulder.

660
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,760
What a stupid idea.

661
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,240
You must

662
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,600
spruce yourself up.

663
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,400
High-heels, skirt,

664
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,160
necklace and earrings,

665
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,400
these are what you’re going to wear.

666
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,480
Don’t worry,

667
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,200
I won’t take your advice this time.

668
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,760
What a coincidence.

669
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,560
S-Skirt?

670
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,560
Is there a problem?

671
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,200
No. It looks pretty.

672
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,400
Thanks.

673
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,800
Let’s go.

674
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,600
Go.

675
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,280
You’re such a lousy shooter.

676
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,840
You can’t win that

677
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,760
cute bear.

678
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,800
If you like it,

679
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,600
I’ll buy you one,

680
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
but I

681
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,160
just can’t hit the balloons.

682
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,520
Sir, sir,

683
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,320
how much does that bear cost?
I’ll buy it.

684
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,680
I don’t sell it.
It’s a prize.

685
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,240
You hit the balloons, you get it.

686
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,120
Come on.

687
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,280
Forget it.

688
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,400
Let’s go there.

689
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,320
Want one?

690
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,040
A doll

691
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,600
must house thousands of mites.

692
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,200
It’s dirty and takes space.

693
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,960
But that one is kind of cute.

694
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,640
What? The toad?

695
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,200
You can’t dissect it.

696
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,400
I don’t dissect

697
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,920
everything.

698
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,320
It is quite cute.

699
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,040
Look,

700
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,320
it looks a bit like you.

701
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,840
So you’re the swan?

702
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,240
Hit balloons?

703
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,040
20 yuan a round.

704
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,920
20?

705
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,800
OK.

706
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,700
Load the gun.

707
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,840
It’s OK, it’s OK.

708
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,120
Even the best shooter

709
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,200
occasionally misses the target.

710
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,760
Try it again.

711
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,880
Sir,

712
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,160
you’ve done something
to the gun, right?

713
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,680
Lad,

714
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,440
watch it.

715
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,520
You’re just a bad shooter,

716
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,760
don’t blame the gun.

717
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,560
If I hit all the balloons,

718
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,400
what do I get?

719
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,480
You get the pack of cigarettes.

720
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,420
OK.

721
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,280
Lad,

722
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,480
I run a small business here.

723
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,880
I barely keep a full belly,

724
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,710
if you take the whole pack,

725
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,630
I earn

726
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,520
nothing today.

727
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,720
Come on, take it.

728
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,360
Never mind.

729
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,560
Give me the toad.

730
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,640
The toad?

731
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,080
We want that.

732
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,800
The green one.

733
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
OK, OK.

734
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,800
Here.

735
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,200
Please be an honest businessman.

736
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,160
It’s not cool to rip people off.

737
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,960
Thanks, thanks.

738
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
You knew he modified the gun,

739
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,360
how did you aim?

740
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,200
The muzzle of the gun

741
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,240
was crooked,

742
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,640
I just needed a bit of adjustment.

743
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,080
But

744
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,600
mainly because

745
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,320
I’m smart.

746
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,240
Smart.

747
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,400
Smart.

748
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,200
Can you scent

749
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,240
the good smell?

750
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,200
It smells like skewers hotpot.

751
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,480
Want to eat?

752
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,440
I’ll buy some.

753
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,240
Stay here.

754
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,400
I’ll go.

755
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,320
Sir, one bucket, please.

756
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,680
Yummy.

757
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Want one?

758
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,720
OK.

759
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
But look at my arm.

760
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,360
You aren’t fully recovered.

761
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,040
No spicy food for you,

762
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,150
right?

763
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,960
No. I...

764
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,720
Come on.

765
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,320
OK.

766
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,800
I heard the movie is very scary.

767
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,520
Really? I’ll get scared.

768
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,000
It’s OK.

769
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,480
When you’re scared,

770
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,480
you hold me.

771
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,840
If you go to a movie,

772
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,440
you must watch a horror movie

773
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,960
so that she’ll

774
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,920
get close to you

775
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,480
and then

776
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,040
you can spontaneously put your arm

777
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,720
around her shoulder.

778
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,880
Now, now.

779
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,760
How could you have the appetite?

780
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
It is fake, isn’t it?

781
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,600
Operations are

782
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,200
more real than this.

783
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,760
Why should I stop eating?

784
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,120
Do you want some?

785
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,760
No, no.

786
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,240
Are you scared?

787
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,080
No.

788
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,120
Do you find it gross?

789
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,360
Kind of.

790
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,040
Eat one.

791
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,080
The movie was fine.

792
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,400
What are you doing?

793
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,140
Nothing.

794
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,400
Watch the road!

795
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,600
Are you OK?

796
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,810
Yeah.

797
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,440
What? Protecting me?

798
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,440
A doctor’s habit.

799
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,520
He was rude.

800
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,640
I thought your arm wasn’t recovered.

801
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,120
It has.

802
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,440
I just acted poor

803
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,360
and tried to gain your compassion.

804
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,600
But I didn’t know

805
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,400
you wouldn’t fall for it.

806
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,200
So...

807
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,880
So what are you doing right now?

808
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,240
A handshake like two strangers?

809
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,340

813
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,480

Keyao,

825
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,600
what are you doing

826
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,880
with the suitcase in the morning?

827
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,880
Going home.

828
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,840
My car got hit

829
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,960
and has been sent to reparation.

830
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,280
Are you OK?

831
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
My hand isn’t well.

832
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,440
Going home?

833
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,040
I got time,

834
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,080
let me give you a ride.

835
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,080
OK.

836
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,800
Get in.

837
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,620
Get in.

838
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,240
Why didn’t you call Xing Kelei

839
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,640
after the accident?

840
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,480
He can help you.

841
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,440
My brother is a special policeman,

842
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,720
I can’t count on him.

843
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,090
Right.

844
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,000
The work of a special policeman

845
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,120
is similar to the doctors’.

846
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
We always stand by.

847
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,960
Uh,

848
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,880
I thought you were doing OK

849
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,760
in the medical research center abroad,

850
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,760
why did you come home

851
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,080
to practice clinical medicine?

852
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,640
I just missed the place.

853
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,320
I got too many memories here.

854
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
If one

855
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,840
starts to reminisce,

856
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,480
it marks he’s getting old.

857
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,800
I don’t want to deny it,

858
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,520
but to be honest,

859
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,800
it does feel different

860
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,760
from before.

861
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,920
What have you been up to lately?

862
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,800
I’m thinking about

863
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,320
being the agent of

864
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,240
a new type

865
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,360
of aneurysm clip.

866
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,560
But I haven’t touched

867
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,320
practical medical equipment
for years.

868
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,840
If you have time,

869
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,920
give me some advice.

870
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,800
OK.

871
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,520
Just email me the information.

872
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,680
Thanks.

873
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,520
