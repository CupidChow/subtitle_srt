chest trauma.

Rectum...

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,880
What’s up?

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,360
Is it blackout?

26
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,840
Press the door open button.

What should we do?

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,840
Protect him.

30
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,200
What should we do?

31
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,600
What should we do?

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,800
Press all buttons.

33
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,480
Protect him.

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,800
It’s such a commotion.

35
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,200
They should be aware of it.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,960
Yes.

37
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,320
Dr. Shao.

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,650
No.

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,360
I should call you Director Shao.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,920
I didn’t know the procedure

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,680
would be complete so soon.

42
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,360
I once worked here.

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,120
People know me,

44
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,000
so they gave me the priority

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,400
to complete the procedure.

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,520
President Zhang,

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,520
I know you’re busy.

48
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,000
You don’t need to help me
with everything.

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,960
I’ll get familiar

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,720
with my job

51
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,640
in a few days.

52
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,320
Good.

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,480
You can find He
if you need anything.

54
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,240
No problem.

55
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,050
Dr. Xu.

56
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,990
-Dr. Mi.
-Xu Yanshan.

57
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,680
Dr. Xu.

58
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,640
Dr. Mi. Can you hear me?

59
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,640
-Mi Ka.
-Dr. Mi.

60
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,920
-Dr. Mi.
-Are you okay?

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,000
We’re fine,
but we have a patient here.

62
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,180
-Can you hear me?
-Dr. Xu.

63
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:06,800
Excuse me.

64
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,380
Director He.

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,000
Director Shao.

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,650
What’s going on?

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,440
The mechanics should

68
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
check other elevators

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,760
but they made a mistake

70
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,800
and caused a patient

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
with fractured ribs

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,280
to be trapped in this elevator.

73
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,560
Is any of our doctors there?

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,440
Two resident surgeons,

75
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Xu Yanshan

76
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,080
and Mi Ka.

77
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,560
How long before they fix it?

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,640
The maintenance department

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,160
said it would take half an hour or so.

80
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,040
Don’t worry.

81
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,440
Contact the two resident surgeons

82
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,440
and see what’s going on.

83
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,440
You go and prepare

84
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,280
surgical instruments.

85
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,920
All right?

86
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,920
The patient may

87
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,960
have hemopneumothorax.

88
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,800
Prepare puncture needles

89
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,880
and bring his clinical record to me.

90
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,640
-Okay.
-And

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,040
contact Dr. Meng
of the General Surgery,

92
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,120
and Director Wei of ER.

93
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,810
-All right.
-Okay.

94
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,060
Ask them to get prepared.

95
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,680
Contact the patient’s family

96
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
and prepare the surgery notice.

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
-Okay.
-All right.

98
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Xu Yanshan. Mi Ka.

99
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,360
Now check

100
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,680
the patient’s condition.

101
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,200
The patient’s condition.

102
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,840
Short of breath, sweating.

103
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,960
Cyanosis.

104
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,960
Pale face. He’s irritable.

105
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,200
Yanshan, absent respiration.

106
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,160
Listen.

107
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,360
I think it’s rib fracture,

108
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,400
but the injury area is not big.

109
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,000
He hasn’t lost much blood.

110
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,720
But why is he

111
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,360
so weak?

112
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,480
You also think he has...

113
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,640
Hemopneumothorax.

114
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,920
A serious hemopneumothorax

115
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
will cause

116
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,800
a collapsed lung.

117
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,320
But judging from the sound,

118
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,440
we can’t tell

119
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,120
if it’s serious or not.

120
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,280
But for sure,

121
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
he has a new bleeding point.

122
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,840
How long are we going to wait?

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,800
He’ll be in danger

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,120
if we can’t help him right now.

125
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,000
Use thoracentesis

126
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,920
to remove the fluid and air

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
to reduce
the intrapleural pressure

128
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,520
and re-expand the lung.

129
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
My phone has no service.

130
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
What about yours?

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,360
Running out of battery.

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
Can you hear us?

133
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
The patient is in danger.

134
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,240
Can we have a video call?

135
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,240
Xu Yanshan,

136
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,520
Director Shao will talk with you

137
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,480
via the video call.

138
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,760
-Open your WeChat.
-Okay.

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,680
Open your WeChat.

140
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,640
Accept it.

141
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,720
Yes.

142
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,640
Accepted.

143
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,320
Hello.

144
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,520
What’s going on there?

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,840
Not good.

146
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
He had a crash

147
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,920
and I think it’s rib fracture.

148
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,800
He looks like having
a hemopneumothorax,

149
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,400
and now he’s in a state of shock.

150
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,680
Do you have any

151
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,480
emergency instruments at hands?

152
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,560
No.

153
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Can you confirm

154
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,240
that the shock is caused by

155
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,120
the hemopneumothorax?

156
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,400
He is short of breath,

157
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,520
sweating and pale.

158
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,960
And absent respiration.

159
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,600
Based on his clinical record,

160
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,360
if he has multiple fractures

161
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,760
and internal haemorrhage,

162
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,560
he might have hemopneumothorax.

163
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,760
Keep calm.

164
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,640
We’ll pry the door open

165
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,120
and give you

166
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,320
the instruments

167
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
for surgery.

168
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,840
In the elevator?

169
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,470
Yes.

170
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,080
Use thoracentesis
to remove the fluid

171
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,560
and reduce the pressure
in the lung,

172
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,640
re-expand the lung.

173
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,920
(Hang up and end of the call.)
We will...

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,640
It ended.

175
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,880
Out of power.

176
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,320
Well,

177
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,280
do they have to perform the surgery
in the elevator?

178
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,400
Yes.

179
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,280
Tell the maintenance department

180
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,240
to stop their work.

181
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,680
Never shake the elevator.

182
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,560
Right now.

183
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,320
Now you have

184
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,080
the instruments.

185
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,600
Have you ever
performed any thoracentesis?

186
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,000
I’m here and you can ask me

187
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,290
if you have any questions.

188
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,280
Okay.

189
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,440
Mi Ka,

190
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,240
is it all right to conduct

191
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,960
the surgery here with
only you and me?

192
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,760
Thoracentesis

193
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,040
is not a very difficult surgery.

194
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,840
Even if it’s a low-risk surgery,

195
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,680
resident surgeons like you and me

196
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,320
should be accompanied

197
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,920
by a mentor when
performing the surgery.

198
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,640
What if anything goes wrong?

199
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,360
Are we gonna watch

200
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,640
him dying

201
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,680
if we don’t do anything?

202
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,840
No.

203
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,280
But we don’t know

204
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,600
if he has an unknown disease.

205
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,480
What if there is any complication

206
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,800
during the surgery?

207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,200
What if we

208
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,680
fail to save him?

209
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,960
Who should be responsible?

210
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,520
We’ll still be responsible

211
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,360
if we do nothing for him.

212
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,400
I’ll cooperate with you.

213
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,600
Yanshan.

214
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,560
I...

215
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,520
It’s not your first surgery.

216
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,880
You’ve succeeded several times.

217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,040
What do you fear?

218
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,960
Look at me.

219
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,400
You’re the best surgeon

220
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
among us,

221
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,640
no matter in practice
or real operation.

222
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,120
We’re doctors.

223
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,040
We’re professional.

224
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
We can

225
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,240
and we have to

226
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,880
save his life.

227
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,840
Let’s begin.

228
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,840
Quick.

229
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,840
Help him up.

230
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,520
I can’t, Mi Ka.

231
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,440
Mi Ka, I think we should wait.

232
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,800
Help me get him up.

233
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,880
I need to insert the needle

234
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,040
between the seventh
and eighth ribs, right?

235
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,690
Yes.

236
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,000
You made the decision.

237
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,320
Make him lie down.

238
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,880
Support here.

239
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,200
How is he, Director Meng?

240
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,840
He’s out of danger.

241
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,160
Send him to the operating room.

242
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,160
You must be scared.

243
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,440
No.

244
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,400
I just forgot the fear
when I focused on the surgery.

245
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,720
Now Director Meng will
take care of him.

246
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,160
You don’t need to worry about it.

247
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,040
Yanshan, you did well.

248
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,400
That’s what I should do.

249
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,320
You’re good.

250
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,400
Well done.

251
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,040
Have a rest.

252
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,360
The senior doctor

253
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,760
will ask you something.

254
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,120
Director He…

255
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,960
(Don’t trouble to give me a ride.)

256
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,640
(I can take a taxi.)

257
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,360
(Go home and have a rest.)

258
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,080
(Okay.)

259
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,080
(You’ll know someday that)

260
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,640
(there is one person in the world)

261
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,720
(who once you’ve met,)

262
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
(you’ll never fall in love
with anyone else.)

263
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,960
What the hell?

264
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,600
(Boss...)

265
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,840
♪I think I’ve seen you in my dreams♪

266
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,800
(No worries.)

267
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,600
(Go on.)

268
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,960
(I said it won’t be that fast.)

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,800
(Don’t come and push us every day.)

270
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,200
♪Attract all my attention♪

271
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,440
♪I don’t want to wake up♪

272
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,320
It’s been so long.

273
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,040
Why doesn’t she call and ask?

274
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,000
My wound will be cured.

275
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
What am I thinking?

276
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,840
This is made of pure cotton,

277
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,960
so as this one.

278
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,760
And this is

279
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,400
edged with lace.

280
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,160
Yes, this one also has

281
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,360
-cartoon images.
-This looks good.

282
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,160
The price is very low.

283
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,360
Yes.

284
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,320
What size

285
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,200
do you need?

286
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,680
I can find the ones that suit you.

287
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,960
Okay, we’ll look around.

288
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,160
The fabric is better than I thought,

289
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
but the design...

290
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,120
Hello, sir,

291
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,640
what can I do for you?

292
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,440
Do you have camisoles?

293
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,500
Camisoles?

294
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,210
Yes, come this way.

295
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,880
This is a new arrival.

296
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,840
What kind of camisole

297
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,640
do you need?

298
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,040
We have various colors.

299
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,120
Do you need a short or a long one?

300
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,700
-We all have.
-I just want

301
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,390
an ordinary one.

302
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,080
An ordinary one.

303
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,890
Yes, these are suitable
for night wear

304
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,440
and give a great cleavage.

305
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,240
They’re good.

306
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,120
That’s true.

307
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,080
Which one

308
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,920
do you prefer?

309
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,740
I don’t know...

310
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,760
-I just want...
-Have a look

311
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,120
and I’ll bring you some bras.

312
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,280
This is a new arrival.

313
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,310
It is

314
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,270
a wireless bra

315
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,500
and made of pure cotton.

316
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,600
You can touch it.

317
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,960
Doesn't it feel good?

318
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,520
No.

319
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,210
-Never mind.
-No.

320
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,650
I just want an ordinary camisole.

321
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,300
It’s not for me.

322
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,120
Don’t make it as if I would try on it.

323
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,630
Why not have a look at

324
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,540
-other bras in our store?
-No, thanks.

325
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,580
I don’t need them. Thanks.

326
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,000
See you, sir.

327
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,920
Hope to see you again.

328
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,120
Welcome. Just pick anyone you like.

329
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,740
(Get 30% Off Sale)

330
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,280
Give me a fried bread stick.

331
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,840
One more.

332
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,560
Thank you.

333
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,880
The fried bread stick.

334
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,640
Chen Tao,

335
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,080
how about we call you Yakult Chen

336
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,600
because you’re so addicted to Yakult?

337
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,960
I’m giving my intestines
a special treat.

338
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,640
Besides,

339
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,040
being a doctor

340
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,000
is a bitter experience.

341
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Shouldn’t I have
some sweet beverage?

342
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,880
My dear fellows,

343
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,880
have you heard that the seniors

344
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,720
will have a meeting just this morning

345
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,000
to decide which department
each of us should go to.

346
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,280
Who has applied for the ND?

347
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,200
Me.

348
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,400
Yanshan is safe.

349
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,640
Whoever else has applied for
the ND will be rejected.

350
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,360
It only accepts one candidate.

351
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
Only one.

352
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,480
I hope I won’t be

353
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,000
assigned to the Emergency Surgery.

354
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,240
Why don’t you

355
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,000
want to work there?

356
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,800
There is a merciless lady

357
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,000
who will only bring misery to us.

358
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,520
Why everything sounds so terrible

359
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,600
if it’s from your mouth?

360
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,560
And why do you always describe

361
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,960
people so terrifying?

362
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,400
She is famous in Renxin Hospital.

363
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,480
Don’t you know that?

364
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,480
Finish your meal

365
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,000
or you’ll be late for the meeting.

366
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
I’d better not tell you.

367
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,240
If I am assigned
to the Emergency Surgery,

368
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,080
I’ll drink a dozen of this every week.

369
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,280
Take them to each department

370
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,920
to get familiar with the job.

371
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,400
Remember to notify the HR.

372
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,040
Okay.

373
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,080
Director Shao.

374
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,400
Director He.

375
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,440
You’re at work.

376
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,120
Yes.

377
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,560
Director Zhou

378
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,760
has asked for leave of two months,

379
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,040
and he has transferred

380
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,960
some of his patients to me.

381
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,520
I need to know their conditions.

382
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,200
See you.

383
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,120
I’m to announce

384
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
the distribution of resident doctors.

385
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,640
Distribution of resident doctors?

386
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
May I have a look at it?

387
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,560
I want to know who will
work in our department.

388
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,830
(Xu Yanshan)
Neurosurgery Department.

389
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,800
Can we have one more?

390
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,180
-One more?
-Yes.

391
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,120
Director Shao,

392
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,600
your department is

393
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,800
already the largest one here.

394
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
We didn’t distribute any newcomers

395
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
to your department
in the past three years.

396
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,880
We’ll give you one this year

397
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,280
because you’ve arrived.

398
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,720
I know, but no worries,

399
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,560
I’ll explain it to

400
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,800
President Zhang.

401
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,960
Then

402
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,720
who is on your list?

403
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,320
Mi Ka.

404
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,120
Mi Ka?

405
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,120
Yes, Mi Ka.

406
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,680
So please add her name

407
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,760
to the list when you announce it.

408
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,360
Thank you. I’ll go.

409
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,080
Director He,

410
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,120
is it all right?

411
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,680
Just do as he asked.

412
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,080
Sister-in-law.

413
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,200
Xing,

414
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,280
I’m surprised you’ve come.

415
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,480
To visit some patient?

416
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,170
No.

417
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,920
I am looking for

418
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,560
Dr. Mi.

419
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,920
Mi Ka?

420
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,040
I think she

421
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,080
is in a meeting now.

422
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,320
Come with me.

423
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,000
Xing Sir,

424
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,760
what brings you here?

425
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,110
Are you feeling better?

426
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,560
Yes. It’s just a small injury.

427
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,160
This is

428
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,640
for you.

429
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,960
For me?

430
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,760
What is it?

431
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,280
You can open it
when you’re back home.

432
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,880
It’s...

433
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,040
It’s a...

434
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,960
You’ll know anyway.

435
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,880
May I ask you

436
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,840
out for the lunch?

437
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,480
Lunch?

438
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,680
Why?

439
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,240
It’s just to eat something.

440
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,640
I have a meeting at noon.

441
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,200
Well.

442
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,280
You still need to eat
after the meeting, don’t you?

443
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,160
That’s it.

444
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,440
You can go back.

445
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,520
Okay.

446
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,760
See you.

447
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:34,180
(Renxin Hospital)

448
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,560
Hello, everyone.

449
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Now I will announce

450
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,800
the distribution of you.

451
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,840
It’s based on your performance

452
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,080
in the last year,

453
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,960
opinions of directors,

454
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,000
and the overall score

455
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,600
you’ve gotten.

456
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,240
I hope all of you are assigned

457
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,920
to your favorite department.

458
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,560
And from now on,

459
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,000
I hope you work hard and make progress.

460
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,760
Now I will announce the list.

Director He, what about me?

489
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,920
Which department am I assigned to?

490
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,520
You are of the ND, too.

491
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,720
Thank you, Director He.

492
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,600
You should treat us to a meal.

493
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,440
No problem.

494
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,400
Go back and get yourselves prepared.

(You’re gonna pass it!
Please go another five steps.)

497
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,920
Uncle, you’re not good at it.

498
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,600
What did you call me?

499
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,680
Do I look as old as your father?

500
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,880
Who are you?

501
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,960
You’re bad

502
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,920
at the game.

503
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,520
You tried three times and failed all.

504
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,800
If you can pass it,

505
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,920
I’ll buy an ice-cream cone for you.

506

Fine.

Anipop.

508
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,120
I can’t believe it.

509
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,760
Here is your ice-cream cone.

510
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,360
I have one. Silly man.

511

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,240
Wenbo, change the position.

519
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,000
Roger that.

00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
that the suspects are armed.

523
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,960
Be careful with your safety.

524
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,880
Implement the plan.

525
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,000
My dear friends,

526
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,320
these are on

527
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,400
Yanshan and me.

528
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,240
No appetite.

529
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,560
I don’t have the mood.

530
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,360
Don’t be upset.

531
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,560
After three or five years,

532
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,920
when you’re an attending doctor,
you can choose your department again.

533
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,280
The most annoying is Mi Ka.

534
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,680
You lied.

535
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,760
You’ve been assigned

536
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,560
to the ND out of our surprise.

537
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,480
I didn’t mean it.

538
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
It’s said that the ND would
only take in one.

539
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,080
I didn’t know it before.

540
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,600
If it only took in one,

541
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,880
it would be Yanshan, right?

542
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,760
Enough.

543
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,080
Please take care of Yanshan

544
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,960
when you’re there.

545
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,160
I’m afraid I’ll be very busy in the ER.

546
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,440
Yanshan is here.

547
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,300
You can tell her yourself.

548
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,000
-Yanshan…
-Why are you so garrulous?

549
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,960
Mi Ka.

550
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,680
Director.

551
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,440
Director He.

552
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,680
You must be too excited.

553
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,040
You lost what Xing Kelei gave you.

554
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,080
Thank you, Director He.

555
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,400
You can’t be careless

556
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,840
when you’re in the ND.

557
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,440
Sure.

558
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,240
Enjoy your food.

559
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,760
-Goodbye, Director He.
-Bye, Director He.

560
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,680
I forgot.

561
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,080
What is it?

562
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,380
(Xing Kelei)

563
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
(Perfect Food)
Shall we meet here?

564
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,600
I’m waiting for you in the parking lot.

565
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,280
Go the auxiliary lane.

566
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,920
Halt.

567
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,280
We have innocents here.
Don’t take any action.

568
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,200
Why are you so officious?

569
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,720
This is

570
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
a vest?

571
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,040
Xing Kelei gave his vest

572
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,000
to you.

573
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,560
It’s a vest.

574
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,000
Why did he give
his vest to you?

575
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,260
-What does he mean?
-How can I know?

576
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:04,930
Is he…?

577
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,550
Let me see.

578
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,360
Take your hands away, Xu Yanshan.

579
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,800
You exert yourself, don’t you?

580
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,800
We got men following us.

581
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,720
Luo Ting, change seats.

582
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,470
Yes.

583
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,050
Let’s go.

584
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,060
(Xing Kelei)

585
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,680
Xiaoman.

586
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,720
Aunt.

587
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,400
Mi Ka is here.

588
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,080
Mi Ka.

589
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,520
Sit.

590
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,640
Why are you here?

591
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,320
Have you gotten the visa?

592
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,320
Yes.

593
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,080
Dr. Shao asked his assistant

594
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,080
to help me with it.

595
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,840
He wrote a letter to the visa officer.

596
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,320
We’ll soon depart.

597
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,280
Yes.

598
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,680
We’re indebted

599
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,600
to Dr. Shao.

600
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,680
He’s applied for

601
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,640
grants from a fund

602
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,560
that could

603
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,720
cover Xiaoman’s

604
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,160
medical fees

605
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,120
and living expenses.

606
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,680
We just don’t know

607
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,680
how to thank him.

608
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,560
I’m happy for you, Xiaoman.

609
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,120
Thank you, Mi Ka.

610
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,920
Without you,

611
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
he wouldn’t even have known me.

612
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,320
You gave me

613
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,320
a second life.

614
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,160
When you’re there,

615
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,040
you’ll receive
the treatment immediately.

616
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,000
Your mother can’t speak English.

617
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,680
You can ask my schoolmate

618
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,320
to help you if you’re in need.

619
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,320
I’ll give you his contact method.

620
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,600
All right?

621
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,040
I also bring you

622
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,400
a good news of mine.

623
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,880
I’ll work in the ND,

624
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,200
working with Director Shao.

625
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,880
Really?

626
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,160
I know you can make it.

627
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,840
That’s great.

628
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,200
That’s great.

629
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:12,880
That’s great.

630
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,200
Wenbo, cut corners and catch him up.

631
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:21,910
Yes.

632
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,160
Attention! The car ahead of us.

633
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,080
We’re Jiangning Special Police.

634
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,840
We’re Jiangning Special Police.

635
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,120
Stop for inspection.

636
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,240
Dr. Shao.

637
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,920
How do you feel?

638
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,720
Anything ails you?

639
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,320
No.

640
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,760
Just rest another two days

641
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,480
and you’ll be discharged.

642
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,440
All right. Thanks.

643
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,160
How is he?

644
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,760
The patient has

645
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,880
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

646
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,920
He was treated

647
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,080
in another hospital for seven days

648
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,120
and was recovering.

649
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,360
The CT scan showed

650
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,240
no bleeding.

651
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,040
But he fell into
unconsciousness on the ninth day

652
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,120
and was transferred to our hospital.

653
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,960
The CT scan showed

654
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,480
no secondary bleeding

655
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,400
or clot.

656
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,440
What’s his blood pressure?

657
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,720
High blood pressure.

658
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,960
What medicine has he been taking?

659
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,880
Aminocaproic acid

660
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,000
and 0.9 percent

661
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,610
Normal Saline

662
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,520
in 100 ml intravenous infusion.

663
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,160
0.9 percent.

664
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,040
Keep the blood pressure

665
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,880
between 160 and 100 mmHg.

666
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,960
Rest in the bed.

667
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,120
Give him some hemostatic.

668
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,320
Be careful with hyponatremia.

669
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,440
Three percent Normal Saline,

670
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,400
given orally or through injection.

671
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,360
And pay attention to

672
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,840
the cerebral angiospasm

673
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,200
which may occur following
the subarachnoid hemorrhage.

674
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,080
Consider vasodilator therapy
if necessary.

675
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,320
Okay. I know.

676
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,600
Run.

677
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,560
Hold on, Xiaochao.

678
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,480
Hold on.

679
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,520
Don’t sleep.

680
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,520
Make way.

681
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,230
What’s the situation?

682
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,280
Two seriously injured and in a coma.

683
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,190
One got shot in the head.

684
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,400
The other’s head is
also seriously wounded.

685
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,280
Make way.

686
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,710
Get out of the way.

687
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,710
Push them in.

688
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,150
Notify the ND for
a surgery consultation.

689
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,230
Hello.

690
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,000
Come with me to the ND.

691
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,230
Who is so important?

692
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,280
They just called

693
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,000
Director Shao directly.

694
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,440
Perhaps it needs
a surgery consultation.

695
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,280
Let’s go.

696
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,000
Shu Sir, why are you here?

697
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,790
My men

698
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,740
got hurt in a mission.

699
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,520
We need to go in right now.

700
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,960
A violent blow to the head

701
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,440
leaves an open injury.

702
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,920
He lost
his consciousness immediately.

703
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,320
There’s a lot of blood lose

704
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,680
and a continued decrease
in pulse amplitude.

705
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,960
Body temperature drops below 35°C.

706
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,280
Pupils are of different sizes.

707
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,200
I guess

708
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,200
it’s an intracranial hematoma.

709
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,520
Well, send him for a CT scan

710
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,560
and get prepared for surgery.

711
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,430
-All right.
-Okay.

712
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,320
What happened to him?

713
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,640
He was shot in the head

714
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,360
and lost his consciousness.

715
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,560
The bullet went through him.

716
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,480
An average of 9 to 12 breaths
per minute.

717
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,440
Pulse rate falls below normal.

718
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,480
Right.

719
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,960
He is the special police

720
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,560
and the one we just saw
is the suspect.

721
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,560
The gun should be self-made.

722
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,680
No blast injury.

723
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,280
I hope the bullet only
reaches his harnpan

724
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,600
and hasn’t hurt the brain tissues.

725
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,760
Send him for a CT scan

726
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,520
and try to keep him alive.

727
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,250
Yes.

728
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,000
And notify Director Wang.

729
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,920
Both of them need

730
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,000
the surgery immediately.

731
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,630
I know.

732
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,640
-All right, go.
-Okay.

733
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,300
(Caution! Harmful Rays
Do not enter while red light is on)

734
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,720
Doctor,

735
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,280
how is my colleague?

736
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,880
Which one is your colleague?

737
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,560
The special police got shot
in the head.

738
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,760
He’ll likely undergo surgery.

739
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,200
Be prepared for
the potential bad news.

740
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,040
I know.

741
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,080
What’s the result?

742
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,640
The patient with
the traumatic brain injury

743
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,240
has an epidural hematoma,

744
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,840
a volume of around 50 ml.

745
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,840
The patient got shot

746
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,880
has foreign bodies in the brain

747
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,080
which has caused bleeding,

748
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,400
according to the CT scan.

749
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,080
Did you contact Director Wang?

750
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,360
He’s performing an operation.

751
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Other eligible surgeons

752
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,280
are also in surgery.

753
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,200
When will he finish the surgery?

754
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,480
According to the circulating nurse,

755
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,560
at least two hours.

756
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,640
Mi Ka,

757
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,640
push the one

758
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,560
with the epidural hematoma in.

759
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,800
Wait.

760
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,440
Shouldn’t you help the one
who got shot first?

761
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,000
Judging from their conditions,

762
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,640
the other patient’s

763
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,840
indications for surgery are clearer.

764
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:14,960
What do you mean?

765
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,760
I can only perform

766
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
one surgery for the moment.

767
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,080
What about Xiaochao?

768
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,800
He has to wait.

769
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,760
We can wait.

770
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,480
But how can he wait?

771
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,280
Xing Sir,

772
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,360
both of them

773
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,170
are in critical danger.

774
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,000
Even if we push him in,

775
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,720
he may not be able to survive it.

776
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,400
Then what should we do?

777
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,960
Or you can transfer him
to another hospital.

778
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
See if there is

779
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,560
any hospital nearby

780
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,920
that can perform the surgery.

781
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,080
No, doctor,

782
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,320
he was injured in a mission.

783
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,000
He shed his blood
for the sake of people.

784
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,280
How can you operate

785
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,240
on a criminal instead of him?

786
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
I’m a doctor.

787
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
I’m not a judge.

788
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,760
I only refer to indications of surgery

789
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,400
when I decide
who should be operated on.

790
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,000
You must be wrong.

791
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,800
The one you’re gonna save

792
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,760
is a criminal.

793
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,400
Even if you saved him,

794
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,240
he would be executed anyway.

795
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,240
You’re the police.

796
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,720
Please mind yourself.

797
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,440
This is the hospital.

798
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,400
We’ve gotten other patients here.

799
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,720
Please control your emotions.

800
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Let me say it again.

801
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,560
I’m a doctor, not a judge.

802
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,200
My duty is to save people,

803
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,280
not to judge them.

804
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,080
Don’t interfere with our work, okay?

805
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,200
Okay.

806
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,320
Get to work.

807
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,640
The one you’re to save

808
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,280
is a criminal.

809
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,040
Li Nian.

810
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,040
Show me the other

811
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,360
patient’s films.

812
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,360
The intracranial pressure increases

813
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,240
and there is a risk of brain herniation.

814
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,520
Clear indications for surgery.

815
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,680
We’ll have two surgeries
at the same time.

816
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,240
Okay, thank you.

817
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,560
Captain Xing, the nearest hospital

818
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,240
that agrees to receive Xiaochao

819
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,520
is twenty kilometers away.

820
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,480
I also asked around.

821
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,880
They said inter-hospital
transfer is riskier.

822
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,800
Notify the operating room and

823
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,720
anesthesia room to be ready.

824
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,320
Quick.

825
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,120
Is Geng Xiaochao’s family here?

826
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,160
We decide to perform
the two surgeries

827
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,080
at the same time.

828
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,760
We need the family’s consent.

829
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,760
Is his family here?

830
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,320
His mother is undergoing
an operation.

831
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,840
His fiancée is here.

832
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,640
No.

833
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,480
Fiancée is not

834
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,040
a “family”

835
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,840
according to law.

836
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Can she undertake the responsibility?

837
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,000
I’m the captain.

838
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,920
I can undertake the responsibility,

839
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,360
so can our police team.

840
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
You’ll sign the document.

841
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,920
Please.

842
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,200
I’ll try my best.

843
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,000
Do you know why Director Shao

844
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,080
decides to have two surgeries

845
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,040
at the same time?

846
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,720
What if anything goes wrong

847
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,600
and they put the blame on us?

848
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,640
He must have his reasons

849
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,040
to do so.

850
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,840
Besides,

851
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,800
lives matter more

852
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,400
than the rules.

853
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,720
Are you ready?

854
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,480
Yes.

855
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,120
How is he?

856
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,240
Stable vital signs?

857
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,930
Yes.

858
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,480
Okay.

859
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,880
His name?

860
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,200
Geng Xiaochao, 26 years old.

861
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,200
Got shot in the head

862
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,000
and foreign bodies in the brain.

863
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,920
Flap suspension.

864
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,480
Skull opened.

865
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,560
Give me the drill.

866
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,920
Milling cutter.

867
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,240
Bone flap removed.

868
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,960
I see the blood clot.

869
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,480
Okay, leave it to me.

870
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,840
Machine ready.

871
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,440
Hemostatic forceps.

872
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,480
I’m into his skull.
Pay attention to his blood pressure.

873
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,480
Cranial pressure decreases.

874
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,520
Neurosurgery

875
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,880
should be the most elegant

876
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,880
medical operation.

877
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,000
We must have a steady hand

878
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,680
and be precise.

879
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,200
Good.

880
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,000
Bleeding stops.

881
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,880
Well done.

882
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,600
Cranial pressure decreases.

883
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,040
Have you figured out

884
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,840
the gun and the bullet?

885
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,480
It’s a self-made gun

886
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,560
with iron bullets.

887
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
I’ve found the foreign bodies.

888
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,160
Okay.

889
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
Wash the tissues and stop bleeding.

890
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,040
Yes.

891
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,680
Zhang Yang,

892
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,560
how is your process?

893
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,720

894
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,000
