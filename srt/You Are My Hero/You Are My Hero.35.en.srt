20
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,620
(Au79 western-style restaurant)

21
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,640
Xia.

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,720
What’s wrong?

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,720
Why? Why are you unhappy again?

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
Xia walked very fast.

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,880
I will use the washroom.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,280
What did you do this time?

27
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,120
Nothing.

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,440
I held the umbrella for her.

29
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,720
How?

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,560
I…

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,360
She walked in front.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,000
I was behind her.

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,680
She was under the umbrella.

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,440
I was out of it.

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,320
What’s wrong?

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,240
We gave you one umbrella

37
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,600
so that you can

38
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,840
use it this way.

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,400
Or this way.

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,480
This way?

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,920
The umbrella is small.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
If the rain is heavier,

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,840
Xia would get wet.

44
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,760
-Not that.
-Not that.

45
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,800
Sit down.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,080
My words may not be right.

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,160
But listen,

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,600
since you’ve invited Xia

49
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,840
to see a film,

50
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,960
if you want to lead her by the hand,

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,080
you should be active, right?

52
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,280
You enjoyed the night scene
on the mountain.

53
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,840
Xia cherished the time

54
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,120
being with you.

55
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,760
But what did you do?

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,640
Oh, I see.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,600
What’s more…

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,520
I don’t think he’s understood.

59
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,360
Let’s put it this way.

60
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,600
You are a couple.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
If Xia wants to do something,

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
you just accompany her.

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,320
Don’t have too many opinions.

64
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,760
Plus,

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,920
think it over

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,680
how you two

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,480
fell in love with each other.

68
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,040
What did you do that day?

69
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,080
I see, Captain.

70
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,080
Really?

71
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
I will go home.

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,520
Let me accompany you.

73
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,520
No.

74
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,120
Yes.

75
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,040
He does better than his master.

76
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,080
A fast learner.

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,720
Better than his master?

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,560
Then I will be like that too.

79
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,960
No.

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
What a numbskull!

81
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,480
They two

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,920
didn’t apologize to us.

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,200
Our dinner was interrupted

84
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,600
by them.

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,360
We still have two days off.

86
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,160
What about

87
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,480
hanging out?

88
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,720
I… I have to work tomorrow.

89
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,720
The day after tomorrow?

90
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,070
I think

91
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,720
it’s hard for us

92
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,160
to have a holiday at the same time.

93
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,680
That’s true.

94
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,480
Because of the job nature,

95
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,200
we can’t accommodate to the other one.

96
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,760
Captain Hao told me about that before.

97
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,600
I didn’t care about it.

98
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,760
Now it seems

99
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
it is true.

100
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,680
How about going to the beach
the day after tomorrow?

101
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,240
Good.

102
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,760
Beach…

103
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,080
You stay at home tomorrow,

104
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,000
and sweep the floor, do the laundry

105
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,840
and pack things up.

106
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,400
And then pick me up

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,480
when I get off work.

108
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,160

You are on duty again.

129
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes, I’m on duty today.

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,480
Here you are.

131
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,680
What is it?

132
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,920
It is the data of one old patient.

133
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,200
Input it in the computer.

134
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,960
Mr. Shao arranges an operation
next week.

135
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,160
Arrange preoperative examinations
for the patient.

136
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,080
Sure, no problem.

137
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,320
Mi Ka, come here and help us.

138
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,080
What’s the matter?

139
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,480
The patient on Bed 7
refused to be discharged.

140
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,280
We tried every means

141
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,680
and failed to persuade her to leave.

142
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,800
The old granny on Bed 7 is adorable.

143
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,040
She is obedient.

144
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,080
So, we ask you

145
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,000
to persuade her.

146
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,240
Let’s go.

147
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:40,880
Go.

148
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,120
Captain Hao.

149
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,360
Kelei,

150
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,760
I have something to tell you.

151
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,160
Come back right now.

152
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,120
Okay.

153
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,160
Dr. Mi,

154
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,840
you explain things clearly.

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,360
I only trust you.

156
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,080
I’ll ask my husband to come upstairs

157
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,360
and pack up my things right now.

158
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,400
Granny,

159
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,360
you just said

160
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
your husband broke his legs

161
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,280
and he couldn’t come.

162
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,680
I deliberately didn’t
tell you the truth.

163
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,080
I love to listen to Dr. Mi.

164
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,600
I believe what she says.

165
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,400
Well,

166
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,920
ask your husband to come upstairs

167
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,080
and go through the discharge procedure,

168
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,600
all right?

169
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,840
All right.

170
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,560
I call him right now.

171
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,560
Right now.

172
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,160
I must listen to

173
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,160
what Dr. Mi said.

174
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,880
Come in.

175
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,720
The banner looks nice this year.

176
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,040
Kelei.

177
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,120
Wu Keming, from Lucheng,

178
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,880
smuggles arms

179
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,840
in the Southeast Asia over the years.

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,480
He has killed several people.

181
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,080
But he recently returns to
our country suddenly.

182
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,560
The provincial public security department
pays high attention to it

183
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,120
and assigns the criminal police

184
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,360
to follow him for one month.

185
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,920
He has returned to Lucheng.

186
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,440
Look.

187
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,680
He is ruthless.

188
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,760
The criminal police

189
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,880
need our support?

190
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,480
The main reason

191
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,720
is that he may carry heavy weapons
with him.

192
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,000
Intelligence shows that

193
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,880
he may return to his parent’s home

194
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,400
in recent days.

195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,150
In the downtown area.

196
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,880
Got it.

197
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,080
I make arrangements with Wenbo first.

198
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,760
You get on the car quickly

199
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,640
and go to City A first.

200
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,080
You can discuss on the way.

201
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,600
Okay. Got it.

202
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,280
I have something to do
in the team today,

203
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,280
so, I can’t go back.

204
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:09,900
(Xing Kelei: I have something to do
in the team today, so, I can’t go back.)

205
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,360
Mi Ka.

206
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,840
Go downstairs now?

207
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,440
I deal with the discharge procedures

208
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,320
for Bed 7.

209
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,400
I need your help.

210
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,600
Please give this patient history

211
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,000
to Mr. Shao for comparison.

212
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,360
He is seeing a patient in the ER.

213
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,040
Hurry up.

214
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,560
Okay.

215
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,160
The faster the better.

216
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,680
I see.

217
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,720
Remember to remind Mr. Shao

218
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
that he has a meeting this afternoon.

219
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,320
All right.

220
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,920
Dr. Mi, where should I queue up?

221
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,560
Here.

222
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,280
You can queue up here.

223
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,240
Okay, thank you, Dr. Mi.

224
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,800
You are welcome.

225
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,440
3% solution.

226
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,360
Either oral administration
or intravenous infusion is allowed.

227
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,840
Go ahead.

228
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,920
Mr. Shao.

229
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,040
Why are you here?

230
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,200
Jia Li asked me

231
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,320
to send the patient history
of a patient.

232
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,240
What’s going on in the ER?

233
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,240
One kinfolk of a patient
fell ill in the ER

234
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,080
coughed badly

235
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,920
and had the symptom of fever.

236
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,000
We knew afterwards

237
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
he just came back from the Middle East.

238
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,840
He was suspected of

239
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,960
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.

240
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,720
We have reported it to
the disease control center.

241
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,800
The ER

242
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,160
is closed for the time being.

243
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,400
Closed?

244
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,760
It’s closed. You are lucky.

245
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
You have to be here with me.

246
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,680
What can I do for you?

247
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,200
A patient with temporal lobe hematoma

248
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,200
needs an operation.

249
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,240
For the moment,

250
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,960
I have to have an operation here.

251
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,400
I planned to ask Chen Tao to operate it.

252
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,320
Since you are here, be my assistant.

253
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay.

254
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,600
Get familiar with the situation.

255
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,520
Captain Xing.

256
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,260
(Disinfection Room)

257
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,120
Chen Tao,

258
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,480
the basic information of the patient.

259
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,840
The patient, 85,

260
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,760
fell down at home,

261
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,640
and fell into a coma when hospitalized.

262
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,600
The CT scan shows

263
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,720
cute intracerebral hematoma

264
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,960
in the front section of temporal lobe.

265
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,120
The median line shifts.

266
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,680
The bilateral pupillary reaction
is good.

267
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,560
In view of

268
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,520
the old age,

269
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,400
high fragility of blood vessels

270
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,200
and fast development of the disease,

271
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,560
the patient needs an operation urgently.

272
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,640
Mi Ka, what operation do we need?

273
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,360
Removal of intracranial hematoma.

274
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,640
The operation is not complicated.

275
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,560
The 24 hours after the surgery

276
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,400
is very crucial.

277
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,600
But the environment in the ER

278
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,360
is complex.

279
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,120
After the operation,

280
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,800
the patient may have pneumonia

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,680
cerebral edema,

282
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,880
or intracranial infection
and other risks.

283
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,120
The ER shall be closed

284
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,960
for at least 24 hours.

285
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,120
The specific duration
is to be determined.

286
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,520
You take charge of monitoring
the situation of the patient

287
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,520
after the operation.

288
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,920
The anesthetist is ready.

289
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,440
Go inside.

290
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:47,880
Go.

291
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,440
Captain Xing, we’re here.

292
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,520
Captain Xu, please open the door.

293
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:22,920
Hi.

294
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,560
Captain Xu.

295
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,920
Let me make an introduction.

296
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,680
This is Captain Xing
from the Special Police.

297
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,360
This is Captain Xu

298
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,520
from the Criminal Police.

299
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,360
Hello.

300
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,360
Captain Xing, hello.

301
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,240
They are Wenbo, Wenjing,

302
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,520
Luo Ting and Li Nian.

303
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,520
Hello, everyone.

304
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,440
Fine. Captain Xing,

305
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,580
let me introduce you

306
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,180
-the specific situation.
-Okay.

307
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,800
This way, please.

308
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,760
You may have read through

309
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,840
some information.

310
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,080
Wu Keming,

311
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,840
runs around in the Southeast Asia

312
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,920
and along the border of Guangxi
for a long time.

313
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,000
He smuggles guns and also drugs.

314
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,320
Two years ago,

315
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,000
Guangxi police once

316
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,160
tried to arrest him.

317
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,160
During the process of arrest,

318
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,080
he resisted arrest with a gun
and wounded the policemen,

319
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,560
resulting in one death and one injury.

320
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,800
After we got the news

321
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,760
that he had gone back to Lucheng,

322
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,440
we immediately

323
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
reported to the province

324
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,080
and asked for support.

325
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,760
So, you Special Police

326
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
were invited here.

327
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,240
Why did he return this time?

328
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,680
We’re not sure about that for now.

329
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,800
When getting the news

330
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,280
that he returned to our country,

331
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,320
Guangxi police thought he came back

332
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,360
for business.

333
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,880
But after more than half a month,

334
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
he disappeared.

335
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,120
No track was left.

336
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,680
They thought he had gone abroad again.

337
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,600
By coincidence,

338
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,880
we caught a kid

339
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,080
who stole a car.

340
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,880
He said, not long ago,

341
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,080
he stole a car

342
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,000
with a person called Heisan.

343
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,040
In the early years

344
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,320
when Wu Keming ran about in Lucheng,

345
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,320
Heisan

346
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,960
used to be Wu Keming’s henchman.

347
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,400
That kid said

348
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,480
Heisan

349
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,920
stole the car for his bro.

350
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,640
No one is qualified to be Heisan’s bro

351
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,160
in Lucheng now.

352
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,640
So, we guess

353
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,320
Wu Keming

354
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,880
has sneaked into our city.

355
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,640
We don’t know

356
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,600
what he will do for now.

357
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,800
What’s more,

358
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,720
Room 305

359
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,600
of the building opposite

360
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,200
is Wu Keming’s parents’ home.

361
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,120
His parents

362
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,200
have passed away many year ago.

363
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,480
He hasn’t got married

364
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,520
and has no children, either.

365
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,760
He only has one sister,

366
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,000
who lives nearby.

367
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,040
This house has been rented out

368
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,600
several years ago.

369
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,200
Tenants live there right now.

370
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,720
Have you checked
the information of tenants?

371
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,560
We have.

372
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
This way, please.

373
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,280
A woman

374
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,520
with a kid.

375
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,280
This woman

376
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,160
opens an online store

377
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,240
which sells clothes.

378
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,120
Her kid is almost 6

379
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,920
and studies at a kindergarten nearby.

380
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,480
She is named Xiang Lulu,

381
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,560
a stranger,

382
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,760
and lives in this house

383
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,960
for more than four years.

384
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,960
We have checked all information of her.

385
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,240
Nothing special.

386
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,480
She has no direct relationship

387
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,960
with Wu Keming.

388
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,040
So, she is basically cleared.

389
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,200
Mi Ka,

390
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,880
we two will be on duty

391
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,920
to care for the patient

392
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,920
tonight.

393
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,920
The old patient is easy to go wrong.

394
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,880
Okay.

395
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,120
I have no choice.

396
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,080
There will be two operations

397
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,400
in the ER in a while.

398
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,360
No one keeps you.

399
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,480
Hurry to the office and take a break.

400
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,840
Half an hour is good. Hurry up.

401
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,360
I really go to sleep.

402
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,640
Mi Ka,

403
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,200
wake up.

404
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,680
Make a call to Xing Kelei

405
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,440
or text him,

406
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,520
telling him you may not go home

407
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,000
tonight,

408
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,960
lest he is worried about you.

409
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,040
I haven’t checked my phone
for the day.

410
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,480
I don’t know if he has looked for me.

411
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,320
Use mine.

412
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,600
Thank you.

413
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:33,880
Sorry.

414
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,080
The phone you are calling
is powered off.

415
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,400
Why is it powered off?

416
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,400
Sorry.

417
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,600
The phone you are calling
is powered off.

418
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,800
Try it five minutes later.

419
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,680
You remind me of something.

420
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,320
(To: Xing Keyao)
See?

421
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,280
I’m eating.

422
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,760
Sorry I can’t have the dinner
with you tonight.

423
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,080
I’m confined.

424
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,480
(Xing Keyao)
You owe me. All of these.

425
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,280
Seven meals in total. No hurries.

426
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,240
You have a lifetime to pay me back.

427
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,640
Okay, I’ll pay you back

428
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,480
little by little.

429
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,280
I have to take care
of the patient first.

430
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
You can keep resting.

431
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,640
I go back to my office first.

432
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,760
I’ll fill in for you three hours later.

433
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,280
Eat something.

434
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,040
Got it.

435
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,960
Take this examination first.

436
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,440
Tell me after the result comes out.

437
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,200
Fine.

438
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,720
He came back specially this time.

439
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,760
Is it possible

440
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,280
due to his parents’ death anniversary
or something else?

441
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,200
Six years ago, his father died.

442
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,310
Four years ago,

443
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,350
his mother died.

444
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,720
By then he didn’t come back.

445
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,000
It seems

446
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,480
he isn’t a filial son.

447
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,240
Did your cameras

448
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,160
shoot this car?

449
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,840
Yes.

450
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,360
But its license plate was changed.

451
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,240
In our city,

452
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,160
there are few vehicles of this type.

453
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,600
So, we made such a judgment.

454
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,280
Any pictures? Let me have a look.

455
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,120
Here.

456
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,000
I think…

457
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,360
I think we can start from

458
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,720
Heisan.

459
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
It is closed here. You can’t pass.

460
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,640
It is closed here.

461
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,430
-Why can’t we enter?
-You can’t pass.

462
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,240
Why is it closed?

463
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,600
What happened?

464
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,840
You can’t enter.

465
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,000
Have you powered off your phones?

466
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,960
We didn’t power them on
since we came here.

467
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,320
Hurry to Mr. Shao.

468
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:17,840
In the NICU,

469
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,440
the patient on Bed 2
needs an operation right now.

470
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,600
You go to the operation room
for preparation.

471
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,240
I’ll be there right away.

472
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,720
Okay.

473
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,880
Keep a close eye on it.

474
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,680
Captain Xing.

475
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,960
This is Zhang from our team.

476
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,520
Hi.

477
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,360
Zhang,

478
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,400
please tell Captain Xing

479
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,280
about the situation inside.

480
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,000
Heisan is still playing Mahjong inside.

481
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,000
Those playing Mahjong inside

482
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,320
are all residents nearby.

483
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,160
We’re afraid if strangers go inside,

484
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,160
he will throw doubt on us.

485
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,760
So, we didn’t send people in.

486
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,680
How many exits?

487
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,400
Two.

488
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,680
One is here.

489
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,560
It’s an alley outside of the window.

490
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,000
Wenbo,

491
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,800
you and Captain Xu keep guard
in the front,

492
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,360
Luo Ting and other people in the back.

493
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,800
Yes.

494
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,360
Li Nian, Wenjing, Zhang,

495
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,080
follow me in.

496
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,000
Got it.

497
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,200
Okay, let’s go.

498
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,000
Well,

499
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,760
can’t you three

500
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,120
give me a break
when playing mahjong?

501
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,400
Every time I play with you,

502
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,680
I lose badly.

503
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,280
Don’t be kidding.

504
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,080
Nonsense!

505
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,680
Listen,

506
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,440
I even didn’t buy a new lipstick

507
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,600
this week.

508
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,520
If you win this time,

509
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,360
then you could

510
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,320
buy one.

511
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,520
Full, right?

512
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,960
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

513
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,440
You never give me a chance of winning.

514
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,120
One of bamboo.

515
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,440
What do you do?

516
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,200
Get out. Get out.

517
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,840
Damn it!

518
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,520
There are people in this room.

519
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,080
No place.

520
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,480
Bad luck.

521
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,120
There is a desk here.

522
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,240
There is a desk here.

523
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Let’s play here. Play here.

524
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,000
What about this desk?

525
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,080
It’s fine.

526
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,200
Good.

527
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,320
Good?

528
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,520
Freeze.

529
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,280
Police!

530
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,120
Police!

531
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,240
Sit down! Don’t move.

532
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,120
Don’t move.

533
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,040
-Don’t move.
-Keep down.

534
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,480
Don’t move.

535
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,400
Police! Be good.

536
00:21:59,520 --> 00:21:59,960
Come and help me.

537
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,520
Let go of me.

538
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,120
Don’t move.

539
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:03,920
Go.

540
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:04,960
Go.

541
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,120
Go. You go, too.

542
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,680
Stand up!

543
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,360
Stand up!

544
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,560
Go!

545
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,920
Hurry up!

546
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,720
I swear

547
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,840
I just stole a car

548
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,040
for Ming.

549
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,800
As for something else,

550
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,240
I really don’t know.

551
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,000
How did you contact him?

552
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
He contacted me.

553
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,880
I don’t have his number.

554
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,560
After that,

555
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,040
he never contacted me again.

556
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,320
Wu Keming is cunning

557
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,040
like a fox.

558
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,960
He must have to be prudent

559
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,600
because of something important.

560
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,520
What a pity!

561
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,000
The information we have now

562
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,080
is really little.

563
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,960
What time, which day, and where

564
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,840
did you meet?

565
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,240
The more detailed the better.

566
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,360
We met

567
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
at 8:30 PM on 13th.

568
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,400
He asked me to park the car

569
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,200
in the empty yard

570
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,440
opposite to the Xiaoxiang Wharf

571
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,280
and put the key in the glovebox.

572
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,520
Sir,

573
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,520
I followed him in the past.

574
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,480
But later he went to the south.

575
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,240
I know he dealt with big business.

576
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,920
I dare not get in touch with him.

577
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,440
Transfer the video clips

578
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,600
of places around Xiaogang Wharf

579
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,320
from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM on 13th.

580
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,400
Are there many people over there
at 8:30 PM?

581
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:23,880
Yes.

582
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,320
There are many food stalls.

583
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,200
Workers who work nearby

584
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,120
go there to have meals.

585
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,040
There are so many.

586
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,840
With few cameras and few lights,
it’s hard to find what we want.

587
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
After he drove the car,

588
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,440
did he change the license plate?

589
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,760
I have no idea.

590
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,760
My men stole it.

591
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,960
I didn’t do it.

592
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,840
I told them

593
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,520
it counts as long as
they parked the car there.

594
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,760
Did he disclose

595
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,160
where he lived

596
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,200
and why he came back?

597
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,440
He didn’t.

598
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,720
He’s lying.

599
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,760
You know he got involved

600
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,240
in many serious cases.

601
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,880
If you know something,

602
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,640
but you don’t tell us,

603
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,720
after we catch him,

604
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,400
we will punish you seriously.

605
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,680
I…

606
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,880
I heard

607
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,120
him say

608
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,520
that he would leave after 20th.

609
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,880
And

610
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,000
he might bring weapons with himself.

611
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,520
Is there any event on 20th

612
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,680
in the city?

613
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,600
I’ll let them to check

614
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,600
if there is any big event

615
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,080
on 20th in the city right now.

616
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,040
Take a break.

617
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,960
I’m on it.

618
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,740
(Outpatient)

619
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,120
Have an infusion
according to this dosage.

620
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,080
Okay.

621
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,160
Mr. Shao.

622
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,360
-Mr. Shao.
-Mr. Shao.

623
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,120
Captain.

624
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,600
You just had murderous look.

625
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,160
If so,

626
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,640
you have died many times.

627
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:43,920
You go out?

628
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,360
Someone is looking for Wu Keming.

629
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,280
Let me take a look.

630
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,080
That’s his sister.

631
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,800
His only relative here.

632
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,200
She’s only responsible
for collecting rent.

633
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
She lives in the neighboring community.

634
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:02,880
Captain Xing,

635
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,640
we get news.

636
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,600
Although Wu Keming has changed

637
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
the license number,

638
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,720
there is a remarkable logo

639
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,120
in the back.

640
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,120
The kid who stole it

641
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,480
has helped us recognize it.

642
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,440
We have found

643
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,440
all places

644
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,480
from the surveillance video

645
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,640
where this car once appeared.

646
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,440
They will send me it right away.

647
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,080
Okay.

648
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,080
Several hours later,

649
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,240
if no patient has an attack,

650
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,920
the quarantine can be released.

651
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,720
We finally go through this tough night.

652
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,880
Good luck. Amitabha.

653
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,560
I don’t have a fever, nor cough.

654
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,600
Knock on wood.

655
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,120
Don’t say such things.

656
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,640
I’m not afraid. I’m happy.

657
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,280
I find you not having a fever
nor a cough, either.

658
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,640
Every one of us is good.

659
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,600
Yes.

660
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,200
We are very lucky.

661
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,120
I finally can go home and sleep.

662
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,000
Yes, I was exhausted yesterday.

663
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,960
I want to lie in my bed at home.

664
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,240
Never thought

665
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,760
you are superstitious.

666
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,440
Who is superstitious?

667
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,000
Mr. Shao, have you eaten?

668
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,600
I have no appetite.

669
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,440
In our hospital,

670
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,760
90% of viruses can be isolated

671
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,880
by our measures.

672
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,280
It’s safe. Nothing to be afraid of.

673
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,280
Mr. Shao,

674
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,480
there are still some people

675
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,600
in bad luck.

676
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,480
Small probability event.

677
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,520
Don’t overthink it.

678
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,880
You are asking for trouble.

679
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,480
Right?

680
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,840
Where is Mi Ka?

681
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,000
She is in the Isolation Room.

682
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,320
I will send her food later.

683
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,440
I’ll go with you

684
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,680
and see the old madam at the same time.

685
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Okay.

686
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,360
Mi Ka. Here is the food.

687
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,120
Ready to change shifts.

688
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,800
Don’t come inside.

689
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,440
What’s wrong?

690
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,040
I cough and have a fever.

691
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:58,880
I have symptoms

692
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,320
that need to be isolated.

693
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,160
The patient is wearing a respirator.

694
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,440
Please make a judgement

695
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,320
if the patient needs to be isolated.

696
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,200
What the hell?

697
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,720
Protective suit.

698
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
We let our colleagues in the bureau

699
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,440
make an analysis.

700
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,640
Look.

701
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,720
In these four places,

702
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,320
namely, Xicheng, Lianyang,

703
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,920
Shanggang and Dongcheng,

704
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,720
his car

705
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,240
appeared often.

706
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,080
He travelled so many places.

707
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,000
I can’t see a pattern in it.

708
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,760
But I let my colleagues
in the technical section

709
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,240
make an analysis

710
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,240
based on the shooting frequency

711
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,640
of his car.

712
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,120
Look.

713
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,560
He can’t enter this area.

714
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,240
He ran frequently

715
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,080
around this area.

716
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,680
Exactly. This place

717
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,280
is Shuangjinger Village

718
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,360
where we are now.

719
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,480
His parents’ home

720
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
and his sister’s home

721
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,440
are all here.

722
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,240
He is deliberately

723
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,760
avoiding this place.

724
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,920
Could it be possible that

725
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,680
he comes here for his sister?

726
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,160
We have observed them for a long time.

727
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,120
He may have no connection

728
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,440
with his sister.

729
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,680
Could it be possible that

730
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,200
he has put something at his parents’ home
and he needs to take them?

731
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,520
Show me

732
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,440
Xiang Lulu’s information.

733
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,480
She runs an online store,

734
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,160
never goes out all the year around

735
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,760
and focuses on taking care of her kid.

736
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,560
By the way,

737
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,000
her kid

738
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,440
got some disease at childhood

739
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,840
and is always in bad condition.

740
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,800
We have checked it.

741
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,760
He often asked for leave

742
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,760
in the kindergarten.

743
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,200
Xiang Lulu

744
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,880
mainly focuses her efforts on her kid.

745
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,720
During this period,

746
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,600
are there many packages?

747
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,400
But there are many take-outs.

748
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,760
As for packages,

749
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,040
only once or twice.

750
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,360
Once or twice?

751
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,400
How long have you monitored them?

752
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,880
Almost four days.

753
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,120
In four days, one or two packages.

754
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,920
It seems no package yesterday.

755
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,440
If she runs an online store,

756
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,520
it’s abnormal.

757
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,160
Wenjing,

758
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,760
check

759
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,080
her online store.

760
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,800
Okay.

761
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,360
Captain Xing,

762
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,360
sure enough, there is a problem
with the store.

763
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,240
Generally,

764
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,720
an online clothes store

765
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,720
updates its clothes
every two or three days.

766
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,240
Even though Xiang Lulu

767
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,840
is an agent…

768
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,280
It means she takes orders

769
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,720
and asks the factory

770
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,200
to deliver goods.

771
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,720
It can explain

772
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,280
why she needn’t send packages.

773
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,360
But at least she should take orders.

774
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,240
In her store,

775
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,200
she didn’t take orders

776
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,400
within more than one month.

777
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,640
She didn’t update, either.

778
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,600
Only two or three pieces of clothes

779
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,880
for each update.

780
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,360
A store like this

781
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,080
is impossible to earn money,

782
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,000
let alone

783
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,240
raising her and her kid.

784
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,760
But she doesn’t have

785
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,760
another job.

786
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,480
Could it be possible that
she is kept as a mistress?

787
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,640
Which mistress lives

788
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,640
in such an old house?

789
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,680
We never see a man

790
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,600
come to her.

791
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,120
Try to place an order.

792
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,040
Okay.

793
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,160
Do you have any earlier information
about her?

794
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,920
Send me.

795
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,000
I have asked them to send.

796
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,480
Director Wei.

797
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,480
Mi Ka,

798
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,920
how do you feel?

799
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,480
A little dizzy.

800
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,630
My throat hurts a bit.

801
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,840
What’s going on with the patient?

802
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,040
Did he get infected by me?

803
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,320
You take a good rest.

804
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Don’t think too much.

805
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,800
The patient whom you took care of

806
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,630
doesn’t have symptoms

807
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,000
of fever and cough.

808
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,150
But according to the regulations,

809
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,630
we also isolated him.

810
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,710
You have to stay here

811
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,080
for 24 hours.

812
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,960
Mr. Shao is in the operation

813
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,880
upstairs.

814
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,560
He can’t come.

815
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,670
If you need anything,
please let me know.

816
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,920
I need my phone

817
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,600
and charger.

818
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
They may be on my office desk.

819
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,080
Okay.

820
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,080
I’ll have them sent

821
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,840
right away.

822
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,520
Okay.

823
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,840
Take a good rest.

824
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,560
If you need anything, just call me.

825
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,230
Okay.

826
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,600
Thank you, Director Wei.

827
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,960
Look at her sales records

828
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,760
of her store

829
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,560
in the past four years.

830
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,760
There are six or seven orders on average

831
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,320
in each month.

832
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,840
But the volume amounts are
over 20,000 yuan.

833
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,600
And only these account numbers

834
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,480
place orders.

835
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,720
The repurchase rate is high.

836
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,200
It’s abnormal.

837
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,960
Could it be possible that

838
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,520
the same person places order?

839
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,280
It’s possible.

840
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,440
And her logistics numbers

841
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,240
are all fake.

842
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,080
That means

843
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
someone gives her money for nothing.

844
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,860
(Lulu: Sorry, the clothes you ordered)

845
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,860
(is out of stock.
You can cancel your order.)

846
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,400
Cancel the order.

847
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,920
It’s clear that she doesn’t
want this deal.

848
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,120
Xiang Lulu and Wu Keming

849
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,080
moved around in Guangxi
and other regions nearby

850
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,280
in early years.

851
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,840
And Xiang Lulu

852
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,480
was arrested by the police before.

853
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,240
So, I doubt

854
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,880
they two

855
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,040
know each other.

856
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,880
Even

857
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,840
this kid

858
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,440
could be Wu Keming’s.

859
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,720
Mi Ka.

860
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,640
How is it? Feel better?

861
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,640
A little fever.

862
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,000
Nothing else.

863
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,960
I bring your phone and charger

864
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,880
for you.

865
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,760
Your phone has been charged.

866
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,080
You can use it once you power it on.

867
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,520
If you need anything,

868
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,880
text me at any time.

869
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,520
By the way,

870
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,360
there is a kettle

871
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,160
in the cabinet over there.

872
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,600
Boil water yourself.

873
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,120
Go out.

874
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,120
Don’t be afraid.

875
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,920
Among these people,
only you get affected.

876
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,000
You’re not so lucky.

877
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,240
Just go.

878
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,360
Call me.

879
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:38,960
Okay.

880
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,260
(Xing Kelei: I have something to do
in the team, so, I can’t go back.)

881
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,340
(Xing Kelei)

882
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,560
Sorry.

883
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,880
The phone you are calling
is powered off.

884
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,480
The phone you are calling
is powered off.

885
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,600
(TO: Xing Kelei)
Xing Kelei,

886
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,480
I was isolated.

887
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,120
Yesterday, in the ER,
there was a patient suspected of

888
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,000
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.

889
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,040
I contacted with the patient in the ER.

890
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,400
Today, I got a fever.

891
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,360
In front of my colleagues,

892
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,800
I can’t say I’m scared.

893
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,960
If I really got affected,

894
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,280
I don’t know what to do.

895
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,840
After seeing my message,

896
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,560
call me back, okay?

897
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,680
(TO: Ruan Qingxia)
Xia,

898
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,800
I was isolated.

899
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,120
Wish me good luck.

900
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,000
Mom, I want to watch cartoons.

901
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,800
It doesn’t work.

902
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,240
You made it broken.

903
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,320
See? Nothing.

904
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,560
Who’s knocking?

905
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,720
Anybody home?

906
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,720
Who are you looking for?

907
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,520
I’m the maintenance personnel

908
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,720
of cable TV in Lucheng.

909
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,480
You called us and said that
your TV went wrong.

910
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,440
It’s me.

911
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,720
My TV was normal

912
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,320
at the beginning.

913
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,920
All of a sudden, there was no signal.

914
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,200
I don’t know what happened.

915
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,760
Let me take a look.

916
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,800
Come inside.

917
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,480
Okay.

918
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,960
It’s here.

919
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,800
You take a look.

920
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,480
My kid is watching cartoons.

921
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,160
All of a sudden, there is no signal.

922
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,000
I didn’t press any button.

923
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,440
Is there a problem with the cable?

924
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,160
Maybe

925
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,680
your router goes wrong.

926
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,160
Router?

927
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,080
I haven’t used it

928
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,560
for a long time.

929
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,640
You are so naughty!

930
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,000
Don’t play it randomly.

931
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,240
Is there a problem?

932
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,360
Can’t you let me

933
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,560
free from worry?

934
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,120
Don’t make trouble.

935
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,440
Look at the mess that you made.

936
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,520
Hurry up. Don’t touch it.

937
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,120
Sit here.

938
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,920
Take this.

939
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,600
Play with this.

940
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,680
Can you fix it?

941
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,520
Almost done.

942
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,320
Wait a moment.

943
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:48,920
It’s done.

944
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,800
Your router doesn’t work.

945
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,200
I replace it with a new one.

946
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,840
How much?

947
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,760
Free.

948
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,280
Our company holds an activity

949
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,080
towards old customers.

950
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:58,840
It’s free.

951
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,120
Sign your name here.

952
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,040
Here?

953
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,200
Right, sigh here.

954
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,320
Alright.

955
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,120
If your TV goes wrong again,

956
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,000
call me.

957
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,480
Let me send you out.

958
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,800
What’s the matter?

959
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,920
The router goes wrong.

960
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,360
I ask someone to fix it.

961
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,720
Okay.

962
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,720
Take care.

963
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
Well,

964
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,120
you should pay for it yourself.

965
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,440
It’s time

966
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,840
to pay the rent this month.

967
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,640
Okay. I get the money for you.

968
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:47,840
How is it going?

969
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,760
Look.

970
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,080
His sister planned to open the door

971
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,440
with the key.

972
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,920
But after seeing you,

973
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,520
she hid the key.

974
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,560
Right.

975
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
When I was about to go out,

976
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,960
I heard the sound of opening the door

977
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,920
with the key.

978
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,000
In normal circumstance,

979
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
it’s impossible for the landlord

980
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,920
to directly open the door

981
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,440
of the tenant with the key.

982
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,640
That’s right.

983
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,320
And she also said the rent.

984
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,480
It seems she deliberately

985
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,000
wants you to hear that.

986
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,520
It’s clear she is pretending.

987
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,680
Director Wei.

988
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,480
39 degrees Celsius. Still high.

989
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,600
Take her temperature again
four hours later.
