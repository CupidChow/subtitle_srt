is at my place.

Tonight?

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,470
It’s half past eight.
It’s not a good time.

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,320
No worries. Only Kelei is in the house.

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,280
Well.

it till today

36
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,160
when you sent the camera to me, right?

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,320
No.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,360
I never thought of that.

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,760

not send it

41
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,600
to you.

42
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,000
I’m tired.

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
How are you feeling?
You must be hungry.

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,840
I’ve bought a lot of food.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,880
Go to my place
and let me make some food for you.

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,680
What will you make?

47
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,080
Mr. Shao.

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,440
Hello, Mr. Shao. Hello, Keyao.

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,480
Keyao.

50
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,200
I...

51
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,320
come here to fetch something.

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,480
Hmm...

53
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,440
She’s here for a free meal.

54
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Yes.

55
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,920
Why did you go downstairs?

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,360
It’s late.
I went to pick up my girlfriend.

57
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,760
What are you laughing at?

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,800
Come on.

59
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,720
Feel free to look around.

60
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,950
This

61
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,960
is the style you like, right?

62
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,360
Yes.

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,000
But it looks smaller

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
than your house abroad.

65
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,400
Yes, more or less.

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,560
Follow me. I’ll get it to you.

67
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,600
What are you doing?

68
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,320
They went in there.

69
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,760
Both of them?

70
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,360
What’s going on?

71
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,320
Yes, what are they doing there?

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,400
I didn’t know

73
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,760
Mr. Shao will come today.

74
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,880
I only know that

75
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,240
they will go out for a meal today,

76
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,040
but I didn’t know they will eat here.

77
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,240
Judging by their progress,

78
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,320
soon I won’t call him mister,

79
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,880
but brother-in-law.

80
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,040
Let’s leave.

81
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,760
Didn’t you say you will

82
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,080
cook a table of dishes for me?

83
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,760
We don’t have much time.

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Do you know

85
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,560
when they two have...?

86
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960
Can it be that

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,280
they start to flirt with each other

88
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,000
when I was having the surgery?

89
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,160
No.

90
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,360
It’s about that time.

91
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,680
Mr. Shao had a call coming in

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,440
and he just smiled and said

93
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
he would go out for a meal.

94
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,080
So it was Keyao.

95
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,920
Can’t it be that
they just fall into each other?

96
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,720
I found it.

97
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,760
Are you planning a journey
to South Africa?

98
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,200
Yes, just go and look around.

99
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,680
Here you are.

100
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,200
What’s in this box?

101
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,800
Objects that will waste

102
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,960
your time if you want a look.

103
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,840
Come in.

104
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,920
Mr. Shao, have some water.

105
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,320
Thank you.

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,920
You’re thoughtful, Xing Kelei.

107
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,160
What’s this?

108
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,480
Your sister just said

109
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,000
it’s a box that will

110
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,800
waste me a lot of time

111
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,920
if I open it.

112
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,960
Xing Kelei,

113
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,760
Mr. Shao will leave soon.

114
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,240
Go back to Mi Ka.

115
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,400
Don’t bother us here.

116
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,160
No, if my sister says such,

117
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,080
then I must have a look at it,

118
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,880
or I’m sure I’ll regret it.

119
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,280
Xing Kelei.

120
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:23,960
Get out.

121
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,120
I haven’t seen this before.

122
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,000
It must have something in it.

123
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,800
Get out, Xing Kelei.

124
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,160
Can I have a look?

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,720
Yes.

126
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,120
Okay.

127
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,600
I think I’d better

128
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,840
leave now and go to my bed.

129
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,960
I’m a bit sleepy.

130
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,920
All right?

131
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,120
What’s that matter?

132
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,320
If you leave,

133
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,360
I’ll feel embarrassed

134
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,920
staying here alone.

135
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,960
Then what should we do?

136
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,320
I’m sick of it.

137
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,920
You even have an accent now.

138
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,000
Listen,

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,790
I feel really

140
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,790
sorry for my sister.

141
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,360
Why?

142
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,520
She’s nearly 40
but hasn’t gotten married.

143
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
I must be responsible for it.

144
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,760
It’s not all your responsibility.

145
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,880
Who will live with his sister

146
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,120
at such an old age?

147
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,800
Look, when others come here

148
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,560
and see a big boy like me

149
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,320
sitting here,

150
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,160
they must feel embarrassed.

151
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,400
I think

152
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,840
it’s because of me

153
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,880
that Mr. Shao has been

154
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,720
hesitating to date my sister.

155
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,840
I don’t think

156
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,000
you’re that important.

157
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,240
No, I tell you,

158
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,800
just a few days ago,

159
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,560
I saw my sister took out

160
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,320
her school uniform,

161
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,800
put it on and whirled around,

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,440
smiling like a silly.

163
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,160
Listen, if they fail
to get back together,

164
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,160
my sister will go mad.

165
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,160
But Mr. Shao
looks well these days.

166
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,720
I heard nurses said

167
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,840
he has been

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,440
happy and cheerful recently.

169
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,160
No, well.

170
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,040
Look,

171
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,280
they’ve been in there for a long time

172
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,880
and haven’t come out.

173
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,680
I can’t just sit here

174
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,640
like a third wheel.

175
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,240
My handwriting

176
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,480
was good back then.

177
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,560
That’s what you get

178
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,640
after looking at them so long?

179
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,680
What’s wrong with

180
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,680
Kelei today?

181
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,560
I feel he’s strange.

182
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,960
He just uses you as an excuse.

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,720
Excuse?

184
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,480
It’s 10:00 PM.

185
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,760
He hasn’t left at 10:00 PM.

186
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,080
That means he wants me to leave.

187
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,480
Forget it. I’ll leave.

188
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Where can you go?

189
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,560
Back to the team.

190
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Will you stay over
in the team tonight?

191
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,840
What else can I do?

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,120
It seems dangerous to

193
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,160
drive on the road at late night.

194
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,920
And I haven’t fully

195
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,280
recovered myself.

196
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,400
You can leave now.

197
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,920
Okay.

198
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,640
Go.

199
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,400
Wait a minute.

200
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:35,920
This...

201
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,840
You may ask for a night’s stay
at your neighbor’s place.

202
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,360
That seems wrong.

203
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,280
Well, forget it.

204
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,840
Let’s go.

205
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,040
Fine, it’s late.

206
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,880
I need to go.

207
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,240
Hmm...

208
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Will you take them away?

209
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,720
I’ll take the digital camera.

210
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,920
I’ll figure out

211
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,880
how to export

212
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,640
the data in it.

213
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,080
What about the others?

214
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,680
Others?

215
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,440
These?

216
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,640
I don’t want others
to see them for now.

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,800
So,

218
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,120
if I want to look at them,

219
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,200
I’ll come here.

220
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,160
You’re always welcome.

221
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,120
Well.

222
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,360
I’m leaving.

223
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,120
I need to use the bathroom.

224
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,480
I’m finally back.

225
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,160
You’re finished?

226
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,760
When did you

227
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,760
fall in love with Beijing opera?

228
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,520
What were you doing?

229
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,320
I just get back home.

230
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Make the bed yourself.

231
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,160
I’ll leave you alone.

232
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,160
Okay.

233
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,720
And,

234
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,880
remember the three rules
between us.

235
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,560
You know what the rules are.

236
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,720
Good night.

237
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,440
Good night.

238
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,080
Want to restrain me?

239
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,400
I’ll do whatever I like.

240
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,280
Morning.

241
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,040
Morning.

242
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,240
What are you doing?

243
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,120
I’m going to work.

244
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,520
I’m going to work, too.

245
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,320
Are you a man?

246
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,040
I should go first.

247
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,680
No.

248
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,680
I... no, no.

249
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,120
I need to do the routine.

250
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Xing Kelei, get out.

251
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
My door.

252
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,200
The canteen

253
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,920
has rips.

254
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,120
Why did you come here

255
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,360
to order some peanuts?

256
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,960
You said you would
treat me to a meal.

257
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,000
If it’s in the canteen,

258
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
that can’t be a treat.

259
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,000
Okay, hurry to eat.

260
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,080
I have other things this afternoon.

261
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,040
How about your wounds?

262
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,000
Almost recovered.

263
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
What’s your plan

264
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,400
with Mi Ka?

265
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,040
Plan?

266
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,200
Isn’t it that
the prince and the princess

267
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,920
will live happily ever after?

268
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,360
Aren’t you going

269
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,600
to participate in the combat?

270
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,480
Do you have time
to get well-prepared for it?

271
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,320
In this case,

272
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,840
I’ll try my best.

273
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,600
If I can’t do it this year,
I can prepare for the next year.

274
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,120
You get a mature attitude now.

275
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,680
In the past,
you would say you must win,

276
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,320
or it’s impossible for you to lose.

277
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,120
Mi Ka has changed me.

278
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,280
Look at her.

279
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,640
Her attitude towards work

280
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,520
is very simple.

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,360
She just wants to be a good doctor.

282
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,920
When we chose

283
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,200
to policemen,

284
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,400
we didn’t think much, either.

285
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,320
We didn’t say

286
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,400
we must win the competition

287
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,080
or we must tell people

288
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,960
how good we are.

289
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,360
We just wanted to

290
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,400
realize our value at the front line

291
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,520
and make some contribution

292
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,440
to the society.

293
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,120
I now have reclaimed

294
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,160
my original dream.

295
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,520
So,

296
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,280
I may need to invite Mi Ka

297
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,960
to give a speech
on the heroic modal meeting.

298
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,840
I hear that the police unit

299
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,320
is looking for a lecturer.

300
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,240
Why not have a try?

301
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,000
I just told you that

302
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,360
I want to serve at the front line.

303
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,320
I know.

304
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,120
But if you work at the front line,

305
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,840
you have to work on shifts
and run errands.

306
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,960
And Mi Ka is a doctor.

307
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Just think about it.

308
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,560
If you hadn’t been

309
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
in the recovery period,

310
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,920
can you always live at home?

311
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,760
And, as I notice,

312
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,560
you’re passionately in love.

313
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,560
You can’t live a day

314
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,120
without her.

315
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,240
If you’re back to the normal work,

316
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,040
you will certainly miss her.

317
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,200
Sorry to keep you waiting.

318
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,880
Enjoy yourselves.

319
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,320
Forget it. Enjoy the food.

320
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,960
Follow me.

321
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,360
This has nothing to do with you.

322
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,080
Shu Wenbo,

323
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,320
if you don’t like Xia,

324
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,880
please stay away from her.

325
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Don’t use her as bait.

326
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,840
Please respect her.

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,200
I don’t respect her?

328
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,440
It’s you who has been fooling her.

329
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,120
What are you doing?

330
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,080
Nothing.

331
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,440
I just hate to see

332
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,520
a man as dull as you.

333
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,080
You can’t even admit
that you like her.

334
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,080
Are you a man?

335
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,040
What on earth do you want?

336
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,440
I just want to ask you,

337
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,240
do you like Xia?

338
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,560
Whether I like her or not

339
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,160
is my own business.

340
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,840
What does it have to do with you?

341
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,720
You won’t take the responsibility

342
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,600
yet you won’t let her go.

343
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,760
You can’t even admit

344
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,480
that you like her.

345
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,120
I look down on you!

346
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,160
I like Xia.

347
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,160
I admit I like Xia.

348
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,600
What’s up?

349
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,520
Then why don’t you cherish her
if you like her?

350
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,720
Why do you remain silent
if you like her?

351
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,920
Who says I don’t cherish her?

352
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,400
Stop fighting.

353
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,400
You’re the police.

354
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,240
Do you want to be fired?

355
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
I told her I love her
and she just rejected me.

356
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,720
Why?

357
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,640
For the sake of whom?

358
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,240
She doesn’t like me.

359
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,680
Is this why you picked a fight?

360
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,400
And you.

361
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,280
You’re a man of charm.

362
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,800
What kind of charm has he got?

363
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,000
He won’t admit what he has done,

364
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,760
and what he has said.

365
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,480
I...

366
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,640
What did Xia say?

367
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,480
Don’t ask me.
Ask her if you want to know.

368
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,760
If you don’t want to tell him,
you won’t come here.

369
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,120
Tell us. Don’t be mean.

370
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,960
I’m not as generous as you thought.

371
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,520
She said

372
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,040
we’re just good friends.

373
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,320
We can do whatever
we like together,

374
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,280
but that’s not love.

375
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,800
I’ve come

376
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,040
because I want to tell you.

377
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,160
If you like Xia,

378
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,680
you should tell her bravely.

379
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,600
If you don’t like her,

380
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
please stay away from her.

381
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,040
Don’t intervene in her affairs.

382
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,920
Although I...

383
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,120
Yes.

384
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,520
I like her but she doesn’t like me.

385
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,400
But I still wish her to be happy.

386
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,360
I don’t like to see her
feel sad for you.

387
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,200
Right.

388
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,360
Listen to what he said.

389
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,280
How can you be beaten up

390
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,080
by Lu Feng?

391
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,440
If you have any questions,

392
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,920
you can ask me or Mi Ka.

393
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,400
Do you know what is Weibo?

394
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,400
I know.

395
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,120
If you want to date her,

396
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,080
you should carefully

397
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,080
look at her Weibo posts

398
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,480
and see what she likes.

399
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
Do you understand?

400
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,560
I will look when I’m back.

401
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,480
What is this?

402
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,720
I’ll make the noodles for you tonight.

403
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,840
They taste brilliant.

404
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,240
It’s not healthy

405
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,480
to eat instant noodles.

406
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,040
If you eat them, you’re the dog.

407
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,320
Why don’t you speak?

408
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,800
You can’t promise you won’t eat,
right?

409
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,080
Never mind what I said.

410
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,520
Shu Wenbo.

411
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,840
(Shu Wenbo)
Why did he call me?

412
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,480
Hello.

413
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,840
Mi Ka.

414
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,120
Sorry.

415
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,480
Are you available for a few minutes?

416
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,800
I want to ask you something.

417
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,880
Is it about Xia?

418
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,680
Yes.

419
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,840
I saw she posted

420
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
on Weibo that she likes

421
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,880
a thing...

422
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,200
but I can’t

423
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,280
figure out what it is.

424
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,400
So I want to ask you.

425
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,360
Do you mean

426
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,280
the chinchilla?

427
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
Yes. Yes. Yes.

428
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,240
That’s it.

429
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,440
It’s a toy

430
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,640
released by Konatsu.

431
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,760
It’s a soldier cat.

432
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,120
Xia likes it.

433
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,480
Where can I

434
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,200
buy the toy

435
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,880
chinchilla?

436
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,480
The domestic market
doesn’t sell that.

437
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,280
You need to find a buying agent.

438
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,280
Fine, I got it.

439
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,240
Do you know where
can you find a buying agent?

440
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,600
No worries.

441
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,720
I can settle it myself.

442
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,040
Don’t promise too much.

443
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,040
I know.

444
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,360
Well, thank you, Mi Ka.

445
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
You’re welcome.

446
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,200
What’s up?

447
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,160
What has stimulated him?

448
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,880
It is just that

449
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,080
he’s jealous of

450
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,600
Lu Feng chasing after Xia,

451
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,760
so he will ask her out too.

452
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,640
Why didn’t anybody else ask me out

453
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,640
to make you jealous?

454
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,480
What are you thinking?

455
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,480
But I think

456
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,040
Shu Wenbo may have
chosen the wrong time.

457
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,000
Xia has been as calm
as still water recently.

458
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,040
She doesn’t want to see any men.

459
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,920
Really?

460
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,960
I think she means it.

461
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,280
Then it can just

462
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,280
put Shu Wenbo into the test.

463
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,880
Does he still need that?

464
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,520
If he has been as good as me,

465
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,360
he won’t

466
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
have the trouble.

467
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,480
I’ll cook the beefsteak later.

468
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,640
That will be a torment
to the beefsteak.

469
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,440
Are you going to

470
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,760
make some dried beef for me?

471
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,160
Are you angry?

472
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,320
Anger will make you lose vitality.

473
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,120
I’ll buy you

474
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,320
a bottle of your ARTEA

475
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,920
to give you more vitality.

476
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,440
Buy a box.

477
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Fine, buy a box.

478
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,160
I’ll keep it

479
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,080
on my note

480
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,000
that you’ve made another mistake.

481
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,920
Kelei.

482
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,120
Sis, Kelei is here.

483
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,080
Lei.

484
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,120
Jianing, what happened to your legs?

485
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,800
You...

486
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,440
You are...?

487
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,880
They’re daughters of Captain Shen.

488
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,360
This is my girlfriend, Mi Ka.

489
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,960
Nice to meet you, Mi Ka.

490
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,840
Nice to meet you, too.

491
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,920
Well...

492
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,520
Have you gone to the hospital?

493
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,880
Yes.

494
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,600
What did they say?

495
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,600
Why not come in and talk?

496
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,560
Yes, we should talk inside.

497
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,640
Let’s go.

498
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
What happened?

499
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,800
Kelei,

500
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,640
since my father left,

501
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,840
our life hasn’t been

502
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,360
very easy.

503
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,160
Last year, my sister had a car incident

504
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,920
on the way back from her night shift.

505
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,640
Her legs haven’t fully recovered

506
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,200
after being discharged,

507
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,560
and since last month,

508
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,240
she can’t even walk.

509
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,080
I’m afraid my sister will...

510
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,000
We have no idea

511
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,920
what should we do

512
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,120
in the future.

513
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,400
Mi Ka is a doctor.

514
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,640
You should go to the hospital

515
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,480
for an examination

516
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,680
and see what’s going on.

517
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
Tomorrow I’ll give you...

518
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,720
Thank you, Kelei.

519
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,640
Thank you very much.

520
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,880
Thank you, Mi Ka.

521
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,600
Sorry to have bothered you.

522
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,520
It’s nothing.

523
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,400
You can talk.

524
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,840
I’ll make some food for you.

525
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,800
You can talk.

526
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,000
Lei,

527
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,400
where is the bathroom?

528
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,960
I want to wash my face.

529
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,280
This way.

530
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,200
Here, go in.

531
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,720
Be careful.

532
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,360
Kelei,

533
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,640
when should we go to the hospital?

534
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,760
Can I leave my luggage at your place?

535
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,400
If my sister is hospitalized,

536
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,520
I can just

537
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,640
make a bed on the ground.

538
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,360
You don’t need to

539
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:38,880
prepare anything for me.

540
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,560
I’ve brought all with me.

541
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,200
Lei.

542
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,520
Sorry to have bothered you.

543
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,960
I’m sorry for that.

544
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,760
Today is the weekend.

545
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,480
Doctors may not be able
to see you today.

546
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
But it may be inconvenient

547
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,440
if you stay here.

548
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,520
How about this?

549
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,040
I will book a hotel for you.

550
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,000
We can’t afford the expense.

551
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,760
And it’s not right to use your money.

552
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,080
I’ll just sleep

553
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,960
on the ground.

554
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,520
That can save a lot of money.

555
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,360
We can find a hotel

556
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,080
near the hospital.

557
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,040
It will be more convenient.

558
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,680
I still think if we stay in the hotel...

559
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,800
Jianan,

560
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,800
we should listen to Lei.

561
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,200
You need to rest well at night.

562
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,400
Whatever he says is right.

563
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,040
Lei,

564
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,840
we’ll follow your instructions.

565
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,520
Okay.

566
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,840
I’ll make some noodles for you.

567
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,280
You can eat some before you leave.

568
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,040
Are you making noodles?

569
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,000
Didn’t you just say that

570
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
we’ll have noodles?

571
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,040
Hmm... it’s an unexpected visit.

572
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,920
Unexpected... well...

573
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,680
I’ll explain it to you

574
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,960
after I help them settle down.

575
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,000
Never mind.

576
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,840
Go and keep their company.

577
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,720
I can help you.

578
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,000
No need.

579
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,080
Sis,

580
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,920
how could it be?

581
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,920
Shen Jianan,

582
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,000
put away

583
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,960
your frowny face.

584
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,360
Please, Jianing.

585
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,440
Lei,

586
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,040
when I see you,

587
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,240
I recall the custom
we had when we were kids.

588
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,600
In our family,

589
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,520
we used to fill Lei’s bowl first.

590
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,560
Her father was polite.

591
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,040
No.

592
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,920
He would only be nice to you.

593
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Mi Ka,

594
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,080
sorry to have bothered you

595
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,480
to cook dinner for us.

596
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,520
You’re welcome.

597
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,880
This is what I should do.

598
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,360
We just suddenly visited here.

599
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,280
Have we disturbed you?

600
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,520
No.

601
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,120
We will be staying at home

602
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,000
at weekends anyway.

603
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,200
We don’t go out.

604
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,400
Jianan has been abrupt.

605
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,640
Don’t worry.

606
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,000
We won’t stay at your home.

607
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,120
Please eat.

608
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,600
Yes.

609
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,480
Eat some food.

610
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,080
Wait a moment.

611
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,160
Lei,

612
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,920
I’m thirsty.

613
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,800
Sorry.

614
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,160
Shall I take you around?

615
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,440
This room is big,

616
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,560
so it’s convenient for you

617
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,640
to go around.

618
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,480
Like the bathroom door

619
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,320
is wide enough for the wheelchair

620
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,120
to go in.

621
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,120
Lei, thank you.

622
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,480
Is this close to your place?

623
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,360
Not very far.

624
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,040
About seven or eight kilometers.

625
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,520
Will it be laborious

626
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,840
for you to go between

627
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,880
every day?

628
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,800
I drive a car.
It’s not laborious at all.

629
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,400
Where is Jianan?

630
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,560
She said she got out for a call.

631
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,240
I’ll wait for her.

632
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,000
Lei,

633
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,040
since my father passed away,

634
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,360
it has been years
since we met last time

635
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,520
and it’s under such a circumstance.

636
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
Thank you.

637
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,880
Generally,

638
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,920
the police unit can’t

639
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,440
leave you alone in such a situation.

640
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,960
Sis.

641
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,600
What’s up?

642
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,720
What did you say to her?

643
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,040
I was just asking about

644
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,120
your current situation.

645
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,280
Kelei,

646
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,680
my mother died early, you know it.

647
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,320
After my father left,

648
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,000
we’re completely on our own.

649
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,840
I failed to be admitted to a good school

650
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,240
and didn’t get a good job.

651
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
The police unit does give
us some allowances.

652
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
But it’s all my fault.

653
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,480
I lost all the savings

654
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,920
when running a small business,

655
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,560
so when my sister
had the incident, we...

656
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,680
Did the driver escape?

657
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,640
No.

658
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,440
He didn’t escape

659
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,840
and he has assumed his liability,

660
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,840
but his family owes over
one million to others.

661
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,280
They’re poor.

662
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
I can’t force him to give
us more money.

663
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,680
Since you’re here,

664
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,760
we should treat your legs first.

665
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,760
I’m here. Don’t worry.

666
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,760
Sis.

667
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,920
What’s up?

668
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,920
I’ve brought the medicine.

669
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,080
What's wrong?

670
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,880
I remember I took it.

671
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,200
Why can’t I find it?

672
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,480
What medicine? I’ll go and buy them.

673
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,160
Send the names to me.

674
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,120
I...

675
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,880
Send them to me.

676
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,920
If it’s serious,

677
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,600
just call me.

678
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,520
I’ll take her to the hospital.

679
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,440
Okay.

680
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,640
Sis,

681
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,960
I remember I took it.

682
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,720
Why...?

683
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,760
I have them.

684
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,200
You nearly frightened me to death.

685
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,040
Can’t you tell me

686
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,280
in advance?

687
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,880
Send the names to Kelei.

688
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,640
What do you mean?

689
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,960
Xing Kelei is hurry to go home

690
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,240
and explain it to his girlfriend.

691
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,960
I don’t want him to go back early.

692
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,600
As you’ve mentioned,

693
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,040
I’d also like to know

694
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,520
that he had been single

695
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,200
for so many years,

696
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320
why he just suddenly
gets a girlfriend?

697
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,560
If we knew it earlier,

698
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,920
we would not turn to him

699
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,880
in a haste.

700
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,560
When fate makes us to suffer,

701
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,160
there’s no use to complain.

702
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,200
We need to find a way

703
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,440
to solve the problem.

704
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,480
How?

705
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,480
Didn’t you see that

706
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,400
there is all her stuff

707
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,320
in the bathroom?

708
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,960
They must have been living together

709
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,560
for a long time.

710
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,920
In my opinion,

711
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,320
Xing Kelei is really

712
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,160
into that girl.

713
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,720
She even knows well

714
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,160
about our father.

715
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,720
That means Xing Kelei

716
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,560
has given his heart to her.

717
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,440
Perhaps they will

718
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,720
get married.

719
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,680
Married?

720
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,640
It won’t be that easy.

721
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
His family asks a lot

722
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,160
of his wife.

723
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
And his sister

724
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,640
won’t be easy to tackle with.

725
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
Don’t you remember

726
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,880
how Xing Keyao scolded us?

727
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,560
Don’t mention it, sis.

728
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,640
I even feel frightened

729
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,680
when I think of her.

730
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,880
I hope we won’t run into
her this time.

731
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,000
No wonder.

732
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
With such

733
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,040
a horrible sister,

734
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,920
it won’t be easy for Xing Kelei

735
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,000
to date a girl.

736
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,360
Right.

737
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,560
So,

738
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,160
this Mi Ka

739
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,080
may not be his last one.

740
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,540
(Yishoutang Drugstore)

741
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,880
This medicine is in short supply.

742
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,920
We haven’t gotten them

743
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,670
for over two months.

744
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,150
You’d better check on

745
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,040
other stores.

746
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
But isn’t Mi Ka

747
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,710
his girlfriend?

748
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,120
Girlfriend?

749
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,440
If I didn’t leave,

750
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,360
I would be his girlfriend.

751
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,320
Any use of saying it?

752
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,150
What can I do?

753
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,280
We thought

754
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,040
Xing Kelei was single,

755
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,120
so after we spent all our money

756
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,280
and had nowhere to go,

757
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,230
we thought that

758
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,800
given how our father treated him

759
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,560
and your childhood friendship,

760
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,360
he could pay your medical fees,

761
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,120
look after you,

762
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,920
and by the way, look after

763
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,920
me, his sister-in-law.

764
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,040
This is his hometown.

765
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,560
His family must have many friends here

766
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,720
and know some people of power.

767
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,920
It’s easy for him

768
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,160
to take care of us.

769
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,040
So, this is the best

770
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,080
solution for us.

771
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,640
Yes.

772
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,280
But he suddenly

773
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,360
gets a girlfriend.

774
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,440
What should we do?

775
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,600
I’m having a meeting. Be short.

776
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,400
Look at your phone.

777
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,520
Do you have this medicine?

778
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,120
It’s out of stock.

779
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,280
But it has a substitute.

780
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,680
I’ll send the name to you later.

781
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,880
Who will use this?

782
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,760
A friend of mine.

783
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,560
But the substitute

784
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,480
is not easy to buy, either.

785
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,760
I’m busy now.

786
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,080
You can check on the drugstores,

787
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,360
or I’ll ask my friends.

788
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,360
All right. Bye.

789
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:39,880
Sis,

790
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,280
I think we need to

791
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,720
change our strategy.

792
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,760
Do you have any ideas?

793
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,520
My idea is first

794
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,000
you need to control well

795
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,240
your emotion.

796
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,440
You make mistakes
when you’re anxious.

797
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
So, you must not be abrupt.

798
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,920
Fine, I know.

799
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,800
Sis,

800
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,200
what about Xing Kelei...

801
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,800
He won’t get back

802
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,600
so quickly.

803
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,360
If we can’t live in his house,

804
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,080
we will stop him from
going back early.

805
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,960
People are easy

806
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,440
to misunderstand each other.

807
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,200
I don’t believe

808
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,360
that Mi Ka will be a saint.

809
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,120
However,

810
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,880
I need to think about it.

811
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,360
Is your head hurting again?

812
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,100
(Mr. Xing)

813
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,720
Hello.

814
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,440
How is your process?

815
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,760
They’re in the hotel.

816
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,680
I need to buy them some medicine.

817
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,640
I think I’m going to be a bit late.

818
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,400
Okay, come back
when you finish the job.

819
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,520
No hurries.

820
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,720
I...

821
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,200
That’s cool.

822
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,000
What did you say?

823
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,240
No, I’m watching a surgery treating

824
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,840
craniomaxillofacial deformities.

825
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,320
Brilliant. Really.

826
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,800
What’s wrong with your voice?

827
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,400
I’m eating the duck neck.

828
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,960
Hm... you won’t...

829
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,160
Are you driving?

830
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,400
Yes.

831
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,360
I have a traffic jam.

832
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,320
I don’t see a car moving.

833
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,600
That’s not right, either.

834
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,000
Don’t make calls when driving.

835
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,040
We can talk when you’re back. Bye.

836
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,720
Okay.

837
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,920
Is she angry or not?

838
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,320
Please come in.

839
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,960
She is in the room.

840
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,760
Sleeping?

841
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,400
She was lying there for a while.

842
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,760
The same type of medicine
and same effect.

843
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,680
Kelei, thank you.

844
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,120
I will go if nothing else.

845
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,680
Kelei,

846
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,560
I want to tell you something.

847
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,080
Okay.

848
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,720
Kelei,

849
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,840
if you don’t have other business,

850
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,800
can you stay here a bit longer

851
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,760
to keep her company?

852
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,080
It’s late now.
I’m afraid it’s not appropriate.

853
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,400
She will speak of pessimistic things

854
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,520
every time she gets a headache.

855
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,920
How long has she been like this?

856
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,600
It happens irregularly.

857
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,760
It’s like hell when it hurts.

858
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,160
The medicine could only
help for a while.

859
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,840
Every time she gets a headache,

860
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,160
she will lose confidence

861
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,320
of her health.

862
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,960
She was just saying

863
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,400
that she would go home
instead of seeing doctors.

864
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,080
She said it would be a waste of time.

865
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
I’ll stay here a bit longer.

866
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,920
Kelei, thank you.

867
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,520
Now you’re the only one

868
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,960
that can reassure her beside me.

869
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,160
I’m with her every day.

870
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,120
No wonder she’s tired
of my lecturing.

871
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,000
I’ll go to the supermarket downstairs

872
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
and buy something.

873
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,400
If she feels uncomfortable,

874
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
just give her the medicine.

875
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,720
Okay.

876
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,960
Kelei, thank you.

877
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,740
(Dear, fill your stomach
even when overworking.)

878
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,600
You nut.

879
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,760
Do you think I won’t recognize you

880
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,080
if you change your ID?

881
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,480
Who has annoyed you?

882
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,840
The same crazy Weibo follower of me.

883
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,000
I blacklisted him.

884
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,400
And he just came back
with another name.

885
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,680
Look at what he has texted me.

886
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,640
I think

887
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,560
you need to be careful with him.

888
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,800
Perhaps

889
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,920
the crazy man

890
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,400
is lurking around us.

891
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,960
Why not let me

892
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,800
send you back when off duty?

893
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,400
No need.

894
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,600
I’ve been

895
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,240
practicing

896
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,360
self-defense recently.

897
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,840
Great.

898
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,520
Xia, takeaway.

899
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,520
Xia, your takeaway.

900
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,480
I didn’t order takeaway.

901
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,680
I’m sure it’s your name.

902
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,560
The delivery man

903
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,520
just left it here.

904
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,900
(Takeaway Order)

905
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,160
The nut again.

906
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,580
(Contacts)

907
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,340
(Blocked)

908
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,340
(Xia)

909
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,440
Hello.

910
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,520
Hello.

911
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,760
What are you doing?

912
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,640
Are you having

913
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,440
a perfect weekend

914
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
with your captain?

915
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,080
No.

916
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,080
Do you know Captain Shen?

917
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,960
Shu Wenbo reveres him, too.

918
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,760
Xing Kelei is also indebted
to him for his recognition.

919
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,120
His two daughters came to us.

920
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,720
His elder daughter had a car accident

921
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,280
that has caused damage to her spine.

922
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,800
She didn’t receive effective
treatment in the local hospital

923
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,920
and has come here with her sister.

924
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,880
Xing Kelei is helping them

925
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,400
settle in a hotel nearby the hospital.

926
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,600
She will see the doctor tomorrow.

927
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,520
It’s a lot of trouble.

928
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,360
She looks pitiful.

929
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,480
And both of them

930
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,040
are young and beautiful girls.

931
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,000
Young and beautiful girls?

932
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,200
Then Xing Kelei must have known them

933
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,720
since they were very young?

934
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,400
It should be.

935
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,640
The elder sister called him Lei,

936
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,320
and the younger called him Kelei.

937
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,200
They must have known
each other long ago.

938
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,520
Are you being silly?

939
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,680
What’s up?

940
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,520
That one

941
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,600
who calls him Lei.

942
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,920
Something is wrong with her.

943
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I see, you two

944
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,200
have been so sweet and

945
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,240
sticking to each other like glue.

946
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,000
You thought you were soul mates

947
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,360
and nothing could separate you, right?

948
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,680
Yes.

949
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,720
What are you saying?
That’s nauseating.

950
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,960
I tell you,

951
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,680
you should be awake and alert.

952
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,960
Be careful.

953
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,200
Xing Kelei is not

954
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,240
a very young man.

955
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,320
I don’t believe

956
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:33,960
he hasn’t had

957
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,040
any puppy love before you.

958
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,920
Isn’t it normal

959
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,880
to have puppy love?

960
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,520
It will shock me if he hasn’t had one.

961
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,880
You’re good.

962
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,360
You’ve grown up.

963
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,720
You’re mentally strong now.

964
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,160
You don’t know.

965
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,080
I just watched an analysis of

966
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,080
a craniomaxillofacial
deformity surgery.

967
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,280
Now I’m just like swimming

968
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,360
in the sea of knowledge.

969
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,280
You don’t understand what it is like

970
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,320
to be filled with knowledge.

971
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,240
Fine. I don’t understand.

972
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,440
I just forgot that I’m calling you

973
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,720
to complain about a thing.

974
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,600
