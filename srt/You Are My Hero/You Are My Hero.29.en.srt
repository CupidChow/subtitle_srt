00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:36,940
Well.

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,640
Go back.

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,290
No worries.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,080
Be careful on the road.

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,600
I’m leaving.

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,840
Be careful.

26
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,720
Mi Ka,

27
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,960
Zhang Wei of the 8th bed,

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,560
just that one who has been

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,720
hospitalized after a car accident,

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,040
is crying for a headache.

31
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,880
I’ll check on her.

32
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,380
(Piano Solo: Zhang Wei)

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,000
Is your head still hurting?

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,160
What do you feel like?

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,160
What else can it be?

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
It feels like an explosion in the head.

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,160
MRI

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,840
shows no problem.

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,840
Perhaps it’s due to

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,560
different habitus,

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,960
so, the recovery time differs.

42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,280
I’ll give you some painkillers.

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,040
But I hope you try not to take them.

44
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,200
And your hands.

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,760
I’ll consult doctors

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
of the rehabilitation department.

47
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,120
Still, I can’t recover

48
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
to the previous levels.

49
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Find me

50
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
if you need anything.

51
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,160
Doctor,

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
I can’t sleep well at night.

53
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,040
Can you give me some sleeping pills?

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,680
No problem.

55
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,360
I’ll arrange it for you.

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,360
Stop practicing.

57
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,600
Go and have the meal with us.

58
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,080
You can go first.

59
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,480
What are you doing here?

60
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,040
You’re just back from surgery

61
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,360
and your body’s still recovering.

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,280
Intense practice doesn’t suit you.

63
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,840
The competition is about to start.

64
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,000
How can I get myself fully
recovered without practice?

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,520
I know you regard the competition

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,160
as a very important event.

67
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,500
So, you should be

68
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,440
more careful with your health.

69
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,600
Make way.

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,240
No.

71
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,920
I think you need to rest now.

72
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,930
In case anything goes

73
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,660
with your body,

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,240
you may drag the whole team down.

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,560
And Mi Ka has asked me to oversee you.

76
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,120
How can I reply to her
if I let you go your way?

77
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,520
You can’t just

78
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,720
think about the competition,

79
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,400
but also Mi Ka.

80
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,480
Captain Xing, you forget
to take the bullets.

81
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,200
Zhang Wei of the 8th bed,

82
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,790
you need sleeping pills

83
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,120
because you can’t sleep well, right?

84
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,480
I’ll take them later.

85
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,420
No.

86
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:45,950
The hospital has the rule

87
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,760
that we must watch you
when you take the pills.

88
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,760
But I’m not going to sleep
for the moment.

89
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,760
Well.

90
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,320
Just come to the nurse station

91
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
and take them
before you go to sleep, all right?

92
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,900
(Mi Ka: Have you gone to bed?)

93
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,160
Zhuo Wenjing, two hits in three shots.

94
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Xing Kelei, one hit in three shots.

95
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,600
What’s wrong with you?

96
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,560
I’m sorry, Captain Xing.

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
I’ll work harder on it.

98
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,480
Why did you give away to me?

99
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
I… I didn’t.

100
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,040
I asked why

101
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,680
you deliberately give away to me.

102
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,360
Zhuo Wenjing,

103
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,280
run ten circles around the playground.

104
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,660
Yes.

105
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,520
If you won’t give

106
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
the best of you in the training,

107
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,600
then you don’t need to participate
in the competition, either.

108
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,560
Do you understand?

109
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,920
Yes.

110
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,200
Go ahead.

111
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,240
You’re back.

112
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,200
I specially ordered some
private home cuisine

113
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,200
with no oil, salt, and aginomoto.

114
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,680
Quick, wash your hands
and have the meal.

115
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,360
What’s up?

116
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,320
Nothing.

117
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,280
What happened to your hands?

118
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,720
How did you get injured?

119
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,560
I just accidentally scratched myself

120
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,560
when assembling and disassembling
the gun.

121
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,200
Sit down and let me treat them.

122
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Director Shao said

123
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,400
you should follow the gradual recovery.

124
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,560
Have you been doing too much training?

125
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,280
No.

126
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,240
I won’t believe that.

127
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,800
Can you slow down

128
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,320
the training?

129
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,480
How?

130
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,560
I can’t even assemble and dissemble

131
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,640
a gun properly.

132
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
How can I participate
in the competition?

133
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,800
But if you’re doing too much training,

134
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,000
you’ll get stressed.

135
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,040
Everyone said the same thing

136
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,920
to me.

137
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,800
I’m really fed up with that.

138
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,120
Please don’t mention it again.

139
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,640
They just care about you.

140
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Care about me?

141
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,600
Did you tell Wenbo that

142
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,920
my hands are shaking?

143
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,600
I didn’t.

144
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,640
Now, the whole team

145
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,480
gave way to me even in the training.

146
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,000
If necessary, I’ll tell them myself.

147
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,800
I needn’t you to tell them.

148
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,560
First-grade instant noodles.

149
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,480
I’m sure you’ll be happy
after eating them.

150
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,840
Nothing can make

151
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,760
me happy.

152
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,320
Do you think

153
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,200
I’ve asked him

154
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,640
to make a wrong decision?

155
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,960
Why can’t you let it go?

156
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,240
Even I know

157
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,960
that Xing Kelei is not a man

158
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,760
that will change his mind

159
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,600
because of others.

160
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,640
You got the wrong point.

161
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,640
What’s the point?

162
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,120
He misunderstood you.

163
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,960
He thought you had contacted

164
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,720
Shu Wenbo in private.

165
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,800
Think about it.

166
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,840
For a man,

167
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,560
especially like Xing Kelei,

168
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,840
the thing he hates most

169
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,160
is being timid

170
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,720
in front of his bros.

171
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,040
And what’s worse,

172
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,000
it’s his girlfriend
that leaks it to them.

173
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,720
I didn’t.

174
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,880
I know you didn’t.

175
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,520
But he doesn’t know.

176
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,040
Why not

177
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,640
give Shu Wenbo a call

178
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,520
and ask what happened?

179
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,360
You… You make the call for me.

180
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:21,960
I won’t.

181
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
You should make the call yourself.

182
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,160
Hello, this is Mi Ka.

183
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,000
He’s been in intense training
these days.

184
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,440
We are all worried about him.

185
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,480
I just said that

186
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,240
if anything went wrong with him,

187
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,480
I couldn’t reply to you,

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,360
and he just left without a word.

189
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,120
Did I say anything

190
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,890
wrong?

191
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,330
No worries.

192
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,960
I just want to know

193
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,600
what’s going on with him.

194
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,040
I’m hanging up.

195
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,160
That Shu Wenbo

196
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,080
is a stupid man with a stupid mouth.

197
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,800
He should have kept his mouth shut.

198
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,020
(Xing Kelei)

199
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,800
Why didn’t you call him?

200
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,240
What can I say?

201
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,520
He has high self-esteem

202
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,880
and also gets stressed.

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,760
I’m afraid I may get things worse
if I say anything.

204
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,440
Doctor Mi,

205
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,200
a relationship

206
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,600
can’t afford too many misunderstandings.

207
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,340
Give it to me.

208
00:13:53,340 --> 00:14:08,220
(Mi Ka)

209
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,280
Now, he doesn’t even answer my call.

210
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,000
What’s paramount

211
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,880
as being a special policeman?

212
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,920
That’s when there is a big case

213
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,600
and when people’s lives

214
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,280
are under treats,

215
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,560
you should pull out your gun

216
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,840
immediately

217
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,640
and respond quickly.

218
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,160
For the whole process,

219
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,080
I hope you can limit it to 10 seconds.

220
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Everyone, ready.

221
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,080
Attention.

222
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,800
Right turn.

223
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,160
Put on the earphone.

224
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,640
Begin.

225
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,240
Today,

226
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,760
you, as newcomers,

227
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,840
surprise me.

228
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,440
Some got 98 rings

229
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
in ten shots.

230
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,520
Xing Kelei,

231
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,320
out of rank.

232
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,600
You’re a good candidate
for the special police.

233
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,880
Continue to work on it.

234
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,920
Thank you, Captain Shen.

235
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,180

240
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,320
Don’t think about it. Go to sleep.

241
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,720
You can sleep first.

242
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,720
Goodnight.

243
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,560

Kelei,

262
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,320
you go back to the police so early.

263
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,960
Where is Mi Ka?

264
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,360
She stays…

265
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,000
Stays at her friend’s home.

266
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,000
Did you quarrel?

267
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,500
I...

268
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,320
I’m not in a hurry.
I can give you a ride.

269
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,020
-Okay.
-Go.

270
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,160
Although I’m your sister

271
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
and you’re my brother,

272
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,880
I don’t agree with you this time.

273
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,800
Mi Ka asks Shu Wenbo
to look after you.

274
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,560
Are there any problems with it?

275
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,760
No problem.

276
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,040
I think

277
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,400
you have high self-esteem.

278
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,320
You think too highly of yourself.

279
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,640
Just think

280
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,480
if you were Mi Ka,

281
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
how would you feel?

282
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,800
I know I was wrong.

283
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,960
I’ll apologize to her today.

284
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,400
Apologize?

285
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,000
You must be sincere.

286
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,760
Only she can put up with

287
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,920
your stubbornness

288
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,080
and sharp tongue.

289
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,480
I wonder if it’s a psychological issue

290
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,860
that results in your shaking hands.

291
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,920
A psychological illness.

292
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,480
Psychological? What do you mean?

293
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,480
Didn’t you have the psychological test
in the police?

294
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,600
I did.

295
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,560
The result is fine.

296
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,360
You

297
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,080
have gotten used to be the winner

298
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
since you were a kid.

299
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,720
You’ll be uncomfortable

300
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,960
if others surpass you.

301
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,620
Why do you put so much

302
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,720
pressure on yourself?

303
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,840
Xing Kelei,

304
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,560
I didn’t tell anything to Shu Wenbo.

305
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,840
Please trust me.

306
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,200
No, that’s too humble.

307
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,600
Believe it or not,

308
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,360
I didn’t tell him.

309
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,550
No, that will provoke another fight.

310
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,120
I really didn’t say anything.

311
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:44,800
Forget it.

312
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,600
He won’t accept it.

313
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,080
(Xing Kelei)
I’m back to the police.

314
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,360
Don’t worry about me.

315
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,200
All right.

316
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,110
Wenbo.

317
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,760
Captain Hao.

318
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,360
How is the training today?

319
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,000
Not bad.

320
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,000
I heard you got full marks

321
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,200
for all five events yesterday.

322
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,000
You did well.

323
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,560
Keep it up.

324
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,560
I have high expectations of you.

325
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,400
Thank you, Captain Hao.

326
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,720
How is Xing Kelei?

327
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,960
He’s practicing within.

328
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,400
How many marks does he get today?

329
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,440
43 rings in five shots.

330
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,320
Captain Hao,

331
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,240
he’s just recovered.

332
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,600
He hasn’t returned to his normal level.

333
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,720
I know.

334
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,880
I just fear

335
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,440
he may give himself too much pressure.

336
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,360
You’re close.

337
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,680
You should show more care to him.

338
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,320
Chat with him if you have time.

339
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,280
Yes.

340
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,880
I’ll stop here.

341
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,630
Captain Shu,

342
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,180
I heard that Captain Hao

343
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,720
goes around bragging to others

344
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,280
your five gestures for
five shooting distances.

345
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,440
How do you make it?

346
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,800
Come up and show me your strength.

347
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,120
Who’s bragging nonsense?

348
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,080
Captain Shu,

349
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,880
Captain Hao has made it known

350
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,120
in the whole sub-branch.

351
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,480
Don’t be modest.

352
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,480
That’s good anyway.

353
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,510
Then we’ll have

354
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,560
two top shooters in our team.

355
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,160
One is Captain Xing,
and the other is you.

356
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,140
If you’re together,

357
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:32,920
we won’t lose

358
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,160
in any battles.

359
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,840
Enough of you.

360
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,800
I won’t miss you in the training

361
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,640
no matter how hard you flatter me.

362
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,640
Do what you’re supposed to do.

363
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,920
We all like sweet words,

364
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,760
but you have been

365
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,320
afraid of being flattered.

366
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,240
I found you...

367
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,240
Li Nian always exaggerates things.

368
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,520
Yet your techniques

369
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,840
have been improved greatly.

370
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,160
You must work hard on it.

371
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,400
I know.

372
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,360
You’re always interested in shooting.

373
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,440
Don’t care about my feelings.

374
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,720
The competition will be

375
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,840
a chance to you.

376
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,600
Captain Xing,

377
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
I’m at your back.

378
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,840
You’re not my back.

379
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,640
You’re the backbone

380
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,760
of the Tiger.

381
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,080
I can’t do it now.

382
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
You’ll recover.

383
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,520
Honestly, I’m not confident this time.

384
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,760
Didn’t Mi Ka tell

385
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,400
you my condition?

386
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,440
What condition?

387
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,560
My hands.

388
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,400
What’s the matter with your hands?

389
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,440
Did you tell Wenbo that

390
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,640
my hands are shaking?

391
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,120
I didn’t.

392
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,320
Please help me ask for leave.

393
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,600
What?

394
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,480
Gosh, Zhang Wei is nowhere to be seen.

395
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,240
What do you mean by nowhere to be seen?

396
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,720
This morning, after you checked on her,

397
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,960
she had a fever.

398
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,720
I said I would go take her temperature,

399
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,560
but I couldn’t find her anywhere.

400
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,520
Where is her family?

401
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,560
She has a sister

402
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,080
but she can’t come until she’s off duty.

403
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,720
How long has she gone missing?

404
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,080
Over two hours.

405
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,440
She would go to the garden

406
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,480
and sit there for some time.

407
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,880
But I just searched the garden

408
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,720
and she was not there.

409
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,200
The orthopedic doctors
had a consultation after her surgery

410
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,080
and they said she might not be able
to play the piano in the future.

411
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,920
She has been in bad mood since then.

412
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,720
Don’t worry.

413
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,560
Perhaps she’s just sitting downstairs.

414
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,800
Let’s look for her separately.

415
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,390
Okay.

416
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,150
Let’s go.

417
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,280
Still no signs of her.

418
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,960
No.

419
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,040
Why are you here?

420
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,320
I...

421
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,120
Do you find her?

422
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,960
No.

423
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,200
What are you looking for?

424
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,640
We have a patient called Zhang Wei.

425
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,960
She is a pianist.

426
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,080
Her right hand suffers
a functional injury

427
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,480
after a car incident.

428
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,880
Now she’s gone missing.

429
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,280
Have you searched the hospital?

430
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,480
Yes, everywhere, but no signs of her.

431
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,080
She’s been in a bad mood lately.

432
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
I’m worried about her.

433
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,960
Did you find her?

434
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,000
No.

435
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,160
Kelei.

436
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:26,840
Mr. Shao.

437
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,000
Please apply to see

438
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,120
the hospital’s video recording.

439
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,680
I’ll check the monitors nearby.

440
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,040
Thank you.

441
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,360
Okay.

442
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:33,980
Let’s go to the monitor room.

443
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,630
Go.

444
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,680
She left through the lobby.

445
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,430
Go.

446
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,040
Thanks.

447
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,320
We’ve checked the video recording

448
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,070
and found that after Zhang Wei

449
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,030
left the hospital, she got on a taxi

450
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,440
which took her to the Qifu Road.

451
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,840
We’ve contacted the driver.

452
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,760
Have you informed her family?

453
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,560
Yes.

454
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,240
Her sister is on the way

455
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,480
to her home

456
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,880
and will see if she’s gone home.

457
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,240
Please take me to

458
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,080
her ward.

459
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:13,760
Okay.

460
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,840
Go.

461
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,540
(Piano Solo: Zhang Wei)

462
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,080
Piano.

463
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,560
She got off
at the Riverside Road, right?

464
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,790
Okay.

465
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
All right. Bye.

466
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,430
She was to give

467
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,320
a piano solo recital today.

468
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,560
Riverside Road.

469
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,360
She should be heading
to the concert hall.

470
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,520
Then we should waste
no time to get there.

471
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,400
What’s up?

472
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,400
I’ve been bad-tempered recently.

473
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,280
I’m sorry.

474
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,600
It doesn’t matter.

475
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:06,990
Let’s go.

476
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:19,960
There.

477
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,300
(Concert Hall)

478
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,720
She is there.

479
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,440
We may panic her

480
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,480
with so many people.

481
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:21,880
Xiaoxiao,

482
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,040
call the police and firefighters.

483
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,030
Okay.

484
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,960
You are familiar with you.

485
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,480
She won’t guard against you.

486
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,760
Try to talk something with her

487
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,800
and win time for us.

488
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,840
I’ll go around the back

489
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,720
and try to save her.

490
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,320
Okay, be careful.

491
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Why did you come up here?

492
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,280
It’s me. Dr. Mi.

493
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,800
Let’s go back to the hospital,
all right?

494
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,680
I won’t go back.

495
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,640
I don’t want any more of

496
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,200
the disinfectant smell spreading
the whole room.

497
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,000
Okay.

498
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
We won’t go back.

499
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,120
Then please tell me

500
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,200
what you want.

501
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,720
I can help you.

502
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,960
Help me?

503
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,640
You can’t help me.

504
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,480
I just want to play the piano.

505
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,840
I started playing the piano

506
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,080
when I was five.

507
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,040
I kept practicing for six hours a day.

508
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,720
The first time

509
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,200
I entered the national children
piano competition,

510
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,560
I won the first prize.

511
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,050
When I was studying

512
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,280
in the affiliated
school of Music College,

513
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,200
I was the first one

514
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,560
who participated in
an international piano competition

515
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,120
and won the golden prize.

516
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,200
Don’t get close to me.

517
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,400
I... I…

518
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,440
I can’t hear clearly what you said.

519
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,080
Just stand there.

520
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,640
If you come closer,

521
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,720
I will...

522
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,680
Okay.

523
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,040
I’ll remain here.

524
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,280
I’ll remain here.

525
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,160
Zhang Wei,

526
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,680
I also had piano classes
when I was a kid,

527
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
but later because of

528
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,440
the heavy homework burden,

529
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,760
I gave up piano.

530
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,040
What’s the brand

531
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,720
of your first piano?

532
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,680
My first piano

533
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,360
is made by Hsinghai,

534
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,120
a domestic brand.

535
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,730
It cost us

536
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,000
over six thousand yuan then.

537
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,160
And when I was 16,

538
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,840
I won the golden prize
of Steinway Piano Competition,

539
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,920
so, they gave me

540
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
a Steinway & Sons piano.

541
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,480
Do you know Steinway & Sons?

542
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,640
I know.

543
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,740
It’s the best piano brand

544
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,240
in the world.

545
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,880
Yes.

546
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,840
That piano

547
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,520
is in my home now.

548
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,000
I’m their spokesperson.

549
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,280
I need to use pianos made
by Steinway & Sons

550
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
for all of my recitals.

551
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,680
No matter where it was,

552
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,600
they would send the piano there.

553
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,240
But now,

554
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,240
my right hand is injured.

555
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,640
I can’t play the piano anymore.

556
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,080
My life ends here.

557
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
It’s not that bad.

558
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,080
I’ve asked the rehabilitation
department.

559
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,560
They say your hand can
get to work again.

560
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,600
They’re making

561
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,960
a recovery plan for you.

562
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,200
After some practice and treatment,

563
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,920
your hand

564
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,160
can recover gradually.

565
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,880
Do you know that I can’t play

566
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,280
Liszt’s Feux Follets anymore?

567
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,400
Many people can never play

568
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,920
Feux Follets well in their lives.

569
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,800
Because it demands

570
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,240
the high flexibility of your arms

571
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,200
and very high techniques.

572
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,320
I always have it on my repertoire

573
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,000
for every recital of me.

574
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,580
But now,

575
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,560
I can’t play it anymore.

576
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,680
Is it normal?

577
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,800
Is it normal to me?

578
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,800
Watch it.

579
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,840
Hold me tightly.

580
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,640
Are you okay?

581
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,200
Hmm...

582
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,840
I’m not here to persuade you.

583
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,640
I just want to say

584
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,310
thank you.

585
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,600
Thank you for giving me a chance

586
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,680
to show how brave

587
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,440
I am

588
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,120
in front of my girlfriend,

589
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,120
and show how strong

590
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,320
I am.

591
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,760
I’m a special policeman.

592
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,200
But just some time ago,

593
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,720
they found a tumor in my head.

594
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,160
It nearly ended

595
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,160
my career,

596
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,920
so, I think I can

597
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,120
understand

598
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,600
how you feel like.

599
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,370
We both take

600
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,520
our career

601
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,400
as more important

602
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,640
than our lives.

603
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,400
So, I was sad

604
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,960
just like you.

605
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,720
I couldn’t see the hope either.

606
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,720
But now

607
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,720
I think

608
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,800
what we have been suffering from

609
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,820
are not completely hopeless

610
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,000
to cure.

611
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,160
So,

612
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,120
if the career we love

613
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,600
hasn’t given up on us,

614
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,760
why should we

615
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,400
give up ourselves?

616
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,520
I saved you once,

617
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,080
and you

618
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,530
owe me a ticket

619
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,880
of your recital.

620
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,200
Two tickets.

621
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,840
Two tickets.

622
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,200
Thank you.

623
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:09,960
Thank you.

624
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,630
Xiaoxiao,

625
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,230
take Zhang Wei back to the hospital.

626
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,600
Let’s go.

627
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,840
What brings you to the hospital today?

628
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,600
Have you been uncomfortable?

629
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,040
I misunderstood you

630
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,230
for the matter.

631
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,150
I should give you more trust.

632
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,120
I don’t mind it.

633
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,600
I’m just afraid that you might be upset.

634
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,800
I’ll give you

635
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,320
more understanding, too.

636
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,520
So, we have

637
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,800
made peace, right?

638
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,200
Have we broken the peace?

639
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,320
Then go home and make food for me.

640
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,600
Okay.

641
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,240
What do you like to eat?

642
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,240
(Repair Service)

643
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:21,880
Hello,

644
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,160
do you sell

645
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,760
lens accessories for this camera?

646
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,310
No.

647
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,600
No? Thank you.

648
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,400
Hello, do you sell

649
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,080
lens accessories for this camera?

650
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,120
Not for this model.

651
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,840
Thanks.

652
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,640
Hello.

653
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,720
-Hello.
-Do you have lens accessories for this?

654
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,240
Not for this model.

655
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,400
Hello, Miss.

656
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,600
Do you sell lens accessories

657
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,920
for this Leica camera?

658
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,920
No.

659
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,880
No?

660
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,830
-No.
-Thank you.

661
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,720
Hello,

662
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,480
do you sell

663
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,320
lens accessories for this camera?

664
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,840
Not for this model.

665
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,590
Thanks.

666
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,200
Hello.

667
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,520
Hello.

668
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,760
Hello,

669
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,760
do you have

670
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,560
lens accessories

671
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,480
for this camera?

672
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,480
This is an outdated Leica.

673
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,760
The camera was discontinued long ago.

674
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,040
But you’re lucky today.

675
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,760
We have accessories

676
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,520
for the lens.

677
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,320
That’s great.

678
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,530
We can repair it.

679
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,320
-No worries.
-Hello.

680
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,600
Come and look at this.

681
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,240
Okay.

682
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,370
Hello, how much is this camera?

683
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,520
This is over ten thousand yuan.

684
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,790
Song,

685
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,080
I find a shop that can
repair Xia’s camera.

686
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,560
Please send her camera

687
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,600
to me directly.

688
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,240
I’ll settle it.

689
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,560
Thanks.

690
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,280
Xia.

691
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,800
Xia.

692
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,920
Are you looking for Captain Shu?

693
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,840
I’ll tell him you’re here.

694
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,640
Stop.

695
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,560
I’m not looking for him.
I’ve come for you.

696
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,200
What? Are you looking for me?

697
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,520
What’s the matter?

698
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,440
I asked you to

699
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,680
go to the class with me that day.

700
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,520
Why did you send
Shu Wenbo there instead?

701
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,800
I was on duty that day.

702
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,120
On duty?

703
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,120
I do not believe you.

704
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
The whole world

705
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
knows that he’s rejected me.

706
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,000
That gives me a deep sense of shame.

707
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,200
What do you mean?
Are you going to humiliate me more?

708
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,840
Are you making fun of me?

709
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,960
No.

710
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
No?

711
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,120
Then why did you do this to me?

712
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,600
Because...

713
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,440
Say it.

714
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,760
I don’t want to see
Captain Shu suffering.

715
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,160
Suffering from what?

716
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:23,990
Well.

717
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,800
If you don’t tell me,

718
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,840
I’ll report to Captain Hao

719
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,080
that you’ve used
your work convenience

720
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,000
to flirt with me.

721
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,360
Stop making a fuss here.

722
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,400
He likes you so much.

723
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,800
What did you say?

724
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,080
I said Captain Shu likes you.

725
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,320
He told me when he got drunk.

726
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,960
You didn’t see what he looked like then.

727
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,600
My heart hurts for him.

728
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,240
It can’t be.

729
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,530
He told me

730
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,880
we are just friends.

731
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,160
That’s because Lu Feng likes you, too.

732
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,480
I don’t know

733
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,760
why he gives you up to Fu Feng.

734
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,620
Give me up to...?

735
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,360
And then,

736
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,640
he got drunk that day

737
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,920
because of you.

738
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,880
If Luo Ting and I didn’t stop him,

739
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,880
Captain Hao might have
peeled off his skin.

740
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,400
He got drunk that day.

741
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,200
He mistook me for you,

742
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,440
and he just held me

743
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,680
in his arms and didn’t let me go.

744
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,320
Don’t you think
he had been very sad?

745
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,320
And

746
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,520
he got back after the dinner
with you that day.

747
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
I saw him

748
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,200
running in the rain alone.

749
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,440
Xia,

750
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,360
you can’t just tell

751
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,320
whether he loves you by his words,

752
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,000
but you should look at his eyes.

753
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,880
Captain Shu, Shu Wenbo,

754
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,920
he only has eyes for you.

Thank you for taking every risk

No thanks. It’s just a small thing.

766

Actually, that camera

767
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
was a gift from my father

768
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,720
when I was admitted by
the Department of Journalism.

769
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,000
He said

770
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,000
he hoped I could realize my dream

771
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,920
and be a good journalist.

772
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,090
His words

773
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,800
have always been my main drive.

774
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,200
So, for me,

775
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,040
this is not a small thing.

776
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,360
You’re already

777
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,680
a good journalist.

778
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,120
You really think so?

779
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,200
Of course.

780
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
I agree with you.

781
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,760
Your arm muscle is torn, isn’t it?

782
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,640
This unguent will be helpful.

783
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,400
It heals the muscle quickly

784
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,640
when rubbed onto the skin.

785
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,320
Take it.

786
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,080
Thank you.

787
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,080
My injury

788
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,800
almost heals.

789
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,520
Almost means not completely.

790
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,080
Listen,

791
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,240
the unguent is really helpful.

792
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,200

I’ll eat those that are not sweet.

795
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,280
I’ll have this.
