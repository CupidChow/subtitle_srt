00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,940
=Episode 22=

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,320
You’ve put all seasonings in?

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,960
Aren’t we having BBQ tonight?

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,400
So better season them in advance.

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,280
The woman

24
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,640
who knew little about cooking

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,490
can now

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,080
make her own meals.

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,680
I got someone to do it for me.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,880
So I learnt nothing.

29
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,760
Now that no one is cooking for me,

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,240
I have to do it myself.

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,840
Now my cooking is no worse

32
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,200
than yours.

33
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,120
OK.

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,920
Let me see

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,080
if there’s something I like

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,440
tonight.

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,200
I remember you used to make

38
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
yellow croaker.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,640
I just can’t make it

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,410
the same taste as yours.

41
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,070
I don’t know

42
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,190
which seasoning is missing.

43
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,480
You tried to cook

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,840
a yellow croaker?

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,830
Yeah.

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,720
During each Spring Festival,

47
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,560
Kelei would be on duty.

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
I was with my parents abroad.

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,520
So for the New Year’s Eve dinner,

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,800
we cooked a fish.

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,400
But

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,720
I couldn’t make it
the same taste as yours.

53
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,880
Something is missing.

54
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,360
What?

55
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,960
Did you add garlics?

56
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,880
No.

57
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,480
You didn’t use garlics, either.

58
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,800
I did.

59
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,920
But before I ladled it out,

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,760
I picked them out

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,120
because I knew you don’t like garlic.

62
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,400
You had been lying to me?

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,440
You think it was lying?

64
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,480
I’m an honest man.

65
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,100
I guess they

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,040
won’t come back for lunch.

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,720
Xia and Wenbo also went out.

68
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,680
Let’s have a casual lunch.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,120
Do you think so?

70
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,480
Yes.

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,280
I’m fine.

72
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,080
Anything.

73
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,280
There are noodles.

74
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,120
I’ll make noodles and an egg for you.

75
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,360
They won’t be worse

76
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,680
than what you made before.

77
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,400
We’ll see after I have a bite.

78
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,440
Shu Wenbo.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,160
Wenbo.

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,200
How long haven’t you climbed a mountain?

81
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,400
For field training,

82
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,160
I climb a few times each month.

83
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,080
The air is so fresh in the mountain.

84
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,120
It is great.

85
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,720
What’s up?

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,320
I think a mosquito stung me.

87
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,960
O type blood is mosquitoes’ favorite.

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,880
I’m not wearing shorts.

89
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,560
Why did I still get stung?

90
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,120
You should have sprayed some

91
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,360
repellent before you came out.

92
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,920
How could I know I would be

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,720
stung even with pants?

94
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,120
Where were you stung?

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,040
Fortunately,

96
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,840
I got this.

97
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,080
Where?

98
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,240
Here.

99
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,440
-Here?
-On both sides.

100
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,120
Rub it with your hands.

101
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,960
Is it necessary?

102
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,040
Here.

103
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,390
More. There are lots of mosquitoes.

104
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,280
Thank you.

105
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,400
It’s OK.

106
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,920
You keep it.

107
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,160
There are too many mosquitoes

108
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,440
in the mountain.

109
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,880
Don’t you need it?

110
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
My skin is thick.

111
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,000
They can’t sting me.

112
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,720
Then why did you take it?

113
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,760
In case I’m stung?

114
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,760
I, um...

115
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,600
What if someone

116
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,720
needs it?

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,480
I can lend it to him.

118
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,920
Alright, let’s go.

119
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,080
Done?

120
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,880
OK.

121
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,440
It looks nothing special.

122
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,960
Try it.

123
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,440
Blend it.

124
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,240
It’s OK.

125
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,800
It really surprises me.

126
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,080
Better than yours, right?

127
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,560
Tastes good.

128
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,080
You learnt to make it

129
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,720
because I like it.

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,800
Are you burnt?

131
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,710
Yes.

132
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,030
OK, leave it to me.

133
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,400
Is it good?

134
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,720
Careful.

135
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,800
Burnt your hands while cooking

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,960
and got the soup

137
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,680
everywhere on your face.

138
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,040
The taste reminds me

139
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
it’s been a long time

140
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,600
since the last time I ate it.

141
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,160
I miss the old days.

142
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,780
What?

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,360
You don’t make noodles anymore?

144
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,280
I’m too lazy to cook for myself.

145
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,360
So I eat in the institute canteen.

146
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,320
Haven’t you met someone

147
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,840
who can dine with you?

148
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,000
Even it’s

149
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,600
to dine with someone,

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,280
it also requires fate.

151
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,240
I haven’t met the destined person.

152
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,160
Yi Qian.

153
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,880
Hi, Qian.

154
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,440
You got my call?

155
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,640
How is your digestion?

156
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,720
Good then.

157
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,440
Let me ask you.

158
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,640
Why didn’t you tell me

159
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,360
you booked the same hotel

160
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,120
with someone?

161
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,920
Shut up.

162
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,840
I know what you’re up to.

163
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,400
Alright, we’ll talk later.

164
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
OK, I got it.

165
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,280
He says hi.

166
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,350
Is it boring

167
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,300
to come out

168
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,400
with us?

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,960
Boring?

170
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,160
No.

171
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,600
It’s great.

172
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,000
I seldom have the chance to relax.

173
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,840
And none of them are strangers.

174
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,720
Mi Ka is my student.

175
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,160
Kelei is your brother.

176
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:03,840
And I met

177
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,920
Wenbo before.

178
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,520
How is Mi Ka?

179
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,960
Why did you ask?

180
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,160
She’s my brother’s girlfriend.

181
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,360
And she’s nice to him.

182
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,480
I want to know more about her.

183
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,160
I think she’s nice too.

184
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,040
That girl was born

185
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,120
with the gifts to be a doctor.

186
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,000
As you know,

187
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,040
all medical workers

188
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,960
start this career

189
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,000
with ambitions

190
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,920
to make achievements, right?

191
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,880
But when they

192
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,160
meet some setbacks,

193
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,160
some would

194
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,360
give up things

195
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,880
and become hesitant

196
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
and conservative.

197
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,910
But Mi Ka isn’t like them.

198
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,640
She’s like you in the old days.

199
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,400
Really.

200
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,320
What about me now?

201
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,160
Now you

202
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,200
change in some ways.

203
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,160
But you probably

204
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,000
would never change in certain ways.

205
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,840
When I was a kid,

206
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,400
I liked

207
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,360
to run on the hills at home.

208
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,040
I loved

209
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,400
May

210
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,920
when the azaleas bloom,

211
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,320
dyeing the hills in dazzling red.

212
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,000
Water from the spring

213
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,040
is drinkable

214
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:33,850
and better

215
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,080
than all the minerals on sales.

216
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,000
Take me with you next time.

217
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,320
What? I’m not welcomed?

218
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,360
OK.

219
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,080
Take a photo for me.

220
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,000
Sure.

221
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,600
I trust your

222
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,280
photographing skills.

223
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,720
Here.

224
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,120
Can I jump?

225
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,180
Sure, come on.

226
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,200
-OK.
-I’ll count to three.

227
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,160
One, two, three.

228
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,680
One more.

229
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,040
Is it done?

230
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,960
Look.

231
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,840
What do you think?

232
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,400
They’re so good.

233
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,460
The last time you

234
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,520
taught me how to film long legs,

235
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,840
I was astonished.

236
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,880
Just some techniques I know.

237
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,640
It’s getting late.

238
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,080
Let’s go back.

239
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,240
Come on.

240
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,580
All roads at my home

241
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,440
are like this one.

242
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,720
Really?

243
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,000
Careful.

244
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,560
What’s up?

245
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,760
I think I sprained my ankle.

246
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,920
Alright, sit down.

247
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,080
I…

248
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,120
Slowly. Slowly.

249
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,200
Easy. Careful.

250
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,080
Which ankle? The left?

251
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,600
Does it hurt?

252
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,360
Yes!

253
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,000
It’s not serious.

254
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,840
Just a twist.

255
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,680
Alright, try to get up.

256
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,400
Wait...

257
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,720
Try to make a few steps.

258
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,240
Come on.

259
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,840
My foot...

260
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,160
How do you feel?

261
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,400
I can’t. It hurts.

262
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,150
It still hurts?

263
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,840
I can’t walk back like this.

264
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,840
Look,

265
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,360
I’ll go get the car

266
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,760
and come back for you.

267
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,000
Wait here for me.

268
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,400
Don’t go around. I’ll be back soon.

269
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,680
Wait.

270
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Your memory is so...

271
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,960
My sister

272
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,240
dresses up today.

273
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,200
Failed?

274
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,760
Do you know how to grill?

275
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,640
Put that on it.

276
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,920
Hold on.

277
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,010
-They’re like...
-Hold on.

278
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,030
a couple, aren’t they?

279
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,880
A couple who’ve been married for years.

280
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,560
What are you doing there?

281
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,200
Why don’t you go there?

282
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,120
What’s wrong with you?

283
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,760
I sprained my ankle.

284
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,960
-She sprained her ankle.
-Sprained?

285
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,280
Perfect timing!

286
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,780
-Careful.
-My foot.

287
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,840
What’s up?

288
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,920
My ankle is also...

289
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,560
Come here.

290
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,000
You sprained your ankle too?

291
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:29,940
Easy. Slowly.

292
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,000
They made an appointment on that.

293
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,920
What’s wrong with him?

294
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,160
He sprained his ankle.

295
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,120
Really?

296
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
How?

297
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,360
It was silly and careless.

298
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,000
-How do you feel?
-It hurts.

299
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,580
Did you have an appointment

300
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,000
on spraining your ankles?

301
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,200
You look happy grilling.

302
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,880
Yes.

303
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,040
You came back right on time.

304
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,840
We’re almost done.

305
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
Get ready for dinner.

306
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,200
I told you I’d do it. Why did you...?

307
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,120
Leave it.

308
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,040
That’d be too late.

309
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,600
She’s speaking for Dr. Shao.

310
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,290
More oil.

311
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,200
More oil, huh?

312
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,120
Better?

313
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,960
You’ll be fine in a while.

314
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,520
The compress kills the pain.

315
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,160
You’re amazing now.

316
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,080
I wonder who the lucky man will be

317
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,560
to marry my sister,

318
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,280
a modern woman with both elegance

319
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,680
and excellent cooking skills.

320
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,600
Are you sure she’s not a burden?

321
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,280
I did all the grilling.

322
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,240
I’ll get the drinks.

323
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,320
Look at these.

324
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
They don’t seem good.

325
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,440
Keyao.

326
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,440
There are a lot of drinks.

327
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,080
In big bottles and heavy.

328
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,200
Why don’t you help Mr. Shao

329
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,240
to get them?

330
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,040
He’s a big man.

331
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,880
He can manage it.

332
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
He can’t, seriously.

333
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,840
Go with him.

334
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,560
Go, go, go.

335
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Let’s take over.

336
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,000
Let me try.

337
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,700
-Careful.
-Shu Wenbo,

338
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,800
sit here.

339
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,360
OK. Sure.

340
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,960
Careful.

341
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,200
I got some honey.

342
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,080
I think it’d be to the ladies liking

343
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,760
to have some on chicken wings.

344
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,400
I’ll put it here.

345
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,870
-I’ll do it.
-I...

346
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,670
Allow me.

347
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,400
It’s OK.

348
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,720
Xing Kelei,

349
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,600
it’s Mi Ka’s birthday.

350
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,400
Don’t you have anything to say?

351
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,000
Yes, I do.

352
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,040
Guys, a toast.

353
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,320
OK.

354
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,840
This vacation is precious.

355
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,440
In the picturesque views

356
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,520
but boring villa,

357
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,120
let’s wish Mi Ka a happy birthday!

358
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,600
-Thank you!
-Happy Birthday!

359
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,680
Happy birthday!

360
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,680
Cheers!

361
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,560
Here, Xia.

362
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,520
You haven’t had any kebabs.

363
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,600
No, thanks. I’ll wait a little bit.

364
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,640
My stomach is not well.

365
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,640
Not well?

366
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,240
Salad is fine.

367
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,150
You guys enjoy it.

368
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:01,710
Alright.

369
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,380
You eat it.

370
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,520
Is it good?

371
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,720
As good as your noodles.

372
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,760
It’s hot.

373
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,760
Blow it.

374
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,720
Why are you looking at us?

375
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,520
Let go.

376
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,120
Watch and learn.

377
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,960
Keyao, it’s really good.

378
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,400
Did you know how to cook

379
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,240
in college?

380
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,360
Well…

381
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,080
No.

382
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,880
I think Dr. Shao knows it better.

383
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,080
No, I don’t.

384
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
I never ate things she made.

385
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,800
Did you make anything for me?

386
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,570
Probably no.

387
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,840
Or you wouldn’t be breathing now.

388
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,160
He did the cooking in the past.

389
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,880
I did all the grilling today.

390
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,200
She only made the chicken wings.

391
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,400
Yeah, you guys, have more.

392
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,720
The chicken wings are not bad.

393
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,880
Here.

394
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,280
It’s like my sister’s doing.

395
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,520
Still raw, isn’t it?

396
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,440
I think there’s blood in it.

397
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,440
Is it hot there?

398
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,570
Yes.

399
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,280
Let’s swap.

400
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,320
You can take my seat.

401
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,160
I want to sit here.

It’s my birthday.

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,200
So everybody listen to my command.

419
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,640
I want to play a game.

420
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,480
It’s called Truth or Dare.

421
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,280
Do you agree?

422
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,800
Yes.

423
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,000
I don’t know how.

424
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,080
I do.

425
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,000
Are you in?

426
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,760
He’s in.

427
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,590
Alright.

428
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,200
I...

429
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,160
Keyao?

430
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,280
OK.

431
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,520
Majority rule.

432
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,240
Alright.

433
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,920
Let me explain the rules.

434
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,840
Well,

435
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
you can choose

436
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,920
Truth or Dare.

437
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,800
But if you choose Truth,

438
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,080
what you share has to be real.

439
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,160
No lying.

440
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,400
Got it?

441
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,340
We can start now.

442
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,160
It’s started.

443
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,280
Xing Kelei.

444
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,200
You can only choose Truth,

445
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,720
not Dare.

446
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,040
Why?

447
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,880
I’m helping you here.

448
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,800
Go ahead.

449
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,960
May I ask?

450
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,720
What’s your memory
about your first kiss?

451
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,880
No.

452
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,400
No memories?

453
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,800
Who would kiss him with that face?

454
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What’s wrong with his face?

455
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,520
It’s handsome.

456
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,840
Right.

457
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,760
How could you know

458
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,960
if I had my first kiss or not?

459
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,840
How many times have you met me?

460
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
Xing Kelei.

461
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,720
OK, next.

462
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,520
I’ll ask the question.

463
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,400
You.

464
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,080
Truth.

465
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,100
Why can’t I

466
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,000
choose Dare?

467
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,600
What do you choose then?

468
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,880
Truth.

469
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,840
Do it.

470
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,880
Fire away.

471
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,480
Don’t know what to ask.

472
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,070
You do it.

473
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,240
Keyao,

474
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,560
can you tell us

475
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,840
three of your ex’s hobbies?

476
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,360
Which ex?

477
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,360
That one.

478
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,960
-That one.
-Who cuts flesh.

479
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:50,550
Yeah.

480
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,360
I never had a butcher boyfriend.

481
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,440
Who is it?

482
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,440
It’s

483
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,840
the man who’s not young anymore.

484
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,840
He doesn’t like cheese or pepper.

485
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,400
And he only eats the steamed buns’ wrappers.

486
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,720
So the cake was...

487
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,000
It was bought for me.

488
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,800
There was no cheese,

489
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,840
right?

490
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,640
Alright, Mr. Shao, your turn.

491
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,360
Truth or Dare?

492
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,400
Truth or Dare?

493
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,560
Truth.

494
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,720
What’s the most impressive

495
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,360
thing about

496
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,280
your first love?

497
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,040
It took me long to save enough money

498
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,960
for two tickets to a concert.

499
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,440
However, on the concert day,

500
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,720
her father forbade her to go.

501
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,760
Why?

502
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Because it’s her family rule.

503
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,400
Before she reached 18,

504
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,720
she couldn’t go out at night.

505
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,320
How old were you?

506
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,360
17.

507
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,560
I was in high school.

508
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,800
Pity.

509
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,960
Shu Wenbo.

510
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,480
Do you like Xia?

511
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,800
I choose Dare.

512
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,840
Why would you choose Dare?

513
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,760
Two choices. I choose Dare.

514
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:15,920
Alright.

515
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,720
Dare it is.

516
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
Take out of your phone.

517
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Call the fifth person

518
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,440
in your call history

519
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,280
and tell him one of

520
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,320
your secrets.

521
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,200
Put it here

522
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,760
so everyone can see who it is.

523
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,480
Lu Feng.

524
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,760
Why did you call him?

525
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,840
I’ll make the call then.

526
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,480
I didn’t know.

527
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,060
(Lu Feng)

528
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,290
Hello,

529
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,240
Lu Feng.

530
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,120
Well, I...

531
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,880
I... What are you trying to say?

532
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,520
I happen to be bored now.

533
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,240
Come to my bar and drink with me.

534
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,920
I’m on a vacation with Xing Kelei.

535
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,560
What?

536
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,600
You didn’t invite me?

537
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,800
It’s Mi Ka’s birthday.

538
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,320
Keyao and everyone else are here.

539
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,000
Is Xia there?

540
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,800
Xia is...not here.

541
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,720
No, she’s not here.

542
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,000
Then I’m not going.

543
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,200
Why are you calling?

544
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,680
Keep talking.

545
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,760
Um...

546
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,600
Nothing.

547
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,560
Then why did you call me?

548
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,880
Mi Ka and Xia are good friends.

549
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,800
How come she isn’t at her party?

550
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,880
I asked her out for dinner on weekends.

551
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
She said she was occupied.

552
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,080
I’ll try again.

553
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,640
Forget it.

554
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,720
You flirt with all girls you met.

555
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,760
I’m not flirting with her.

556
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,600
I like her

557
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,200
and I will get her.

558
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,040
Besides,

559
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,070
Wenbo has no problem

560
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,480
with me suiting Xia.

561
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,640
Well, it’s late.

562
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,920
It’s Mi Ka’s birthday, isn’t it?

563
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,540
Let’s cut the cake.

564
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,680
Yeah, I want cake.

565
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Xing Kelei, cake.

566
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,280
Where is the cake?

567
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,560
What cake?

568
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,320
I’m asking you,

569
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,310
-Xing Kelei.
-What cake?

570
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,080
I forgot it.

571
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,600
It’s OK.

572
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,440
I...

573
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,560
I’ll eat this.

574
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,840
Happy birthday.

575
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,840
It’s the same.

576
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,160
Shu Wenbo,

577
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,640
you have no problem with
Lu Feng suiting me?

578
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,680
What do you mean?

579
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,560
I heard it’s someone’s birthday.

580
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,160
Happy Birthday!

581
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,640
As a friend,

582
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,560
let me tell you a secret.

583
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,160
Captain Xing

584
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,600
asked me to sign

585
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,600
for a package that costs thousands.

586
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,600
I guess it’s a gift for you.

587
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,000
There’ll be a surprise

588
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,760
on your romantic vacation.

589
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,640
Be prepared for it.

590
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,680
It’s my birthday.

591
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,720
I made myself a cake.

592
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,120
There isn’t even one gift.

593
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,200
Who cares?

594
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,020
(Xing Kelei)

595
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,840
I ate too much tonight.

596
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,160
Would you like a stroll?

597
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:52,940
(Mi Ka: Coming!)

598
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,520
The view is good up ahead.

599
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,640
Shall we?

600
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,960
Sure.

601
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,160
Get a drink,

602
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,600
in case you’re thirsty.

603
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,440
There are some in the trunk.

604
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,440
You want me to get it?

605
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,920
Yeah, go.

606
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,600
Alright.

607
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:38,140
(Happy birthday)

608
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,480
Come on.

609
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,960
Look at there.

610
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,840
What is it?

611
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,880
The Aries.

612
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,000
That’s Aries?

613
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,880
Yeah.

614
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,240
That’s you.

615
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,080
Competitive and childish.

616
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,880
You’re childish.

617
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,640
You know horoscope?

618
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,560
It’s a wild guess.

619
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,320
Beautiful.

620
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,640
He prepared

621
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,600
fireworks for me.

622
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,520
Where are their parents?

623
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,240
Teach them a lesson.
They could start a wild fire.

624
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,960
Wait for me.

625
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,480
Unbelievable.

626
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,600
Come on.

627
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,640
The view is great here.

628
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,400
It’s perfect to watch stars here.

629
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,840
Yes.

630
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,080
You know?

631
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,960
Sometimes I thought

632
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,600
if it was a wrong decision

633
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,400
to quit the career

634
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,800
as a doctor.

635
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,160
I thought you would

636
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,280
never say something like that.

637
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,840
Life is a journey

638
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,440
with lots of branches.

639
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,880
Each branch

640
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,160
leads to different views.

641
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,800
It’s not right or wrong

642
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,560
to choose any branch.

643
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,040
Different branches

644
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,320
may lead to the same end.

645
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,080
Right?

646
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,760
Who is the first love

647
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,620
you mentioned

648
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,320
who blew you off on the concert?

649
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,640
Is that why

650
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,280
you kept looking at me?

651
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
You wanna know?

652
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,280
I made it up.

653
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,480
Don’t you know who my first love is?

654
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,600
No, I don’t.

655
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,040
My first love is you.

656
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,960
It’s you.

657
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,520
I do remember

658
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,200
there was once

659
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,720
that I queued up for a long time

660
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,360
to get tickets for a concert.

661
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,600
At last,

662
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,720
you slept off

663
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,840
while working on your paper.

664
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,800
I waited for nothing.

665
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,760
You never came. Did you?

666
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,880
I apologized to you

667
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,800
for many times.

668
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,800
It’s been years.

669
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,240
You still remember it?

670
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,360
I don’t need your apology.

671
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,080
I don’t think you were wrong.

672
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,870
I’m just saying

673
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
I didn’t lie just now.

674
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,000
I just changed a time

675
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,640
and a location.

676
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,200
The stars are bright tonight.

677
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,680
Do you remember?

678
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,640
When we were abroad,

679
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,600
you took me

680
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,000
to the desert to watch the stars once.

681
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Yes.

682
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,720
I’ll never forget it.

683
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,320
If you’re interested,

684
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,200
we can find somewhere

685
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,160
around here

686
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,560
some time

687
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,160
to watch the stars together.

688
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,840
Why are you walking so fast?

689
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,770
It’s late.

690
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,920
I wanna go to bed.

691
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,400
Catch up.

692
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,840
It’s late.

693
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,360
Wait.

694
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,520
This is not the way back to the villa.

695
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,400
Where have you led me?

696
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,280
I never said we’re going back.

697
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,800
Where are we going then?

698
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,320
It’s not my place

699
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,320
to make judgment on this.

700
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,280
The decision

701
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,360
is related to yourself,

702
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,280
and your parents

703
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,720
and family.

704
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,680
After all,

705
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,520
your father is ill.

706
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,360
You need to go back

707
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,480
and take over the family business.

708
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,840
You should.

709
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,000
So this is your opinion?

710
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,240
You want me to leave?

711
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,360
You don’t care if I leave?

712
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,280
If I care,

713
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,920
will you stay?

714
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,840
Yes.

715
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,520
Say it.

716
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,120
Tell me you want me to stay.

717
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,800
If you say it, I’ll stay.

718
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,040
Is it so difficult?

719
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,240
Is it so hard to say?

720
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,560
We’ve been together for so many years.

721
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,560
If I leave,

722
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,320
we can hardly meet each other again,

723
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,920
you know?

724
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,280
Is what you said to me

725
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,200
a joke?

726
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,400
I just want to hear it from you,

727
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,760
don’t go and stay with me.

728
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,160
We’ll have a romantic wedding

729
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,080
and lots of kids.

730
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,040
Why can’t you say it?

731
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,000
What do you mean by keeping silence?

732
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,670
I can’t.

733
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,710
I can’t say that.

734
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,400
Is it that complicated?

735
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,190
Yes.

736
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,040
How so?

737
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,400
It just is.

738
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,120
Why can’t you say it?

739
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,560
We’re adults.

740
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,630
Be sensible.

741
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,120
When there’s a problem, we solve it.

742
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,710
It’s better than acting on impulse.

743
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,520
Tell me.

744
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,120
Stay.

745
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,480
Alright.

746
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,920
You’re sensible.

747
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,040

(TO: Xing Keyao)
Yi Qian talked about a party.

785
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,440
Shall we throw a party when we go back?

786
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,680

Dr. Mi isn’t a sensitive girl.

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,640
To be with her, you need to be frank.

You want to make it romantic.

792
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,800
But she’ll miss every sign.

Even so,

794
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,560

Dr. Mi is competitive.

802
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,760
She’s used to protecting others.

803
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,880
From now on,

804
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,160

Though she had tears and snots,

813

820

It’s a neuroendocrine reflex
