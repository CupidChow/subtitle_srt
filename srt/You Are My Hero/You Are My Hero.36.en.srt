00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,660
(Xing Kelei: Something came up
in the team. I won’t go back today.)

25
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,320
Captain Xing.

26
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,200
Captain Xing.

27
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,920
Yeah.

28
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,960
Captain Xing.

29
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,720
We verified

30
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,080
Xiang Lulu’s identity again.

31
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,360
She used to work

32
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,280
as a lobby manager in a place

33
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,120
in Nanxiu, Guangxi.

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,440
The police also found

35
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,880
the trace of Wu Keming

36
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,960
in that hotel.

37
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,160
It all fits now.

38
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,560
Xiang Lulu moved here four years ago

39
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,480
before Wu Keming’s

40
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,160
mother died.

41
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,240
You are saying

42
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,520
Wu Keming’s mother

43
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,680
knew this kid

44
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,560
and wanted to see her grandson
before she died.

45
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,840
So she asked Xiang Lulu

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,640
to bring the child back.

47
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah, no one knows

48
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,480
that this kid is Wu Keming’s son.

49
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,120
They can keep living there

50
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,400
as tenants.

51
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,240
Wu Keming’s older sister knows it.

52
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,920
She is looking after
this mother and son.

53
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,320
But I don’t think he came back this time

54
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,880
just to see his son.

55
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
It won’t take that long.

56
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,200
Why is he still staying here?

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,080
Have you finished?

58
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,720
Put on your clothes
if you have finished.

59
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,040
If what Heisan said

60
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,120
is true,

61
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,120
what will he do today?

62
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,680
Yeah.

63
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,000
What will he do...

64
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,520
The target is leaving the house.
Now set off.

65
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,020
(Xing Kelei: Something came up
in the team. I won’t go back today.)

66
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,460
(Ruan Qingxia)

67
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,680
Hello.

68
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,360
Mi Ka.

69
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,600
I just read your message.

70
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,520
I also heard

71
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,200
that Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

72
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,800
appeared in your hospital.

73
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,920
The ER is closed.

74
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
How are you doing now?

75
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,720
I’m still having a fever.

76
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
How did that happen?

77
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,000
Does Xing Kelei know it?

78
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,080
He doesn’t know.

79
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,920
He went out on a mission
the day before yesterday.

80
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,560
I can’t reach him.

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,720
How can he leave you alone?

82
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,320
What should you do then?

83
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,760
I’m still in the suburbs.

84
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,160
It’s okay, my co-workers

85
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,920
are taking good care of me.

86
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,280
No, wait for me.

87
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
I’ll go to the hospital to see you

88
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,160
right after I finish the shooting.

89
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,400
Don’t bother, I’m really fine.

90
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,720
You don’t need to come.

91
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
No, I’m going to the hospital.

92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,760
I’ll just wait for you outside
if I can’t go in.

93
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,960
At least I can stay with you.

94
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,200
Thank you, Xia.

95
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,880
No thanks necessary between us.

96
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,760
I’ll teach Xing Kelei

97
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,640
a good lesson for you.

98
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,840
Okay. Bye.

99
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,240
Xiang Lulu is

100
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,600
taking a taxi to Jiangning

101
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,520
with the kid.

102
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,640
We haven’t found

103
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,240
the trace of Wu Keming.

104
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,320
Captain Xing.

105
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,920
Xiang Lulu is taking

106
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,840
a taxi to Jiangning.

107
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,560
We haven’t found Wu Keming’s car

108
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,960
at tollgates along the highway.

109
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,600
Jiangning.

110
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,480
Will she run away

111
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,680
with Wu Keming?

112
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,920
Captain Xing.

113
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,640
Ask the Police Department
for reinforcements.

114
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,200
Keep an eye on the train station,

115
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,320
the coach station and the airport.

116
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,960
Okay.

117
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,780

118
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Xiang Lulu is taking the kid

119
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,640
to Renxin Hospital.

120
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,720
Captain Xing.

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,880
Xiang Lulu is taking the kid

122
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,080
to Renxin Hospital.

123
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,280
Renxin Hospital.

124
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,840
The file shows

125
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,120
that her child has Kawasaki disease.

126
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,600
They might go there for a reexamination.

127
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,920
Maybe Wu Keming

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,080
will also show up there.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,200
The hospital is crowded with people
and the environment is complicated.

130
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,560
It’s hard to control

131
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,600
and arrest him.

132
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
That’s why

133
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
he chose this place.

134
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,120
Wu Keming might

135
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,960
show up in the hospital.

136
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Send two people to follow them inside.

153

for two white coats

155
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,800
and dress as doctors.

156

to do a blood test.

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,160

the blood test result.

I won’t go back.

204

Captain Xing.

205
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,320
Xiang Lulu is just
waiting for the result

206
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,360
with the kid.

207
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,160
The kid is using the phone.

208
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,960
She didn’t make

209
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,000
any phone call during this time.

210
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,320
Could we guess it wrong?

211
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,080
Maybe she and Wu Keming

212
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,560
have no relationship to each other.

213
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,240
Wu Keming came back

214
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,760
for this.

215
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,320
He should be around.

216
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,600
Hello.

217
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,200
Are you sure?

218
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,160
Okay.

219
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,840
They found Wu Keming’s car

220
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,760
in a parking lot

221
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
five kilometers away.

222
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,760
But there is no clue in the car.

223
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,120
Your colleagues from the CSU

224
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,160
have rushed in there.

225
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,280
He left the car.

226
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,960
Captain Xing.

227
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,040
I heard that a patient

228
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,640
with Middle East Respiratory Disease

229
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,080
came to Renxin Hospital recently.

230
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,520
Anyway, it’s a patient

231
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,440
with a highly contagious disease.

232
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
The whole ER

233
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,000
has been locked down
for a day and a night.

234
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,120
Is Mi Ka all right?

235
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,720
I didn’t bring my phone.

236
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,800
I don’t know.

237
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,360
But she has been
transferred to neurosurgery.

238
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,560
She should be fine.

239
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,720
Captain Xing.

240
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,320
She has seen the doctor with the kid.

241
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,240
Now she is walking out.

242
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,960
Roger that.

243
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,480
People at the door guard it well.

244
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,080
She might take a taxi
and leave at any time.

245
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,000
Captain Xing. Captain Xing.

246
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,920
She is walking to the lawn

247
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,840
by the back door.

248
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,760
She is sitting on a bench

249
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
on the lawn with the kid.

250
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,280
Roger that.

251
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
Let’s take a detour and take a look.

252
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,680
Did Xiang Lulu make any call

253
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,320
with her phone?

254
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,680
No.

255
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,520
She didn’t

256
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,480
make any call with her phone.

257
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,360
Okay, roger that.

258
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,460
(Xing Kelei: Something came up
in the team. I won’t go back today.)

259
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,160
Chen Tao.

260
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,440
My temperature has

261
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,480
dropped to 36.5.

262
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,640
Should you ask

263
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,640
Director Wei to take a look at me?

264
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,760
If it’s all right,

265
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,880
can I be

266
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,960
released from quarantine?

267
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,400
Attention.

268
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,080
Wu Keming might show up at any time.

269
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,520
I guess she worries
that the child might be hungry.

270
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
So she ordered some takeaway food.

271
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,040
She didn’t make any call.

272
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,800
Something is wrong.

273
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,880
The police.

274
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,640
Don’t move! Don’t move!

275
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,840
Don’t come over!

276
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,560
Lay down your weapon.

277
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,110
Wu Keming.

278
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,640
You care about your son so much.

279
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,240
Do you really want him

280
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
to have

281
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,440
such a bloody memory

282
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,070
in his childhood?

283
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,350
Do you really want them

284
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,830
to live at such a small space

285
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,070
for a lifetime?

286
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,880
He is such a cute kid.

287
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,880
Don’t you want him

288
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,240
to go outside and see the world?

289
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,200
For you,

290
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,120
and for your family,

291
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,520
put down your weapon.

292
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,760
Let’s go.

293
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,140
(Inpatient Department)

294
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,680
If you have any discomfort,

295
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,720
you must come to the hospital

296
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,250
in the first place.

297
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,960
You are a doctor.

298
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,080
Don’t take it lightly.

299
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,480
Got it, go to work.

300
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,440
Call me if anything happens.

301
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,080
Bye.

302
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,800
Bye.

303
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,280
Mi Ka!

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,920
How are you doing now?

305
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,400
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

306
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,840
No.

307
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,520
Really?

308
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,240
Just a little headache.

309
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,440
A headache.

310
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,640
Are you really fine?

311
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,760
Yeah.

312
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,800
Does Xing Kelei know that you are sick?

313
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,920
He doesn’t know.

314
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,800
What’s wrong with him?

315
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
I’ll call Wenbo

316
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,000
and ask him.

317
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,760
The phone

318
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,800
you are calling is powered off.

319
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,520
The phone

320
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,320
you are calling is powered off.

321
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,120
Why is it still powered off?

322
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,640
I guess he is still busy.

323
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,320
The mission hasn’t been finished?

324
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,440
Let’s go.
Let me take you home first.

325
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,800
Put your arms inside.

326
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,080
Don’t catch a cold.

327
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,720
Have a good sleep.

328
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,880
I’ll be in the living room.

329
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Call me if you need anything.

330
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,600
Thank you.

331
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,080
Mi Ka. Mi Ka!

332
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,960
Xia.

333
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,160
Where’s Mi Ka?

334
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,880
Mi Ka is sick.

335
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,880
Is it serious?

336
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,880
A patient

337
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,000
with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

338
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,200
went to their hospital.

339
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,880
The whole ER has been closed.

340
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,400
Mi Ka was inside.

341
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,840
She was sick and had a fever.

342
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,280
So she was also quarantined.

343
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,120
The fever just subsided this evening

344
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,080
and she was released.

345
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,080
She is upstairs sleeping.

346
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,960
Take good care of her.

347
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
I’m leaving.

348
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,680
I made some porridge. It’s in the pot.

349
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,680
Okay.

350
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,880
Thank you.

351
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,600
Sorry.

352
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,880
I didn’t know you were quarantined.

353
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,720
Were you scared?

354
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,480
I wasn’t sacred.

355
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,840
I was just afraid of

356
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,000
being infected on the first day.

357
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,640
Later,

358
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,440
what I’m more afraid of is

359
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,200
whether you get injured
during the mission.

360
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,920
Are you all right?

361
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,840
I’m fine.

362
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,600
That’s good.

363
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,680
Come on.

364
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,040
Sit down.

365
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,720
Let me feed you.

366
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
I only had a fever.

367
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,280
It’s not that I can’t
take care of myself.

368
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,920
You should have told me

369
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,840
that you had a fever.

370
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,760
I tried to

371
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,840
call you.

372
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,040
You turned off your phone.

373
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,360
Later I knew

374
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,000
you were on a mission.

375
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,680
I didn’t dare tell you.

376
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,520
I was afraid...

377
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,680
I was afraid you would worry about me.

378
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,720
I’m quite guilty.

379
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,200
I’m not

380
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,400
a good boyfriend.

381
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,000
No.

382
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,640
You told me

383
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,000
to act strong

384
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,000
in front of other people

385
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,440
and leave
the most vulnerable side to you.

386
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,160
You need to do the same thing.

387
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,080
Why are you talking so sweetly today?

388
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,720
You woke up early.

389
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,920
I’ll go to work.

390
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,200
It’s not early already.

391
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,200
Go to work? Shouldn’t you rest today?

392
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,040
I’m fine.

393
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,280
I’m worried that the hospital
is short-handed.

394
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,040
I’ll go to take a look.

395
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,320
Have a breakfast.

396
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,560
I’ll eat at the hospital.

397
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,000
It’s too late.

398
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,960
Have the breakfast first.
I’ll send you there later.

399
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,160
Shu Wenbo!

400
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,760
What have you been doing these days?

401
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,440
I was on a mission.

402
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,480
I can’t say it.

403
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,920
You have to make it up for me.

404
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,280
No problem.

405
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,520
Whatever you want.

406
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,440
What are we going to do?

407
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,600
Enjoy the view, have a fancy meal,

408
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,600
and go shopping!

409
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,580
(Outpatient)

410
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,360
Are you off tomorrow?

411
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,160
We can spend tomorrow together.

412
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,160
Okay.

413
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,240
I’m leaving.

414
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,520
Drive safely on the way back home.

415
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,080
Do you remember

416
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,000
you took photos of me

417
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,920
right here last time?

418
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,160
Yeah.

419
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,000
Give me the phone.

420
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,640
I’ll take more photos of you.

421
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,520
No.

422
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,480
I just want you to stay by my side.

423
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,920
Shu Wenbo.

424
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,520
I want to marry you right away.

425
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,640
What did you say?

426
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
Nothing.

427
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,080
Why are you smiling?

428
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
I’m not smiling.

429
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
What a beautiful view.

430
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,720
Well,

431
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,520
it’s beautiful.

432
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,880
You are bringing too many stuffs.

433
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,800
We are going to the seaside tomorrow.

434
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,120
It’s a long trip.

435
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,480
We need food

436
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,360
in case you are hungry.

437
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
All these are your favorite foods.

438
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,920
Are you

439
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,840
making it up for me?

440
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,600
I’m just being nice to my girlfriend.

441
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,000
No.

442
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
By the way, I found

443
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,840
a good seafood

444
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,520
and barbecue restaurant.

445
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,520
How about we go to

446
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
that restaurant tomorrow night?

447
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,560
Okay, whatever you want.

448
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,280
It’s ten kilometers away.
We’re almost there.

449
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,000
After we arrive there,

450
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,320
can we eat first?

451
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,560
I’m hungry.

452
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,120
That’s because you slept in.

453
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,720
Have some of these first.

454
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,240
Here, cookies.

455
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,000
Take a bite.

456
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,160
No, I want to eat seafood.

457
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,400
What a troublesome man.

458
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,100
(Captain Hao calling)

459
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,680
Hello.

460
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,400
I am Hao Yicheng.

461
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,000
There is a major vicious incident

462
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,760
in the east of the city

463
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,960
on a busy street

464
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,960
which needs to be
dealt with immediately.

465
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,040
Come back now.

466
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,080
Okay, got it.

467
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,520
Make a U-turn now.

468
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,560
Sorry.

469
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,000
Stop saying sorry to me.

470
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,600
You are a policeman.

471
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,960
Can you disobey the order

472
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,440
because of me?

473
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,080
The love life of a policeman

474
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,200
is basically single life.

475
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,800
It’s totally true.

476
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,320
Coming.

477
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,840
Hurry up, help me with it.

478
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
It’s too heavy.

479
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Oh my god.

480
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,760
Why did you buy so many stuffs?

481
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,280
I bought these things

482
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,520
to comfort you

483
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,160
who have been

484
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
stood up by Xing Kelei

485
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
again and again.

486
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,160
Didn’t Shu Wenbo also stand you up?

487
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,600
That’s different.

488
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,160
He stayed with me all day yesterday.

489
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,120
We also saw

490
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,640
the super beautiful sunset.

491
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,440
Just go back.

492
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,160
All right.

493
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,920
Let’s not talk about this.

494
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,800
Let’s have

495
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,280
hot pot and drink beer tonight.

496
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,400
Let’s get drunk.

497
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,520
Cheers.

498
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,400
Cheers.

499
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,760
Hot pot, barbecue,

500
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,280
and cold beer.

501
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,800
It feels so great.

502
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,080
So great.

503
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,160
It’s 11:00 PM.

504
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,800
What’s wrong?

505
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,520
Are you worried about Xing Kelei?

506
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,520
Don’t you worry about Shu Wenbo?

507
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,760
Of course I’m worried.

508
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,280
But what can we do?

509
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,360
No one made us

510
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,080
fall in love

511
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,200
with two special policemen.

512
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,120
Are you all right

513
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,600
with Xing Kelei?

514
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,440
Yes.

515
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,720
It’s just that I suddenly

516
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,720
realized a fact recently.

517
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
What fact?

518
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,480
Our jobs

519
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,240
are too special.

520
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,040
We need to work overtime
every now and then.

521
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
There are emergencies from time to time.

522
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,720
Even we live in the same house,

523
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,640
we may not be able to
see each other for a long time.

524
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,520
Even we see each other,

525
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,800
we only have the time to say hi.

526
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,320
Can this relationship last long?

527
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,640
Same here.

528
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,680
Shu Wenbo

529
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,400
also stands me up all the time.

530
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,280
Everyone in the Special Police

531
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,680
stands people up all the time.

532
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,320
I wish I can be optimistic like you.

533
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,080
Once you

534
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,440
make a decision,

535
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,480
you would just head for it.

536
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,400
Then you should learn from me.

537
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,480
Think less

538
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,160
and you will be happier.

539
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,640
Think less and be happier.

540
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
Okay!

541
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,240
From tonight,

542
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,440
let’s go get it.

543
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,160
Come on.

544
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,240
Come on.

545
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,080
Instructor, Captain Shu.

546
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,630
See you tomorrow.

547
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,320
Okay.

548
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:11,920
Bye.

549
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,040
Bye.

550
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,820
(Xing Kelei)

551
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,520
Don’t go.

552
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,040
Stay with me.

553
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,200
Wenbo.

554
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,040
Give me a kiss.

555
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,580
(Outpatient)

556
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:22,720
Morning.

557
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,760
Mi Ka, you’ve recovered.

558
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,520
-Dr. Mi, you are back.
-Morning.

559
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
(Waiting for Xing Kelei
to accept the call)

560
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,760
Sorry.

561
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,200
The subscriber you dialed

562
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,560
cannot be connected for the moment.

563
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,120
Please redial later.

564
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,920
(Mi Ka)
Sorry.

565
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,880
The subscriber you dialed

566
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,680
cannot be connected for the moment.

567
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,600
Do you have time this weekend?

568
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,200
Can you do me a favor?

569
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,880
What’s wrong?

570
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,400
Can you

571
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,880
pick a diamond ring for me?

572
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,680
I trust your taste.

573
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,080
Do you want to propose?

574
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,600
Do you think

575
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,640
I’m in a hurry?

576
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,520
Well,

577
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,160
once you fly, you soar into the sky.

578
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,360
It’s too fast.

579
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,760
I want to

580
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,560
make up for all the time

581
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,080
I wasted.

582
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,600
Okay, I’ll help you.

583
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,520
Mr. Shao.

584
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,840
You are back.

585
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,760
Have you received the mail?

586
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,200
What mail?

587
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,200
It looks like you don’t know it yet.

588
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,320
You passed the preliminary evaluation

589
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,440
of Allen Medical Center.

590
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,640
You need to add some more materials.

591
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,280
Then an interviewer will

592
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,560
make a video call to you

593
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,680
and interview you online.

594
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,160
That’s it?

595
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,600
Shouldn’t you be very happy?

596
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,840
Mr. Shao...

597
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,440
Mr. Shao, to be honest,

598
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,280
I haven’t decided

599
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,680
whether I’m going or not.

600
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,960
Because of Xing Kelei, right?

601
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,000
There are too many choices.

602
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,720
Welcome.

603
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,040
What kind of ring

604
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,160
do you need?

605
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:08,960
A diamond ring.

606
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,800
Do you need it for a proposal?

607
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,080
What’s your budget?

608
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,800
Budget...

609
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,600
Do you have any recommendations?

610
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,680
We want something special.

611
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,800
Okay.

612
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,440
These two rings are very special

613
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,200
and pretty.

614
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,840
You can take a look.

615
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,600
In fact, a diamond ring

616
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,520
is special enough
as long as it’s big enough.

617
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,160
It sounds about right.

618
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,600
But she may not like

619
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,240
this ostentatious style.

620
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,040
Why don’t you ask Mi Ka?

621
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,080
See if Xia told her

622
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,920
what kind of ring

623
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,400
she likes.

624
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,840
Okay, I’ll ask her.

625
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,800
Wait a moment.

626
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,440
Because Xing Kelei’s work

627
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,880
is special,

628
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,880
he needs to make an application

629
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,080
to go abroad.

630
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,240
If there is a temporary task,

631
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,800
he has to cancel the leave.

632
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,760
I also heard

633
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,080
that the courses of Allen Medical Center

634
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,600
are tightly scheduled.

635
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,720
It’s true.

636
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,700
(Xing Kelei: Which one looks good?)

637
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,480
What’s wrong?

638
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,240
Nothing.

639
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,120
Mr. Shao.

640
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,440
Wait a minute.

641
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,840
Think about

642
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,640
this matter carefully.

643
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,560
It’s a good opportunity

644
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,000
and it’s very important

645
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,240
for your future development.

646
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,080
Don’t make a hasty decision.

647
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,720
Okay, Mr. Shao.

648
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,480
Let’s go.

649
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,560
How is it?

650
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,040
She hasn’t replied.
I guess she is busy now.

651
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,480
What should I do then?

652
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,240
Just find one

653
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,600
that will look good on her.

654
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,880
I think any ring will

655
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,760
look good on her.

656
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,840
Sir.

657
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,520
We also have this series.

658
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,960
You can take a look.

659
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,040
The wedding rings

660
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,480
and the diamond ring
are from the same series.

661
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,720
These three rings

662
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,480
will cost less than 30,000 together.

663
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,760
It’s quite cost-effective.

664
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,800
You can take a look.

665
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,240
Okay. Can I try it?

666
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,480
Yes.

667
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,960
Look at this.

668
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,760
Try it for me.

669
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,880
I want to see if these two rings

670
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,720
look good together.

671
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,280
Didn’t you say that any ring

672
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,280
would look good on her?

673
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,720
Your fingers are thin.

674
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,600
You can wear it.

675
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,640
Let me see if they look good together.

676
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
Also wear

677
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,040
the diamond ring.

678
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,160
Not bad, right?

679
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,800
Not bad.

680
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,200
It looks good together.

681
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:06,920
It looks good.

682
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,800
Let me hold your hand.

683
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
Look, let’s hold hands.

684
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,400
Right?

685
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,560
Doesn’t it look good?

686
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,440
Hold hands.

687
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,760
The price of this series
is favorable now.

688
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,520
There is a discount
if you buy the three of them.

689
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,200
It’s quite cost-effective.

690
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,200
Okay.

691
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,680
Okay, I’ll take them.

692
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,680
Okay.

693
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,000
You can wear this ring.

694
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,200
What’s your fiancée’s

695
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,160
ring size?

696
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,600
Please take a look.

697
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,120
She wears this one on the ring finger,

698
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,520
and this one on the middle finger.

699
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,520
Okay.

700
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,200
That’s her size.

701
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,200
Please hold on.

702
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,480
Well done.

703
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,080
You are really thoughtful now.

704
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
I’ve been thinking about this
for a long time.

705
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,160
Am I sincere?

706
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,840
Sir, please keep this.

707
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,760
Okay, thanks.

708
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,480
Okay.

709
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,200
Please take a look.

710
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,280
If there is nothing wrong

711
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,920
with this series,

712
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,440
I’ll wrap them up for you.

713
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,400
You can have a 5% discount

714
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,520
for these three rings.

715
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,080
If you buy more thing,

716
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,320
you can get a 12% discount.

717
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,640
Do you want to

718
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,840
buy one more thing?

719
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,800
You can wear the dragon
and phoenix bracelets

720
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,840
or necklaces on the wedding.

721
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,720
I don’t need that.

722
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,320
You said a 12% discount?

723
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,240
Yes.

724
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,880
It can save me a lot of money.

725
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,000
How about you buy the rings with them?

726
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,600
Why don’t you buy one for Mi Ka?

727
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,840
What?

728
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,360
Aren’t you going to propose to Mi Ka?

729
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,560
I realize that you are

730
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,520
really insincere.

731
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
Mi Ka has been so good to you.

732
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,040
You don’t even buy a ring for her.

733
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,880
You...

734
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,440
How am I insincere?

735
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,520
Group buying a ring for her

736
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,120
is insincere.

737
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,040
Hold on.

738
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:44,760
Are you really not

739
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,560
going to propose to her?

740
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,640
I will propose.

741
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,760
Then why don’t you buy a ring for her?

742
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,600
Wait.

743
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,960
Are you a shill here?

744
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,240
Is it you or me who want to buy rings?

745
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,480
It’s me.

746
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,400
Well,

747
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,040
pick a necklace.

748
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,120
It will be my wedding gift for you.

749
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,920
-How can I take that?
-Shut up.

750
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,840
Show me

751
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,480
the necklace.

752
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,000
Okay, this way.

753
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:19,860
(They both look pretty, what’s wrong?)

754
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,880
That one is also pretty.

755
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,200
This one is not bad.

756
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,600
(I’m helping Shu Wenbo
buy a proposal ring for Xia.)

757
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,600
(He needed your advice.
Keep it a secret.)

758
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,560
(Don’t tell Xia.)
They are both good.

759
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,360
It’s just the right price.
