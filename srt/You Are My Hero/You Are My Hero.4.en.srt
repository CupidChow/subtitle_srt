This area

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,720
is quite untraversed.

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,720
I reckon we’ll have to drive

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,840
out another 10 miles or so.

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,560
You can still bear it, right?

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
Do I have another choice?

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,320
Slow down. Slow down.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,720
Alright. I’ll slow down.

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,680
No.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,480
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,440
What do you want on earth?

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,480
Are you all right, Xia?

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,800
Are you all right?

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,840
I’m not in the mood talking to you.

34
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,680
What?

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,320
I’m not in the mood talking to you.

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,240
If you don’t feel well, I can slow down.

37
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,720
Don’t… Don’t move.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,840
Xia, your shirt is broken.

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,670
One more move,

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,360
you shirt

41
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,640
will be torn apart.

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,560
Well then,

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,960
stop talking nonsense,

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,640
just help me with it.

You…

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,720
Put off your T-shirt.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,640
What?

53
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,360
Give your T-shirt to me!

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,040
Jesus.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
How many times of deep cleansing

56
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,240
I’m gonna need to save my face?

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,680
I’m done.

58
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,480
Well, you look different

59
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,160
than you were earlier.

60
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,080
What do you mean?

61
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,560
Do I look terrible without makeup?

62
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,400
No. No. No.

63
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,510
I just wanna say…

64
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,680
Turn around. Don’t look at me.

65
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,440
I mean you look great in this way.

66
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,600
More natural.

67
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,280
Seriously?

68
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,000
You didn’t even take a look at me.

69
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,920
I just did as you’ve asked.

70
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,640
Come on. Let’s go.

71
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,680
Buckle up.

72
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,920
Sorry. Sorry.

73
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
I didn’t mean to.

74
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,600
If apologies work,

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,080
why would we need the police?

76
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,080
Let’s go.

77
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,440
After a day of rest,

78
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
do you feel better now?

79
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,720
Not yet.

80
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,720
No? Then, do 100 squats first.

81
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,400
If not, you gotta get yourself together.

to come down
from the roof to the ground.

87

This wall behind us

88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,440
is 27 meters tall.

89
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,120
You only have 5 minutes
to finish the task.

90
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,520
Are you ready?

91
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Yes. Sir.

Yes. Sir.

94
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,240
Turn left.

95
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,600
Go upstairs.

101
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,200
Pull the brake tightly
with your right hand.

102
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,360
Don’t let go of it

I can’t see anyone up there.

It’s sweltering.

It’s hot, huh?

114
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,920
Yeah, it’s roasting hot.

Did she go up there?

123
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,280
I don’t know.

124
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,000
Come on.

125
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,920
The sooner the better.

126
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,000

What’s going on up there?

140
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,400
Yeah.

141

Oh my god!

142
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,640
Something could happen.

143
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,240

It’s serious.

150
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,580
Take a look.

151
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,100
Get her down.

152

-Get her down.
-Come on.

153
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,560
What’s wrong with her?

154
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,240
She looks pale.

155
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,080
Yeah.

156
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,440
Her breathing and pulse are stable.

157
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,240
It is a syncope caused

158
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,840
by certain psychological factors

159
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,280
and specific stimuli.

160
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,400
Cut to the chase.

161
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,640
She was scared out of her mind.

162
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,000
She has a fear of heights.

I’m fine.

169

I felt better after having a bowl

170
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,000
of beef noodles last night.

171
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,360
Nothing to worry about.

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,680
You should tell us earlier

173
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,160
that you have Acrophobia.

174
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,400

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,280
Speaking of which,

178
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,080
let me help you.

179
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,600
Come on.

180
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,240
Yanshan. Let me do this for you.

181
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,840
What’re you doing?

182
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,320
I saved a bottle of water for you.

183
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,720
Physical training costs too much energy.

184
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,960
You girls must drink more water.

185
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,720
What about mine?

186
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,760
In my bag.

187
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
Here you are.

188
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,440
How interesting it is!

189
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,760
We’ve finished the test.

190
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,320
Why would we still need
physical training?

191
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,000
Might as well let us go back
to the hospital

192
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
and report for duty as soon as possible.

193
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,080
It should be some kind of hidden test.

194
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,120
You never know what will come next.

195
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,320
Let’s go, don’t fall behind.

196
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,920
OK.

197
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,200
We’ll camp here tonight.

198
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,840
All of our instructors have

199
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,920
prepared a completion party for you.

200
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,000
Tonight,

201
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,320
you guys

202
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,080
can enjoy yourselves.

203
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,800
Bravo.

204
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,320
Bravo. Bravo.

205
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,920
Next,

206
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,280
I’m gonna present

207
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,000
Certificate of Completion to you.

208
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,120
The trainees who are named,

209
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,600
please step forward
to receive your certificate.

210
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,080
Chen Xiaoyan.

211
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,040
Zhang Qingqing.

212
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,160
Chen Tao.

213
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,240
That’s it. That’s it.

214
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,960
Nie Xiaohui.

215
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,720
Liu Rong.

216
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,240
Li Hong.

217
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,840
Gong Ning.

218
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,240
Su Wei.

219
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,560
Wang Jiali.

220
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,640
Zhang Dan.

221
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,600
Cheng Xinya.

222
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,840
Liu Chengwei.

223
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,920
Xu Yanshan.

224
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,160
For this session
of Emergency Rescue Training,

225
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,240
all Certificates of Completion

226
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
have been issued.

227
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,880
Congratulations to the above trainees!

228
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,920
Sir.

229
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,640
What about Mi Ka?

230
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,080
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

231
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,840
Mi Ka…

232
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,600
Mi Ka hasn’t finished rappelling test.

233
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,160
That’s why she can’t get
the certificate.

234
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,120
But she landed at last.

235
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,840
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

236
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,560
Would you please make an exception
for her?

237
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,200
After all, she got the highest score

238
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,280
in the comprehensive training.

239
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,040
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

240
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,440
Just give her one more chance.

241
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,680
Give her another chance, please.

242
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,640
Would you please give her a chance?

243
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,200
Just one more chance.

244
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,000
I believe Mi Ka will be

245
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,280
a very excellent doctor.

246
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,160
But she is not qualified to be
an emergency rescuer.

247
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,520
A good emergency rescuer

248
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,360
requests not only hard-core
technologies,

249
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,200
but also a good psychological quality.

250
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,000
She

251
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,320
has a clear fear of heights.

252
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,760
I’m afraid I can’t issue a
Certificate of Completion for her.

253
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,000
Because I gotta be responsible for you

254
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,400
as well as the wounded

255
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,960
and her.

256
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,640
So, I’m sorry for that.

257
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,760
Xing Sir is right.

258
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,040
I’m not qualified

259
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,960
to get the Certificate of Completion yet.

260
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,400
The party is coming up soon.

261
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,200
Why don’t we start to get ready
for it,

262
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,120
OK?

263
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,440
Happy Graduation!

264
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,720
Alright. Dismissed.

265
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,840
Actually, you performed quite well.

266
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,200
No need to kill yourself, right?

267
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,960
I’m not trying to kill myself.

268
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,760
Life is wonderful.

269
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,360
Do you know how many passes

270
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,360
I have to take to be a doctor?

271
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,640
You’re not the only one

272
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,320
who failed me, Xing Kelei.

273
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,880
I’m not that weak.

274
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,240
Besides,

275
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,240
my life was also saved

276
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,560
by someone’s desperate efforts.

277
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,000
I definitely will cherish it.

278
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,880
Someone?

279
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,440
I was robbed two years ago.

280
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,640
It was a particularly dangerous
situation.

281
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,480
The robber put the grenade directly

282
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,200
into my hand.

283
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,720
I was thinking that

284
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,960
my life might be over at that moment.

285
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,320
Then, at this time,

286
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,000
Uncle Special Police

287
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,080
appeared.

288
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,160
He said to me that

289
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,360
I’m here, and you’ll be fine.

290
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,000
Then, he held the grenade

291
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,080
in his hand.

292
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,520
Uncle Special Police?

293
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,360
Seriously?

294
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Was he that old?

295
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,080
Why can’t you

296
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,440
see the point?

297
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,720
Am I talking about

298
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,200
his age?

299
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,800
No. It’s just that,

300
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,680
most of special police
aren’t particularly aged.

301
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,720
But he is certainly not young.

302
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,160
Because he is particularly calm.

303
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,200
He faced danger fearlessly.

304
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,040
He deserves such a complement.

305
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,920
Anyway, he’s super handsome.

306
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,680
You haven’t seen his face.

307
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,560
How do you know he’s handsome?

308
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,440
How do you know

309
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,720
I haven’t seen his face?

310
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,040
We special police

311
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,560
have to wear masks on missions.

312
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,160
No.

313
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,640
Even though he wore a mask,

314
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,000
I could feel

315
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,760
the light shining on him.

316
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,400
What are you laughing about?

317
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,440
Nothing.

318
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,000
You wouldn’t look like
a special police

319
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,080
if you weren’t wearing this outfit.

320
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,880
Why?

321
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,840
Look at your baby face

322
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,760
and your fair skin.

323
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,440
No one in the special police team
looks like you.

324
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,200
I…

325
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
…have a fair skin?

326
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,400
Well,

327
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,640
what’re you doing?

328
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,520
I’ll show you

329
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,960
how fair my original skin was.

330
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,920
See?

331
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,600
It’s tanned.
You called this fair skin?

332
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,000
You’re like I’m stepping on your tail.

333
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,280
I heard that

334
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,880
you are the youngest squadron leader.

335
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,080
This is unprecedented.

336
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,840
Are you even younger than me?

337
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
How is that possible?

338
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,240
I’ve been working for years.

339
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,440
You just graduated from college.

340
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,760
We have to study for seven years
in Medical College.

341
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,920
So, we should be about the same age.

342
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,980
(Emergency Rescue Training
Completion Party)

343
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,520
Look at these guys.
Negative in trainings.

344
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,680
Active in parties.

345
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:14,960
Well,

346
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,850
Xing Sir.

347
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,240
Can I take a picture with you?

348
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:18,920
Here we go.

349
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,830
1. 2. 3.

350
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,040
Xing Sir.
You didn’t look at the camera.

351
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,070
One more.

352
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,560
1. 2. 3.

353
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,560
OK.

354
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,600
Let me see.

355
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,080
What are you looking for?

356
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,840
Let’s go.

357
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,640
OK.

358
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,560
Don’t move.

359
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,760
Oh. You scared me.

360
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,080
Why are you here?

361
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,760
I can’t miss such a big fun.

362
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,920
I begged Captain Hao to appoint someone

363
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,840
to give me a ride.

364
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,960
What a party queen you are!

365
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,080
Well. What is this?

366
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,960
Did you change your career?

367
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,440
This is Shu Wenbo’s T-shirt.

368
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,160
Shu Wenbo’s T-shirt?

369
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,720
Then he took off his T-shirt

370
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,960
and gave it to me.

371
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,000
You didn’t like him, did you?

372
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,720
I also think it’s incredible.

373
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,480
It only take one second for you

374
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,200
to fall in love with someone.

375
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,800
You don’t even know

376
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,600
how adorable he was when he
took off his T-shirt and gave it to me

377
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,560
and the way he

378
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,480
looked straight ahead.

379
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,520
It turns out that my hero

380
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
never needs

381
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,920
a big scene to support his appearance.

382
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,680
He showed up just like that.

383
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,320
Then, what about your

384
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,480
Andy, Tony, Criz?

385
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,680
Cri…?

386
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,560
They’re no more than the colorful clouds

387
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,680
that my hero steps on.

388
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,560
What a messy theory!

389
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,960
Then why do you still wear

390
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,800
his T-shirt today?

391
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,720
I’m happy to.

392
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,640
I’m willing to wear it every day.

393
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,080
Good evening. Xing Sir.
Good evening. Shu Sir.

394
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,320
Shu Wenbo.

395
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,480
Shut up.

396
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,520
What’re you doing?
She’s calling you.

397
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,320
I’m not going. I’m not going.

398
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,080
Go. Go. Go.

399
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,560
Watch your attitude. Go.

400
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,400
No.

401
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,840
Come here.

402
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,640
Sit here.

403
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,320
There’s a seat for you.

404
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,200
There’s a seat for you.

405
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,920
Couple’s clothes, huh?

406
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,600
Well.

407
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,680
Xia, why are you

408
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,220
still wearing

409
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,000
my T-shirt?

410
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,680
There’s no mall nearby.

411
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,960
I haven’t had a chance to buy it.

412
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,840
I asked you yesterday

413
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,760
if you wanted to go to the mall.

414
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,680
You said no.

415
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,400
I just borrowed one of your shirts.

416
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,200
What’s the big deal?

417
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,240
I’m not... I’m not making it a big deal.

418
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,040
Interesting, isn’t it?

419
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,000
Goblin.

420
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,000
You can eat the Monk Tang’s flesh.

421
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,040
However,

422
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,560
you have to follow the rules.

423
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,000
Hey.

424
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,520
Why do you keep looking at me?

425
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,040
Look at me.

426
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,000
Assemble. Assemble. Assemble.

427
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,360
Everybody.

428
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,200
The 2019 Renxin Hospital

429
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,480
Emergency Rescue Training Team’s

430
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,720
Completion Party

431
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,960
is about to begin.

432
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,040
I hereby announce that

433
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,920
this party

434
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,600
is completely

435
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,080
taken control by the trainees.

436
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,200
Now the power is reversed.

437
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,120
Are you excited?

438
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,680
Are you thrilled?

439
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,400
Yeah!

440
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,800
Yeah!

441
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,680
What does it have to do with you?

442
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,720
Don’t get too excited yet.

443
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,800
We’ve almost been ripped off

444
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,840
by the instructors here for two weeks.

445
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,120
Shouldn’t we strike

446
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,960
back now?

447
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,640
-Definitely.
-Yes.

448
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,560
Yes.

449
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,280
OK.

450
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
Then, in the first

451
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,880
warm-up show,

452
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,560
we’ll invite Instructor Xing Kelei

453
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,880
who loves us toughly

454
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,240
to join us.

455
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,520
Let’s welcome him

456
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,480
with the loudest applause and cheering.

457
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

458
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,800
Welcome, Xing Sir.

459
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,160
Xing Sir. Go.

460
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,520
We’re waiting for you.

461
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,400
Good.

462
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,840
Xing Sir.

463
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,360
Put on this.

464
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,360
Here’s a bracelet.

465
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,000
Don’t get nervous. Xing Sir.

466
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,240
It’s just a little game

467
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,960
called Who Makes Your Heart Beat.

468
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,000
Now, as we can see,

469
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,440
Xing Sir’s heart rate

470
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,800
is sixty eight now.

471
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,640
If we can

472
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,920
make his heart beat

473
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,640
up to one hundred,

474
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,240
he has to be punished,

475
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,200
OK?

476
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,600
OK.

477
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,520
OK. OK. OK.

478
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,000
White Vengeance, huh?

479
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,200
Alright. Bring it on.

480
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,240
Let’s start from Xu Yanshan.

481
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,640
Twenty push-ups.

482
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,400
OK.

483
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,680
Ready?

484
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,640
Start the clock.

485
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,480
Go.

486
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,480
Fifty high knees.

487
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,640
Forty burpees.

488
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,440
How come his heart rate
only reaches eighty?

489
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,680
How is that possible?

490
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,400
Hail Captain Xing!

491
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,240
Yeah.

492
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Captain Xing.

493
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,720
Captain Xing.

494
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,320
Captain Xing. Captain Xing. Captain Xing.

495
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,080
Stop.

496
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,320
Mi Ka.

497
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
It’s your turn.

498
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,800
Not physical lesson.

499
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,520
Me?

500
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,800
If it still doesn’t work,

501
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,280
all of you gotta face the music.

502
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,440
Use the beauty trap.

503
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,320
What do you mean?

504
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,120
Go. Go. Go. Come on.

505
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,520
I can’t.

506
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,200
Just stare at him.

507
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,320
Don’t blink.

508
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,320
Stare…?

509
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,440
I’ve never lost a game like that.

510
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,680
No blinking? Me either.

511
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,960
Bring it on.

512
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,960
It’s up. It’s up.

513
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,360
Eighty-four. Eighty-five.

514
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,120
What’s happening?

515
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,560
It’s already reached one hundred
and twenty-five.

516
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
One hundred and twenty-five.

517
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,600
Captain Xing.

518
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,560
It’s broken, right?

519
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,840
Is the bracelet broken?
Or is your heart pounding…?

520
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,920
This is what they called

521
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,160
“Knight Love”.

522
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:48,920
Captain Xing.

523
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,360
You have to keep your word.

524
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,840
You’re the typical guy

525
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,240
who can’t resist the temptation
of beauty,

526
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,040
aren’t you?

527
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,880
Then he gotta receive the punishment.

528
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,400
Punish him.

529
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,560
Punish. Punish.

530
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,360
Punish. Captain Xing.

531
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,000
Punish. Captain Xing.

532
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,520
Punish. Punish.

533
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,200
OK. I’ll take it.

534
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,200
Come on.

535
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,310
(Capsicol)
OK.

536
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,640
Here comes the exciting time

537
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,080
of punishment.

538
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,640
Here’s a cookie

539
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,560
with some super-hot mustard.

540
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,760
Awesome.

541
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,920
Disgusting.

542
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,520
Captain Xing.

543
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,240
Eat it. Eat it.

544
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,040
Eat it. Eat it.

545
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,840
Eat it. Eat it.

546
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:33,400
Eat it.

547
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,320
Eat it.

548
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,160
Next, we’ll have a tougher one.

549
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Here’s a cup of water.

550
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,240
Pepper.

551
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,560
Chili oil.

552
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,640
When we were training,

553
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,440
the instructors often gave us

554
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,640
the patchouli water.

555
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,150
One more.

556
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,360
One more. One more.

557
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,920
One more.

558
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,400
One more. One more.

559
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,150
Sir.

560
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,440
It’s them
who asked me to do so.

561
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,840
Captain Xing.
This is a cure for all diseases.

562
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,880
Mi Ka.

563
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,640
No. I’m not going.

564
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:22,800
Mi Ka.

565
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,960
It’s time for you to take revenge.

566
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,120
Mi Ka. Mi Ka. Mi Ka.

567
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:26,680
Mi Ka.

568
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,240
Good.

569
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,840
Awesome.

570
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,320
Awesome. Awesome.

571
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,560
Hail Captain Xing!

572
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,120
You’ve been tortured by me
for so long.

573
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,280
Happy now?

574
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,600
I have a few more words for you.

575
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,120
We didn’t mean to

576
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,960
punish you.

577
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,160
Instead, we just wanted you

578
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,400
to be stronger

579
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,920
both physically

580
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,360
and mentally

581
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,200
through the training.

582
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,680
You’ve been through

583
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,640
such a tough training session.

584
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,320
What

585
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,000
can’t be overcome in your life?

586
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,680
Right?

587
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,920
-Yes.
-Yes.

588
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,200
Finally,

589
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,920
I wish you

590
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,360
all the best and huge success

591
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,520
in your respective positions

592
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,720
and your life.

593
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,480
-OK. OK.
-Thank you, Sir.

594
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,680
Then, beyond Captain Xing,

595
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,440
we still have one more person

596
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,440
to join our game.

597
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,200
That is our beloved

598
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,720
Captain Shu.

599
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,360
Captain Shu. Captain Shu. Captain Shu.

600
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,640
Captain Shu. Captain Shu. Captain Shu.

601
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,800
Captain Shu. Captain Shu. Captain Shu.

602
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,040
Captain Shu. Captain Shu. Captain Shu.

603
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,360
Captain Shu. Captain Shu. Captain Shu.

604
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,640
Captain Shu. Captain Shu. Captain Shu.

605
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
Captain Shu. Captain Shu. Captain Shu.

606
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,720
Xing Sir.

607
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,920
Captain Shu. Captain Shu. Captain Shu.

608
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Do you wanna rinse your mouth?

609
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,680
I’m fine.

610
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,800
I’m fine.

611
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,240
Captain Shu. Captain Shu. Captain Shu.

612
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,280
What’re you looking for?

613
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,440
I’m looking for the toilet.

614
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,400
Let me walk you to there.

615
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,960
Captain Shu. Captain Shu. Captain Shu.

616
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,680
It’s too far.

617
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
I’ll give you a ride.

618
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:50,960
This way.

619
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,700
Thank you.

620
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,680
Captain Shu. Captain Shu. Captain Shu.

621
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,880
Good.

622
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,720
Xing Sir.

623
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,080
There is a car accident

624
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,960
8.3 kilometers away from here.

625
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,880
Someone needs help.

626
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,640
(A car accident happened 8.3 km away.)
The APP alarmed.

627
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,440
Get on the car.

628
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,960
Let’s go.

629
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,080
Hello? What’s going on there?

630
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,320
Can you still talk?

631
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,520
The head of the car is badly damaged.

632
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,920
The car stuck here.

633
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,320
It is likely to slide down.

634
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,400
Xing Sir. Look.

635
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,640
Look at the reflective mirror.

636
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,960
The driver seems to be alive.

637
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,240
But he’s been bleeding.

638
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,920
It’s been a while.

639
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,640
He should have lost more
than 800ml of blood.

640
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,480
In this case,

641
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,960
he’s gonna die
even we send him to the hospital.

642
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,200
Xing Sir.

643
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:21,800
Can you find a way

644
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,800
to get him out?

645
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,680
Let me take a shot.

646
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,520
Sir. Don’t fall asleep.

647
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,880
Stay awake.

648
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,760
Sir. Sir.

649
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,400
Be careful.

650
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,280
How is the situation there?

651
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,480
He is trapped

652
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,680
and couldn’t get out of there.

653
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,760
Then, find a way

654
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,040
to put me in.

655
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,320
What’re you gonna do?

656
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,480
I can stop the bleeding for him.

657
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,120
But you have Acrophobia.

658
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,000
How are you gonna cope with it?

659
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
It’s too risky. No, you can’t.

660
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,120
Even the Rescue Team are
on their way now,

661
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,240
they still need time to come here.

662
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
But he needs my help

663
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,720
to stop the bleeding right now.

664
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,640
I have to get in there to help him.

665
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
Don’t hesitate.

666
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
Trust me.

667
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,680
Stop immediately

668
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,600
if you don’t feel well.

669
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,160
All right.

670
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,830
I’ll assist you.

671
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,400
OK.

672
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,840
Don’t look down. Look at me.

673
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,440
I’m here. You’ll be fine.

674
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,720
I’m here. You’ll be fine.

675
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,200
What should I do now?

676
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,000
Step over me.

677
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,840
Hey. Are you all right?

678
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,960
I... I’m okay.

679
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,400
I’m okay.

680
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,080
Sir. Sir.

681
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,360
How is he doing?

682
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,960
He has suffered a severe head injury.

683
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,560
Open trauma.

684
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,240
Probably intracranial injury as well.

685
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,760
There’re glass pieces in his lungs.

686
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,400
He has probably hemopneumothorax.

687
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,280
Sir.

688
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,880
Can you hear me?

689
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,040
Sir.

690
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,500
Sir.

691
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,760
Can you hear me?

692
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,560
He’s breathing.

693
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,880
I’m gonna stop his bleeding first.

694
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,680
Are you gonna throw up?

695
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,720
Go. Go that way.

696
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,640
Stay away from my car.

697
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,440
Xing Sir. What a jerk you are!

698
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,200
As an acrophobe,

699
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,520
how brave I was!

700
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,240
Didn’t you see that?

701
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,750
Can’t you just give me

702
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,080
a little compliment?

703
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,320
Good job.

704
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,680
You got hurt. Take a seat.

705
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,800
What’re you doing?

706
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,160
We ran out of the bandages.

707
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,040
It’s nothing. Not a big deal.

708
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,120
No, no, no.

709
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,960
I have an idea.

710
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,200
What’re you laughing about?

711
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,440
Let’s go.

712
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,800
Xing Sir is right.

713
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,200
I’m not qualified yet

714
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,040
to get the Certificate of Completion.

715
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,000
I’m a doctor.

716
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,240
I can stop the bleeding for him.

717
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,320
Come in.

718
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:40,960
Captain Hao.

719
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,240
Coming this early

720
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,200
to harass me?

721
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,640
That is not you.

722
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,840
Would you please sign that for me?

723
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,320
Reissue the Emergency Rescue

724
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,880
Certificate of Completion for Mi Ka?

725
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,640
I remember

726
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,480
it was you who failed her

727
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,400
because of her fear of heights.

728
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,440
Yes, I was.

729
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,880
But she is also the one

730
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
who saved the truck driver’s life

731
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,200
at the cliffs last night.

732
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,200
I heard about that.

733
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,520
It was her.

734
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,500
Yeah.

735
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,480
It has been proven that

736
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,480
she can overcome

737
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,640
her fear of heights.

738
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,840
So I really don’t think

739
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,040
we can judge a person’s ability

740
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,600
by only one test.

741
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,840
So can you…?

742
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,490
Have some water.

743
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,200
OK. Thanks.

744
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,280
Look at you.

745
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
I can sign it for you

746
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,600
but

747
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,160
I have a question.

748
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,840
You didn’t have a crush

749
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,320
on this girl

750
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,480
and use the advantage
of your position

751
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,560
to chase after her, did you ?

752
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,240
No. Absolutely no.

753
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,200
Don’t be in a hurry to deny it.

754
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,720
If all of our special police

755
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,720
don’t date,

756
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,240
then we shall become monks.

757
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,040
But I have to give you a head up.

758
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,880
As a special police,

759
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,320
do not marry a doctor.

760
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,080
If you marry a doctor,

761
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,400
that’ll be a disaster.

762
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,320
Just like my family’s situation.

763
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,920
My wife and I have no time
to take care of the family.

764
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,200
Yep. That’s true.

765
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,280
I’ll sign.

766
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,920
Thank you.

767
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,760
The water is so sweet.

768
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,060
(Neurosurgery)

769
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,680
Do you know that

770
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,640
the special police call Director He

771
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,600
sister-in-law?

772
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,520
How nosy you are!

773
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,600
Neurosurgery

774
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,720
is the key department of our hospital.

775
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,080
We’re one of the top 3
neurosurgery in the country.

776
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,840
We have

777
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,280
more than 60 experts

778
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,040
and over 200 medical and nursing staff.

779
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,360
Make way.

780
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,160
This boy

781
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,720
is only 15 years old.

782
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,160
He has just undergone a craniotomy.

783
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,320
His brain tumor

784
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,880
was in a very dangerous location.

785
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,760
After being diagnosed
by several hospitals,

786
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
he has been declared inoperable.

787
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,000
Then he was brought to us.

788
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,240
Was it the surgery performed

789
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
by Dr. Shao Yuhan?

790
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,560
That’s right.

791
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,680
Most of you

792
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,320
will stay

793
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,880
in General Surgery.

794
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,880
There is only one person

795
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,200
who can stay in Neurosurgery.

796
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,040
The quota is available

797
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,320
only because Director Shao Yuhan

798
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,200
wants to form his own team

799
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,720
in the hospital.

800
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,800
During the surgery,

801
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,800
facts always speak louder than words.

802
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,080
So all of you,

803
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,880
work hard and go get it!

804
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,920
Thank you, Director He.

805
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,800
I’m out for sure.

806
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,080
Look at us.

807
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,760
Except for Xu Yanshan,

808
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,920
who else would be able to stay?

809
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,320
Don’t be a sour grape.

810
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,320
Can you get A in all your classes?

811
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,760
Beyond that,

812
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,920
Yanshan’s father

813
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,520
is an authority in neurosurgery.

814
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,760
In this regard, she has won

815
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,840
in the starting line.

816
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,320
But my father has been dead

817
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,560
for many years.

818
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,920
Why can’t they just take in

819
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,680
a couple more of us, right?

820
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,440
Let’s go.

821
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,120
Yeah. Right.

822
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah.

823
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,520
What happened to you today?

824
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,400
You look upset.

825
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,200
I’m kind of depressed.

826
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,640
Depressed?

827
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,840
Take my sparkling water.

828
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,360
It cures unhappiness.

829
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,200
Congratulations, though.

830
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,080
You’re the closet person
to Neurosurgery.

831
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,680
Chen Tao was kicking up a fuss.

832
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,600
You don’t wanna be like that.

833
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,160
If I don’t make it,

834
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,320
I’d be a standing joke.

835
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,520
What about me?

836
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
The whole hospital knows that

837
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,560
I haven’t gotten
Certificate of Completion.

838
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,840
It’s said that

839
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,400
this training

840
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,600
is a tradition for young doctors

841
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,280
before they start to work here.

842
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,960
No one has ever failed the test.

843
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,240
I’m the first one so far.

844
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,160
What a lucky dog I am!

845
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,240
If I were you,

846
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:51,760
I would definitely

847
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,120
settle a score with Xing Kelei.

848
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,160
What’s the point of that?

849
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,360
Press the button.

850
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,440
Dr. Xu. Dr. Mi.

851
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,040
Morning.

852
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,160
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

853
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,640
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

854
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,120
Dr. Xu. Dr. Mi.

855
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,880
What a small world!

856
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,120
This is the patient
who was just brought in

857
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,040
from the Emergency Room.

858
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,720
He has a closed trauma

859
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,800
to the chest.

860
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,440
I’m gonna take him upstairs
for a CT scan

861
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
and get prepared for his surgery.

862
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,270
Why

863
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,520
don’t you take the special elevator?

864
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,320
It’s being occupied.

865
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,560
The patient needs
to take a CT scan immediately.

866
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,800
