=The Demon=

00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:03,250
=Episode 1=

3
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,159
(Why do demons exist as demons)

4
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,959
(instead of humans?)

5
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,680
(Just like a ray of light
shining into darkness)

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,879
(making the light
into something sinful.)

7
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,480
(Demons used to appear in the world)

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,159
(and humans started to fear them.)

9
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,840
(Demon slayers were born
from the circumstances.)

10
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,359
I'm here on Moyuan City Lord's orders

11
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,319
to get rid of the demon.

12
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,879
Surrender now!

13
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,560
I'll stay.

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,480
Spare the children.

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,760
(They harm all sorts of lives)

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,200
(in the name of slaying demons)

17
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,879
(and started a war
between humans and demons.)

18
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,719
(The lord's son)

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,690
(suffered from a strange illness
since he was young.)

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,400
(No one could approach him.)

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,719
(Because of that,)

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,560
(he departed on a journey
to the Western Regions.)

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,439
(Legend has it,)

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,719
(that only the Cat Demon
of the Western Region)

25
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,480
(can heal his illness.)

26
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,200
(That is)

27
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,959
(a place where demons run rampant)

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,159
(and mysterious.)

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,000
(Shen Wangchen)

30
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,560
Brothers,

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,800
we have a great haul today.

32
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,879
Later, we'll kill some of them

33
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,520
to celebrate this occasion.

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,199
All right!

35
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,159
The Tiger Demon is here!

36
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,479
Release the animals!

37
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,800
- Your Majesty!
-Spare us!

38
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:19,587
(Fan Dayao)

39
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,199
Young Master, we should leave.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,639
All of you, stop!

41
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,159
You must have a death wish!

42
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,439
Your Majesty!

43
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,000
(How is he so strong)

44
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,479
(when he is just a mortal?)

45
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,639
This is impossible.

46
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,159
Your Majesty, this man is weird.

47
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,319
We shouldn't fight him.

48
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:24,562
(Divorce Agreement)

49
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,519
(Your strange illness)

50
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,160
(can only be treated)

51
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,879
(by the Cat Demon
of the Western Region.)

52
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,680
(She...)

53
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,079
(This man is extremely dangerous.)

54
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,920
(He must not be released.)

55
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,480
(Otherwise, he'll be trouble.)

56
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,160
Let's go!

57
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,360
I didn't allow you to leave.

58
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,480
Don't waste your time and energy.

59
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,439
You can't beat me.

60
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,319
Let them go.

61
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,079
I can

62
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
spare them.

63
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,720
You must follow me to the Demon Fort.

64
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,480
If you don't obey me,

65
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,120
I'll kill every person

66
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,360
within a hundred-li radius.

67
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,639
Young Master, we don't want to die.

68
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,439
You must save us.

69
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,560
Save me.

70
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,920
(She allowed me to see colours)

71
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,920
(but she is just an evil Tiger Demon.)

72
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,160
(I should use this to my advantage
before making a decision.)

73
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,137
(Qianchun Mountain)

74
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,759
(Chief Fan,
I hope you keep your promise.)

75
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,959
(Don't hurt innocent people)

76
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,079
(if I stay in the fort.)

77
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:17,312
(Fort Aowu)

78
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,240
Welcome back, Your Majesty!

79
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Welcome back, Your Majesty!

80
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Welcome back, Your Majesty!

81
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,759
Welcome back, Your Majesty!

82
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,519
Everyone, listen.

83
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,079
From today onwards,

84
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,279
we must treat Mr. Shen well.

85
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Yes!

86
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,160
Treat us well?

87
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,839
Young Master.

88
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,360
Are we going to live here?

89
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,040
Young Master.

90
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,600
I know you wanted

91
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,319
to save the people

92
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,120
but if we

93
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,279
can't find the Cat Demon

94
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,000
and kill it,

95
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,120
I'm afraid you can't last

96
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,680
past this winter.

97
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,079
We are out of time.

98
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,079
Moreover,

99
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,319
staying here...

100
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,639
I can see colours.

101
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,279
Colours?

102
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,319
Young Master, you can see colours?

103
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,680
Jiang Li!

104
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,199
Young Master.

105
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,759
(Jiang Li)
You can see colours now.

106
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,079
Why hasn't

107
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:57,800
your strange illness

108
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,199
which reflects other people

109
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,519
been treated yet?

110
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:03,879
Come.

111
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,680
Young Master.

112
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,800
Hold on, Young Master.

113
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,800
Why can you suddenly see colours?

114
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,959
It might be related to Fan Dayao.

115
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,879
Fan Dayao?

116
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,399
Is she

117
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,480
the demon you are looking for?

118
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,480
That's not right.

119
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,360
Master Shang said your illness

120
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,879
was caused by a Cat Demon.

121
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,399
Fan Dayao

122
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,959
is an infamous Tiger Demon.

123
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,039
We must find our answers

124
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,039
from the Tiger Demon then.

125
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,287
(Si Ming)

126
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,200
Si Ming.

127
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,799
We are close acquaintances.

128
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,120
Why are you still doing this?

129
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,919
Tiger Demon, How dare you

130
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,600
harm the people of the city?

131
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,279
What a joke.

132
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,440
When the people were harming us,

133
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,320
I didn't see you upholding justice.

134
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,720
Do you have some kind of obsession
with demons?

135
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,080
Demons of the world

136
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,240
should be killed by my Astral Sword.

137
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,200
Trying to escape?

138
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,639
Die!

139
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,080
(Oh no! It's raining.)

140
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,639
Who is it?

141
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
(What's going on?)

142
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,399
Who are you?

143
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Why did you hurt my cat?

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,120
Sorry. I made a mistake.

145
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,440
(Why is he here?)

146
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,080
(You are hurt.)

147
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,159
(Let me take you back.)

148
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:08,720
(Sure.)

149
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:11,850
(Fort Aowu)

150
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,679
(Darn it.)

151
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,679
(Should I let him rub me like this?)

152
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,399
(I can't even)

153
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,679
(resist at all.)

154
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,559
Young Master.

155
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,639
How can you still keep a cat?

156
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,600
I'm so anxious.

157
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,480
How can you...

158
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,279
(Stop staring.
Do you think I want this?)

159
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,320
Young Master,

160
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,360
why didn't you

161
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,480
get rid of Fan Dayao

162
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,879
with that demon slayer?

163
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,120
We can

164
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,360
discuss a plan

165
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,120
to crush Fort Aowu from the inside.

166
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,840
(I heard it.)

167
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,360
Young Master, rest well.

168
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,759
I'm going back.

169
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
(Crushing Fort Aowu?)

170
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
(Dream on.)

171
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,519
Kitty,

172
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,639
I saved your life.

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,080
Shouldn't you repay me?

174
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,399
(He did save my life.)

175
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,240
I'm new

176
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,600
in this place.

177
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,519
Meeting you

178
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,200
is fate.

179
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,000
(I would've killed you)

180
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,320
(if you didn't know evil spells.)

181
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,679
(You wouldn't even have a chance
to talk about fate with me.)

182
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,519
(What are you doing?)

183
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,080
(Where are you touching?)

184
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
This is a pressure point
that improves recovery.

185
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Let me massage it.

186
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,759
(Don't touch me.)

187
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,120
(I have my pride)

188
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,039
(and dignity.)

189
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,600
(I warn...)

190
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,360
(It's quite comfortable.)

191
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:02,700
♪Where did I lose my direction?♪

192
