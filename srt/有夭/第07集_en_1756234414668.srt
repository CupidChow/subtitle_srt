in this world.

5
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,519
Why don't you show it to everyone,

6
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,760
Xiao'er?

7
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,079
What... What are you talking about?

8
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,359
What... What Xiao'er?

9
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,480
There's nobody here by that name.

10
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,120
And I don't know anyone by that name.

11
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,599
I don't get it.

12
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,959
(I'm doomed.)

13
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,280
Don't worry, Chief Fan.

14
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,159
I'll keep that a secret.

What's it?

32
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,790
It'd be inappropriate
if I helped you with that.

33
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,240
Are you going to stop massaging me

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,000
because you found out about my identity?

35
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,400
Fine.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,240
Forget it.

37
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,199
We're not close

38
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,560
after all.

39
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,919
But can you promise

40
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,120
not to tell anyone about

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,280
my identity as a cat?

42
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,719
Sure, rest assured.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,280
Now you know that,

44
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,599
as a demon,

45
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm flawed.

46
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,800
Can you promise me

47
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,759
another thing?

48
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,879
Don't hurt the other demons

49
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,960
in the fort.

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,240
Just come at me.

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,199
Sure.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
No.

53
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,719
I mean,

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,199
I will never hurt you.

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,240
Like I said,

56
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,280
both my father

57
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,360
and I

58
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,240
never kill the innocent,

59
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,400
be it a human or a demon.

60
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,319
I believe you.

61
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,360
I will

62
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,959
keep my word.

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,399
Sure.

64
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,680
Then starting today,

65
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,079
you need to heed

66
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,000
my instructions.

67
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,079
Yes.

68
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,279
Rong Momo.

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
Si... Si Ming.

70
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,160
Si Ming is here, Dayao!

71
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,240
Shush.

72
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,839
I'm not here to cause you trouble.

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,560
Do you know me?

74
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
Whoever joins the fort

75
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,319
will receive a copy of the name list
of Her Majesty's enemies.

76
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,000
And you top the list.

77
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,279
Of course we all know you.

78
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600
However,

79
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,279
everyone says you're good-looking.

80
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,959
To my surprise, you are really handsome.

81
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,720
I'm the number one man in her heart.

82
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,439
That's right.

83
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,519
Oh, no.

84
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,240
It's Mr. Shen now.

85
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,920
Shen Wangchen?

86
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,120
She puts him first?

87
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,079
That's right.

88
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,000
What's he like?

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,160
Her Majesty said

90
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,879
Mr. Shen

91
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,519
is our greatest enemy.

92
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,439
He's talented,

93
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,040
refined,

94
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,360
and...

95
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,759
and...

96
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,959
Pass this to Fan Dayao.

97
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,639
This magical artifact

98
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,160
can conceal all of her demonic aura.

99
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,399
Those demon slayers
won't be able to locate her.

100
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,439
Why?

101
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,120
Aren't you a demon slayer?

102
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,120
I am.

103
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,240
That's why I won't come here again.

104
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,759
Why did Si Ming gift this to me?

105
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,959
Could it be

106
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,319
a trap?

107
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,639
Dayao.

108
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,639
I've tested it.

109
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,480
It really conceals one's demonic aura,

110
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,000
making it a rare valuable.

111
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,160
This feels off.

112
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,720
He must be up to something.

113
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,759
Don't fall for his trap.

114
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,240
Dayao.

115
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,040
I think Master Si Ming

116
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,560
gave this to you

117
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,279
for your sake.

118
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,360
Besides, I think he's into you.

119
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,160
He's into me?

120
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,680
That demon slayer?

121
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,160
You should stay away

122
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,680
from Si Ming after this.

123
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,360
Why?

124
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,240
He...

125
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,079
He's a demon slayer,

126
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,879
so he's dangerous.

127
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,639
In my opinion,

128
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
he's unlike other demon slayers.

129
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,839
He seems slow-witted,

130
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,319
posing no threat to me.

131
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,120
All right. Focus.

132
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,519
Starting tomorrow,

133
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,560
you'll learn how to be a tyrant.

134
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,079
Dayao.

135
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,759
Leave me alone.

136
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,319
Please show your true face.

137
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,600
I don't find this getup

138
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,959
imposing at all.

139
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,319
Why don't we maintain...

140
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,680
We'll do as you say.

141
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,799
What's the point
of practicing how to smile?

142
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,679
It's a waste of my time!

143
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,200
Dayao.

144
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,919
Can you take back this severance pay?

145
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't want to leave.

146
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,200
Mo.

147
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,799
I won't blame you

148
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,200
for the Truth Serum incident.

149
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,320
In fact, I'd like to praise you.

150
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,360
If not for you...

151
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,320
If not for you,

152
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,000
I wouldn't have been able
to recognize my own shortcomings.

153
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,240
Are you alright, Dayao?

154
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,519
Do your best!

155
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
I have faith in you.

156
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,039
You have a bright future ahead!

157
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,120
Thank you, Dayao!

158
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,240
I will complete my mission!

159
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080
Don't mention it.

160
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,480
Now that's the spirit.

161
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,519
Young Master, when are you going
to return the demon core?

162
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,960
Your body...

163
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
I know what to do.

164
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,960
But who's been

165
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,799
stirring up trouble in this city?

166
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,360
And what's he after?

167
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,679
What do you think, Young Master?

168
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,000
Perhaps all of this

169
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,840
is the doing of a single man.

170
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,000
That person harbors sinister intent.

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,960
And there are unspeakable secrets
behind him.

172
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,159
We must not let our guard down.

173
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,039
It's true.

174
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,840
Her Majesty has already learned

175
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,080
how to be considerate of others.

176
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,679
I think it's time

177
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,879
for you to head back.

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,960
Mr. Shen's strategy
has been a brilliant one.

179
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,120
He actually made Her Majesty
change her ways.

180
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,200
She now understands

181
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,279
the hardships of us followers.

182
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,679
I haven't seen Her Majesty in days,

183
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,919
and I've even started to miss her.

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,720
Then let's go back today.

185
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,000
That won't do.

186
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,399
Mr. Shen said,

187
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,559
if Her Majesty is to

188
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,120
truly learn to make friends,

189
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,879
we must listen to him.

190
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,200
Do you

191
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,559
want Her Majesty

192
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,519
to have no friends

193
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,320
and end up a lonely spinster?

194
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:13,517
Who says Her Majesty is friendless?

195
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,240
I think Master Si Ming and Dayao

196
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,759
are getting along very well.

197
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:20,879
Well,

198
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,080
I saw Master Si Ming giving Dayao

199
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,679
a gift.

200
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,159
Really?

201
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,799
I knew it, that brat

202
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,559
has designs on Her Majesty.

203
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,240
No demon slayer would come here often

204
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,919
without taking a single demon.

205
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,840
A demon slayer and a demon queen.

206
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,799
What a forbidden love.

207
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,559
No, no, no.

208
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,000
I think

209
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,679
Mr. Shen and Her Majesty

210
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,720
make the best match.

211
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,759
Think about it.

212
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,879
If Mr. Shen

213
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,480
becomes Her Majesty's consort,

214
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,919
Aowu Fort will surely prosper.

215
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,559
It's a bright future ahead!

216
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,759
My young master says

217
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,240
you may head back now.

218
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,840
One more thing.

219
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,679
My young master

220
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,120
is both brilliant and refined.

221
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,720
He would never fall for

222
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
a hot-headed, dull demoness

223
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,559
like your boss.

224
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:41,879
No one is allowed
to speak ill of Her Majesty!

225
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,039
Darn it!

226
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,480
Come, let's go find Her Majesty.

227
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,399
Let's go.

228
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,200
Momo…

229
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,039
Momo, they...

230
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,279
They bullied me

231
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,039
and wouldn't let me tell the truth!

232
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,320
Dayao

233
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,440
has always been fierce, no?

234
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,039
No one is allowed to speak ill of Dayao!

235
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,440
(Si Ming 2-to-1, Shen Wangchen 7-to-1)
Come on, place your bets!

236
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,799
Here!

237
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,759
Here, place your bets!

238
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:10,998
Come on!

239
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,759
Do it!

240
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,639
Here!

241
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,879
Put in everything you've got!

242
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,720
(Si Ming 2-to-1, Shen Wangchen 7-to-1)
It's Si Ming! It's him!

243
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,039
Quick, place your bets!

244
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll bet on Mr. Shen.

245
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,500
(Si Ming 2-to-1, Shen Wangchen 7-to-1)

246
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,840
What's that?

247
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,240
We still can't tell

248
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,279
who Her Majesty will marry.

249
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,559
I'll bet on Mr. Shen.

250
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,559
You all should do the same.

251
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,720
What's this?

252
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,039
Just trust me.

253
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,679
Si Ming and Her Majesty have been having
an undefined relationship for years.

254
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,879
It's been less than a month

255
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,360
since Shen's arrival here.

256
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,919
He's far behind!

257
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,919
I'll bet on Si Ming.

258
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,279
Yes, Si Ming it is.

259
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,080
I think Mr. Shen will win.

260
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,639
You and Siming have been having
an undefined relationship for years?

261
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
What do you mean by that?

262
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,799
Just wait and see. You'll lose.

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,720
Jiang Li.

264
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,639
Bet on Mr. Shen!

265
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,919
Bet on Mr. Shen! Bet on him!

266
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,879
I trust your taste, sir!

267
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:03,604
(Si Ming 2-to-1, Shen Wangchen 7-to-1)

268
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,759
That's more like it!

269
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,559
How wonderful. Everyone's back.

270
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,759
You're truly impressive, Shen Wangchen.

271
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,399
Mr. Shen! Mr. Shen! Mr. Shen!

272
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,360
That's more like it!

273
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,639
Your Majesty.

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,279
Have you won Mr. Shen's heart?

275
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,320
Winning a man over is an easy feat.

276
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,639
Get over here, Shen Wangchen!
