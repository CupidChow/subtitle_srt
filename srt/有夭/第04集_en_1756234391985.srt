=Episode 4=

3
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,000
You have a lot of nerve showing up.

4
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:22,879
Chief Fan,

5
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,319
I know what happened to you.

6
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,680
Shen Wangchen, I'm warning you,

7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,799
think twice before you speak.

8
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,599
I can help you.

9
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,879
What?

10
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,519
What tricks are you pulling now?

11
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,480
Drop your act.

12
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,319
I know

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,879
everything you're plotting.

14
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,000
You're ambitious

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and righteous,

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
but you lack understanding

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
of rites and morality,

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,700
and discernment of good and evil
in people's hearts.

19
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,159
I'm willing to lend you

20
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,359
a helping hand

21
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,159
to actualize your great ambition.

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,439
Shen Wangchen,

23
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,000
just speak plainly.

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,400
Don't play dirty tricks on me.

25
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,200
I can help you

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,799
become a great king admired by all

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,120
and ruling the land.

28
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,280
I don't need you to teach me that.
Get lost!

29
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,719
Guards.

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,919
Shen Wangchen!

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,680
Shooting star!

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,879
Oh, Heaven.

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,680
Please let the king treat me better

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,080
and make me a legendary demon hero.

35
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,800
Your wish will come true.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
What are you trying to do?

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,240
I... I'm warning you,

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,919
you're playing with fire.

39
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,400
Help! Help us!

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,439
Be careful, Your Majesty.

41
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,800
Save us, Your Majesty!

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,520
Be careful.

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,280
This one looks good.

44
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,400
You'll do.

45
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,520
Your Majesty!

46
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,960
Wait, wait!

47
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,280
Maybe let him throw us away.

48
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,759
As long as we don't die, we'll run back.

49
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,719
Enough!

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,919
I... I...

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,199
I promise you.

52
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,400
See you tomorrow.

53
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,759
Don't get hurt, Your Majesty.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,520
We're not afraid.

55
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,319
We're not afraid at all!

56
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,840
Young master,

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,199
will this plan

58
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,599
really earn Fan Dayao's trust?

59
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,919
Isn't it too dangerous?

60
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,919
Can your body

61
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,960
handle such a big plan?

62
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,879
Isn't there an easier way?

63
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Don't give me so much next time.

64
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,199
But young master...

65
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,400
Say no more.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We must cast a long line
to catch a big fish.

67
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,600
Fish?

68
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,399
What fish?

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,160
When she's in cat form,

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,920
she won't guard against me.

71
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,399
Your Majesty, you've overstrained
yourself recently.

72
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,759
You need to watch your kidneys.

73
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,480
No.

74
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,879
I can't just sit on my hands.

75
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,240
Stop massaging.

76
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,879
I'll scout the enemy myself.

77
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,199
Switch legs, Your Majesty.

78
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,279
Your Majesty.

79
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,160
(Perfect timing.)

80
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,160
(I'm going to)

81
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,879
(get to the bottom
of who you really are.)

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,120
(Why are you touching me again?)

83
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,240
(You!)

84
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,240
(Why are you always)

85
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,199
(so handsy?)

86
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,000
You're quick to recover.

87
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,120
(Oh no! I forgot about that.)

88
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,120
Looks like this acupoint

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
does help you recover.

90
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,560
You enjoy this so much.

91
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,360
Since we're fated,

92
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,720
we're friends.

93
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,920
I'll give you a name.

94
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,000
(A name?)

95
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,780
(Today is the second day
of the twelfth month.)

96
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,680
A long wind blows through a clear sky,
like the breath of spring.

97
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,439
(Be gentle.)

98
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,680
I'll call you "Xiao'er".

99
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,079
(Xiao'er?)

100
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,000
(That's awful.)

101
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,519
Xiao'er.

102
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:07,920
Xiao'er.

103
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,560
(You came up with a name like this)

104
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,800
(after all that poetry?)

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,639
Only if

106
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,319
you can find me the cat demon.

107
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,079
(Very good. Carry on.)

108
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,759
Someone wise said

109
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,959
the cat demon can help me
turn misfortune to fortune.

110
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,560
(Turn misfortune to fortune?)

111
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,800
(That's your reason?)

112
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,759
(This massage feels nicer.)

113
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,160
(It'd be good)

114
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,399
(if he could massage me more.)

115
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,639
(No! I mustn't fall into this!)

116
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,959
(I'm going to conquer)

117
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,519
(the demon realm.)

118
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,480
(How could I be swayed)

119
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,720
(by a mortal's gentle touch?)

120
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,560
(You'd better watch yourself.)

How to become a good king?

122
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,439
Exactly.

123
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,279
Do you know what you need

124
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,600
to become a good king?

125
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,120
I know.

126
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,920
Iron fists, iron strength,
and an iron heart.

127
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,319
It's knowledge
and the trust and respect of the people.

128
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,399
I don't like reading

129
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,600
human books.

130
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,519
That's a shame.

131
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,360
Wait.

132
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,399
(The Path of Overlords)
The Path of Overlords.

133
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,100
(The Art of Kings)

134
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,959
The Art of Kings.

135
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,759
That's perfect for me.

136
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,360
Come.

137
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,920
Bring them all here.

138
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,439
You must memorize these two first

139
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,839
before reading the others.

140
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,439
Otherwise, it'll backfire on you.

141
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,000
All of them?

(A Good King)

143
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Young master,

144
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,240
these are classics of governance.

145
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,919
Why rename them?

146
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,360
To strike at the vital point.

147
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,720
This is Fan Dayao's weakness.

148
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:50,037
(The Path of Overlords)

149
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,639
First is timing.

150
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,240
Second is the advantage of place.

151
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,200
Third is...

152
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,559
Third is...

153
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,000
Quiz time. What's the third point?

154
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,559
Shen Wangchen!

155
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,639
If you don't study hard,

156
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,639
you won't be able to protect them.

157
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,039
First is timing.
Second is the advantage of place.

158
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,639
Third is harmony among people.

159
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,679
Then, four directions, above and below,
left and right, front and back.

160
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,000
Clear every doubt
by asking as many questions as possible.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,759
The heart rules over the body.

162
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,919
The ruler leads his minister.

163
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,159
Your Majesty?

164
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,360
You must be tired now.

165
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,919
Take a rest.

166
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,440
Rest now,

167
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,799
or I'll kill you.

168
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,919
No matter what you do,
you must be patient

169
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:50,960
and calm.

170
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,559
Chicken Spirit.

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,480
The work here is endless,
and no rest at all.

172
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,919
Everyone's been wanting to leave.

173
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,240
But the king is overbearing.

174
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,320
No one dares to speak up.

175
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,799
This time,

176
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,639
with Mr. Shen's help,
we can finally escape her control.

177
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,360
Exactly.

178
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,159
Let's go and find Mr. Shen.

179
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,559
I almost fell for his trick.

180
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,799
Why am I memorizing these?

181
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,639
I must figure out a way to kill him.

182
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,919
Rong Momo,

183
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,639
I'll give you one last chance.

184
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,639
Pour this Truth Serum

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,759
into that mortal's food.

186
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,799
Yes, Your Majesty.

187
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,000
(Once I find out)

188
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,559
(the source of your divine power,)

189
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,759
(I'll find your weakness.)

190
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,240
(You're doomed, Shen Wangchen.)

191
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,360
Today,

192
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,559
I've prepared some liquor

193
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,639
as a reward for your hard work.

194
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:15,960
You've suffered enough

195
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,360
these days.

196
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:18,960
Your Majesty,

197
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,600
it's our good fortune

198
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,519
to serve in Fort Aowu.

199
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,960
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

200
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,720
Let's drink to Her Majesty.

201
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,000
To Your Majesty.

202
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,480
Cheers.

203
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:38,840
Of course,

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,039
the one I must thank most is Mr. Shen.

205
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,039
We may get off on the wrong foot,

206
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,600
but without Mr. Shen,

207
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,000
I'd never have known

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,639
to care for my subordinate.

209
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,519
A toast to you, Mr. Shen.

210
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,639
You're too kind, Chief Fan.

211
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,039
Cheers.

212
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,159
Come.

213
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,759
Eat to your fill. Don't be shy.

214
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,639
Have some fish, Mr. Shen.

215
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,240
Mr. Shen,

216
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,600
I have a few questions

217
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,240
I'd like to discuss with you.

218
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,320
Yes, please.

219
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,559
Mr. Shen,

220
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,559
are you the son
of the lord of Moyuan City?

221
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,799
You're wise, chief.

222
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,519
How old are you?

223
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,440
Twenty-five.

224
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,960
How many people are in your family?

225
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,600
Why are you asking that?

226
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,240
I just mean...

227
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,120
After putting up with this tigress

228
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,200
all these years,

229
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,639
we finally get a decent meal.

230
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,080
She only bullies us

231
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,240
because she's bigger than we are.

232
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,960
Bah!

233
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,639
She must've been struck by lightning

234
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,840
to come to her senses.

235
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,639
Young master.

236
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,759
What's wrong with them?

237
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,639
No, Your Majesty.

238
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,840
I'm just telling the truth.

239
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,799
Truth Serum?

240
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,639
Rong Momo!

241
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,440
I added it to the fish.

242
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,320
You have to believe me, cousin.

243
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,759
Cousin?

244
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,960
You're her relative!

245
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,440
Rong Momo.

246
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,840
What's Truth Serum?

247
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,990
To make you spill the secret
of the divine power so I can snatch it.

248
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,320
My goodness.

249
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,360
Wait. Wait. Wait.

250
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,200
I'm feeling dizzy.

251
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,000
When the Truth Serum
is mixed with the liquor,

252
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,799
it makes people drunk instantly.

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,759
Chief Fan, your Truth Serum

254
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,200
really works wonders.

255
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,720
How dare you!

256
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,360
Shen Wangchen, you're cunning indeed!

257
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,440
I put it in the fish.

258
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,440
How can it be?

259
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,039
Chief Fan.

260
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,039
You...

261
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,840
What are you trying to do?

262
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,759
Why do you need my divine power?

263
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,799
To kill you, wipe out Moyuan City,

264
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,799
and avenge the demon race.

265
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,720
Life has been unbearable

266
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,120
under this tigress.

267
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,840
Mr. Hiss,

268
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,639
flattering her all day

269
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,799
must be rough on you.

270
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,159
Ms. Chickie,

271
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,840
I can't stand this place

272
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,600
another day.

273
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,240
Do you really think

274
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,279
they followed you

275
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,039
willingly?

276
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,039
How dare you all!

277
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,320
Chief Fan,

278
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,639
why don't we find another place

279
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,000
to discuss the divine power?

280
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,480
I want to quit!

281
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,039
I just can't do this anymore.

282
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,399
Just you wait.

283
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,759
Shen Wangcheng, you...

284
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,159
Tell me the truth
about the divine power.

285
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,080
I want to quit!
