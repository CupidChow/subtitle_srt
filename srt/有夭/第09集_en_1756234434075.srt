=Episode 9=

3
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,439
Young Master!

4
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,680
You can finally touch people!

5
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
I can only touch her.

6
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,200
Why so?

7
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,000
Because she's different.

8
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,840
How different is she from the rest?

9
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,000
Red bean soup?

10
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,519
Young Master.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,560
Why are you making
this signature dish of yours?

12
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,319
It's for her.

13
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,920
That darned Fan Dayao!

14
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,319
How dare she force you

15
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,200
to cook for her.

16
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,879
Not only is she humiliating you,

17
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,040
but she's also shaming me!

18
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm doing this of my own accord.

19
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,879
Young Master.

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,840
Have you fallen

21
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,120
for that cat?

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,759
Yes.

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,479
Take your time.

24
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,080
So, what's it?

25
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:23,960
You can't stop yourself

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,280
from attacking others.

27
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,960
And you can't get close to them

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
except for me?

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,599
That's right.

30
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:49,960
Done.

31
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,199
Well...

32
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,039
Well, what's with

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,599
your divine power?

34
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,080
Well...

35
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,439
It's a long story.

36
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,280
If it's a sad story,

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,240
forget it.

38
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,400
You just want
to get close to people, no?

39
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,120
If you want to,

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,240
just get close to me.

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,039
It's no big deal.

42
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,840
After all,

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,319
when you got close to me,

44
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
I was quite happy.

45
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,199
Thank you, Chief Fan.

46
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,479
Don't mention it.

47
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,960
You're my consort.

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,840
Friends

49
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,159
never stand on ceremony.

50
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,719
Just touch and hug me

51
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,680
as you please.

52
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,000
Shen Wangchen.

53
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,400
How brilliant of you.

54
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,680
You managed to turn these hard red beans

55
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,400
into something

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,039
so sweet and soft.

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,560
I'd make

58
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,800
this red bean soup

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,439
whenever I missed my family.

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,159
Why?

61
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,639
Because people believe

62
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
red beans are
the truest symbol of longing.

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,360
Before parting, they would always
give each other red beans

64
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,639
to display their yearning.

65
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,480
Got it.

66
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,759
Could I have another serving?

67
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,879
There's plenty more.

68
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,360
Your Majesty.

69
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,000
We sure have a lot of enemies.

70
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,759
Apart from the demon slayers,

71
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,800
those trappers

72
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,360
are a real headache too.

73
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,639
Well, why do they try to catch

74
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,480
these ordinary animals?

75
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,199
Who knows?

76
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,480
Shen Wangchen said

77
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,360
it wasn't their doing either.

78
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,160
Who could it be, then?

79
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,240
Your Majesty.

80
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,720
When we catch them again,

81
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:30,517
we must teach them a lesson!

82
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,240
That won't do.

83
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,560
As Shen Wangchen said,

84
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,399
threats

85
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,279
aren't the right way.

86
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
His Highness is right.

87
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,839
Go tell

88
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,040
those little creatures.

89
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,519
This is my territory.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,199
If they dare set foot here again,

91
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,839
I'll eat them alive!

92
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,399
Your Majesty.

93
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,800
All hail Your Majesty!

94
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,000
In the blink of an eye,

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,839
I pried open that iron trap

96
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,120
and gently lifted the pup

97
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,879
out of it.

98
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,360
Of course,

99
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,639
it then showed me

100
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,639
its gratitude.

101
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,360
Sadly,

102
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,600
I still ended up being outsmarted

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,519
by that thing.

104
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,560
But I heard

105
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,079
your gave that pup

106
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,319
the fright of its life.

107
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,120
News travels fast, huh?

108
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,160
Well, the situation was dire.

109
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,920
Those little ones were playful

110
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,959
and always wandering there.

111
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,600
So I did that to the pup

112
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,399
to make the rest think

113
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,680
there's a vicious demon in the woods.

114
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,180
That way, they would never
dare go there again.

115
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,480
That makes sense.

116
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,959
Well...

117
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,000
I've finally mastered

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,079
my protective divine art!

119
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,319
Still, it needs bandages and medicine.

120
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,279
Fine.

121
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,639
I shall let you

122
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,120
serve me.

123
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,160
It may hurt a little.

124
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,959
It's alright.

125
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,720
Done.

126
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,360
I'll tend to your wound again tomorrow.

127
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,800
For now, get some rest.

128
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,079
I'll take my leave.

129
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,600
I want to sleep with you.

130
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,960
You're right.

131
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,519
I have no friends.

132
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,480
I'm pretty lonely too.

133
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,360
So I've decided to listen to you.

134
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,840
When you held me in your sleep,

135
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,159
I was beyond words.

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,399
I want you by my side.

137
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,120
I don't want to be alone.

138
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,240
Not even for a moment.

139
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,919
Stay with me.

140
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,559

Shen Wangchen.

I've got you

172
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,480
these tonic herbs.

Your Majesty.

176

Mr. Shen has run away.

177
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,039
He even took the bedding with him!

178
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,679
He broke his oath,

179
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,919
abandoned me,

180
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,399
and fled.

181
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,639
And I nearly bought into

182
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,159
that human's lies!

183
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,120
Could it be

184
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,759
he schemed

185
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,320
to win my trust,

186
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,000
make me lower my guard,

187
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,799
and run back to Moyuan City?

Here's a letter from Mr. Shen.

193
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,320
I said,

194
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,360
I'll never believe

195
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,279
that human again.

196
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,240
Get lost!

197
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,159
Old Turtle.

198
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,320
Go clean this place up.

199
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,159
Let me rest a bit more.

200
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,200
I'll do that right after.

201
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,159
It's only been a day
since Mr. Shen left,

202
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,440
and the whole fort is in chaos.

203
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,039
Her Majesty's back to being

204
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,919
that hot-tempered tigress again.

205
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,879
Do you think Mr. Shen

206
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,559
will ever come back?

207
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,519
I doubt it.

208
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,799
He was taken here

209
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,279
by Her Majesty in the first place.

210
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,919
What human would ever

211
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,080
choose to stay

212
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,279
with a bunch of demons?

213
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,440
Jiang Li.

214
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,559
When will you ever come back?

215
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:51,062
(Aowu Fort)

216
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,360
Could it be

217
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,720
my demon core gave him the power

218
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,240
to defeat me?

219
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,879
Shen Wangchen.

220
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,159
Give me back my divine power!
