00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,080
A hundred years ago,

50
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
our sect had a fierce fight
with the Cat Demon.

51
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,360
In the end, she was slain.

52
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,599
She then destroyed her demon core,

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,000
turning to ashes.

54
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,159

but today...

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,599

its aura is unscattered.

A faint glow has appeared.

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,080

60
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,560
No matter what, she must be eradicated.

61
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,680
Yes, Master.

62
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,600

63
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,639
Why do I feel ashamed?

64
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,279
No,

65
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,000

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,639
No...

67
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,199

00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Stop thinking about it.

69

81
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,360
Ever since the dream about that mortal,

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,319
I've been hearing things

83
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,959
and my body can't stop burning.

84
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Do you mean Mr. Shen?

85
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,240
Your Majesty.

86
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,040
Look.

87
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,480
Did your dream

88
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,519
look like this?

89
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,199
That's right.

90
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,560
It looked exactly

91
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,439
like this.

92
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,560
Your Majesty.

93
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,199
Well,

94
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,399
that's not an ailment.

95
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,439
It's considered

96
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,800
a spell.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,600
It's named Flirty Spell.

98
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,600
Flirty Spell?

99
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
Shen Wangchen.

100
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,720

What... What are you laughing about?

103
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,879
You look

104
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,720
quite different today.

105
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,240
Speak.

106
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
What evil spell did you use

107
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,480
to get into my dream?

108
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,160
You promised to stand by me
through weal and woe.

109
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,399
Yet you stoop so low behind my back!

110
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,920
You dreamed of me?

111
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,240
That's right.

112
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,399
What did you dream of?

113
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,000
Well...

114
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,720
Outrageous!

115
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,079
Trying to pry into my dream, huh?

116
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,519
Listen here, Shen Wangchen.

117
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,279
Don't think you can control me.

118
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,439
Withdraw that wicked spell at once

119
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,399
or don't blame me

120
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,360
for disregarding our bond.

121
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,199
