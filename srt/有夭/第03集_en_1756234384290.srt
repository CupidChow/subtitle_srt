just let me stay.

Shut up!

52
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,719

Why do you buy so much charcoal?

58
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,639
We have a stick of charcoal
that's enough for a year.

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,120
This is not...

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,839
Your Majesty.

Young Master Shen

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,639
asked me to deliver your clothes.

63
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,600
Your Majesty, why are your clothes

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,959
with Young Master Shen?

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,079

- Young Master Shen?

66
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,439
Enough!

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,519
Rong Momo,

68
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,040
I'll give you another chance.

69
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,560

70
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,480
why that mortal
is looking for a Cat Demon.

71
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,600
Remember not to be too blunt.

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,120
Yes. Got it!

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,040
Jiang Li, why is your Young Master

74
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,839
looking for a Cat Demon?

75
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,120
This is his secret.

76
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,720
I can't tell you.

77
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,199
Humans are so troublesome.

78
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,879
There shouldn't be

79
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,000
so many secrets!

80
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,480
Are you angry?

81
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,360
Of course!

82
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,839
I've always treated you as a friend

83
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,639
but you

84
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,000
hide everything from me.

85
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,399
Well...

86
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,680
There's another way.

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,279
Tell me about it

88
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,519
as a little secret.

89
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,360
Sorry.

90
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,399
I can't simply reveal

91
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,199
things about my master.

92
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,439
Jiang Li.

93
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,720
Young Master.

94
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,079
Did you tell her everything?

95
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,519
Of course, not.

96
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
I disappointed Rong Momo

97
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,519
for your sake.

98
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,600
Perhaps...

99
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,279
What?

100
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,879
Perhaps this is

101
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,879
a good opportunity to put an end
to the conflict with demons.

102
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,199
Young Master.

103
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,040
They are all demons.

104
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,920
Neither of us

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,439
is enough for them as food.

106
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
I know you want

107
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,079
to help the lord
solve his problem quickly.

108
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,959
However, I think

109
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,360
we shouldn't do that.

110
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,920
Why don't we escape first

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,279
before we make further plans?

112
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,360
It's not difficult.

113
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,480
I just need Fan Dayao to help me.

114
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,439
The Tiger Demon?

115
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,279
Will she listen to us?

116
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,439
She is a cat.

117
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,160
Young Master Shen.

118
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,279
Your divine power

119
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,839
isn't some kind of illness.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,360
In your previous life,

121
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,959
(Shang Lv)
you came in contact with a Cat Demon

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,120
and its demon core was stored in you.

123
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,319
A mortal body
that contains the demon core

124
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,800
will exhaust a lot of energy.

125
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,040
You might be 25

126
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,079
but you already

127
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,279
have the body of a 60-year-old man.

128
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,959
If you don't return the demon core,

129
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,240
you will die soon.

130
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,519
Search for the Cat Demon
to return its demon core?

131
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,839
How do I do it?

132
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,519
I only know that this necklace

133
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,639
contains the way to cure you.

134
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,959
You must

135
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,160
search for the secret yourself.

136
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,160
No wonder you are great.

137
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,439
Then, we must find

138
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,980
a way to return the demon core
as soon as possible.

139
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,519
Fan Dayao has a peculiar character

140
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,519
and is cruel.

141
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,319
If I return it now,

142
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,800
the people might suffer.

143
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,240
We can't act recklessly.

144
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,399
We need to find a way to suppress her

145
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,759
before we act.

146
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,920
You are right.

147
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,319
She's a cruel female demon.

148
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,920
If she is stronger,

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,759
she might bring chaos to the world.

150
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,399
Young Master,

151
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:59,399
your body can't hold on for much longer.

152
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,839
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

153
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,199
Let's go and take a look.

154
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,480
Jia has always been

155
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,559
a cautious demon.

156
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,470
Why would he be killed

157
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,360
by humans?

158
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:14,960
Jia.

159
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,600
We agreed

160
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,240
to cultivate

161
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,559
and become powerful demons together.

162
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,559
We must become

163
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,759
the king's aide

164
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,440
and fight for her.

165
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,362
However, I'm the only one left.

166
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,879
Jia,

167
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,480
we will avenge you.

168
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,200
Yes.

169
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:45,720
Find the murderer and avenge Jia!

170
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,240
Find the murderer and avenge Jia!

171
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,919
Find the murderer and avenge Jia!

172
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,759
Who is it?

173
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,000
Fan Dayao, what are you doing?

174
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,320
I can't kill you.

175
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,600
But do you think I can't kill him?

176
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,320
Stop!

177
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,960
Your Majesty, don't hurt him!

178
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,360
He is not a bad person.

179
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,879
You know nothing.

180
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,919
Get lost!

181
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:52,679
Your Majesty.

182
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,000
Chief Fan.

183
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,080
Let's have a chat.

184
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,879
I have nothing to talk about with you.

185
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,919
Your Majesty,

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,159
we are at a disadvantage.

187
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,559
If we fight him,

188
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,759
we won't have an advantage.

189
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,120
We should

190
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,879
learn his intention

191
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,840
before making a decision.

192
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,080
Momo.

193
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,360
Jia was my best friend.

194
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,000
I hate humans.

195
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,039
I hate Moyuan City!

196
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,480
Sorry.

197
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
I apologize

198
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,879
on behalf of the humans

199
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,360
who have hurt demons.

200
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,759
I don't blame you.

201
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,879
It's all my fault.

202
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,840
It's my fault

203
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,039
for not being as strong as the king

204
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,840
and I failed to protect Jia.

205
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,879
Momo.

206
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,200
I hope you can be happy.

207
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,440
It's true.

208
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,799
This has nothing to do with me.

209
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,840
Do you think I'll believe you?

210
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
Can you tell me what happened?

211
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,759
Stop acting.

212
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,440
You are from Moyuan City.

213
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,799
So, what?

214
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,240
Don't tell me you don't know

215
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,679
that Moyuan City

216
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,000
have been killing demons

217
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,960
for centuries.

218
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,799
That's because
demons are harming humans.

219
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,120
We must chase them away.

220
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,840
Not every human is as you imagined

221
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,240
and not all demons

222
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,600
are under your control.

223
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,519
We only came here by accident

224
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,679
because we heard the wind chimes.

225
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,480
We didn't have any bad intentions.

226
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,080
Those are not wind chimes.

227
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,840
They are lives.

228
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,360
They are the hundreds of lives

229
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,720
that the humans have killed.

230
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,600
Every wind chime

231
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,320
contains the primordial soul
of a small demon.

232
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,039
I saved the armadillo

233
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,720
from humans.

234
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,120
Although it has weak powers,

235
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,759
it has been

236
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,759
acting as a sentry for me

237
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:43,799
to repay me.

238
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,320
It has never hurt anyone

239
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,080
but it was still hunted

240
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,320
by humans.

241
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,720
They called it

242
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,360
an evil demon

243
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
and skinned it alive.

244
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,879
When I found it,

245
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,840
it was a bloody mess.

246
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,000
I could only

247
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
protect its primordial soul.

248
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,080
Demons kill humans.

249
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,720
Humans are afraid

250
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,840
so they resist.

251
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,519
Demons and humans make no difference.

252
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,370
Must you kill all the demons
in the world

253
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,639
because of one demon's wrongdoings?

254
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,080
You said I was cruel.

255
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,840
What about humans?

256
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,759
Aren't they crueller?

257
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:23,759
Fine.

258
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,200
I will make them pay.

259
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,279
Shen Wangchen.

260
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,639
I warn you.

261
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,440
Don't try to harm the fort.

262
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,519
You have a divine power.

263
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,559
I can't hurt you now.

264
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,120
However, the same cannot be said

265
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,879
for your lackey

266
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,279
