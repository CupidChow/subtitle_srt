00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,480
Your Majesty,

37
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,680
when the lackeys
went to send food to the mortal,

38
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,319
he beat them up.

39
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,639
What?

40
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,399
They were beaten up so badly.

41
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,240
You.

42
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,240
Go and investigate
the mortal's background.

43
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,079
I will fight against him.

44
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,680
Let go of me!

45
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,879
Your Majesty,
let's not stoop to his level.

46
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,079
We can't defeat him.

47
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,639
I'll fight you to the death!

49
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,480
let me finish?

I'm so angry.

51
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,680
He defeated me again.

52
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,079

57
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,839
Let me stay here.

58
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,480
I'll do my best

59
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,519

61
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,399
Let me tell you again.

62
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:19,680
Get lost!

63
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,480
Whatever.

64
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,720
Just don't annoy me.

65
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,720
Thank you, Dayao.

66

70
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,839

of Moyuan City's Lord
from a thousand li away,

72
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,680
Shen Wangchen.

73

74
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,759
You can't catch me.

75
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,439
Over here.

76
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,920
Come here.

77
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,600
I caught you two.

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,800
I caught you!

79
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,920
You caught us both.

80
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,319
Let's play hide-and-seek now.

81
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,920
Who will catch?

82
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,639
(Young Fan Dayao)
Me!

83
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,000
(Aunt Rong)
Sure. Dayao, go.

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,000
We'll go there later.

85
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,720
Everyone, hide well
and don't make a noise.

86
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,199
Come here!

87
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,560
Come here, quickly.

88
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,879
Hurry!

89
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,510
There are many demons
appearing on Qingteng Mountain

90
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,480
that harms humans.

91
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,759
I'm here on Moyuan City Lord's orders

92
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,319
to get rid of the demon.

93
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,639
Demon,

94
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,959
Surrender now!

95
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,240
I'll stay.

96
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,519
Spare the children.

97
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,600
Dream on.

98
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,040
Don't come out.

99
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,319
You mustn't come out!

100
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,000
Dayao,

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,040
take the fort's demons with you

102
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,079
and leave Qingteng Mountain.

103
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,319
You are the only one
who can save everyone!

104
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,079
Go!

105
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,439
The lord's son?

106
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,120
I'm not looking for you

107
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,800
but you've come here
on your own instead.

108
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,160
Shen Wangchen,

109
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,319
I won't allow you

110
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,680
to leave this place alive.

111
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,040
Your Majesty,

112
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,519
people are talking in the fort.

113
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,519
If you don't kill him,

114
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,519
you might not be able
to please everyone.

115
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,920
Your Majesty,
you fought him multiple times

116
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,759
when he was prepared.

117
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,279
Tonight, when he is unprepared,
you should...

118
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,240
(You will pay with your blood today.)

119
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,840
Chief Fan?

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,879
Chief Fan,
you are the leader of the fort

121
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,279
yet you sneaked up on me.

122
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,279
Isn't it an embarrassment
to your position and status?

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,559
A sneak attack
is only done by bad demons.

124
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,600
It's not something I do.

125
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,799
I came here...

126
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,080
Are you from Moyuan City?

127
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,399
I was from Moyuan City.

128
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,600
I came all the way here

129
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,559
to look for a Cat Demon.

130
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,039
(Cat Demon?)

131
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,320
I'm willing to be confined here by Chief Fan.

132
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,879
I also hope you can

133
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,600
use your connection in the Demon World

134
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,840
to help me find
all the Cat Demons around this place.

135
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,919
I must kill you even if it kills me.

136
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,759
It's raining, Chief Fan.

137
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,399
We should...
