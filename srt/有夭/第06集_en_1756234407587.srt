=The Demon=

00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:03,250
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,879
(This man clearly has a mortal body.)

4
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,439
(Why does he carry a demon core within?)

5
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,920
Such a creature

6
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,840
cannot be allowed
to remain in this world.

7
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,920
Chief Fan.

8
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,200
Chief Fan.

9
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,959
Why are you striking him?

10
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,640
(A mortal body,)

11
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,000
(yet with such a powerful demon core.)

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,599
(Could this man be
an ancient demon in disguise?)

13
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,439
Shen Wangchen.

14
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,799
Return to Demon Fort first.

15
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,280
I promised you

16
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,599
I would not harm the innocent.

17
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,400
But I never promised
not to harm demon slayers.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,799
Stand aside.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,519
Today I must take him away.

20
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,480
Si Ming.

21
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,879
I am the most powerful demon.

22
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,760
You wouldn't take me, but you took him?

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,359
Who are you looking down on?

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,520
(Are you human or demon?)

25
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,800
Forgive my offense.

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,240
Chief Fan, stand aside.

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,639
Who told you to meddle in this matter?

28
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you all right?

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,759
None of your concern.

30
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,930
This medicine is best for treating
internal injuries from cultivation.

31
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,560
Next time, don't rush for quick success.

32
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,800
You should mind yourself first.

33
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,159
Before I even make a move,

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,560
you'll fall sick and die on your own.

35
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,680
My followers, your King has returned.

36
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,319
My followers?

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,199
Dayao!

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
No one could endure your torment.

39
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,840
They've all run away.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,199
Run away?

41
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,000
Where did they go?

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,439
Everyone has resigned.

43
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,560
They even took all their belongings.

44
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,319
You'll have to bear with it.

45
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,159
How could this be?

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,240
Was I not good to them?

47
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,599
You often

48
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,039
slammed the table at us in anger

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,439
and threatened and coerced us.

50
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,719
To be honest, they'd already told me

51
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,240
that they were going to resign.

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,319
Tell me,

53
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,319
what else did I

54
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,479
do wrong?

55
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,560
They didn't say anything else.

56
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,479
I'm not too sure either.

57
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,250
(Good King)

58
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,840
Rule Eight Hundred and Sixty-Eight.

59
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,879
To earn the trust of the people,

60
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,919
one must always keep their word.

61
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,479
But you...

62
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,199
Enough!

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,680
I am the Demon King

64
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,719
of Qianchun Mountain,

65
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,080
How could I be shamed like this?

66
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,719
They had better never return!

67
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,879
Dayao.

68
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,519
Xiao'er.

69
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,360
(Why is it that whenever I'm upset,)

70
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,759
(I end up running to you?)

71
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,600
Xiao'er, how have you been lately?

72
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,800
(Not well at all.)

73
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,120
(It's driving me mad.)

74
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,399
(Luckily you're still useful.)

75
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,160
(Come, serve your King properly,)

76
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,279
(and ease my troubles.)

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,720
(Ah, that feels good.)

78
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,319
(Shang Xin,)
Master, I report.

79
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,000
My powers were too weak.

80
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,759
I failed to defeat Fan Dayao.

81
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,600
Si Ming.

82
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,680
You've gone after that
Tiger Demon again and again.

83
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,279
Do you truly mean to capture her,

84
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,040
or do you simply wish to see her?

85
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,759
For a cultivator,

86
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,839
the gravest taboo
is to fall for worldly desires.

87
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,240
I would not dare.

88
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,199
Do not let me down again.

89
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,639
Yes, Master.

90
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,319
It's late. Go and rest.

91
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,079
Master…

92
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,759
Have you ever seen a mortal

93
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,680
with a demon core inside?

94
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,519
The sect scrolls do record such a case.

95
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,600
If a demon

96
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,519
passes its demon core to a mortal,

97
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,879
that would be the result.

98
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,399
But once the core leaves the body,

99
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,959
the demon is doomed to die.

100
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
Why do you ask this?

101
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,680
I was reading the old texts today

102
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,920
and grew curious.

103
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,439
End that Tiger Demon quickly.

104
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,480
Yes.

105
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,680
Those useless brats…

106
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,160
They're still not back.

107
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,639
What if someone snatched them on the road?

108
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,759
What would I do then?

109
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
Chief Fan.

110
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,000
I've told you before,

111
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,600
forcing and threatening people
will never make them stay.

112
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,240
Why would I need friends anyway?

113
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
If that's the case,
they will never come back.

114
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,279
Even if someone takes them away,

115
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
they'd still rather leave
than live with you.

116
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,959
Am I really that unbearable to them?

117
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,879
Calm your mind like still water.

118
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,000
Free yourself of desire.

119
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,720
Focus your spirit as one.

120
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
See no self, no other.

121
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,319
Do you truly have a way

122
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,639
to bring them all back

123
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,839
and make them more loyal to me?

124
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,720
There is a way.

125
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
But, Chief Fan...

126
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,600
What?

127
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,839
If you cannot be honest with others,

128
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,920
then in the same way,

129
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,000
you will never earn

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,879
their honesty or trust in return.

131
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,600
It must be because lately

132
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,679
I haven't been able to defeat you.

133
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,159
They think I'm not strong enough,

134
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,480
so they've all left

135
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,039
to seek another path.

136
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,480
They didn't leave

137
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,840
because you weren't strong enough.

138
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,559
Strength alone cannot win hearts.

139
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,720
Only sincerity can bring true loyalty.

140
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,200
You once had

141
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,519
the kindest heart of all.

142
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,360
Why not let everyone see it?

143
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,639
