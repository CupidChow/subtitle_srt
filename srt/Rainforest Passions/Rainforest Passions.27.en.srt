3
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,320
At the signing later,

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,500
you'd better keep it together.

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,890
Qi Chuan is a piece of fat meat
being handed to us.

6
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,879
If you mess this up, we're all doomed.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,519
I still don't believe

8
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,320
they would help us
out of the goodness of their hearts.

9
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:36,399
Believe it or not,

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,759
you'll find out soon enough.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,240
Once the deal is signed,

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,880
I won't wait another moment.

13
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:48,640
Ms. Bai,

14
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:49,960
you know

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
I can't handle you.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,240
We really need to talk about this.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,880
Ms. Bai.  Mr. Li.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,990
The other three board members
have arrived.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,490
We can begin the signing.

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,519
Thank you all for being here.

21
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,439
Before we proceed,

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,239
I'd like to share

23
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,610
the story of my connection
with the Su Shide Group.

24
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,519
Five years ago,

25
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:17,319
my brother and I ran

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,910
a security and logistics company.

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,920
We were tasked

28
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,920
with escorting the Eye of Wucha

29
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,359
from Mangbei back to the country.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,150
Unfortunately,

31
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,159
that escort ended in a disaster.

32
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:29,760
My brother, Qi Shan,

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
and the Eye of Wucha were lost at sea.

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,959
Since then,

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,380
the Eye of Wucha has been a thorn
in my heart.

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
After years of searching,

37
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,159
I finally tracked it down

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,319
when it reappeared in Mangbei.

39
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,239
I'm sure

40
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,000
those present here remember

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,200
that event vividly.

42
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:51,879
Yes,

43
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,120
I remember it well.

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,799
Mr. Qi, this is getting off track.

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,990
Why don't we finish

46
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,879
the deal first?

47
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,480
Ms. Bai,

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,239
look at how intently Mr. Li
is listening.

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,400
He must want me to finish my story.

50
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,319
After that event,

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,260
many people and events took
a sudden turn for the worse.

52
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,520
Some lost their lives,

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,220
others were injured,

54
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,439
and even lost their memories.

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,820
But one person walked away
with the Eye of Wucha unscathed.

56
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,560
That person was Mr. Li,

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,000
Li Qingfeng.

58
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,280
That's right.

59
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,919
I'm the one who lost my memory.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,290
After I returned to the country,

61
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,680
Mr. Li took great care of me

62
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,800
and protected me.

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,590
He made sure I could only take
the medicine he gave me

64
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,319
and meet the people
he allowed me to meet.

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,400
He completely cut me off from my past

66
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,280
because those medicines
were never meant to treat me.

67
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,080
I've been trapped

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,759
in the world you created,

69
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,520
controlled by you,

70
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,319
which is why I ended up as your fiancée.

71
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,759
Xiamo,

72
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,240
what are you doing?

73
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,000
Madam Bai,

74
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,800
haven't you seen

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,680
his true colors yet?

76
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,720
Once the funds come through,

77
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,439
we'll cash out

78
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,960
and leave this place.

79
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,390
You have to trust me.

80
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,159
I've only ever loved you.

81
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,719
Did you tell Bai Lan the same thing?

82
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:20,960
Of course, not.

83
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,599
Everything with her was just a game.

84
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,120
Xiamo,

85
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,039
why are you doing this?

86
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,319
Why?

87
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,840
How should I answer that?

88
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
I can't possibly reveal to everyone here

89
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,520
the passionate moment

90
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,520
you two just shared inside, can I?

91
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,759
You tricked me?

92
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,159
You little wench!

93
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:50,919
Madam Bai,

94
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,719
I only wanted you to stop

95
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,199
before it's too late.

96
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,520
I didn't think

97
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,760
you just wanted to destroy everything.

98
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,120
So you got your memory back

99
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,800
and you've been pretending
all this time.

100
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,039
No,

101
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,360
you won't lie to me.

102
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,319
How are you so dense?

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,780
She and Qi Chuan
have been working together.

104
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,639
I was forced to do all this.

105
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,439
I did all of this for you.

106
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,680
I even gave you

107
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,199
the shares without hesitation.

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,120
For me?

109
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,879
Do you know
I almost believed everything you said?

110
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,480
It wasn't until last night

111
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,370
that when you had to choose
between me and the recording device.

112
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,600
Li Qingfeng,

113
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,839
you only care about yourself.

114
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,480
Everything you said
including the shares you gave me.

115
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,360
Those were mine, to begin with.

116
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,240
What are you getting so worked up for?

117
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,079
You've known all along

118
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,319
that you're not even
Su Shide's daughter.

119
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,199
You're just a shameless fraud.

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,959
Do you really think

121
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,680
using my identity as your trump card

122
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,120
will work?

123
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,680
You thought no one would find out, huh?

124
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,940
(DNA Test Report)

125
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,480
To inherit Su Shide's fortune,

126
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,759
you had no choice
but to find his true heir.

127
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,959
Once you found Xiamo,

128
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,360
you feared

129
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,480
she would hinder your claim.

130
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,199
So in public,

131
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,639
Xiamo is the long-lost heiress

132
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
while you manipulate her

133
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,439
behind the scenes.

134
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:35,970
That's impossible.

135
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,759
Su Shide is already dead.

136
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,560
How did you get this DNA test report?

137
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,160
When Xiamo first came to Mangbei,

138
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,360
my father had doubts about her identity

139
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,160
and had people investigate.

140
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,639
(Biological related)

141
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,360
I didn't think

142
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,279
it would be useful today.

143
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
I played along with you

144
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,600
and compromised.

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,480
But you still try to push me to my end.

146
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,519
Bai Lan,

147
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,600
do you know your manipulation

148
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,240
has stolen precious time

149
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,199
between me and my real father?

150
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,990
One more thing, Ms. Bai.

151
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,090
And as for the contract,
it's not signed yet.

152
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,720
Here's the share transfer agreement.

153
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,759
If you transfer your shares to Xiamo,

154
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,199
maybe she'll show mercy

155
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,279
on your dirty deeds.

156
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,519
You can't sign it.

157
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,590
We fell for their tricks.

158
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,360
I've already transferred

159
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,240
all my shares to her.

160
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,240
If you sign it, we'd be left with nothing.

161
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,360
Li Qingfeng,

162
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,920
why won't you turn back?

163
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,079
Can I even turn back?

164
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,680
I saved your life.

165
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,370
Instead of repaying me with gratitude,

166
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,680
you've teamed up with outsiders

167
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,639
to go against me.

168
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,639
Everything I've done
was just to make myself worthy of you.

169
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,399
My biggest mistake

170
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,000
was trusting you,
and falling in love with you.

171
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,279
You and Pu Ba conspired
to kill my father

172
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,600
and indirectly caused Zheng's death.

173
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,199
Do you think

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,680
no one knows

175
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,920
of your crimes in Mangbei?

176
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,079
Are you trying to say

177
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,920
you have a recording device?

178
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,800
I won't fall for your trick anymore.

179
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,900
If you have evidence,

180
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,639
show it.

181
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,480
There's no recording device

182
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,400
for your transaction with Pu Ba.

183
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,199
But I'm a witness.

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,639
Li Qingfeng,

185
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,560
were you trying to blow me up?

186
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,600
When did you remember that?

187
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,279
If you promise me

188
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,759
to turn yourself in,

189
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,839
I'll tell you everything.

190
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,560
You know

191
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,680
I will always agree

192
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,079
to whatever you ask.

193
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,920
It was the first time I saw him.

194
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,340
Just one glance at the eyes of someone

195
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,480
I deeply loved

196
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,360
was enough to be unforgettable.

197
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,440
Li Qingfeng,

198
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,000
you two-faced scoundrel.

199
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
I'll kill you!

200
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,360
Are you crazy?

201
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,159
You should hate them,

202
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:08,679
not me!

203
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,580
Let's get out of here.

204
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,279
I did deceive people.

205
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,399
I can't blame her for hating me.

206
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,519
But I really did bring

207
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,159
Su Shide's daughter back.

208
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,890
The good outweighs the bad

209
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,159
so I owe no one,

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,759
except for you.

211
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,960
You completely deceived me.

212
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,559
You brought it upon yourself.

213
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,639
If you told me

214
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,850
Xiamo's real identity earlier,

215
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,690
I wouldn't have had to cater
to your whims

216
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,720
and become

217
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,039
Su Shide's true son-in-law!

218
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,440
Don't you still get it?

219
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,639
What we have wasn't love.

220
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,080
Li Qingfeng,

221
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,799
let her go and turn yourself in.

222
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,480
Okay?

223
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,919
You told me

224
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,039
we're the last family

225
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,240
we have in this world.

226
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,600
Does that still count?

227
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,890
Then what about switching my medication
and messing with my memory?

228
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,890
How do you explain that?

229
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,360
I've done many bad things.

230
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,440
You're the only one

231
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,120
I can face with a clear conscience.

232
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,639
Don't you feel

233
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,519
even a shred of guilt toward me?

234
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,080
The only way you can help me now

235
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,120
is to help me escape!

236
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,320
Li Qingfeng,

237
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,600
put the knife down.

238
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,400
There's still a way.

239
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,880
Take another step, and I'll kill her!

240
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,399
We can't push him into a corner.

241
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,300
Even if he escapes,

242
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,919
he won't get far.
