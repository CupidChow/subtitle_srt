1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,200
(My name is Su Xiamo.)

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,359
(Yesterday, I was still the heiress
of a jewelry conglomerate.)

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,080
(Mangbei)
(Before I knew it, my stepmom tricked me into)

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,480
(going to the most dangerous place
in the world.)

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:14,599
(Where is he?)

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:15,599
(Mangbei.)

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,719
(She told me I could find
my missing brother here.)

8
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:20,800
(But)

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:21,879
(what awaited me)

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,879
(was a trap set by my stepmom.)

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,200
Get the goods onto the ship.

12
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:37,039
(Until he appeared...)

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,439
(Who would have thought)

14
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,239
(that this dangerous man before me)

15
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,760
(would become my husband)

16
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,799
(within a day?)

17
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,780
=Rainforest Passion=

18
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,660
=Episode 1=

19
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,200
(Welcome to the world of Mangbei,)

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,959
(Su Xiamo.)

21
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,680
(How did you know my name?)

22
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,560
(I not only know your name.)

23
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,079
(I also know)

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,760
(that you're Su Shide's daughter.)

25
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,879
(And your father)

26
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,040
(is the reason my brother is dead.)

27
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,439
Qi,

28
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,359
since she's our enemy's daughter,

29
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,959
why not take this chance

30
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,359
and kill her

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,680
before she wakes up?

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,400
Don't act rashly

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,879
until the truth comes to light.

34
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,759
(To investigate my brother's death,)

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,800
(I became a bodyguard.)

36
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,039
(It made it easier to gather information
from both the legal and the underworld.)

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,960
(Finally, I have a lead.)

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,240
(I may not know
what grudge this man had)

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,960
(against my father.)

40
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,000
(But I can't just sit
and wait to be killed.)

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
(Just die!)

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,199
(Be careful.)

43
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
Is this how you repay my kindness?

44
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,159
Xiamo!

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,080
Li Qingfeng?

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,000
(Li Qingfeng, Xiamo's Younger Brother)
I've finally found you.

47
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,439
You're really here.

48
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,199
The irony of stealing from your family.

49
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,800
Qi Chuan,

50
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,599
stay out of my business.

51
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,479
You only need to protect her for me.

52
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,879
How could I possibly help you protect

53
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,879
my enemy's daughter?

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,680
Aren't you investigating
your brother's death?

55
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,479
My boss left no chance
of survival for her.

56
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,680
Instead of that,

57
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,560
why not hand her over as a hostage?

58
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,319
Has that girl left?

59
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,840
(Zheng, Qi Chuan's lackey)
Li Qingfeng took her to the dock this morning.

60
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,000
Qi,

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,479
Since she's the enemy's daughter,

62
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,479
why did you
let Li Qingfeng take her away?

63
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,000
I keep gratitude and grudge separate.

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,439
I've done what I promised
to Li Qingfeng.

65
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,560
What happens next

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,280
will be out of my control.

67
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,159
So you sent Qi Chuan for me?

68
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,240
Yes.

69
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
I sent him to rescue you.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,360
He's a well-known bodyguard in Mangbei,

71
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,599
who specializes
in escorting valuable goods.

72
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,120
Anyway,

73
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,759
I've finally found you.

74
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,000
You shouldn't have come here

75
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,399
or meddled in my business.

76
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,439
Why not?

77
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,120
You're my brother.

78
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,000
I am not your brother.

79
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,759
Here's your pass to board the ship.

80
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,759
Take it.

81
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,319
I need to grab something from the car.

82
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,040
I'll be right back.

83
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,639
(After all these years,)

84
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,199
(have you felt nothing?)

85
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,399
(Xiamo,)

86
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,800
(you should leave.)

87
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,199
(There are things I can't face.)

88
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,279
Li Qingfeng!

89
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,279
(I can only suppress my urge)

90
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,720
(by staying away from you.)

91
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,319
Li Qingfeng

92
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,199
(You brat!)

93
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,000
(I'll bring you home no matter what.)

94
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,079
(Did he leave her?)

95
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:09,839
Get in the car.

96
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,160
Why are you here?

97
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,199
Just passing by.

98
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:14,879
If you don't get it now,

99
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,720
he'll get away.

100
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,160
Can you please drive faster?

101
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,759
Faster.

102
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,000
His car is out of sight now.

103
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,439
Li Qingfeng isn't heading
in this direction.

104
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,879
Where are you taking me?

105
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,519
How about this?

106
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,560
You can drop me here,

107
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,600
and I'll find him myself.

108
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,600
That's not an option now.

109
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,360
Are you planning to kidnap me again?

110
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
I'm trying to help you here.

111
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,120
Then drop me here.

112
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Then stop the car and let me out.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,120
You wanted this yourself.

114
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,360
So don't regret it.

115
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,560
The patrolling soldiers patrol
every street here,

116
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,160
and you have no ID.

117
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,680
If you want to end up in jail,

118
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,279
be my guest.

119
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,439
The patrolling soldiers are coming.

120
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,279
You can leave now.

121
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,439
Wait, I'm sorry for doubting you.

122
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,160
I was overthinking just now.

123
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
I'll get back in the car now.

124
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,800
Oh, no. You can't do that.

125
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,879
What if you accuse me
of kidnapping you again?

126
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,600
I...

127
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,399
(Why is this guy being so difficult?)

128
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,720
(This is bad. I'm going to get caught.)

129
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,040
You can't do this to me!

130
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,199
I love you!

131
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,319
I... I'm even pregnant with your child!

132
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,319
You can't leave us.

133
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,120
How can you be so heartless?

134
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,120
You betrayed me!

135
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,319
You, liar! You're a liar!

136
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,120
Don't hit me!

137
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,439
(You, little liar.)

138
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,120
(What is she up to now?)

139
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,439
I can abort our baby.

140
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,639
I'll do whatever you say.

141
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,279
You sure know
how to stir up public sentiment,

142
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,399
little liar.

143
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,759
Don't push it.

144
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,959
Poor child.

145
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:41,959
Come with me.

146
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,120
I'll take you inside to change
into some clean clothes.

147
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,879
That's not necessary.

148
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,720
It's no trouble at all.

149
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,120
It's okay. Go ahead.

150
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Come with me.

151
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,439
Come, it's fine.

152
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,040
But I...

153
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,480
Poor girl.

154
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,480
This scumbag...

155
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,000
This man is the worst!

156
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,120
How shameless!

157
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,279
Who would've thought?

158
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,600
I can tell you love him very much.

159
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,600
How can you tell?

160
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,159
You picked a wedding dress,

161
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,639
I'm sure he knows what you want.

162
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,720
Of course.

163
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,519
How could I let an "amazing" woman

164
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,799
like you slip away?

165
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,320
(This sly old fox is a better actor
than I am.)

166
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:48,840
He's a liar.

167
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,960
He's trying to kidnap me.

168
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,600
Help me.

169
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,480
Why?

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,960
Are you still not willing to forgive me?

171
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,519
Silly girl.

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,159
Love itself is a reckless form
of kidnapping.

173
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,559
Give him another chance.

174
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,320
I still have a delivery to make,

175
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,960
my love.

176
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,840
Little Liar.

177
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
You're my walking bad luck.

178
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,679
I could say the same to you.

179
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,720
Yes, Boss.

180
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,159
Did you take care

181
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,000
of that woman from yesterday?

182
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,200
Yes, but I'm curious.

183
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,799
Why go to such lengths

184
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,039
for an outsider?

185
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,279
(Jian Axin, Mangbei Gang Leader)
I'm just following someone's orders.

186
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,759
What's the matter?

187
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,840
Feeling soft?

188
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,799
Anyway,

189
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,480
we're still salvaging the sunken ship.

190
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,080
While I'm away these days,

191
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,279
make sure to watch our territory.

192
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,240
Keep out of trouble.

193
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,080
Understood, don't worry.

194
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,639
Chaya,

195
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,919
why are you so happy?

196
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,759
(Chaya, Jian Axin's Daughter)

197
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,720
I've brought you a wedding invitation,

198
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,480
my dear father.

199
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,559
Whose wedding is it?

200
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,360
Mine.

201
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,480
It's happening today.

202
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,279
Absolutely ridiculous!

203
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,919
When are you taking me
to find Li Qingfeng?

204
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,720
After I finish this delivery.

205
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,320
(The man in the black suit)

206
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,000
(with the green betel nut tower)

207
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,840
(is your target.)

208
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,799
Slow down.

209
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,919
It's hard to move in this skirt.

210
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,320
Sir,

211
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,919
this Wucha wedding
is blessed by the elder

212
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,519
and witnessed by the Wucha God,
making it the highest ceremonial rite.

213
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,600
Before entering, please drink a cup
of sacred vine water.

214
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,720
You cannot enter without drinking it.

215
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,200
I'll drink it for him.

216
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,240
(Are)

217
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,159
(you okay?)

218
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,080
(You're welcome.)

219
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,519
Didn't you say
you have to make a delivery?

220
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,720
Why are we at a wedding?

221
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,559
Why is everyone staring at us?

222
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,919
And why does your face keep spinning
in front of me?

223
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,360
I have a bad feeling about this.

224
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,399
(Elder Wucha,)

225
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,000
(the one holding the betel nut tower)

226
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,360
(is today's groom.)

227
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,360
(What's going on?)

228
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,720
The gods will bless the chosen couple,

229
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,840
binding them in eternal matrimony.

230
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,639
(Qi Chuan,)

231
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,360
(what is he saying?)

232
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,159
(He said)

233
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,759
(the gods would bless
the chosen couple,)

234
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,720
(binding them in eternal matrimony.)

235
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,000
(Do you vow to honor and protect)

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,279
(your lifelong partner)

237
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,000
(as you would serve the gods?)

238
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
I do!

239
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,679
Stop everything!

240
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,919
You've made a mistake!

241
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,440
Under the watchful eyes
of the Wucha God,

242
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,759
you are...

243
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,200
We

244
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,440
are now officially husband and wife.

245
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,639
Yeah!

246
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,000
We're married!

247
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,080
We're married!

248
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,720
(This is a contract
that no one can defy,)

249
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,879
(alter,)

250
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,159
(or break.)

251
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,639
(I've actually married)

252
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,600
