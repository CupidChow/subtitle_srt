00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:35,900
(Witness Statement)

4
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,799
You're up.

5
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,319
Why didn't you wake me up earlier?

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,300
You've been so tired these days.

7
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,840
I want you to get more sleep.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,599
No, I can't.

9
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,150
I'm afraid my memory might get mixed up.

10
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,719
By the way, take a look at this.

11
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,910
It's the testimony I've organized
against Li Qingfeng.

12
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,719
Bai Lan called.

13
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,159
He will turn himself in.

14
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,560
Bai Lan also promised us

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,340
that she would distribute
the shares to you.

16
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,000
That's great.

17
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,490
They've finally come to their senses.

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,400
You know, I've been worried these days.

19
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,040
My brain suffered some trauma before.

20
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,319
What if they don't accept my testimony?

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,480
So,

22
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,239
you figured it all out

23
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,560
the moment you met me
and you just didn't tell me

24
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,680
and would rather endure my bad temper

25
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,200
than confront me?

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,560
I...

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,560
It's not that I didn't want to tell you.

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,640
It's just that I wasn't sure
at that time.

29
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,000
You know,

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,920
when I first bumped into you,

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,560
it felt like

32
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,319
there was something

33
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,639
somewhere in the corner of my mind

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,159
that had been triggered.

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,039
I felt like

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,560
you were warning me about danger.

37
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,680
But at that time,

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,159
I couldn't remember who you were.

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,520
At that time,

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,719
you seemed familiar

41
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,680
but also unfamiliar.

42
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,919
Dangerous

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,159
yet safe.

44
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:33,719
I'm sorry

45
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,520
I came too late.

46
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,199
I've been thinking about this.

47
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,520
If

48
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,879
I hadn't gone to Mangbei to find him,

49
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,719
would we have avoided

50
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,199
all this endless trouble?

51
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,759
If that didn't happen,

52
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,840
we wouldn't have reunited.

53
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,520
Reunited?

54
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:53,840
Come with me.

55
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,280
Is this where we first met?

56
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,000
It turns out

57
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,520
you saved me all those years ago.

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,439
You saved me first.

59
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,439
You know,

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,639
after my brother died,

61
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,680
I was overwhelmed

62
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,919
with guilt.

63
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,919
I wanted to die at the time.

64
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,199
But as I was about to take that step,

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,280
I heard the sound of a piano,

66
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,800
which pulled me back.

67
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,719
If it weren't for your playing,

68
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,759
I might have disappeared

69
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,919
from this world long ago.

70
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,039
I think I've seen you in this outfit.

71
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,360
I also remember it.

72
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,039
People's fates

73
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,800
are strange and twisted.

74
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,639
Back in Mangbei,
I already recognized you at a glance.

75
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,960
It felt surreal.

76
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,700
I thought you had already forgotten.

77
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,360
Tomorrow,

78
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,959
I'll take you to meet Bai Lan.

79
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,120
How about this?

80
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,800
Help me hand over the information
about Li Qingfeng's crime

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,720
to the police.

82
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,959
As for Bai Lan,

83
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,279
I'll handle it myself.

84
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,780
That will work too.

85
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,839
Come.

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,240
Li Qingfeng isn't answering my calls.

87
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,680
Has he contacted you?

88
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,439
We can talk

89
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,120
about any man in this world,

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
except Li Qingfeng.

91
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,759
Don't you think
it's a bit too sensitive?

92
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,959
Sometimes I really don't understand

93
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,480
why would you like him.

94
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,890
After I married your father
for three years,

95
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,399
he started ignoring me.

96
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,879
You're asking

97
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,600
why a woman

98
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,639
who's been lonely in her marriage
for so many years

99
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,040
would fall for a young man

100
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
who's smart, and considerate.

101
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,639
So,

102
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,480
are you really okay

103
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,600
with my public relationship
with Li Qingfeng?

104
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,279
How could I possibly be okay?

105
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,759
I know I can't compare to you.

106
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,319
But when it comes to Li Qingfeng,

107
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,319
I have something more stable to offer.

108
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,079
Money

109
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,079
and experience.

110
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,519
Back then, your father used
those very reasons

111
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,560
to keep me around

112
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,079
in that messy love triangle

113
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,120
with your mother.

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,959
As you can see,

115
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,100
I eventually became Mrs. Su.

116
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,040
Basically,

117
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,199
Li Qingfeng and I

118
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,730
are the same kind of people.

119
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,519
It seems like

120
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,519
you understand him better than I do.

121
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,839
What good does that do?

122
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,319
If something isn't mine,

123
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,839
no matter how hard I fight for it,

124
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,800
I'll have to let it go in the end.

125

126

(Share Transfer Agreement)

129
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,839
No matter what,

130
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,800
you're the one

131
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,480
who brought me back to my father's side.

132
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,740
You've been part of the Su family
for so many years.

133
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,439
At least,

134
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,560
you deserve some credit.

135
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,759
I'm not

136
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,480
the type to burn bridges.

137
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,839
What do you mean by that?

138
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,480
I...

139
00:07:59,480 --> 00:07:59,959
Hello?

140
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,839
Xiamo,

141
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,519
I'm here checking the things

142
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,839
my father left in the warehouse.

143
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,399
But I think I got lost.

144
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,880
It's impossible to get a taxi here.

145
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,480
Can... Can you come and help me?

146
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,240
Calm down.

147
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Send me your location.

148
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,420
I'll go and pick you up.

149
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,680
I need to go and pick Chaya.

150
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,879
We'll talk

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,390
about the contract some other time.

152
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,850
I don't want
to waste time dragging this out.

153
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,600
I'll give you a ride there
and we'll clear things up on the way.

154
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,360
That will work too.

155
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,879
When I used to work for your father,

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,879
I did everything he asked,
no matter how shady.

157
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,320
Now,

158
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,159
consider you're paying off his debts.

159
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,679
Is she in here?

160
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,480
I think I heard something inside.

161
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,919
I didn't mean what I said earlier.

162
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,600
It was just out of anger.

163
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,799
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,879
I was wrong, okay?

165
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:28,519
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,759
I was wrong.

167
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,090
What exactly are you trying to do?

168
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,399
They don't have evidence.

169
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,550
They have no way to send me to prison.

170
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,160
But I don't want
to let all my efforts go to waste.

171
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,850
You're the only one who can help me now.
