(WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE
Chinese woman)

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,039
That's her.

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,080
Qi,

4
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:14,560
do we need to act?

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,000
Just leave it.

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:17,640
Go and buy the medicine first.

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,100
=Rainforest Passion=

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,980
=Episode 8=

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,000
It's okay now.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,439
This is my wife.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,200
Is there a problem?

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,620
(WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE)

13
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:57,960
It's not her.

14
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,240
You can leave.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,159
How did they not recognize me?

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,040
Does that mean I can use this chance
to escape back home?

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,760
Do you have a death wish or something?

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,359
So you made me drink that juice

19
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,959
just to trigger my allergy
and avoid being identified, right?

20
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you so much

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,640
for making me look like this now.

22
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:26,640
Lie down.

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,760
What do you want to do?

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,920
Apply the medication for you.

25
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,959
Or do you want to do it yourself?

26
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,840
You can do it.

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,319
You may have a sharp tongue.

28
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,000
But you have a kind heart.

29
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,359
You know

30
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,840
before you came to save me,

31
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:50,959
I had a feeling

32
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,040
you would show up.

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
I was passing by.

34
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,040
No matter what,

35
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,680
I'm a little convinced now.

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,760
About what?

37
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,200
The power of the mind.

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,599
As long as I sincerely call your name,

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,200
you'll hear me.

40
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,120
So it's no longer
the suspension bridge effect theory?

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,599
You heard that?

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,039
So that's why you told Chaya
you hated me.

43
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:19,520
Am I right?

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,719
Don't flatter yourself.

45
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,599
Bee-stung puppy.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
I said that

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,479
because I didn't want
to make an enemy of her.

48
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,319
After all, she likes you so much.
Am I right?

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,879
There's nothing between us.

50
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,759
Then why did you kiss her?

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,439
You've got it wrong.

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,360
Down.

53
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,439
Up.

54
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,240
Hand.

55
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,479
What are you doing?

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,400
Dog training.

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,719
You're the dog.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,800
Bee-stung puppy.

59
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,879
Now that things have come to this,

60
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,719
why not just make peace
with the situation?

61
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,240
No, I can't.

62
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,439
Get a hold of yourself.

63
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,719
Xiamo,

64
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,560
are you okay?

65
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,199
(Oh, shoot. What do I do?)

66
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,400
(Maybe I'll just pretend to faint.)

67
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,159
Are you throwing her out?

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,319
Pack her clothes

69
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,159
and bring them to the hospital.

70
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,520
I wish I could be like Qi.

71
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,039
His life after marriage
is exciting every single day.

72
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,000
Has no one ever told you

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,240
that your silence is infuriating?

74
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,800
You...

75
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,800
You didn't see anything

76
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,160
you weren't supposed to just now
in the bathroom, did you?

77
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,079
It's not the first time I've seen it.

78
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,920
What do you mean
it's not the first time?

79
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,319
You're really not a gentleman at all.

80
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,079
Can't you just say
you didn't see anything?

81
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,360
Then pretend I didn't see anything.

82
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,720
I know

83
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,079
I'm not your type.

84
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,319
But you're not my type either.

85
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,319
So let's keep our distance from now on.

86
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,399
Stop doing things

87
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,439
that make me misunderstand.

88
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,519
Am I the one
who keeps making you misunderstand,

89
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,120
or are you the one
who constantly misunderstands me?

90
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,240
Me? Misunderstand you?

91
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,279
Then why are you always so close to me?

92
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,279
And I saw you kissing Chaya.

93
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,600
Don't tell me that with your strength,

94
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,560
you couldn't push a woman away.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,839
My neck hurts.

96
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,000
Not bad.

97
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,720
What do you mean by that?

98
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,839
If I look closely,

99
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,600
some parts

100
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,439
are my type.

101
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,000
What you saw between me and Chaya

102
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,319
is precisely this.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,160
Nothing happened.

104
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,759
(Qi Chuan,)

105
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,639
(you...)

106
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,120
(Darn, you!)

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,560
(What a terrible weather.)

108
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,399
(Why is it so hot?)

109
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,040
Is the fan broken?

110
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,560
Yeah.

111
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,240
The things in your room

112
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,720
are really poor quality.

113
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,079
If you can't stand the heat,

114
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,399
you can sleep in my room.

115
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,480
It's much cooler than here.

116
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,759
Your room has no ventilation.

117
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,360
Forget it.

118
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,279
Sleeping with you
would make it even hotter.

119
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,560
I'll just go for a walk.

120
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,560
Suit yourself.

121
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Qi Chuan actually married
Su Shide's daughter.

122
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,600
That's just a misunderstanding.

123
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,960
She's not Su Shide's daughter.

124
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,639
She came here to find me.

125
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,399
What is the relationship
between you two?

126
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,919
She's my sister.

127
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,000
We grew up

128
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,559
in foster homes together.

129
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,679
By coincidence, I met your father.

130
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,759
So I came to Mangbei alone.

131
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,000
She's really worried about me.

132
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,840
So

133
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,360
you two are just siblings

134
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,639
without blood ties?

135
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,159
I hope

136
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,799
we are more than that.

137
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,480
Why must it be Xiamo?

138
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,840
All of this is such a coincidence.

139
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,399
How did I end up in Qi Chuan's room?

140
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,519
(If I look closely,)

141
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,039
(some parts)

142
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,000
(are my type.)

143
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,919
Actually, in terms of appearance,

144
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,960
you're also my type.

145
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,720
But...

146
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:24,919
