00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,420
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:19,440
You brat.

4
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,800
I can no longer go back, Xiamo.

5
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,039
I'm your sister.

6
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,519
(Sister?)

7
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,559
(I thought they were...)

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,960
Why are you with him?

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,320
If you hadn't left me

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,640
at the dock,

11
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,399
would I have ended up marrying
this outlaw bodyguard?

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,560
Married?

13
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,119
Let her go.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,679
So you're the bride

15
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,920
who crashed the Wucha wedding.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,039
Now that you know,

17
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,560
stop being disrespectful.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,399
You actually dared
to set your sights on her?

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,280
That's enough.

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,000
I am

21
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,039
your brother-in-law now.

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,239
I thought I came to save him.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,719
But it turns out

24
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,840
to be my wishful thinking.

25
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,120
Everyone has their own choices to make.

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,239
He has his own path to follow.

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,560
Yeah.

28
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,200
If it weren't for looking for him,

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,000
I wouldn't have to deceive Su Shide
against my conscience.

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,799
Why did they pick you?

31
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,879
Su Shide's mistress said

32
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,920
I looked a lot like
his missing daughter.

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,239
She told me his days were numbered.

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,599
As long as I could make him happy,

35
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,519
she'd help me find Li Qingfeng.

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,719
And why did Li Qingfeng leave home

37
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,480
in the first place?

38
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,000
Maybe

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,879
it was just a rebellious phase.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,680
He suddenly had a big fight
with the family

41
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,000
and said he couldn't face it anymore.

42
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,639
After that, he vanished without a trace.

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,240
Even when our parents
were in a car accident,

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,680
he didn't come

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,039
to see them one last time.

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,520
I was so angry with him.

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,000
But now,

48
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,439
he's my only family left

49
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,400
in this world.

50
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,680
He doesn't seem

51
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,680
completely indifferent to you.

52
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,000
Is

53
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,599
the power out again?

54
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,400
My hand really hurts.

55
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,439
There's a splinter here.

56
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,560
I'll get it out for you.

57
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,680
Bear with it for a second.

58
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,960
All done.

59
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,479
It's hot.

60
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,800
I want to eat that.

61
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,279
You guys can stop displaying
your affection.

62
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,160
I'm allergic to all labiatae plants.

63
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,800
You can use your other hand

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,160
to eat with the spoon.

65
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,279
Thank you.

66
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,079
I think it's time to wash my hair.

67
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,800
But I can't wash my hair

68
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,720
with my hand like this.

69
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,639
I'll help you wash your hair.

70
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,759
Do you think I'm prettier,

71
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,439
or is my brother's girlfriend prettier?

72
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,759
Chaya

73
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,000
is not your brother's girlfriend.

74
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,360
How could it not be his girlfriend?

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,920
They were already like that.

76
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,480
Like what?

77
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,480
Oh, you know. They were hugging

78
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,839
and tugging on each other.

79
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,079
We do that too.

80
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,439
So, are you my girlfriend?

81
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,959
My ear...

82
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,000
My ears are really itchy.

83
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,639
Can you rub it for me?

84
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,600
Chaya!

85
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,439
What a coincidence!

86
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,399
What's so coincidental about it?

87
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,839
I'm here to see him.

88
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:36,800
Wait!

89
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,120
Qi...

90
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,000
It's not really the best timing.

91
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,439
Why not?

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,480
I'm still curious.

93
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,160
Earlier, you said
Chaya doesn't like my brother.

94
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,040
How did you know that?

95
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,839
Because the person I like is him.

96
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,800
Do you know each other?

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,759
We're more than that.

98
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,199
If it weren't for you,

99
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,199
I'd already be his Wucha bride.

100
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,879
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

101
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,160
Well,

102
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,720
this is quite lively.

103
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,040
Do you mind if we talk in private?

104
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:17,959
Qi,

105
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,399
the brakes seem to have a problem.

106
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,319
Can you check it for me?

107
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,439
Come on, hurry.

108
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,800
I don't want

109
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
or plan to know you.

110
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,639
I only want you to understand

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,040
that you'll never love him
the way I do.

112
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,399
You're not wrong.

113
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,480
We've only known each other
for a few days.

114
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,480
This is nothing but a farce.

115
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,319
So

116
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,720
you don't love him?

117
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,120
It'd be a bit extreme

118
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,360
to say not at all.

119
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,920
I admit

120
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,000
he's very attractive,

121
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,279
and I'm someone
who likes good-looking men.

122
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,920
It's normal
if my heart occasionally flutters.

123
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,480
Then you're going against me.

124
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,439
I don't want to be your enemy.

125
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,720
Sometimes, I even wonder

126
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,199
if these feelings are just an illusion.

127
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,160
Have you heard
of the suspension bridge effect?

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,879
It means

129
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,279
when someone crosses a bridge in fear,

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,879
their heart will race
against their will.

131
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,199
If they happen to run into someone
at that time,

132
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,240
they might mistake it

133
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,120
as an attraction to that person.

134
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,720
I don't understand
all this complicated speech.

135
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,160
I won't defy the Wucha God's blessing.

136
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,480
But if you don't cherish him,

137
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,680
I'll protect the man I love

138
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,959
in my way.

139
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,159
Both of you defiled
the Wucha God's blessing.

140
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,120
I thought about stepping aside.

141
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,320
Just leave.

142
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,080
Qi Chuan.

143
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,720
You heard what she said, right?

144
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,080
She doesn't love you.

145
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,240
She's only using you.

146
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,039
This is my personal matter.

147
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,240
I always thought

148
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,679
you would be the indifferent one
in a relationship.

149
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,320
But now you're feigning ignorance.

150
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,360
It seems you've fallen for her.

151
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,600
Maybe

152
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,360
you have a thing for people
who don't like you.

153
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,480
She's exactly

154
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,360
the type I hate most.

155
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,639
What about me?

156
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,679
Don't push me to embarrass you.

157
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,159
Xiamo's words today were a bit harsh.

158
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,480
If you ask me,

159
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,919
she needs to experience
how harsh the outside world can be.

160
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,480
We cared

161
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,639
for her like a precious flower.

162
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,720
But she acts like

163
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,039
she's the flower on a cow...

164
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,320
Sorry, slip of the tongue.

165
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,399
I didn't mean
to say you're the cow dung.

166
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,480
Enough nonsense.

167
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,679
Where did this luggage come from?

168
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,720
Li Qingfeng had someone deliver
her luggage.

169
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,639
Should we take it...

170
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,320
Take it to her.

171
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,559
Okay.

172
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,360
Where's my passport?

173
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,559
I asked Li Qingfeng
to send my luggage to me.

174
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,720
But my passport is missing.

175
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,759
Is this your style?

176
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,360
Yes,

177
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,240
the type you hate most.

178
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,639
I know that.

179
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,000
You overheard my conversation
with Chaya,

180
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,360
didn't you?

181
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,120
But don't worry.

182
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,240
I don't care

183
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,360
if you like or hate me.

184
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,440
I'm leaving soon anyway.

185
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,440
I may take shelter here.

186
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,600
But I won't mooch off you.

187
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,879
Here you go.

188
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,399
What's this supposed to mean?

189
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,840
Compensation.

190
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,399
Su Shide gave me this bank card.

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,360
It should be enough, right?

192
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,120
Do you think this is what I'm after?

193
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,679
Didn't you keep me here

194
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,279
as a bargaining chip
to negotiate with Su Shide

195
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,080
for even more compensation?

196
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,240
Listen to this clearly.

197
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,200
Xiamo,
