3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,200
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,960
The gift you gave to Pu Ba

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,079
is now in my hands.

6
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,520
Relax.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:33,920
Don't worry.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,500
I'll settle the scores

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,479
with you slowly.

10
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,250
The business world
is like a battlefield.

11
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,300
Everyone wants
to know their opponents and themselves.

12
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,390
But as long as we secure
the investment funds first,

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,200
we would still gain the upper hand.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,519
Okay.

15
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,319
In that case,

16
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,519
we'll give it a shot.

17
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,319
Let's see who's quicker.

18
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,879
Xiamo has found out about us.

19
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,000
She doesn't want to be the fake heiress.

20
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,599
She only wants to complete
the division of Su Shide's assets.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,519
Isn't that a good thing?

22
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,640
But why are you upset?

23
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,359
I'm only curious.

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,640
They clearly have dirt on us.

25
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,159
Why aren't they making their move?

26
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,040
What exactly are they waiting for?

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,799
Or could they have
some incriminating evidence against us?

28
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:03,840
No,

29
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,159
that could be a bluff.

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,680
But no matter what,

31
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,400
I'll make the person he loves most

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,599
become the sharpest knife stabbing
into his heart.

33
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,759
Come on.

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,759
- Bottom's up.
- Drink up.

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,759
Come on.

36
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,180
Don't leave a single drop.

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,960
Come on.

38
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:57,919
Qi.

39
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,000
Hey, he's cheating.

40
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,840
You, brat.

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,560
Are you planning to get me drunk today?

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
I have plenty of drinks.

43
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,100
(Even though you've confirmed)

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,879
(that Li Qingfeng was behind all this,)

45
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,319
(he is still Xiamo's brother.)

46
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,830
(If you go through with this,)

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,719
(you will have no chance
with her anymore.)

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,439
Qi Chuan.

49
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,680
I didn't expect

50
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,719
I would still worry
about you feeling hurt.

51
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,000
Tell me

52
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,759
why Qi Chuan is so hostile
toward you.

53
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,639
I think I've been cursed
by the Eye of Wucha.

54
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,279
What do you mean?

55
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,160
This priceless artifact

56
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,759
could bring me success.

57
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,690
But its origins are shrouded in mystery.

58
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,199
There's a legend in Mangbei.

59
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,199
Anyone who harbors greedy thoughts
toward this object

60
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,759
will be dragged into its curse.

61
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,639
Jian Axin ignored the warnings
of the local chieftain,

62
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,800
destroyed the temple, and dug it out.

63
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,490
After several changes of hands,

64
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,920
everyone who has possessed it

65
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:42,920
has met their end.

66
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,800
Qi Chuan's brother,

67
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,240
Jian Axin,

68
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,680
and Pu Ba.

69
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,879
Who's Pu Ba?

70
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,560
Just an irrelevant person.

71
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,240
Xiamo,

72
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,930
you wouldn't want me to fall victim
to the curse, would you?

73
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
You must help me.

74
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,160
Help me retrieve

75
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,560
the dirt Qi Chuan has over me.

76
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,970
What exactly is this dirt

77
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,680
you're talking about?

78
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,839
It's a recording device.

79
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,240
It could bring our company down.

80
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,680
Qi Chuan wants to use it
to short Su Shide Group.

81
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,900
I can't let him get what he wants.

82
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,470
I don't want to be entangled
with Bai Lan any longer either.

83
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,120
Do you still want
to remain in Qi Chuan's cage forever?

84
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,079
I know why you're hesitating.

85
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,950
You should act decisively

86
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,360
if you're going to make a move.

87
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,150
You want to take over Su Shide Group

88
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,000
and complete your revenge
at the lowest cost.

89
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,480
You must have a trump card, right?

90
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:08,879
That's right.

91
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,370
The trump card is right here.

92
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,199
I'm waiting for the right moment.

93
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,279
But why are you more anxious than I am?

94
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,399
I've already been thrown out.

95
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,560
Of course, I'm anxious.

96
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,279
Besides,

97
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,800
isn't opportunity supposed
to favor those who are prepared?

98
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,319
Caviar.

99
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,319
Want to try some?

100
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,879
What are you doing?

101
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,240
I'm trying to please you,

102
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,900
like what you wanted.

103
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,000
How is it?

104
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,279
Taste fishy.

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,290
If you don't like it, forget it.

106
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
(This box of caviar)

107
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,879
(has been infused
with a high dose of sedative.)

108
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,990
(When the time comes,
find a way to make him eat it.)

109
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,959
(In less than three seconds,
he'll fall into a deep sleep.)

110
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,720
Did you get the device?

111
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,360
Yes, I got it.

112
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,560
But it's out of power.

113
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,800
This is your last chance.

114
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,160
Tell me what's inside.

115
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,159
I did

116
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,790
a lot of unspeakable things

117
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,279
to get you.

118
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,399
I'm afraid if I tell you, you'll be scared.

119
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,120
But don't worry.

120
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,480
Everything is already in the past.

121
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,519
From now on, no one and nothing

122
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,559
can take you away from me.

123
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,039
Can you really tell

124
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,480
if you are doing this for me
or yourself?

125
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,290
What are you doing?

126
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,879
Let me go!

127
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,320
Stay still!

128
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,440
You're still so mischievous.

129
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,360
Hand over

130
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,039
that little trinket you stole from me.

131
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,080
Qi Chuan, do you call yourself a man
for using a woman to threaten me?

132
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,240
Do you think you're noble?

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,519
Watch this.

134
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,970
This is a recording device.

135
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,990
It contains the evidence of your crime
that can affect your future.

136
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,639
This woman is related to your happiness.

137
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,399
Between future and happiness,

138
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,600
you can only pick one.

139
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,290
So make your choice.

140
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,480
You, scum!

141
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,879
Li Qingfeng,

142
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,200
take me away.

143
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,880
I want the recording device.

144
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,039
Li Qingfeng!

145
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,440
See that?

146
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,279
He keeps claiming it's for you.

147
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,679
But it's for himself.

148
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,620
I don't have to give it to you,
you know?

149
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,160
But I can't stoop to that.

150
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,440
I can't stoop so low
as despicable as you.

151
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,240
