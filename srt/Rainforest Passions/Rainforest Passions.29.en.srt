3
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,679
Xiamo has been kidnapped
by Li Qingfeng.

4
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,439
Chaya is also in his hands.

5
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,399
He told you not to alert anyone

6
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,079
and to bring all your money

7
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,840
along with the Eye of Wucha to him.

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,079
Chaya.

9
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,399
Chaya.

10
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,359
I didn't expect

11
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,640
you and Bai Lan are still scheming!

12
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,039
You made me do this.

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,879
I'm bleeding.

14
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,319
I've done so much to find our secret place.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,359
I said, I'm bleeding.

16
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,040
Why aren't you feeling sorry for me?

17
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,439
I no longer have any sympathy for you.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,640
You only disgust me now.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,760
Don't look at me like that!

20
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,920
That look in your eyes
only makes me want to gouge them out.

21
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,000
But you know

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,560
I can't bear to.

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,439
How about this?

24
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,879
I'll torture her instead.

25
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,879
Then beg me, okay?

26
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:49,760
Don't do it.

27
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,879
Li Qingfeng, no.

28
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,760
Please.

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,239
I'll do anything you ask.

30
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,879
Just don't harm the innocent.

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,879
Why do you care so much about others?

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,879
Yet, there's no place for someone

33
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,360
like me?

34
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,759
Do you know

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,280
nothing else matters

36
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,639
than you

37
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,159
in my heart?

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,199
Do you know

39
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,680
why I brought you here today?

40
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,240
Eighteen years of secret admiration,

41
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,400
I hid it all here.

42
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,599
But you broke your promise.

43
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,360
You once told me

44
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,520
that we'd always be family

45
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,360
and I'm the most important person to you.

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,759
I kept my word.

47
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,879
Did you?

48
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,120
You're like a ray of light.

49
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,520
Just one glance

50
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,560
at you fills me

51
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,919
with satisfaction.

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,520
I've cared for you

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,120
like a delicate flower.

54
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,280
I've done so much for you.

55
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,000
Why can't I enter your heart?

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,759
When we were five,

57
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,000
we moved into a new home together.

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,599
I always thought

59
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,800
becoming family with you

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,759
was the happiest moment of my life.

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Do you remember

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,319
how happy we all were back then?

63
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,639
I wasn't the one
who destroyed this bond.

64
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,800
It was you.

65
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,599
For years, I've been trapped
by calling you sister.

66
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,400
Can't you feel it

67
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,039
when I look at you?

68
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,680
You've lost your mind.

69
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,919
Yes.

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,000
You're right!

71
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,759
I've lost my mind!

72
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,080
I've completely lost my mind!

73
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,759
Why won't you love me?

74
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,879
You're willing to give up everything
for Qi Chuan.

75
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,280
Why can't you do the same for me?

76
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
You will come back to Mangbei with me.

77
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,000
So long as Qi Chuan gives me
the Eye of Wucha,

78
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,319
I can make a comeback.

79
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,680
Stop dreaming.

80
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,160
He won't let you succeed.

81
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,279
That's not a nice thing to say.

82
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,399
Then I have to start the punishment.

83
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,560
Li Qingfeng.

84
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,800
Li Qingfeng.

85
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,040
Li Qingfeng.

86
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,240
Li Qingfeng!

87
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,360
See?

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,639
Don't.

89
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,879
I've unlocked the gates

90
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,160
but she couldn't even walk out.

91
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,920
I'll do whatever you want.

92
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,319
Please don't hurt her.

93
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,000
Li Qingfeng.

94
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,040
Li Qingfeng!

95
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,199
Li Qingfeng!

96
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:55,959
No!

97
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,879
I'll give you one last chance
to say something.

98
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,360
You're the reason

99
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,399
I'm in this state.

100
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,519
It's all my fault for trusting
the wrong person.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,480
I thought you would change your ways.

102
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,360
Our special guest has finally arrived.

103
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,160
Xiamo.

104
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,120
Qi Chuan,

105
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,519
watch out for Bai Lan.

106
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,199
Ms. Bai is a smart woman.

107
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,160
Why would she choose
to work with Li Qingfeng for a second time?

108
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,240
Don't waste your breath.

109
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,240
One of you used me to pave
the way for your success.

110
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:48,399
The other one turned her efforts
in vain.

111
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,800
She can only trust me.

112
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,759
It's all because of you guys.

113
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,680
Li Qingfeng,

114
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,639
this money and treasure

115
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,560
are more than enough for you
to escape unscathed.

116
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,199
Release them.

117
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,990
What gives you the right
to order me around?

118
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,079
These things

119
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,680
were mine to begin with.

120
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,639
I am the one you hate.

121
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,879
Kidnapping two women
doesn't make you a man.

122
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,439
I'll give you a chance.

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,680
If you want something,

124
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
direct it to me instead.

125
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,399
Trying to be a hero, huh?

126
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,800
I'll give you that chance too.

127
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,279
Go inside

128
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,399
and I won't mistreat them.

129
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,079
Take that

130
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,120
and tie him up.

131
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,680
How do you plan to deal with them?

132
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Burn it all down

133
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,759
and make it look like an accident.

134
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,800
Then we should leave now.

135
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,639
No rush.

136
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,399
Go and check the goods.

137
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,200
We'll need a scapegoat for this fire

138
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,679
and it can only be you.

139
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,039
Qi Chuan,

140
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,200
our game will begin now.
