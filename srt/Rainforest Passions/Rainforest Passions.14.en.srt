3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,420
(Engagement Day)

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,399
Xiamo,

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,519
are you ready?

6
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:23,280
Xiamo?

7
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,200
I can't believe
Qi Chuan would really do this to you.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,600
He said

9
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,920
things would be dangerous tonight.

10
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,799
He's planning to make a move
against Jian Axin.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,280
What exactly is his plan?

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,960
I have no idea.

13
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,079
He refused to tell me anything.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,000
I cracked Jian Axin's decryption device.

15
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,040
It can unlock your anklet

16
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,719
and give you access to the Eye of Wucha.

17
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,239
My guess is

18
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,480
that Qi Chuan is also targeting the gem.

19
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,079
If you can get it,

20
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,319
not only can it help Qi Chuan

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,000
uncover the truth
about the shipwreck case,

22
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,840
but it might also allow me
to escape Jian Axin

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,640
and go back with you.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,439
And you're the only one

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,719
who can get close to the Eye of Wucha.

26
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,359
But Qi Chuan...

27
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,200
Forget about him.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,959
At this point,

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
you can only trust me

30
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,359
and yourself

31
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,959
if you want to get out of here.

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,280
Qi Chuan will lose it when he sees it.

33
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,760
Just ignore him.

34
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,040
You should be focusing on

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,200
what you need to do.

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,719
Now, give me your hand.

37
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,519
What are you doing?

38
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,799
Put this watch on.

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,400
It's the key to unlocking
the Eye of Wucha.

40
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,760
You need to hold it

41
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,840
near the gem for one minute

42
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,319
to deactivate the security alarm.

43
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,120
Once you get it,
I've arranged a black car

44
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,759
on the northern side

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,800
to take you straight out of the country.

46
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,400
Qi Chuan.

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,159
If you go there now,

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,039
everyone will start gossiping about me.

49
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,919
She shouldn't be here.

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,039
If this continues,

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,199
things won't go as you hope.

52
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
And it won't work out for you either.

53
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,479
I can tell you one thing for certain.

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Li Qingfeng's feelings for Xiamo

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,719
are complicated.

56
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:37,960
What kind of complicated?

57
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,879
They're not biological siblings.

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,479
Li Qingfeng likes Xiamo.

59
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,400
Even if I step aside,

60
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,599
he'll be your biggest obstacle.

61
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,520
After all,

62
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,240
Xiamo came here for him

63
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,159
in the first place.

64
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,599
Can you seriously

65
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,360
consider marrying me?

66
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,240
You're well aware of my intentions.

67
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,319
There's no future for us.

68
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,800
Welcome

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,719
to my daughter's engagement ceremony.

70
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,599
I know that everyone gathered here today

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,479
has been eagerly waiting

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,840
for another highlight of the event,

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,639
which is

74
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,719
the dazzling treasure
of a thousand years

75
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,520
under this velvet.

76
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,240
The legendary Eye of Wucha

77
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,400
has resurfaced in this world.

78
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,080
Why is Pu Ba here?

79
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,680
He has always been Father's ally.

80
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,840
Do I really need
to take this hot potato away

81
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,319
with me?

82
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:45,800
Yes.

83
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,560
It's the only way to save Qi Chuan

84
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,639
and get myself back home.

85
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,240
Next,

86
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,400
let me invite our most esteemed guest,

87
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,400
the next rightful owner
of the Eye of Wucha

88
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,080
to unveil

89
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,560
its mystery

90
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,840
for us.

91
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,759
- All right!
- Great!

92
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,240
Okay.

93
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,479
Let's see it.

94
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,439
- Okay, good.
- Nice.

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,800
(Let's see if you'll protect
the Eye of Wucha)

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
(or Xiamo.)

97
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,160
Miss Su, please do the honor.

98
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,279
Miss Su, please.

99
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,279
Beautiful!

100
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:44,879
Oh, heavens!

101
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,879
Once this deal is completed,

102
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,319
this treasure

103
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,000
will officially belong

104
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,199
to the distinguished Miss Su.

105
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:53,879
That's why

106
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,399
I've personally invited Chief Pu Ba

107
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,800
to ensure the safe handover

108
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,279
of this rare gem.

109
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,240
- Well done!
- Good work!

110
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,360
Something seems off

111
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,199
about the Eye of Wucha on stage.

112
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,040
That's just a replica.

113
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,879
Until everything sets in stone,

114
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,560
he likes to keep everything
under his control.

115
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,439
So, where is the real Eye of Wucha?

116
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,839
let the celebration begin!

118
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Let's raise a toast

119
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,959
to my daughter, Chaya's happiness,

120
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
and to Miss Su for acquiring

121
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,759
this remarkable treasure.

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,199
- All right!
- Of course!

123
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,360
Great!

124
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,279
Miss Su, that way, please.

125
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,680
Pu Ba.

126
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,279
- Come.
- Okay.

127
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,399
Groom,

128
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,360
aren't you a little too excited?

129
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,040
Sorry about that.

130
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,079
Chief Pu Ba,

131
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,639
it's been a while.

132
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,439
Who would've thought
you knew each other?

133
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:03,959
Well,

134
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,480
as you Chinese say, it must be fate.

135
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,639
Congratulations.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,519
Likewise.

137
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,240
Let's go.

138
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,560
Come.

139
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,519
I'll show you the real Eye of Wucha.

140
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,720
The Eye of Wucha

141
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,199
is truly irresistible.

142
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,639
Come.

143
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,040
Don't you think
it's quite a coincidence?

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,160
The buyer this time

145
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040
is Su Shide again.

146
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,600
Boss,

147
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,920
are you suggesting
we handle it like last time

148
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,399
and make sure they never come back?

149
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,160
Come on.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,720
May our path to wealth

151
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,480
last forever.

152
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,600
To a successful partnership.

153
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,800
(I just found out the gem)

154
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,160
(on stage is fake.)

155
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,000
(The real Eye of Wucha)

156
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,519
(is hidden beneath the pagoda nearby.)

157
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,800
(You could use your status as a buyer)

158
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,560
(to find out.)

159
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,160
Don't make any noise.

160
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,279
If you go now,
you're walking straight into their trap.

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,319
I have a way to get the Eye of Wucha.

162
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,480
You see this situation too simply.

163
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Jian Axin never planned

164
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,040
to let you leave alive.

165
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,600
They have countless ways

166
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,680
to make you disappear

167
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,959
as if you were never here.

168
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,040
Right now, they are pulling
the same trick again.

169
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,600
You two, check over there.

170
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,279
Yes.

171
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:45,759
Let's go.

172
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,800
Stay alert.

173
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,720
Everyone, stay sharp.

174
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:01,879
Three years ago,

175
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,160
my brother was escorting
the Eye of Wucha.

176
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,439
On his way back,

177
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,040
there was a mysterious shipwreck.

178
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,680
He and the Eye of Wucha sank

179
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,920
to the bottom of the sea together.

180
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,300
(Find the truth)

181
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,140
(Return Route)

182
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,980
(Historic Titanic Tragedy, Su Shide's Priceless Jewels Lost in the Wreck
I was supposed to go. Brother died because of me.)

183
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll wait for your return.

184
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,680
You, brat.

185
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,959
At first,

186
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,920
I thought Su Shide was behind it
to commit insurance fraud.

187
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,000
But later, I discovered

188
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,399
that Jian Axin was the anonymous seller.

189
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,540
(Jian Axin)

190
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,519
It was all part

191
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,679
of his inside job.

192
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,559
So

193
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,759
you kept me by your side at first

194
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,279
to use me for your revenge.

195
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,399
Then you sent me straight into danger.

196
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,480
It was all

197
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,559
to lure Jian Axin into your trap.

198
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,120
I admit

199
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,679
I used you at the start.

200
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,000
But now that you know the truth,

201
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,639
you really shouldn't get involved
in this mess.

202
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,759
If we really get

203
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,120
the Eye of Wucha,

204
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,679
will it prove everything?

205
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,399
The chip embedded in the Eye of Wucha

206
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,720
has recorded its entire journey.

207
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,200
With concrete evidence,

208
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,440
the truth will come to light.

209
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,559
Honestly, when Li Qingfeng asked me

210
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,200
to retrieve the Eye of Wucha earlier,

211
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,799
I didn't think it mattered much.

212
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,360
But now, everything has changed.

213
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,840
I have to get it.
