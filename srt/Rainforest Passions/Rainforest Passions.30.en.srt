=Episode 30=

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,239
Qi Chuan,

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,239
our game begins now.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,280
Oh, my dear Xiamo.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,870
I've cherished you like my own life
for so many years.

7
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:26,800
You even became my fiancée.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,800
I've longed for you so much.

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,079
But to honor your wishes,

10
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,200
I haven't so much as touched
a single finger of yours.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,200
Li Qingfeng!

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,119
Kiss me.

13
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,759
I've never found you
more disgusting than now.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,759
Oh, don't be mad.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,479
I'll take both of you away with me.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,280
Then I will create a prison for you.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,450
We'll have all the time in the world
to nurture our feelings.

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,439
And as for you,

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,560
you'll die with Bai Lan.

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,280
Li Qingfeng,

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,719
let them go.

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,320
I... I'll go with you.

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,039
No.

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,200
Let Xiamo go.

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,479
I'll go with you.

26
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:05,560
Did you hear that?

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,400
I've never felt so popular.

28
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,519
How about you help me decide?

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:11,890
Who should I leave

30
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,480
and who should I take with me?

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:14,840
Li Qingfeng,

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,719
you've already taken four lives.

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,480
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

34
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,560
Four lives?

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,319
Pu Ba,

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,680
Zheng,

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,280
Jian Axin,

38
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,400
and Bai Lan.

39
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
You were right.

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,040
It was four lives.

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,959
Why did you have to kill my father?

42
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,879
You can't blame me alone
for your father's death.

43
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,239
Thanks to Pu Ba's help.

44
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,879
He somehow managed
to get his hands on a special drug

45
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,480
that caused your father
to die unknowingly in prison.

46
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,280
But Pu Ba was too greedy.

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,840
He wanted to take

48
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,519
this artifact away from me.

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,350
You've all heard of the curse,
haven't you?

50
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,640
Anyone who harbors greed for this object

51
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,760
will inevitably perish with it.

52
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,400
And so,

53
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,760
Pu Ba perished.

54
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,359
What did you do to Pu Ba?

55
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,599
I stabbed him and dumped him in the river,

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,280
right at the car explosion site.

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
It's a pity

58
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,360
that you and Zheng ended up

59
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,199
in the car

60
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,080
meant for Pu Ba.

61
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,319
To be honest,

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,719
Zheng was doomed to die young anyway.

63
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,680
But none of this is my fault,

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
but yours.

65
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,240
If it weren't
for your constant longing for Xiamo,

66
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,879
they wouldn't have gotten in that car.

67
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,680
No one would've died

68
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,990
and Chaya wouldn't have ended up
with a broken leg.

69
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,759
So I'm guilty?

70
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,560
What about you?

71
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,080
Li Qingfeng,

72
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,080
the money and jewels
are in your hands now.

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,919
What more do you want?

74
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,280
I want her love.

75
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,000
But you already have Bai Lan's love.

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,080
Bai Lan?

77
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,039
She's only using me to make up

78
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,039
for the neglect she suffered
from your father.

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,360
How can someone who cares only
about their self-interest have any feelings?

80
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,439
How dare you deceive me?

81
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,479
Don't come any closer!

82
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,960
Try me if you dare.

83
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,159
Everything you did has been recorded
through the surveillance camera

84
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,719
and uploaded
to the company's computer.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,639
You've lost

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,800
this round.

87
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,000
Your time is running out.

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,080
The police are almost here.

89
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,990
You should give up now.

90
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,039
Protect her!

91
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,039
Li Qingfeng!

92
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,120
You haven't made your decision yet.

93
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,879
Give me Xiamo,

94
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,800
and I'll give you Chaya.

95
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,800
Let's see who's more important to you.

96
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,439
Save Chaya.

97
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,240
We shouldn't keep failing her.

98
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,400
Do you truly love Xiamo?

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,700
The one you love is nothing more
than a figment of your imagination!

100
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,110
Your provocation doesn't trigger me.

101
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,919
The decision lies
in Qi Chuan's hands now.

102
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,319
Chaya!

103
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,360
You betrayed me!

104
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,599
You said so yourself.

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,599
People who care only
about their self-interest have no feelings.

106
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,479
To bring Li Qingfeng to justice,

107
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,839
we have to play along with him
in this kidnapping

108
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,290
and obtain the most direct evidence.

109
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,519
But Li Qingfeng
has already lost his mind.

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,490
How could you be sure he'd trust you?

111
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,120
He's completely unhinged.

112
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,879
I discovered that he prepared sedatives.

113
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,439
But regardless of who he intended
to use them on,

114
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,800
I switched them out in advance.

115
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,879
Xiamo and Chaya don't know about this.

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
So we need to act quickly.

117
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,199
Why are you willing to help us?

118
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,800
Maybe Xiamo's kindness suddenly hit me.

119
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,600
It's time to put an end to this.

120
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,319
Once we step through this door,

121
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,439
we'll enter the devil's world.

122
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
Li Qingfeng, the police are almost here.

123
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,920
You're on your own now.

124
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,759
(Xiamo,)

125
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,759
(have you really never felt anything
for me?)

126
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,879
(Breaking news.)

127
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,000
(Li Qingfeng, a top executive
of Su Shide Group,)

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,319
(has been detained)

129
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,800
(on suspicion of cross-border crimes.)

130
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,279
What are you watching?

131
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,639
(Will the curse of the legendary jewel,)

132
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,439
(the Eye of Wucha, continue?)

133
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Let the past stay

134
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,199
in the past.

135
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,890
What are your plans for the future?

136
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:38,959
I

137
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,800
don't really have any business acumen.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,839
So I plan

139
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,990
to hand over the company
to professional consultants.

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,759
I am not talking

141
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,560
about these.

142
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,079
After that,

143
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,319
I'd like to pursue my dreams.

144
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,959
Maybe I'll start a world tour.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,720
Is there

146
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,500
no place for me in your future?

147
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,240
Maybe there is.

148
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,839
Maybe not.

149
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,439
Honestly, I haven't figured it out yet.

150
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,040
I think

151
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,079
I should sort myself out first.

152
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,399
A solo world tour is too dangerous.

153
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,360
Let me be your bodyguard from now on.

154
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,399
I can't afford a bodyguard
as expensive as you anymore.

155
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,439
I'm willing

156
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,200
to be my wife's bodyguard.

157
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,399
But I never agreed to be your wife.

158
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,759
But you've already sworn
before the gods.

159
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,600
I don't think the gods of Mangbei
have power over this place, right?

160
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,560
Xiamo,

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,560
the gods are all things in the universe.

162
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,720
They see everything.

163
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,900
No matter how long it takes,

164
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,519
I'm willing to wait

165
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,040

I've told you before

195
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,840
