00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,960
I picked a star.

00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,239

I have sinned.

No, wait.

19
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,040
I only made the same mistake

20
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,920
every woman makes.

21
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,239
But still, I have sinned.

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,719
You're up?

23
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,280
Uh...

24
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,519
Last night,

25
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,280
did we...

26
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,719
Who initiated it?

27
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:04,959
You.

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,280
Me?

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,920
That's impossible.

30
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,400
You even took off your own clothes.

31
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,520
Then what happened next?

32
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,919
Your fan broke down.

33
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,000
So I let you sleep in my room,

34
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,120
and I slept in yours.

35
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,680
That's it.

36
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,159
Oh, thank goodness.

37
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:29,800
Wait.

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,960
I was already in this state,

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,240
and you did nothing?

40
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,120
Nothing happened at all?

41
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,000
Am I...

42
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,520
Am I really that unappealing?

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,319
Okay.

44
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,000
Next time,

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,280
I will know what you expect of me.

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,280
There won't be a next time.

47
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:46,840
Get out.

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,680
I want to get dressed.

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,919
Remember to drink the water.

50
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,360
(Personal Profile)
(My immigration documents?)

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,000
(So he secretly prepared these for me.)

52
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,960
(Was he trying to surprise me?)

53
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,960
Should I also do something in return?

54
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:35,960
Qi Chuan.

55
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,599
Where is he?

56
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,080
Qi Chuan.

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,879
Qi,

58
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,000
it looks like

59
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,319
she was wearing hair extensions.

60
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,439
So

61
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,400
it wasn't her hair?

62
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,540
(Which DNA report is real?
Xiamo, who exactly are you?)

63
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,940
(Find the truth)

64
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:15,879
What are all these?

65
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,279
So you've been investigating me
all along?

66
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,279
You were the one
who had been lying to me.

67
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,319
You hid my identity documents.

68
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,519
I thought you were planning
to surprise me.

69
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
But now I see your kindness

70
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,040
was only to cover your ulterior motives.

71
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,120
You are keeping me here

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,680
to investigate whatever truth
you were looking for,

73
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,439
am I right?

74
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,879
Do you know

75
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,000
how important this is to me?

76
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,240
I've already told you

77
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
I have no connection to them.

78
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,639
Why won't you believe me?

79
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:51,959
Stop it!

80
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,800
If you're not Su Shide's daughter,

81
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,720
why are you so angry?

82
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
I'll never trust you again.

83
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:16,800
Let me go.

84
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,839
Qi?

85
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,639
Leave!

86
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,000
This time, the report is foolproof.

87
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,480
If I wanted to imprison or torture you,

88
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,439
I have a hundred ways to do it.

89
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,560
Why go the long way around?

90
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,600
Actually, this matter...

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,240
I said, leave.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,279
Okay.

93
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,600
It's not the right time
to send you away.

94
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:08,959
If you stay by my side,

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,759
I can protect you better.

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,160
We're only husband and wife in name.

97
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,240
Don't think of me as your husband.

98
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,720
I don't need you
to take responsibility for me.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,800
Then what were you expecting

100
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,600
when you stayed by my side,

101
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
eating my food, and sleeping in my bed?

102
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,399
Then why did you come back for me

103
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,959
after you left me in the street?

104
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,160
Because...

105
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,720
I couldn't bear it.

106
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,240
Liar.

107
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,319
You're lying.

108
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,279
If you want to leave,

109
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,160
I can let you go.

110
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,839
But if you want to stay...

111
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,040
Never mind.

112
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,720
Today,

113
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,080
I'll have Zheng take you away.

114
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:42,879
Qi,

115
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,600
the report results...

116
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,000
Chaya has already shown me.

117
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,720
Send Xiamo away.

118
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,120
After she gets on the ship,
give her these.

119
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,440
Let it be my farewell gift to her.

120
00:08:59,399 --> 00:08:59,879
Qi,

121
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:01,919
where are you going?

122
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:03,879
Don't forget.

123
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,919
If she wants to leave,
let her go quickly.

124
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,240
Mr. Jian, you're back.

125
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,480
How's the Eye of Wucha search going?

126
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,480
It was never lost.

127
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,960
It was all an act.

128
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,480
It's much easier than dealing

129
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,759
with that girl.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,879
I'll handle her myself.

131
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,720
(Jian Axin is back.)

132
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,440
(He's on his way to your place.)

133
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,240
(The Eye of Wucha has always been
in Jian Axin's hands.)

134
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,200
(He's the real culprit
behind the sinking incident.)

135
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
(He's been trying)

136
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,679
(to erase the evidence
of the shipwreck.)

137
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:49,919
Zheng,

138
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:51,720
has Xiamo left?

139
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,000
No.

140
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,440
She's still in the yard

141
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,840
saying goodbye to the plants.

142
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,559
What's going on with you two?

143
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,159
Hurry up and send her off.

144
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,720
Jian Axin is about to arrive soon.

145
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,440
In any case,

146
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,559
keep her safe.

147
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,399
I'll be right back.

148
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,039
Got it.

149
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,120
Time to go.

150
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:22,799
Come on.

151
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,759
Jian Axin is here to catch you.

152
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,840
If we delay any longer,
no one can save you.

153
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
I forgot something.

154
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:05,240
You...

155
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,799
What are you waiting for?

156
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,399
We have to go now.

157
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,320
Qi has offended Jian Axin

158
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,440
just to protect you.

159
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,879
If you don't leave now,

160
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,200
everyone will be finished.

161
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,159
But what will happen to you

162
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,039
after I leave?

163
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,840
That's not for you to worry about.

164
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,639
Just do what Qi says.

165
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,039
Leave now.

166
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,559
I'm thirsty.

167
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,080
(Qi Chuan,)

168
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,600
(I've made up my mind.)

169
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,919
(I'll face all of this myself.)

170
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,600
(I can't keep dragging you all down.)

171
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,960
You're driving me crazy.

172
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,799
Why do you want to drink tea

173
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,720
at a time like this?

174
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:03,720
Stop acting like a spoiled young lady.

175
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:05,919
I'm not leaving anymore.

176
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,200
I've caused

177
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,720
a lot of trouble for you these days.

178
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,960
Now that danger is upon us,

179
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
I can't just walk away.

180
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,120
From now on,
we'll face the difficulties together.

181
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,320
Whatever's hard to overcome,

182
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,440
I'll face it myself.
