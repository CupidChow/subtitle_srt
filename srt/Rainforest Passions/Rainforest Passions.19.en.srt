00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,140
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,620
This is the first time
I've heard you hit the wrong note.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,079
I've made many mistakes.

5
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,600
The worst of them

6
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,079
was twisting the nature
of our relationship.

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,799
I know

8
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:57,640
you came back with me
to make Qi Chuan give up.

9
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,100
Don't pressure yourself.

10
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,790
I'll give you time to sort it out.

11
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,140
(Flight Ticket)

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,519
Let's leave this place today.

13
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,439
We can go anywhere we want.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,450
You can also play

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
the piano on any stage you want.

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,800
What do you think?

17
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,780
(Pu Ba)

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,040
You should pack up.

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,319
I think this trip

20
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,200
will last a while.

21
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,040
I'll get going first.

22
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,340
(Flight Ticket)

23
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,680
Are you leaving with Li Qingfeng?

24
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,400
I never belonged here.

25
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:47,840
What about Qi Chuan?

26
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,480
Qi Chuan should be able to return

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,239
to the peaceful life he once had.

28
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,200
You've lost your courage.

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,879
Before, you told me to always be brave.

30
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,920
It turns out you can't do it yourself.

31
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,640
Sometimes,

32
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,760
if we only focus on being brave,

33
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,359
it may be

34
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,719
another form of selfishness.

35
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,560
Thinking back,

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,479
it seems like I've been the one clinging
to him all along.

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
Perhaps

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
giving up

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,800
is another kind of courage.

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,719
Qi.

41
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,400
Qi,

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
the General is here.

43
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,080
The truth is

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,479
the General was here

45
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,400
when you were sleeping.

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,159
He also met Miss Su.

47
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

48
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,990
I dare not cause more trouble
than it already is.

49
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,039
Uncle.

50
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,879
You look like you've recovered well.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,560
It seems you've finally resolved
your feelings about Qi Shan.

52
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,240
I wouldn't say it's resolved.

53
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,800
Jian Axin may have been arrested.

54
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,599
But I've paid a heavy price for it.

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,280
You mean that girl?

56
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,240
I know

57
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,560
you've met her.

58
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,159
She's not suitable for you.

59
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,879
You two

60
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,319
lack fate.

61
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,520
After this,

62
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,199
I will find a girl

63
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,759
who's more suitable for you.

64
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,080
Uncle,

65
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,080
I don't like being controlled by others.

66
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,159
I know you have deep feelings for her.

67
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,719
But what about her?

68
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,919
If she were truly certain about you,

69
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,120
how could she have wavered

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,759
because of my words?

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,280
The real obstacle between you isn't me.

72
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,719
It's her hesitation
and uncertainty about you.

73
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,159
Fortunately, the good thing about family

74
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,840
is that they'll never abandon you.

75
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,080
Join my unit,

76
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,759
and your world will be even broader.

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,360
(After the car explosion,)

78
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,120
(we narrowly escaped death.)

79
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,600
(I asked Xiamo the same question.)

80
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,000
(One Month Ago
Xiamo's arrival in Mangbei)

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,920
You just saved me.

82
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,360
I'll give you a chance to choose.

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,040
To the right from here

84
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,240
leads home.

85
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,560
Then

86
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
what about the left?

87
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,319
To the left

88
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
is the way you came.

89
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,920
Those who see you as an enemy

90
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,000
will make your life unbearable.

91
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,610
(I've given you a chance
to save yourself.)

92
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,399
(But you chose to stay)

93
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,959
(for your brother.)

94
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,120
She's never been one to compromise.

95
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,760
She's the type of person

96
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,690
who always pushes forward,
no matter how difficult the road is.

97
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,040
She never looks back

98
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,120
once she's made up her mind.

99
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,730
The only thing that makes her hesitate

100
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,040
is the harm it might cause others.

101
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,560
She's carefree on the surface.

102
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,639
But always protecting
other people's weaknesses.

103
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,319
I think

104
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,160
you must have used my weakness

105
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,519
to threaten her, right?

106
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,680
As your family,

107
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,380
I hope you can overcome
your inner demons

108
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,800
more than anyone else.

109
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,240
That girl will only drag you
into the abyss!

110
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,000
No,

111
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,759
it was precisely her

112
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,600
who saved me
from falling endlessly into the abyss.

113
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,100
Are you done talking?

114
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,430
Is there anything else
that you're hiding from me?

115
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,319
I...

116
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,279
When you were unconscious,

117
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,319
she asked me to prepare
many flowers and balloons.

118
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,990
She said she wanted
to give you a surprise.

119
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,160
I thought she wanted to...

120
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,879
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

121
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,360
Qi, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

122
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,319
What do we do now?

123
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,240
I'll do what you say.

124
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,560
No matter what you do,

125
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,319
bring her to the forest.

126
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,279
Okay.

127
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,430
I'll make sure to get it done.

128
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,380
(Qi Chuan)

129
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,590
I will pass your message on to her.

130
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,240
Whether she's going,

131
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,639
it's up to her.

132
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,710
Qi Chuan wants to see you
to bid a proper farewell

133
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,639
in the forest.

134
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,990
Zheng will come and pick you up.

135
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,360
I'm not going.

136
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm leaving with Li Qingfeng soon.

137
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,720
If we meet again,

138
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,480
it'll only drag things out.

139
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,959
It's important
to have a proper farewell.

140
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,040
If you don't go, you will regret it.

141
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,160
If you have other concerns,

142
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,680
I can go with you.

143
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,279
Then leave it to fate.

144
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,439
Heads for going,

145
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,199
and tails for not.

146
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,720
I've decided

147
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,079
to go.

148
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,040
Thank you, Chaya.

149
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,519
If I ever look back on this journey,

150
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,879
you'll be the person I remember most.

151
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,500
Well, one of the people.

152
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,160
Let's go.

153
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,879
I've prepared the thing for you.

154
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,200
You drive the car away.

155
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,399
Smart move.

156
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:40,720
Remember,

157
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,720
I don't want to see you again.

158
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,440
Sometimes,

159
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,320
fate makes the decisions for us.

160
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,919
You're utterly useless.

161
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,700
By the time you fix it,
it'll probably be nightfall.

162
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,000
Forget it.

163
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,039
Just drive Li Qingfeng's car.

164
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,919
I know where his keys are.

165
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,840
I'll just let him know later.

166
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,720
No other choice, then.

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,290
I can't believe you managed
to trick her into coming out.

168
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,240
It looks like Qi is going
to succeed this time.

169
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,850
If you two had fallen out
over what happened with Uncle,

170
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,200
I would feel guilty forever.

171
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,879
But I've never seen

172
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,990
Qi put so much effort
into doing something romantic.

173
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,759
What romantic thing is he up to?

174
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,399
Xiamo,

175
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,120
marry me.

176
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,000
Why should I marry you?

177
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,399
Does that seem a bit too casual?

178
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,279
I can't imagine

179
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,360
letting another man marry you.

180
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,580
If he's worse than me,

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,730
what would you do?

182
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,700
And if he's better than me,

183
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,600
what would I do?

184
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,080
Isn't that too cheesy?

185
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,960
Is he planning to propose?

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,960
You always mess things up.

187
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,039
So you already knew?

188
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,360
It was supposed
to be a surprise for you.

189
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,720
All this while,

190
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,399
you've been through so much together.

191
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,780
All that's left is this one small step.

192
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,360
You just need to sit back and enjoy it.

193
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,440
Zheng, stop the car for now.

194
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,080
Some things should be said face-to-face.

195
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,200
Even if there might be regrets,

196
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,879
you should give him a chance
to explain himself.

197
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,960
But

198
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,720
there are so many obstacles between us.

199
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,159
Qi Chuan has overcome them.

200
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,440
Think about it.

201
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,200
He's already so firm in choosing you.

202
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,600
Why are you still hesitating?

203
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,960
(If I agree to his proposal,)

204
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,039
(I will be a constant reminder for him)

205
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,279
(of that painful memory.)

206
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,890
(But if I leave him,)

207
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,360
(he'll feel lost,)

208
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,440
(and he might hate me.)

209
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,720
(But he'll recover from that someday.)

210
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,639
(Doing this is right.)

211
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
(It must be, right?)

212
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,320
If your mind is telling you

213
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,600
to be rational,

214
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,279
please listen to your heart

215
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,799
at least once.

216
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,279
(My heart?)

217
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,039
(But isn't life all
about unexpected encounters?)

218
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,120
Look

219
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,759
at the sunrise and fiery sky.

220
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,039
It's romantic,

221
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:32,679
isn't it?

222
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,799
I think

223
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,519
I already know the answer.

224
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,960
Excuse me, ladies!

225
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,840
Qi is getting really impatient.

226
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,600
Can't you guys talk in person?

227
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,159
Proposals are supposed
to be surprises for girls.

228
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,320
Now you've ruined it.

229
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,000
Well,

230
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,559
how about we save this surprise
for Qi Chuan?

231
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,039
Who's calling me now?

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,090
Oh, shoot! What do I do now?

233
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,720
Hello, Qi.

234
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,879
This situation just got a bit tricky.

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,879
Xiamo still refused to see you.

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,940
Then I'll go in person.

237
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,279
Oh, you don't have to.

238
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,000
I... I can take care of this.

239
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,200
Even if it costs me everything,

240
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,039
I'll see it through.

241
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,360
When you've succeeded,

242
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,679
you have to let me be the godfather
of your future kids.

243
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,440
Be quick.

244
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,759
I'll make sure to learn well from Qi.

245
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,240
Can you hear

246
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,559
that sound?

247
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,060
(Pu Ba)

248
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,759
Li Qingfeng,

249
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,820
where's your car?

250
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,600
Are you trying to mess with me?

251
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,799
This frequency

252
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,000
is identical to the one
on the day of the car explosion.

253
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,279
There's no way I'd mishear it.

254
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,679
My hearing is very sharp.

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,679
It's the sound of a countdown
and it's speeding up.

256
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,000
Xiamo.

257
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:43,900
Get in the car.

258
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:44,639
Time to go now.

259
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:45,639
Get out!

260
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,559
