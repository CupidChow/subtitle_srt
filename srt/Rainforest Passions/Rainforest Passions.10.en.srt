(Authoritative certified DNA report)

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,960
Xiamo,

5
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,600
is there anything else
you're hiding from me?

6
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:37,719
No.

7
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,439
Then what about your relationship

8
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,159
with Su Shide?

9
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,799
Didn't I explain it to you

10
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,719
several times already?

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,439
We have no relationship.

12
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:48,920
You better not lie to me

13
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,159
or I'll make things
very difficult for you.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,039
Where are you going?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,679
I thought you were taking me
to meet your uncle.

16
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:57,880
He won't be coming anymore.

17
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,200
Your attitude

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,799
sure changes faster
than the weather in Mangbei!

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,840
Are you seriously leaving me here alone?

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,000
I made a scene at your house

21
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,319
just to get Xiamo's hair.

22
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,439
She's completely deceived you.

23
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,239
Xiamo and Su Shide

24
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:34,960
(The parental authority probability)
are biologically related.

25
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:35,680
(calculated 99.9091%)
are biologically related.

26
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,000
How do I know

27
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,799
this report isn't fake?

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,120
You can check it yourself too.

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,040
Why would I lie to you?

30
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,799
It's just
that my father is returning soon,

31
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,840
and I don't want you
to have trouble with him

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,680
because of this fraud.

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,079
Have you ever thought

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
about why your father is so determined

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,159
to take her life?

36
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,200
You know

37
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:57,959
what my father is like.

38
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,159
Sometimes,

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,920
he doesn't need any reason

40
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,599
to like or hate someone.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
It's not without reason.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,439
Your father's role in all of this

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,280
may go beyond your understanding.

44
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,800
What do you mean?

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,439
Your father

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
is the seller behind Su Shide.

47
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,080
Before all the truths come to light,

48
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,680
please keep this matter

49
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,759
a secret for me.

50
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,400
You'd rather doubt my father

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,479
than suspect
that Xiamo has ulterior motives.

52
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,199
That's between me and her.

53
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:29,919
Whatever happens,

54
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,280
I'll handle it myself.

55
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,599
It's not for you to interfere.

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,599
Zheng,

57
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,520
double-check the DNA report

58
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,000
you gave me previously.

59
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,159
Verify the details.

60
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,319
Brother,

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
Su Shide's bid this time

62
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,439
is to deliver goods to Mangbei.

63
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,400
I heard

64
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,120
there will be a rare treasure
in this batch

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,159
called the Eye of Wucha.

66
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,520
I want to take this job.

67
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,919
Then do you know why

68
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,199
everyone is not willing
to take this job?

69
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,199
It's said that the seller's identity

70
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,039
has been kept secret,

71
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,199
and with the chaos in Mangbei,

72
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,919
everyone is worried about the Eye
of Wucha's questionable origins.

73
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,360
The risks for this escort
are just too high.

74
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,280
I won't let you go.

75
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,199
I don't care what you think.

76
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,120
I'm going.

77
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,080
If you don't go,

78
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:48,919
I'll go by myself.

79
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,719
You...

80
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,000
How about this?

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,039
If anyone's going, it should be me.

82
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,000
You're staying here.

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,960
The company can't run without you.

84
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,199
What?

85
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,759
Are you questioning my skills?

86
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,800
You, brat. I know you're taller
than I am now.

87
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,479
Brother,

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,560
I'll wait for your return.

89
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,080
Brat.

90
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,800
I've never met

91
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,160
such an unpredictable person.

92
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,079
Why does he treat me like this?

93
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,879
You've never been troubled

94
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,800
by a man like this before.

95
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,720
Don't tell me
you've actually liked him.

96
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,600
How is that possible?

97
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,680
To him,

98
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,759
there is only right and wrong.

99
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,600
But my life

100
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,040
is full of gray areas.

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,720
We're from completely different worlds.

102
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,439
You're lying.

103
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:16,839
Listen to this.

104
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,839
Aren't these two notes
constantly rising?

105
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,199
The Shepard's scale

106
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,680
goes back and forth
with just these two notes.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,199
In a repeated cycle,

108
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,600
it creates an illusion for the senses.

109
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,480
Some things can't be judged
just by feeling.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,879
Sometimes,

111
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,120
the feeling is just an illusion.

112
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:42,959
Xiamo,

113
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,399
you won't find anyone

114
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,480
who has stayed by your side longer

115
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,839
than I have in this world.

116
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,439
You're such a bad liar.

117
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,319
I'm hungry.

118
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,879
Let's grab something to eat.

119
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,399
Stop drinking.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,519
The person I like

121
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,560
is a savior who only belongs to me.

122
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,319
He will always appear

123
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,399
as long as I think of him

124
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,120
no matter where or when.

125
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,360
He will appear.

126
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,680
We've shared

127
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,079
so many incredible moments together.

128
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,199
Yet...

129
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,600
I've been with you for every second

130
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,000
and every moment for 25 years.

131
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,600
What does he have that I don't?

132
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,480
Tell me.

133
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,079
Qi Chuan,

134
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,439
you're so mean.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,839
Don't tell me
you've completely fallen for him.

136
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,199
This won't do, my dear sister.

137
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,759
Who does he think he is?

138
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,680
He's only...

139
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,560
He's only my bodyguard.

140
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,240
Then

141
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,959
if Qi Chuan really showed up here,

142
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,800
what would you say to him?

143
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,480
I'll tell him

144
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,920
he's not good enough for me.

145
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,439
He wants me to be his wife?

146
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,639
Only if the stars fell from the sky.

147
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,199
He's here.

148
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,759
Say that again.

149
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,920
Qi Chuan,

150
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,240
what took you so long to pick me up?

151
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,800
You're drunk.

152
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,680
Come,

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,639
I'll take you home.

154
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,040
Are you going with him

155
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,959
or me?

156
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,279
Stop it, Brother.

157
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,319
Let's go home.

158
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,000
Qi Chuan,

159
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,000
you can't do this to her.

160
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,759
You heard what she said earlier.

161
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,360
It's impossible between us

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,360
unless the stars fall from the sky.

163
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,120
Qi Chuan,

164
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,679
you must be nicer to me.

165
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,399
Is it because I'm your bodyguard?

166
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,080

get down from there.

Will you stay with me
for a little longer?

187
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,440
This isn't part of a bodyguard's job.

188
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,639
Mr. Bodyguard, look.

189
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,759
