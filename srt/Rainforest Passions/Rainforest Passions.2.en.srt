1
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:08,119
(Qi Chuan)

2
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:10,960
(a reliable bodyguard who navigates)

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,400
(between the underworld and law
in Mangbei,)

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,640
(almost got himself into trouble)

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,760
(because of a woman.)

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:24,920
(Brother,)

7
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:29,000
(I will find the culprit
who killed you.)

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,740
=Rainforest Passion=

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,700
=Episode 2=

10
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:37,479
Qi Chuan!

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,960
Where's the woman who ruined my wedding?

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,799
You better explain

13
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,039
about the Wucha wedding today.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,960
I want you and me

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,399
to receive the Wucha God's blessing.

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,200
It was supposed
to be me getting married today.

17
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,200
I should have been the bride
at this wedding.

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,479
If I were getting married,

19
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:02,960
shouldn't I know about it?

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,879
That's because you've never cared

21
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,280
about women.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,159
I spent so much time planning this

23
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,680
and finally convinced the elder

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,200
to bless my Wucha wedding.

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,200
So

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,840
you tampered with the welcome drink?

27
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,599
Who is

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,760
this woman?

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,840
I've never seen her before.

30
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,280
She's my hostage.

31
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,799
Thanks to today's farce,

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,799
I now have a legitimate excuse
to keep her,

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,560
resolving a trouble of mine.

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,640
You better not fall in love with her.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,920
Don't forget

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,599
that I'm Jian Axin's daughter.

37
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,239
I know what she looks like now.

38
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,120
But this is just a custom.

39
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,520
There's no need to be serious about it.

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,840
You underestimate the significance
of this wedding.

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,759
Here,

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
no one can defy
the will of the Wucha God.

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
That won't do.

44
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,000
I still have to find Li Qingfeng.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
The organization Li Qingfeng is with

46
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,039
has been hunting for you.

47
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,280
If you go to them now,

48
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,919
you're walking right into their trap.

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,240
I don't get it.

50
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,039
Why are they targeting me?

51
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,360
You shouldn't ask me this question.

52
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,080
You're Su Shide's daughter.

53
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,719
You can call and ask him.

54
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,879
He wouldn't abandon you.

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
He's ill

56
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:03,919
and has been in a coma for a long time.

57
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,199
Wait a minute.

58
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,639
First, I get kidnapped,

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,439
and now this bizarre wedding.

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,840
You...

61
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,840
Don't tell me
you're captivated by my appearance.

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,960
You've just given me a new idea.

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,280
You've offended the region's
most powerful tycoon,

64
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,439
ruined the wedding of Watupa's heiress,

65
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,599
and deceived the sacred Wucha God.

66
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,400
If you're walking down the streets
of Mangbei right now,

67
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,719
at least three factions

68
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,639
would kill you on sight.

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,879
Do you think you have any way out?

70
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,560
Stop it.

71
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,800
I... I didn't mean it like that.

72
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,039
Fine, I'll tell you the truth.

73
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,840
I'm not Su Shide's daughter.

74
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm an impostor.

75
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,240
Su Shide's mistress wanted

76
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,960
a bigger share of the inheritance.

77
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,479
So she made me pose as his daughter.

78
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,800
She even promised
to help me find Li Qingfeng.

79
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,000
I know

80
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,639
I'm a terrible person.

81
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,040
I shouldn't have lied.

82
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,160
But...

83
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
But threatening me

84
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,560
won't help you

85
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,720
with whatever you're trying to do.

86
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,720
At least you finally told the truth.

87
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,079
Which part?

88
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,959
That you're a terrible person.

89
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,839
Well, what do you expect me to do?

90
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,480
For now, being the Wucha bride

91
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,000
can temporarily keep you safe.

92
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,279
If you want to stay alive,

93
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,160
stick with me and behave

94
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,199
until I've figured everything out.

95
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,480
Without my permission,
you're not allowed to go anywhere.

96
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,439
She said she was an impostor.

97
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,839
There are indeed rumors back home

98
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,560
that Chairman Su Shide

99
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,399
recently found his long-lost daughter.

100
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,920
But whether it's true or not

101
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,399
is still unclear.

102
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,480
She's as stubborn as ever.

103
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,160
But we should verify it.

104
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,720
That's easy.

105
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,480
A strand of her hair will do.

106
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,120
I'll have my friends back home
to run a DNA test

107
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,639
to see if she's related to Su Shide.

108
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,759
But how did Su Xiamo

109
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
end up becoming your wife?

110
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,879
All thanks to Chaya.

111
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,000
Do you really think

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,879
I'd willingly marry my enemy's daughter?

113
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,319
Anyway,

114
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:50,920
she's the best hostage

115
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,079
to help crack the shipwreck case.

116
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,600
Li Qingfeng wants to send her away,

117
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,920
Jian Axin wants her dead,

118
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,560
and you clearly hate her.

119
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,920
Yet, you married her by accident.

120
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:00,759
Qi,

121
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,399
this has at least proven two things.

122
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,120
Look.

123
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:03,720
First,

124
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,360
Li Qingfeng doesn't want her.

125
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,000
Second,

126
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,839
you want her.

127
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,040
Shut up.

128
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,279
You can deal

129
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,199
with the woman you married yourself.

130
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,480
I'm heading back.

131
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Don't panic.

132
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,040
It's just a burst pipe.

133
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,199
Stay inside for now.

134
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,399
What did you say?

135
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,879
I said, stay inside for now.

136
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,600
Fine,

137
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,360
I'll go back inside.

138
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,079
Get out.

139
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,480
Are you guys

140
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,000
actually serious about this?

141
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,759
Get out.

142
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,560
Okay.

143
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,079
You know,

144
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,600
if you really wanted
to make this official,

145
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,360
I'm fine with it.

146
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,439
I'll go and shut off the main pipe.

147
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,959
(What's wrong with me?)

148
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,959
(Why am I distracted
by his looks at a time like this?)

149
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,920
(Settling scores with Li Qingfeng
is more important.)

150
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,700
(Historic Titanic Tragedy,
Su Shide's Priceless Jewels Lost in the Wreck)

151
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,900
(Return Journey)

152
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,920
(Brother,)

153
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,879
(Find the truth)

154
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,079
(I will soon uncover)

155
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,079
(Has a daughter?)

156
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,680
(Xiamo, Su Shide's long-lost daughter. Unverified)
(the truth behind the shipwreck.)

157
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,240
Stop right there.

158
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,840
I've already explained everything.

159
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,279
You've seen what kind of person.

160
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,679
I am useless except
for my beautiful face.

161
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,919
Yesterday's misunderstanding

162
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,000
was my fault.

163
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,320
But you have no right
to restrict my freedom.

164
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,559
So

165
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,320
you were the one captivated
by appearances.

166
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,320
I wasn't.

167
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,759
I just don't understand

168
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,559
why you insist on keeping me here.

169
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,080
Before I figure things out,

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,639
just think of it

171
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,240
as me fulfilling a husband's duties.

172
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,639
Husband?

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,279
Then why don't you look

174
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,679
at what your "wife" used

175
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,639
to wash her hair last night?

176
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,480
When I showered yesterday,
all I had was a bar of soap.

177
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,720
Even if I'm seeking refuge,

178
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,919
I'd prefer to stay with a decent family.

179
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,600
If you want to blame someone,

180
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,720
blame the Wucha God

181
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,080
for not pairing you
with a wealthy household.

182
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,559
If you stay here, I can provide you food

183
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,360
and ensure your safety.

184
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,039
If you still can't come around,

185
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,679
just think of yourself
as a little housemaid seeking refuge.

186
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,799
I bought what you asked for, Qi.

187
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,799
Sorry about that.

188
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,919
Are you okay?

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,279
Qi asked me to buy
these clothes for you.

190
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,240
There are more here.

191
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,200
Uh...

192
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,360
Thank you.

193
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,279
I have a delivery to make.

194
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,240
Teach her how to be
a proper little housemaid.

195
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,759
A...

196
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,240
A housemaid?

197
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,440
Watch her closely
and don't let her escape.

198
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,840
Qi,

199
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,799
the snake is out of the hole.

200
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,360
This place is so lively.

201
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,679
Li Qingfeng,

202
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,879
where should I go to find you?

203
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,519
Are you sure this plan works?

204
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,039
To gain someone's trust,

205
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,039
the first step
is to let them dig their own grave.

206
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,159
Chaya's men have already tracked
her movements.

207
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,600
Don't forget

208
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,279
I'm Jian Axin's daughter.

209
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,759
I know what she looks like now.

210
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,840
(You've offended the region's
most powerful tycoon,)

211
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,559
(ruined the wedding
of Watupa's heiress,)

212
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,759
(and deceived the sacred Wucha God.)

213
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,759
(If you're walking down the streets
of Mangbei right now,)

214
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,440
(at least three factions)

215
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,320
(would kill you on site.)

216
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:21,960
(Do you think)

217
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,519
(you have any way out?)

218
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,080
Let me go!

219
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,480
I don't know you people.

220
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,480
Let me go!

221
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,399
What are you planning to do to me?

222
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,519
Please!

223
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:43,080
I don't know any of you people!

224
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,320
Is there anyone

225
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,440
who can save me?

226
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,159
Xiamo.

227
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,639
Wake up! Stop sleeping!

228
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,159
You brat! Stop right there!

229
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:21,960
Who are you?

230
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,279
Why...

231
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,919
Why are you here?

232
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,360
Are you still going to run?

233
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:46,919
Could it be

234
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,879
that you sent them to kidnap me?

235
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,879
Would you believe it

236
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
if I stabbed you right now?

237
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,200
I... I was only kidding.

238
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,879
If you save me this time,

239
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:57,799
I promise.

240
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,519
I promise I won't run again.
