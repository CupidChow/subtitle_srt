3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,879
Do you hear...

4
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:22,879
Do you hear that noise?

5
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:24,640
What noise?

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,920
Get out!

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,760
There's a bomb!

8
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,560
I heard the sound of a countdown.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,000
How did you get out alive
from that explosion?

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,200
I... I told him to save them.

11
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:45,880
Who is he?

12
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,320
Li Qingfeng.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,799
You've finally remembered.

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,759
Get out.

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,239
(Why are there always
some blurry memories?)

16
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,439
(There was blood
from a fourth person at the scene.)

17
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,980
(Did you ever consider
there might be other possibilities?)

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,439
(What exactly had happened back then?)

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,960
I used to love hearing
you play the piano.

20
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,639
Do you know what was on my mind

21
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,840
when you were playing the piano?

22
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,240
I thought

23
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,439
I would forgive you

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,439
for everything you've done to me

25
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,680
because of this one moment.

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,240
I can still play

27
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,840
for you now.

28
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,280
I don't want to hear this piece.

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,960
I want to hear

30
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,800
the first piece you ever played for me.

31
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:47,680
You said

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
you only played it for me.

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,240
You clearly know
I don't remember anything.

34
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,240
It's okay.

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,840
I can teach you.

36
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,120
That's enough.

37
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,919
The things you wish to remember
are what I want to forget.

38
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,730
If you think that won't be enough
to ease your hatred,

39
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,900
then I'll destroy these hands.

40
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,400
We'll be even.

41
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,120
Right?

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,280
If you dare do that,

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,400
I guarantee you'll regret it.

44
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,360
Qi Chuan,

45
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,520
we can no longer go back.

46
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
I want to start over with you.

47
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,319
If that means

48
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,199
you'll let me go,

49
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,920
then I will do it willingly.

50
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,480
Sometimes, I really can't understand.

51
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,040
Do you not want to let me go,

52
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,639
or do you not want to let yourself go?

53
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,639
You brought yourself

54
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,399
into this mess.

55
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,639
Do you know how happy this makes me,

56
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,240
my little plaything?

57
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,240
What is it
that you're still unsatisfied with?

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,680
I should be the one in pain.

59
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,279
A plaything's duty

60
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,680
is to please its master.

61
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,319
I can't do that.

62
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
You don't lack women.

63
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,319
Why won't you let me go?

64
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,879
I only want to see you

65
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,639
do everything to make me happy.

66
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,759
I'm done playing.

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,519
Qi Chuan feels invincible

68
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,439
because he has the evidence
to short-sell Su Shide.

69
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,160
Be patient for now.

70
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,360
Take this opportunity

71
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,040
and find the evidence.

72
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,199
I really don't want to wait any longer.

73
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,399
Once the funds are in,

74
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,279
we'll empty out this company

75
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,800
and leave together,

76
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:15,720
okay?

77
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,839
Anything you say.

78
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:28,800
You're back.

79
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,920
I've copied all the data

80
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,870
from Qi Chuan's phone as you instructed.

81
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,630
I'm not sure
if there really is the evidence

82
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,360
you claim of Qi Chuan shorting
the company.

83
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,079
But I saw this.

84
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,199
I can explain.

85
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,759
It's all Qi Chuan's doing.

86
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,250
He is using you to take revenge on me.

87
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,319
Stop arguing.

88
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,720
I'm doing all this for you.

89
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,639
I have no other choice.

90
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:02,839
Li Qingfeng,

91
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,000
sometimes

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,879
I really don't know

93
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,120
if you are telling the truth or lying.

94
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,879
You don't want
to tell me the truth, huh?

95
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,439
Fine.

96
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,639
From now on, we go our separate ways
and walk on our own paths.

97
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,700
Everything I've done for you is sincere.

98
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,040
We grew up together.

99
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,959
For twenty years,

100
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,990
I took care of you day and night

101
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,279
when you were sick.

102
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,879
When we were in Mangbei,
I risked my life to protect you.

103
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,199
You're the most important person
to me in this world.

104
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,120
Why would I want to harm you?

105
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,879
Then I'll give you one last chance

106
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,439
to tell me everything you know.

107
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,399
(Bai Lan said)

108
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,839
(you were not
the Chairman's birth daughter.)

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,950
(At that time,
the Chairman was critically ill.)

110
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,279
(She only wanted to use you)

111
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,959
(to obtain more of Su Shide's shares.)

112
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,690
(After you came back
from the accident in Mangbei,)

113
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,450
(I didn't want you
to be traumatized again.)

114
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,959
(So I had to use this method)

115
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,959
(to delay Bai Lan.)

116
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,439
(It turns out)

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,680
(that none of this was ever
my business.)

118
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,519
I'll take you away.

119
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,800
You don't have to forgive me.

120
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,639
But you shouldn't become his tool
to get back at me.

121
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,120
You really overestimate yourself.

122
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,500
You're not worthy to be my opponent.

123
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,279
Let me go.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,919
You won't win her heart
by using these methods.

125
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,159
Listen here.

126
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,159
No one knows her weaknesses
better than I do.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
I don't need to know her weaknesses.

128
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,120
You do have a lot of dirt on me.

129
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,710
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

130
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,480
The gift you gave to Pu Ba

131
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,600
is now in my hands.

132
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,039
Relax.

133
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,440
Don't worry.

134
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,990
I'll settle the scores

135
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,000
