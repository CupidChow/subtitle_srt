00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,340
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,000
I can no longer escape.

4
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,239
Just leave.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,640
Trying to create a diversion, huh?

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,079
So, why aren't you escaping anymore?

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,800
We had an agreement.

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:32,840
I'm taking her with me.

9
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,320
But Miss Su and I

10
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,920
haven't finished our business yet.

11
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,920
Whatever business you're discussing,

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,960
I'll be the one protecting
and escorting the goods in the end.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,679
Ah, yes.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,479
That's right.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,679
Because your uncle is General Ganchang,

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,240
and you are

17
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,520
the most reliable escort in Mangbei.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,320
That's why

19
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,799
you can go anywhere unimpeded here.

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:57,640
However,

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,200
until this deal is finalized,

22
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,719
Miss Su cannot leave

23
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,640
my sight

24
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,480
under any circumstances.

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,799
I'm fine with that.

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,799
To be safe,

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,599
I'll stay here

28
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,879
and help you watch this mysterious

29
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,200
and incredibly high-net-worth woman.

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,239
How about this?

31
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,359
This black card will serve as a deposit.

32
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
I represent my father

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,920
to show a little sincerity
regarding the Eye of Wucha.

34
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,159
Under this roof,

35
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,760
you'll be my most honored guest.

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,439
Qi Chuan,

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,879
take good care of her for me.

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,800
Jian Axin is the true culprit
behind the shipwreck case.

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,080
You shouldn't have dragged
Xiamo into this.

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,879
Jian Axin still doesn't know

41
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,120
your relationship with Xiamo, right?

42
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,039
I warn you.

43
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,479
Don't you dare say a word.

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,639
Otherwise, we all die together.

45
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,439
If it weren't for you,

46
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,520
would Jian Axin

47
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,879
have targeted Xiamo?

48
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,080
I am

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,199
the one protecting Xiamo here.

50
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,439
And I despise

51
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,400
people telling me what to do.

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,759
(So many surveillance cameras.)

53
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,199
(Where could the Eye of Wucha be?)

54
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,520
Miss Su,

55
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,599
how are you settling

56
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,800
these past two days?

57
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,000
Pretty well.

58
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,480
You know,

59
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,680
you can't eat and drink for free here.

60
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,439
This is the card you gave me.

61
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,959
There haven't been
any new funds deposited.

62
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,360
Cross-border transactions

63
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,120
can sometimes be delayed.

64
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:43,480
Ah, right.

65
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,680
Delayed.

66
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,439
Delayed, huh?

67
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,360
But even delays

68
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,800
should have time limits, shouldn't they?

69
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,360
(Only patrols are set up here.)

70
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,839
(Could it be...)

71
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
There's a transaction made to the card.

72
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,620
(Money Transfer Receipt)

73
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,639
Miss Su, you indeed kept your word.

74
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,639
You even managed
to find such a hidden place.

75
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,040
I'd like to hear

76
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,560
what excuse you'll come up with.

77
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:01,839
Father,

78
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,439
it's a misunderstanding.

79
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,319
I asked him to help me retrieve

80
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,720
the necklace Mother left me.

81
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,600
That's the dowry
your mother left for you.

82
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,079
Didn't you say

83
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,040
you'd only wear it

84
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,480
on the day you get married?

85
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,360
Qi Chuan proposed to me.

86
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,600
And I agreed.

87
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,680
Is that true, Qi Chuan?

88
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,720
Have you finally come around?

89
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,199
There's no need to be shy at this time.

90
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,319
Father will find out sooner or later.

91
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,480
Yes.

92
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,480
Originally,

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,079
I wanted to surprise everyone.

94
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,240
Congratulations.

95
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,959
After all the twists and turns,

96
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,079
you've finally found your bride.

97
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,839
Oh, right.

98
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,959
Go retrieve that necklace.

99
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,560
(Here's the key to the secret room.)

100
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,600
A few days from now,
at the bonfire party,

101
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,720
it'll also be the day the Eye of Wucha
will make its reappearance.

102
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,040
At that time,

103
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,000
I will announce

104
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,839
your engagement to everyone.

105
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,040
Miss Su,

106
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,560
I hope

107
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,920
our deal

108
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
can proceed smoothly then.

109
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,319
All right, then.

110
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,000
Qi Chuan,

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,120
come and pick for me.

112
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,600
In a few days, we'll be engaged.

113
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,360
Which dress
do you think suits me better?

114
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,399
Chaya,

115
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
thank you for helping me out.

116
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,439
But I can't marry you.

117
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,920
There's surveillance here.

118
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,120
Be careful what you say.

119
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,840
I know everything about your plans.

120
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,080
I'm willing to help you.

121
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,879
Isn't that enough?

122
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,440
Xiamo.

123
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,879
Qi Chuan!

124
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,759
Can you turn around and look at me?

125
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,159
I'm the one who has always loved you.

126
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,759
Don't push me away.

127
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,600
Give me a chance.

128
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,679
I'm willing to give you

129
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,320
everything you want.

130
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,200
If it weren't for Xiamo,

131
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,159
I would already have been
your Wucha bride.

132
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,919
This has nothing to do with Xiamo,

133
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,279
or with anyone else.

134
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,000
Be honest with me.

135
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,120
Have you

136
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,840
really fallen in love with her?

137
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,960
She is

138
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,440
vain, arrogant,

139
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,200
and frivolous.

140
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,440
Not to mention,
she's Su Shide's daughter.

141
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,759
She thought she was clever.

142
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,279
But other people can see
through her easily.

143
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,519
How could I possibly
fall in love with her?

144
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,639
Do you want me to beat him up for you?

145
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,480
He's right.

146
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,320
It's not wise to beat up
your boss' future son-in-law.

147
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,320
Let's go.

148
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
I’ve asked myself
that question countless times.

149
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,200
But the truth is,

150
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,480
I'm like a madman obsessing

151
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,000
