3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,160
It's a lighter.

4
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,759
Qi,

5
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,159
do you know

6
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,119
how many people came after that?

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,200
Good thing I've got some skills.

8
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,280
One left hook

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,000
and a right kick.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,560
If it weren't for me...

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,359
Did you contact Uncle?

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,799
So you already knew?

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,759
If it weren't for General Ganchang,

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,000
I might not have made it back.

15
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:51,799
Seriously,

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,479
I went all out for you.

17
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,399
But you abandoned me for a hostage.

18
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,119
You...

19
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,240
Don't tell me

20
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,560
you've fallen for Xiamo?

21
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,239
What happened, Qi Chuan!

22
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,519
(Do you still remember,)

23
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,400
(Xiamo?)

24
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,519
Xiamo, are you okay?

25
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:31,920
I'm coming in.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,959
The electrical wiring here

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,680
is bad.

28
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,879
So power outages happen all the time.

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,560
Scary things keep happening one
after another.

30
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,840
A blackout

31
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,879
isn't even a big deal anymore.

32
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,040
Take this.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,400
You might need it.

34
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,159
No, thanks.

35
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,120
(You don't remember, do you?)

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,520
(I didn't expect
this straightforward guy)

37
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,479
(is actually that thoughtful.)

38
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,599
(I never imagined)

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,199
(the woman who pulled me back)

40
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,280
(from the edge of death three years ago
with a single melody)

41
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,159
(would end up being my wife.)

42
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:43,759
Dad.

43
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,240
Mom.

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,639
Go in peace.

45
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,759
I will find Qingfeng

46
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,319
and bring him to you guys.

47
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,919
It's a lighter.

48
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,360
(Xiamo,)

49
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,639
(have you truly forgotten?)

50
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,120
(Mastermind? Accomplice?)

51
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,959
Pu Ba.

52
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,600
Shipwreck case.

53
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,079
Jian Axin.

54
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,600
Pu Ba.

55
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,199
Su Shide.

56
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,360
Also...

57
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,980
(Xiamo, from Licheng.
Su Shide's long-lost daughter. Unverified)

58
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,040
(She was the girl
who saved me from my despair.)

59
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,600
(But if she's also)

60
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,800
(the daughter of my enemy,)

61
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,720
(could I still hate her?)

62
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,439
Do you hear that?

63
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,000
Could it be yesterday's
patrol soldiers coming back?

64
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,439
I'll go and check it out.

65
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,560
Now that they're here,

66
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,120
I can't hide here like a coward.

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,519
Xiamo,

68
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,480
what are you doing?

69
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,480
I just told them you're ill.

70
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,199
I thought you were in danger.

71
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,279
So,

72
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,519
is that why you tried
to save me with a turner?

73
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,040
Since you've saved me so many times,

74
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,000
I thought
I should finally return the favor.

75
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,079
They heard I got married.

76
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,720
So they are here
to give us our blessings.

77
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,480
I was worried
you wouldn't be used to this.

78
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,800
Congratulations to you.

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,959
(This is their tradition.)

80
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,920
(Just go along with it.)

81
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,720
(If you don't want them to realize)

82
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,079
(we've deceived the Wucha God,)

83
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,800
(you'd better act the part.)

84
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,360
Okay.

85
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,920
Congratulations.

86
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,240

89
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:19,920
Thank you.

90
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,639
Take good care of her.

91
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,399
Blessings to you both.

92
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
May you be together forever

93
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,959
and be happy.

But I wasn't pretending.

101
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,959
I felt their sincerity.

102
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,800

How could it be cursed?

114
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,559
You know why.

115
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,799
She wasn't lying.

116
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,639
She's not Su Shide's daughter.

117
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,279
