=Episode 21=

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,560
Do you really not remember anything?

4
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,399
Are we close?

5
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,600
There was a woman
who was allergic to this juice.

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
She was very good at acting
and deceiving people.

7
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,920
If she wanted to,

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,560
she could use her eyes
to mesmerize people.

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,200
She sounds impressive.

10
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,319
Is she someone you like?

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,280
No.

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,990
She is someone I will never let go of

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,519
as long as I'm alive.

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,159
That's scary.

15
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,519
Good thing I'm not her.

16
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,280
Now, please move aside.

17
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,359
You're in my way.

18
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,760
A person can pretend to forget.

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
But their body

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,959
can't possibly remain unaffected.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,090
I've been patient
for the sake of the collaboration.

22
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,079
So don't push it.

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,719
If you just be honest with me,

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,439
I can trust you.

25
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,959
If you keep bothering me,

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,799
I won't show you mercy.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,560
Why push yourself to drink it
when you know you're allergic?

28
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,080
I just can't stand
his arrogant attitude.

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,670
I don't want him to have the upper hand.

30
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,280
I can't stand him either.

31
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,879
He used to pursue you.

32
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,639
But as you can see now,

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,319
he's just not someone women like.

34
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,719
But I really don't understand

35
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,879
why he has such hostility toward me.

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Did I forget some memory

37
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,639
when I was in Mangbei?

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Why can't I remember anything
after all these medical treatments?

39
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,240
I...

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,960
Take it slow. No rush.

41
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,000
The doctor said

42
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,159
selective amnesia

43
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,960
is a defense mechanism by the body.

44
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,400
Maybe you can't recall

45
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,520
some memories because

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,260
they just aren't necessary
to be remembered.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,110
Take your medicine first.

48
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,000
This contract

49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,280
is my gift to you as a greeting.

50
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,840
Five hundred million?

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,319
Mr. Qi, you are really generous.

52
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,690
That's because you're worth that much.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,879
Please show some respect to my fiancée.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,350
As you said, she's only your fiancée
and not married yet.

55
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,719
From what I know about Miss Su,

56
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,400
there's nothing money can't solve.

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,240
If there is,

58
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,599
it only means the money is not enough.

59
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,960
Qingfeng,

60
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,840
are you okay?

61
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,599
Don't forget.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,639
You were never my match in Mangbei.

63
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,759
That's enough.

64
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,040
No matter what grudges you had before,

65
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,920
can you accept my apology?

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,680
Sure.

67
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,120
If you want to apologize to me,

68
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,800
come to my villa tonight.

69
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,040
You...

70
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:28,879
Let it go.

71
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:29,959
Let it go.

72
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,279
Let's go.

73
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,980
(Licheng, One Year Ago.
Bai Lan, Su Shide's Second Wife)

74
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,040
You don't need to pretend

75
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,439
to be Su Shide's daughter here.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,439
But you haven't kept your promise yet.

77
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,319
I have found the person
you asked me to find.

78
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,319
Where is he?

79
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,399
Mangbei.

80
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,879
Su Shide has already amended the will.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,199
Go and find your brother now.

82
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,199
You don't need to pretend
to be Su Shide's daughter anymore.

83
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,959
Don't worry.

84
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,480
I'm also sick
of your fake stepmother act.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,530
(Mangbei)
The woman I mentioned to you

86
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,110
should have already arrived in Mangbei.

87
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,560
I'll leave the rest up to you.

88
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:37,920
Got it.

89
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,959
That investment
was the company's lifeline.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,519
You ruined such
an important negotiation.

91
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,700
How am I supposed to keep
the board members in check?

92
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,480
Do you know who that investor is?

93
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,240
I don't care.

94
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,959
Even if he's a demon,

95
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,279
he's the only one who can help us.

96
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,560
He's Jian Axin's successor.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,920
Trust me.

98
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,680
They definitely have ulterior motives.

99
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,160
Don't forget

100
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,639
the promise you made to me back then.

101
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,519
After the chairman passed away,

102
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,199
you asked me to keep Xiamo's
fake heiress identity hidden.

103
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,279
You said you would use her feelings

104
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,480
to cash out the shares

105
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,319
and take me away from here.

106
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,240
Li Qingfeng,

107
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,839
my patience is running out.

108
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,600
She's about to marry me.

109
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,279
Our plan has never changed.

110
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,800
You're being too insecure.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,319
I brought a cup of coffee for you.

112
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,480
I just overheard
that you seemed to be arguing.

113
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,439
Is it about the investment?

114
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,759
So what if it is?

115
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,360
You and Mr. Li ruined the deal anyway.

116
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,279
Ms. Bai is in a bad mood.

117
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,399
Don't take it to heart.

118
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,600
Wait for me outside.

119
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,399
Go.

120
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,839
I can't stand it anymore.

121
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,000
Sometimes, I really don't know

122
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,279
who you truly care about.

123
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,879
She has a head injury.

124
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,240
Why must you be so petty with her?

125
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,319
Hello?

126
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:53,839
Mr. Qi,

127
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,399
I'd like to have a talk with you.

128
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,920
If I'm not mistaken,

129
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,839
you should be at my door now.

130
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,560
Is anyone home?

131
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,240
Hello?

132
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,279
If you've really lost your memory,

133
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,560
at least pretend to be a little afraid.

134
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,919
Compared to that,

135
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
what I fear more

136
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,759
is you.

137
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,600
At least fear

138
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,559
keeps people alert.

139
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,159
Have you figured out your opening line?

140
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,159
I hope

141
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,039
you'll proceed with the investment
in the Su Shide Group.

142
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,160
Going back on your decision

143
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,399
will cost you something.

144
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:07,720
Tell me

145
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
what you want.

146
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,360
Leave Li Qingfeng,

147
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,720
come to me,

148
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,360
and work as my personal assistant.

149
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,580
Twenty-four hours a day,
unconditionally, and without limits.

150
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,600
If all you want is to humiliate me,

151
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,200
then I've truly overestimated you before.

152
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,480
Has Li Qingfeng mentioned Zheng to you?

153
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,120
Zheng?

154
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Excuse me, ladies!

155
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,639
Qi is getting really impatient.

156
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,600
Can't you guys talk in person?

157
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,720
Zheng...

158
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:46,759
Yes.

159
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,879
How's Zheng?

160
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,360
He's dead.

161
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,360
What...

162
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,240
Dead?

163
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,039
Get in the car.

164
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:01,679
Time to go now.

165
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,559
Get out!

166
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,480
There's a bomb!

167
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,639
Then...

168
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,840
Then what about Chaya?

169
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,879
You clearly remember them.

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,360
But you don't remember me.

171
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,279
I...

172
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,950
So you're still pretending
to be innocent.

173
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,440
Did Li Qingfeng tell you to do this?

174
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,360
No.

175
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,919
No, it wasn't.

176
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,399
Li Qingfeng saved me.

177
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,919
He was helping me to regain my memories.

178
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:37,840
Yes,

179
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,080
I'll go and ask him.

180
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,200
I'll ask him.

181
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,559
Miss Chaya,

182
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,039
let's take a break here.

183
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,000
Slowly.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,679
Chaya...

185
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,360
Chaya.

186
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,919
You should fight for your own happiness,

187
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,039
not get stuck in this mess.

188
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:05,799
Where's Chaya?

189
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,720
Tell me where Chaya is.

190
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,600
Why aren't you pretending anymore?

191
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,279
You still remember,

192
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,000
don't you?

193
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,720
I...

194
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,919
Why has she become like this?

195
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,879
I'll ask you one more time.

196
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,600
On the day of the car accident,

197
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,200
what exactly did you see?

198
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,360
I can't remember.

199
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,679
I really can't remember.

200
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,200
Please

201
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,120
take me to Chaya.

202
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,360
Please?

203
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,720
I told you

204
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,720
I'll make you remember soon.

205
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,440
You will meet Chaya.

206
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,440
I'll also complete the investment
in the Su Shide Group.

207
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,000
But before that,

208
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,440
you need to tell Li Qingfeng

209
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,340
that you're leaving him

210
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:14,960
to come to me.

211
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,919
I'll think about it.

212
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,120
Then I'll take my leave now.

213
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,200
What are you doing?

214
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,200
Put me down!

215
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,159
Put me down!

216
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:34,799
Walk forward.
