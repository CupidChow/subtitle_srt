=Episode 23=

3
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,390
It looks like

4
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:36,280
the Wucha God

5
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,240
wants you to stay again.

6
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,359
Hey, kid.

7
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,000
What's is it, mister?

8
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,200
Can you lend me

9
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,959
your bubble machine for a while?

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,319
Sure.

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,079
Thanks.

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,350
I'll give it back to you later.

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,799
Can't I just be left alone for a while?

14
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,519
Do I no longer have the right
to walk on my own?

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,680
I don't like seeing you look gloomy.

16
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,400
I want my little plaything to be happy.

17
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,400
Can you just let me go?

18
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,490
It's also letting yourself go.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,799
Thanks.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,610
You're welcome.

21
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,359
How is that possible?

22
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,199
The world is filled
with too many distracting noises.

23
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,120
You only need to listen to one.

24
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,479
But now I regret it.

25
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,080
I can no longer return

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,599
to the safe haven I know.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,760
Just forget about the safe haven
he created.

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,759
My black castle

29
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,520
will be completed soon.

30
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,280
Chaya.

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,360
Be careful.

32
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,800
I was planning to show off

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,879
my recovery.

34
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,060
Your shoelace is undone.

35
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,400
Be careful not to trip.

36
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,439
Xiamo!

37
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,120
Can you go

38
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,439
and buy me a bottle of water?

39
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,560
Okay.

40
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,120
It's been a while.

41
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,759
I finally get to see you.

42
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,639
Do you know how worried I was?

43
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,700
You were worried about me?

44
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,610
You've always been
under Li Qingfeng's control.

45
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,680
He's been blocking me
from contacting you.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,540
It wasn't until I saw
the engagement news

47
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,659
between you two on the media

48
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,539
that I realized something was wrong.

49
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:04,460
Li Qingfeng

50
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,740
may be a little overprotective.

51
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:08,620
But he's really nice to me.

52
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,740
We have a great understanding.

53
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,699
But Qi Chuan doesn't think so.

54
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,499
No one can take your place

55
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:15,499
in his heart.

56
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,990
It's just a shame

57
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,420
I've become his burden
over the past year.

58
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:21,819
In his eyes,

59
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,019
I'm the indirect killer
of Zheng and his brother,

60
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,139
and the bad woman
who caused you to hurt your leg.

61
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,180
He forced me to stay by his side

62
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,180
only to torture me

63
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,339
so he could feel better.

64
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,060
Did you also lose your senses
since your memory loss?

65
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:41,780
Why would he want to torment you?

66
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:43,540
He's gathering evidence.

67
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,860
What evidence?

68
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,939
There was blood
from a fourth person at the scene.

69
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,579
My father passed away

70
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:51,899
in prison due to a stroke.

71
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,590
Li Qingfeng left with the Eye of Wucha
and disappeared with you without a word.

72
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,990
Have you ever considered
there might be other possibilities?

73
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:08,060
Are you okay?

74
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:09,699
I can't remember.

75
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,699
You've told my assistant too much.

76
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,060
She can't take it here.

77
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,550
I'll visit again in a couple of days.

78
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:21,740
Xiamo,

79
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,939
I hope you'll be able to see the truth

80
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,180
the next time we meet.

81
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,819
The company is saved.

82
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,899
Mr. Qi has sent over the proposal.

83
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,550
Do we really have no choice
but to cooperate with them?

84
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:51,540
What happened?

85
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:53,899
You look upset.

86
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,339
Xiamo wants to break off the engagement.

87
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:01,980
It's her own fault.

88
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:04,699
Xiamo has always been a burden to us.

89
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,019
With Mr. Qi's investment,

90
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,939
we can cash out and leave.

91
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,180
As for the shares Xiamo holds,

92
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,699
we should hold
a press conference immediately

93
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:16,980
and expose her

94
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,860
as a fraud pretending
to be a rich heiress.

95
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,620
Don't harm her.

96
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:33,100
Announcing it now

97
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,530
would do no good for the company.

98
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,660
I really don't want to wait any longer.

99
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,860
Once the funds are in,

100
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,540
we'll empty out this company

101
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,139
and leave together,

102
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:54,259
okay?

103
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,220
You wanted the scent of fir.

104
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,540
Bring it in.

105
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,579
This used to be your favorite smell.

106
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,339
But now,

107
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,060
I prefer the fragrance of flowers.

108
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,110
Li Qingfeng has sheltered

109
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,740
and turned you into someone weak.

110
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,220
What are you doing?

111
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,660
Relax.

112
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,540
I'm just letting you feel
the warmth of fire.

113
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:19,300
After the explosion,

114
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:23,300
Zheng and Chaya were trapped
in the car for a long time.

115
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,540
That fire

116
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:26,939
also burned for a long time.

117
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:34,180
Do you hear...

118
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:36,180
Do you hear that noise?

119
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,939
What noise?

120
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:41,540
I don't know.

121
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,219
I don't know.

122
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:44,310
With your superior hearing,

123
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,579
I'm sure you can distinguish it.

124
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,339
My hearing is very sharp.

125
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:50,500
There's no way I'd mishear it.

126
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,500
It's the sound of a countdown.

127
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,099
Get out!

128
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:54,979
There's a bomb!

129
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:01,339
I heard the sound of a countdown.

130
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:04,780
How did you get out alive
from that explosion?

131
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:08,459
I... I told him to save them.

132
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,140
Who is he?

133
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,579
Li Qingfeng.

134
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,060
