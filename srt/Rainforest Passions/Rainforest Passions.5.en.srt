=Episode 5=

3
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,199
I'm really curious.

4
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:24,039
What kind of woman could leave

5
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,679
our beautiful Young Lady Chaya

6
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,359
so heartbroken?

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
A woman from China.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,399
She ruined my Wucha wedding

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,200
and is now Qi Chuan's bride.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,600
What a humiliation.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,000
Why don't I bring this up with Mr. Jian?

12
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,159
With his temper,

13
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,320
your problem should be easy to solve.

14
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,679
Let me make this clear one more time.

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,039
I'll handle my own affairs.

16
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,240
If you say a word to him,

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,679
I'll make sure

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,159
you disappear faster than my troubles.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,759
This

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,040
is the residence of Jian Axin,
the head of the organization.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,959
Li Qingfeng is one
of his trusted helpers.

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,159
Who's that woman?

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,000
Chaya,

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,159
Jian Axin's daughter.

25
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,920
That brat really knows
how to live it up.

26
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,319
I told you before.

27
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,719
Li Qingfeng thrives here
like a fish in water.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,760
He's a winner, living the high life.

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,840
I suggest you think twice

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,439
about falling head over heels
for a man like him.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
That rascal is enjoying himself

32
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,599
without a care in the world.

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,879
After seeing this,

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
do you still want to take him away?

35
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,680
Speaking of which,

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,200
that woman has a connection to you too.

37
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,840
I've seen countless women.

38
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,799
If she's one I've discarded,

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,280
it wouldn't be surprising.

40
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,400
If you hadn't shown her mercy

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,079
that day,

42
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,319
things wouldn't have escalated
to this point.

43
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,000
What do you mean by that?

44
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,560
I need to speak to him and get answers.

45
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,400
Are you planning to get yourself killed?

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,120
Look around.

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,120
Here,

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,240
and here.

49
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,000
They're all heavily armed guards.

50
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,960
Li Qingfeng wouldn't deny knowing me.

51
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,000
You can leave first.

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,759
I'll talk to him myself.

53
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,280
Li Qingfeng!

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,960
Are you crazy?

55
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,680
Listen to me.

56
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,319
I don't plan to be a widower.

57
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,319
My arm!

58
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,000
Put me down!

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:34,919
I can't do that.

60
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,360
I said, let me down!

61
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,719
No.

62
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,280
Come on, let me down.
My hand is injured.

63
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,560
Look at what you did to my hand.

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,479
My hand...

65
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,840
How can I ever play the piano again?

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,400
Hurting your hand is better

67
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:54,960
than losing your life.

68
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,159
I can't believe
after all that I've suffered

69
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,919
and the risks I've taken,

70
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,840
he's out there flirting

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,319
with some rich heiress.

72
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,560
The rich heiress doesn't even like him.

73
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,960
How did you know that?

74
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,599
This isn't the point.

75
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,719
I can't understand

76
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,199
why I ended up here.

77
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,240
I don't have any identity now.

78
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,360
I can't leave,
and I can't stay here either.

79
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,199
Li Qingfeng doesn't care about you.

80
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,120
He'll only make you cry.

81
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,199
A man like that isn't worth it.

82
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,719
Get off.

83
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,520

84
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,879
