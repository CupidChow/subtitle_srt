=Episode 18=

3
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,399
He took the medicine

4
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,280
and just fell asleep.

5
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,920
Qi once said

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,719
that you guys

7
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,960
actually met many years ago.

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,600
You just don't remember.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,159
Maybe

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
this can help you recall.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,120
I'll leave you here with him.

12
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:04,719
It's a lighter.

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,640
Give me your bag.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,599
Open your bag.

15
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:21,799
Your phone.

16
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,319
Hurry up. Your purse too.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,840
Come on!

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,319
Hurry!

19
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,159
Don't move.

20
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,959
Who do you think you are?

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,519
Get lost!

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,359
(Unknowingly, it turns out)

23
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,400
(that you saved me before.)

24
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,639
You're always

25
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,919
so stubborn.

26
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,240
Can you be gentler in the future?

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,680
Don't go.

28
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,919
Don't go.

29
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,759
Xiamo...

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,719
Qi Chuan,

31
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,280
I promise

32
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,599
I won't leave anymore.

33
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,520
Xiamo.

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,280
Xiamo.

35
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,759
That's great.

36
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
His fever is gone.

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,800
Xiamo,

38
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
please be nice to Qi.

39
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,919
He went out of his way

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,990
to plead with his uncle
for your identity records.

41
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,190
It's not that he doesn't allow you
to leave.

42
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,759
It was because Jian Axin

43
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,879
had informants at the port.

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
He sent you to Jian's residence

45
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,140
because the enemy had already arrived
at the doorstep.

46
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,860
He had no choice
but to take a risky move.

47
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,319
To ensure that you could leave

48
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,199
without any burden,

49
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,690
he refrained from telling you
that he knew you in the past.

50
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,199
Zheng,

51
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,080
I've made up my mind.

52
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,919
Can you do me a favor?

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,479
When he wakes up,

54
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,199
I want to give him a firm answer.

55
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,520
You've finally come around.

56
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,670
I'll go and check who that is.

57
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:35,959
Xiamo.

58
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,360
Xiamo.

59
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,519
You're finally awake.

60
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,390
I've been waiting for a while now.

61
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,480
What

62
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,120
are all these for?

63
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,480
The painful days are finally over.

64
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,360
After this,

65
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,560
what's your plan?

66
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,279
What about you?

67
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,639
What's your plan?

68
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,199
I want

69
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,680
to get married.

70
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,120
I want to marry someone who loves me.

71
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
If he behaves well,

72
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,680
I'll give him children.

73
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,439
Of course,

74
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,120
I'll keep playing the piano

75
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,270
and he'll take care
of the family for me.

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,390
What a coincidence.

77
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,990
I had the same thoughts too.

78
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,000
Then

79
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,720
I hope your dream will come true soon.

80
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,560
I don't want your wishes.

81
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,480
I want you to be in it.

82
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,720
Qi!

83
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,199
Xiamo.

84
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,279
Where's Xiamo?

85
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,600
She...

86
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,000
Li Qingfeng took her away.

87
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,279
She said the two of you

88
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,800
were never meant to be.

89
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,040
(Forgive me for leaving
without saying goodbye.)

90
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,000
(Along the way,)

91
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,720
(it seems our relationship)

92
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,639
(has been cursed)

93
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,590
(ever since we deceived the Wucha God.)

94
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,360
(We've endured too many trials,)

95
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,319
(and I've caused
you countless troubles.)

96
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,120
(I think)

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,630
(it's time to put an end
to all of this.)

98
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,439
(If you need a more specific reason,)

99
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,240
(I cannot abandon Li Qingfeng)

100
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,439
(because of you.)

101
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,020
♪Is it fate that refuses to let me go?♪

102
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,820
♪Is it something I can't let go?♪

103
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,140

00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,100

106
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,110
So, have you made up your mind?

♪Memories surface♪

108
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,680
Let me see who's at the door.

109
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,279
General Ganchang,

110
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,360
what brings you here?

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,759
At first,

112
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,360
I was both shocked and pleased

113
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,360
when he told me

114
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,399
he had a fiancée.

115
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,759
I will never oppose

116
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,920
whatever Qi Chuan wants to do.

117
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,360
Any girl in the world

118
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,320
can become his wife

119
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,200
as long as he likes her.

120
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,480
Except for you,

121
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,279
I couldn't agree to it.

122
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,919
Why?

123
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,840
After Jian Axin's capture,

124
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,120
Qi Chuan obtained
the Eye of Wucha's chip.

125
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,879
The chip's records show

126
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,320
it has always been in Jian Axin's house.

127
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,600
Su Shide was fully aware
of Jian Axin's embezzlement.

128
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,480
Your relationship with him

129
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,399
has already determined your fate.

130
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,320
How could this be?

131
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,639
You've seen firsthand
how obsessive Qi Chuan is

132
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,480
about his brother's death.

133
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,159
I suggest you

134
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,960
let go of whatever ideas you have.

135
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,540
Short-term pain is better
than prolonged suffering.

136
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,879
I can arrange for you
to return home as soon as possible.

137
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,380
(Flight Ticket)

138
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,020
(Flight Ticket)

139
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,519
I won't give up on my feelings

140
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,679
for him that easily.

141
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,720
I believe he won't either.

142
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,990
No matter what difficulties
we encounter,

143
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,360
I believe

144
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,000
we can face them together.

145
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,519
Since that shipwreck incident,

146
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,320
Qi Chuan has been suffering
from severe PTSD.

147
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,080
Your presence

148
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,799
constantly agitates him.

149
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,440
Do you want to see him suffer even more?

150
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,279
Is that what you call truly loving him?

151
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,240
Don't worry.

152
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,840
I won't make you cry

153
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,519
like Qi Chuan does.

154
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,039
Let's go.

155
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,519
(Forgive me for lying
to you once again.)

156
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,639
(But I know)

157
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,679
(this is)

158
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,720
(the best decision for you.)

159
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,240
I remember telling you

160
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,879
that we should never meet again.

161
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,080
Did you forget?

162
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Jian Axin

163
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
is already dead.

164
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,519
Chaya must not find out about this.

165
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,519
Qi Chuan's uncle

166
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,039
has been closely investigating

167
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,399
Jian Axin's affairs.

168
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,120
I have to leave Mangbei.

169
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,120
So you know what to do...

170
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,080
I've already paid you all your dues.

171
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:01,919
Pu Ba,

172
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,200
you shouldn't be so greedy.

173
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,639
Only vulgar people care about money.

174
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,720
I am not.

175
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,759
What I want

176
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,519
is the Eye of Wucha.

177
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,320
As long as you give me what I want,

178
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,639
we can always go back

179
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,200
to being close and inseparable.

180
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:23,919
After all,

181
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,440
we've killed people together before.

182
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,000
You must be mad.

183
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,480
Listen to this.

184
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,639
You and Jian Axin
were like father and son.

185
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,440
Yet, the person who wanted him dead

186
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,279
was you.

187
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,799
Chief Pu Ba,

188
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,570
you've made even more profit

189
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,639
in this deal than I have.

190
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,440
This is a copy.

191
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,360
