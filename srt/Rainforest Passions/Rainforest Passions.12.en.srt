3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:17,679
Xiamo!

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:22,679
Xiamo.

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:27,760
Qi Chuan.

6
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,439
I knew you'd come and rescue me.

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,000
Why didn't you leave?

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,520
Because...

9
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,280
Because I couldn't bear to leave.

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,439
When I asked you to stay before,

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,240
you insisted on leaving.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,840
Now, when I tell you to leave quickly,

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,799
you refuse to go.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,040
If I leave,

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,000
what will happen to you?

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,519
These past days,

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,200
you've been protecting me all the time.

18
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,400
I've already started seeing you
as my guardian angel.

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,359
So when I encounter danger,

20
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,680
I'm not scared at all.

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,040
But I will also wonder about this.

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,400
What if my guardian angel needs me?

23
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,319
That's why I have to stay.

24
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,719
I want him to know

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,680
I didn't leave,

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,719
so I can be at ease.

27
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,920
So

28
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,000
you're the guardian angel
of the guardian angel now?

Before,

34
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,040
I had other motives for approaching you.

35
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,400
My brother was involved in a shipwreck

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,359
while escorting your father's jewelry.

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,879

those things in your room

39
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,760
are to investigate your brother's case?

42
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,360
Know what?

43
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,680
You can't stay.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,000
If you stay,

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,159

All right, then.

Go and dress up nicely.

you finally called me.

That will work too.

00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,399
it's a pleasure to finally meet you.

Once you're done talking,

146
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,240
I'll come pick her up.

147
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,439

148
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,439

With me here,

151
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,360
they won't do anything to you.

152
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
What on earth are you playing at?

153
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,519
Xiamo, there's no way
you can escape now.

154
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,399
Once this anklet is put on,

155
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,000
it will explode
if you leave the safe zone.

156
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Stay by my side

157
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,480
and follow my lead.

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,519
Don't worry.

159
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,959
I'll protect you.

160
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,199
He's coming.

161
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,759
Miss Su,

162
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,560
what's your relationship with Bai Lan?

163
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,920
She was my former stepmother.

164
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,279
So

165
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,000
you're Su Shide's daughter.

166
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,680
Why is everyone so obsessed

167
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,920
with my connection to Su Shide?

168
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,160
Does being his daughter mean
I deserve to die?

169
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,279
Of course not.

170
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,879
In fact,

171
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,879
he and I go way back.

172
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,319
Years ago, Su Shide bought

173
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,480
the Eye of Wucha

174
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,959
from me.

175
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,080
Too bad

176
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,759
that shipment met with a mishap.

177
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,279
So

178
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,639
you're the mysterious ship owner
from the shipwreck case.

179
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,480
You guessed it.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,639
Now,

181
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,679
I plan to sell the Eye of Wucha again.

182
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,799
So, do you think

183
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,279
your father take the hook

184
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,840
if I use you as bait this time?

185
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,519
Are you saying that this time,

186
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,399
both I and the Eye of Wucha

187
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,360
will sink to the bottom of the sea?

188
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,159
You know too much.

189
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,919
Qingfeng.

190
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,960
If anyone gets to deal with her,
it will be me.

191
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,679
I've had enough of her.

192
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,840
Whatever her intentions are,

193
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,919
let's end this

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,759
and be done with it.

195
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,639
Chaya,

196
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,200
please don't behave this way.

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
You're a young lady.

198
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,039
Why are you always playing
with knives and guns?

199
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,279
I thought you wanted
to get rid of all loose ends.

200
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,879
It's only a life.

201
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,240
We can afford it.

202
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,919
What are you doing?

203
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,360
Stop him!

204
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,600
Chaya,

205
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,960
stop being impulsive.

206
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,159
You're not acting
like a proper young lady.

207
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,559
Don't worry, I'm here to help.

208
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,600
Miss Su,

209
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,559
you have two options now.

210
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,120
Your first option is to stay in Mangbei
for the rest of your life.

211
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,080
- I picked the second option.
- The second option...

212
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,279
Then tell Su Shide

213
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,480
that the Eye of Wucha has been found,

214
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,639
and so is his daughter.

215
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,559
As long as the price is right,

216
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,879
I can return you
and the Eye of Wucha to him.

217
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,200
Boss.

218
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,720
Chaya.

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,519
Qingfeng.

220
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,159
Come with me.

221
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,080
I’ve come to take you home.

222
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,120
I can no longer escape.

223
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,360
Just leave.
