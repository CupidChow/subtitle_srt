3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,000
Qi Chuan.

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,399
No, it's me.

5
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,810
I thought you were sending me away.

6
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,560
Why am I still here?

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,399
Things went overboard last night.

8
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,190
I need to come up with a new plan.

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,079
Let me go.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,399
Let's just pretend
you were drunk last night.

11
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:45,679
From now on,

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,790
I don't want to hear anything
about it anymore.

13
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,399
I wasn't even drunk yesterday.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,200
I want to be with you.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
It's something I've been planning
for a long time.

16
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,120
What do you mean?

17
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:16,879
Look.

18
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,400
We're rich.

19
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,200
You don't need to rely on Su Shide anymore,

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,530
or live under someone else's roof.

21
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,959
I can give you the life you want.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,439
We should stay here

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,840
and live freely for the rest
of our lives.

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,079
When did you become like this?

25
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:32,840
It feels like

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,439
I don't even know you now.

27
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,920
To be worthy of you,

28
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,560
I naturally have to work hard.

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,970
You're not used to it, that's all.

30
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,920
We can take things slow.

31
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,879
I would rather

32
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,040
you remain reckless

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,599
and arrogant brother.

34
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,159
Do you know?

35
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,000
After our parents passed away,

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,439
you were the person
I cared about most in this world.

37
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,959
And now, you've destroyed

38
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,200
the most precious bond I had!

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,239
But

40
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,000
you've always been the one
I cared about most in this world.

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,800
I'm so disappointed in you.

42
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,159
We've been siblings for too long.

43
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:15,960
It's okay.

44
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,919
Soon you'll see things differently.

45
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,039
From now on,

46
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,680
just focus on being with me.

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,319
Chaya,

48
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,960
how could you be so foolish?

49
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,520
When one is bleeding,

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,680
maybe it'll make the pain

51
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,960
in the heart hurt a little less.

52
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,719
Promise me

53
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,719
not to give up on yourself.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,759
Never.

55
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,000
Give up?

56
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,319
If I knew how to give up,

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,520
I wouldn't have ended up
where I am today.

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm just like you.

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,560
No lover

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,960
and no parents.

61
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,800
If you don't hate me,

62
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,159
can I be your family

63
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,000
instead?

64
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,400
How could I be like you?

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,479
Do you think I'm that weak?

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,639
I was just peeling an apple

67
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,960
and accidentally cut myself.

68
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,319
You're right.

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,199
We're not the same.

70
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,439
You're kinder

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,759
and braver than I am.

72
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,039
I was overthinking just now.

73
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,039
Between the two of us,

74
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,960
one of us

75
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,639
deserves a better ending.

76
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,520
You should fight for your own happiness,

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,719
not get stuck in this mess.

78
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,960
(Li Qingfeng
won't let you leave easily.)

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,520
(He's even replaced the security team.)

80
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,159
(But I've already arranged
everything for you.)

81
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,399
(Later,)

82
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,439
(you can slip out quietly.)

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,240
(Don't let Li Qingfeng notice.)

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,790
(I'll also arrange for you
to meet Qi Chuan.)

85
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,320
Where are you going?

86
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,079
I...

87
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,240
I'm going to find Qi Chuan.

88
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,959
You can tell me.

89
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,319
I can drive you there myself.

90
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,860
By the way, I forgot to tell you.

91
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,360
Qi Chuan was badly hurt last night.

92
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,639
I keep wondering

93
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,240
how many lives he has

94
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,880
to keep risking himself to protect you.

95
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:19,959
Qi Chuan.

96
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,000
Qi Chuan.

97
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:22,839
Xiamo.

98
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,480
How did you get injured like this?

99
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,759
Does it hurt?

100
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,360
Why didn't Li Qingfeng send you away?

101
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,759
I wanted to stay.

102
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,879
Zheng

103
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,680
delivered your message to me.

104
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,439
What Qi Chuan did this time,
had affected a lot of people.

105
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,439
Staying with him
will only drag him down.

106
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,490
Are you certain
you still want to see him?

107
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,720
Leaving him

108
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,990
is the only way
to give him a chance to live.

109
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,200
None of that matters anymore.

110
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,160
I came here today

111
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,160
to tell you

112
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,600
not to worry

113
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
about me

114
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,680
or risk your life for me anymore.

115
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,920
Didn't you stay back

116
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,519
because of me?

117
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:33,920
No.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,090
We'll only hold each other back
if we stay together.

119
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,480
Even if you're willing,

120
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,519
I'm not.

121
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,519
Is this why you come and see me?

122
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,920
Yes.

123
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
Take care of yourself

124
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,399
in the future.

125
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,360
At least,

126
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,839
I never regretted

127
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,800
loving you.

128
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,199
Chaya...

129
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,040
You should hate me.

130
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,839
I foolishly thought
I could have happiness.

131
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,199
This is the punishment I deserve.

132
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,199
What a fool.

133
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,879
You are right about that.

134
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,839
Just keep hating me

135
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,800
if hating me

136
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,439
makes you feel better.

137
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,680
Chaya.

138
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,519
I won't hate you

139
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,279
or love you anymore.

140
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,320
Let's consider that slap

141
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,840
as settling the score between us.

142
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,159
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,200
From now on,

144
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,370
there will be no longing for you,

145
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,960
and have a father laden with sins.

146
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,039
Every day I spend in this world

147
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,600
will be for myself.

148
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,159
Forgetting someone is always difficult.

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,559
But given enough time,

150
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,660
no matter what kind of feelings
there are, they can be nurtured.

151
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,480
What he's done for you, I can do too.

152
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,639
People aren’t machines.

153
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,720
You can’t program them

154
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,519
and expect

155
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,879
the response you have input.

156
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,559
I can double

157
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,879
whatever he can give you.

158
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,519
You and he are completely different.

159
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,990
Of course, we're not the same.

160
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,470
Both of you could become
strangers again at any time.

161
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:48,279
But I will always be the brother
who will never betray you.

162
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,759
At least,

163
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,440
I've never regretted

164
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,440
loving you.

165
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,720
Each bead carries a blessing.

166
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,970
According to the local custom,

167
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,840
if you string them

168
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,360
on this cord and wear them,

169
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,960
it will ensure a lifetime
of happiness with Qi.

170
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,200
Xiamo!

171
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,960
(If there are gods,)

172
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,159
(all I wish is for her
to live a life of happiness)

173
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,240
(If there is a price to pay,)

174
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,960
(I'm willing to trade all my luck
for it.)

175
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,960
For you.

176
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,720
Wishing you a peaceful

177
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,360
and fulfilling life ahead.

178
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,159
Qi Chuan.

179
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,440
Qi Chuan.

180
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:36,960
Qi Chuan!

181
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,440
Qi Chuan!

182
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,639
Qi Chuan!

183
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,970
(All you have to do is call my name,)

184
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,540
(and the gods will hear your call.)

185
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,600
Qi Chuan!

186
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:58,060
♪Tears burn through every disguise♪

187
00:11:59,159 --> 00:11:59,759
(Qi Chuan,)

188
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,759
(every time I called for you
in the past,)

189
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,440
(you always showed up right on time.)

190
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,799
