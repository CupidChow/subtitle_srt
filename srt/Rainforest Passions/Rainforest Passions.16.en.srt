Where does this blood come from?

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,039
Did I get hurt?

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,359
Why would I let you get hurt?

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,199
Does that mean you're injured?

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,239
Let me see.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,239
Where is it?

9
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,039
What's that sound?

10
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:30,199
Go and take a look.

11
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,479
Come on over now!

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,840
Check out that area now!

13
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,159
One team to the left,
one team to the right.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,240
Check and report back immediately.

15
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes!

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,240
How long will it take to crack it?

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,880
One minute.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,719
To bandage your wound.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,920
One minute from now,

20
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,159
I'll have the Eye of Wucha,

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,040
and you'll have the evidence.

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,359
Then we'll part ways for good.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,599
It's finally time to put an end
to all this nonsense.

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,159
I

25
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,040
have been wanting to ask you something.

26
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,920
Have you ever hesitated before?

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,719
Even for a moment?

28
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,120
I have.

29
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,719
Have what?

30
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,560
It means I have.

Have you ever felt something?

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,879
I'm not telling you.

35
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,800
Then have you ever thought

36
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,719
of staying?

37
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,479
Even if for a moment?

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,080
Before I met you,

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,960
I went through many painful moments.

40
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,840
But one minute from now,

41
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll be back on my path to the light.

42
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,439

I've been living in darkness.

49
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,199
I hope your path to the light

50
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,560
is smooth and easy.

This letter contains

57
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,520
your secret.

58
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,039
But I'm not sure
if you want to know the truth.

59
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,360
You can decide whether to open it

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,319
after you return home.

61
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,719
Now,

62
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,360
it's time for us
to say goodbye in advance.

63
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,079
They are over there!

64
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't let him get away!

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,639
Xiamo,

66
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:23,920
go now.

67
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,600
Run.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,639
Chaya.

69
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,120
Why did you lie to me?

70
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,480
I know you're innocent.

71
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,279
I've always considered you
my most precious friend.

72
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,600
And have you...

73
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,519
Have you guys

74
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,560
ever thought of me

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,680
when you did all of this?

76
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,680
Even if he's guilty,

77
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,360
all of this shouldn't have happened

78
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,439
during my engagement ceremony.

79
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,160
How am I supposed
to face being his daughter?

80
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,319
Then shoot me.

81
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,319
If shooting me

82
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,600
could end your resentment,

83
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,600
I'd risk my life

84
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,160
to see if I'm strong enough
to survive it.

85
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,519
Get out of here.

86
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,519
Where's Qi?

87
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,600
Where's Qi?

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,079
Zheng,

89
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,079
go and save him.

90
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,079
He's alone

91
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,800
there.

92
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,160
Zheng!

93
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,800
Tell him

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,199
that I've thought of it

95
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,000
countless times!

96
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,319
Qi,

97
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,360
sorry I'm late.

98
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,920
Did you Xiamo?

99
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,000
She...

100
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,439
She got in the car.

101
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:14,759
She...

102
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,279
She wanted me to tell you

103
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,959
that she thought of it
countless times.

104
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,279
Then have you ever thought

105
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,680
of staying?

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,959
Even for a moment?

107
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,879
(I've thought of it)

108
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,959
(countless times!)

109
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,799
We're going to the dock.

110
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,879
We managed to pull it off

111
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,519
without anyone noticing.

112
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,519
Well, it's all thanks to Qi Chuan.

113
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,279
Qi Chuan should be thanking you.

114
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,679
If you didn't tell me

115
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,519
to drug him in advance,

116
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,039
we wouldn't have caught

117
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,000
Jian Axin so easily.

118
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,840
Wishing a successful partnership.

119
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,720
May it be rewarding.

120
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,399
You and Jian Axin
were like father and son.

121
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,600
Yet, the person who wanted him dead

122
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,320
was you.

123
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,879
Chief Pu Ba,

124
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,320
you've made even more profit
in this deal than I have.

125
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,840
From now on,

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,320
we'll split all his business 50-50.

127
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,679
Let's make money together.

128
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,799
May our partnership be a success.

129
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,080
I think it's best
if we don't meet again in the future.

130
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,279
Li Qingfeng,

131
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,399
it's better to leave some room

132

when dealing with others.

133
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,600
This isn't the way to the docks.
