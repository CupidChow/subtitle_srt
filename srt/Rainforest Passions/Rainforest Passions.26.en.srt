3
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,120
Now that I've taken
your greatest leverage,

4
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,520
Xiamo will eventually return to me.

5
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,719
When you believed

6
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:34,799
I had dirt on you,

7
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,510
you had already lost the entire game.

8
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:37,640
Li Qingfeng,

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,280
I advise you to turn yourself in.

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,519
The show has begun.

11
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,020
(One Message Received)

12
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,860
(One Message Received)

13
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,719
(Save me)

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,800
Xiamo.

15
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,439
Why is it you?

16
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,199
Happy birthday.

17
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,960
Happy birthday.

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,160
What's the meaning of this?

19
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,000
This is something Xiamo and Mr. Qi
specially planned for you.

20
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,100
They've been preparing the surprise
since last night

21
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,480
and wouldn't even let me come over.

22
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,719
At today's birthday party,

23
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,159
Qi Chuan will sign the contract
with Su Shide Group.

24
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,000
Look.

25
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,919
Madam Bai even brought the Eye of Wucha
to celebrate your birthday.

26
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:55,840
This should be

27
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,120
your favorite gift, right?

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,800
Oh, did I scare you?

29
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,639
It's been a while,

30
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,719
Li Qingfeng.

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,000
You're not as carefree
as you used to be.

32
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:24,919
Why?

33
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,599
Aren't you happy to see Chaya?

34
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,879
I'm glad that you're okay now.

35
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,560
There's no grudge that can't be resolved
between old friends.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,680
Xiamo is like a daughter to me,
after all.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,319
Once the contract is signed today,

38
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,000
Mr. Qi

39
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,879
will practically be my son-in-law.

40
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,280
We're all family now.

41
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,400
When did

42
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,639
this plan begin?

43
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,319
You've already pulled down their act.

44
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,919
He can no longer say

45
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
he's doing things for my sake.

46
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,879
Next,

47
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,360
he should face our judgment.

48
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,800
So the recording device

49
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,439
was also a trick you played on me?

50
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,959
We were only messing with you.

51
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,680
You should be more forgiving.

52
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,720
Everyone is enjoying themselves.

53
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,959
You're not that petty, are you?

54
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,399
He's right.

55
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,720
Mr. Qi

56
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,319
just loves to joke around.

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,360
If you ask me,

58
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,839
old matters like this

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,240
should be left in the past.

60
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,439
From today onward,

61
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,720
we're all in the same boat.

62
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,879
Take it.

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,040
Cheers.

64
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,600
Then we'll rely on Mr. Qi

65
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,319
to help us sail through.

66
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,639
Recently, I've heard some rumors

67
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,120
that Xiamo

68
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,399
is not Su Shide's daughter

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,519
but rather a fake heiress you took in.

70
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,639
Is that true?

71
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,680
If a board member
has such a problematic issue,

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,120
I'm afraid our partnership

73
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:16,920
might be jeopardized.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,439
How could that be, Mr. Qi?

75
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,240
Rest assured

76
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,360
on that matter.

77
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,360
If that's the case,

78
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,560
I have a suggestion.

79
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,120
Why not

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,990
transfer the ownership
of your company's treasure,

81
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,040
the Eye of Wucha,

82
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,519
to Xiamo

83
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,160
to silence the rumors?

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
We will think about this.

85
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,439
I also heard

86
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,720
that there's a peculiar relationship

87
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,040
between Ms. Bai and Mr. Li.

88
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,120
A relationship
between a senior and a junior

89
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,500
that crossed the boundaries

90
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,390
of a stepmother
and son-in-law's relationship.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,959
Do you think I don't know
what you are up to?

92
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,160
You want to create chaos

93
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,399
and take over my company.

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,990
I won't let that happen.

95
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,319
I only want to verify

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,639
the hearsay.

97
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,920
Don't you think you are overreacting?

98
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,000
That's right.

99
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,319
Mr. Qi,

100
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,040
you're messing with us again.

101
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,800
These are all baseless rumors.

102
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,040
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

103
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,519
Li Qingfeng,

104
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:22,920
come with me.

105
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,480
Sorry,

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,199
my legs are still a bit shaky.

107
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,439
Hope you can understand.

108
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,120
When Li Qingfeng was in Mangbei,

109
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,920
he was completely obsessed with Xiamo.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,079
I wonder if he has changed

111
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,160
after all this time.

112
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,519
Were you sincere
about the things you said before?

113
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,560
Of course, not.

114
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,319
Qi Chuan set me up.

115
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,240
He did it to make you hate me.

116
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,920
But now, I don't know

117
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,199
how to believe anything you say.

118
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:06,800
Xiamo,

119
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,680
tell me if you have any demands.

120
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,839
I will agree

121
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,920
to anything I can do.

122
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,959
I want to redeem

123
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,490
the shares you mortgaged to the board.

124
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,120
This group is just an empty shell.

125
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,199
Without Eye of Wucha, it's nothing.

126
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,040
Once Qi Chuan's investment comes in,

127
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,879
I can take you away.

128
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,199
Why are you doing this?

129
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,160
Just think of it as me being nostalgic.

130
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,920
Once you sign this,

131
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,040
I will believe you.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,760
It doesn't matter.

133
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,439
Whether the contract
is with you or me, it's the same.

134
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,850
Once the funds come through,
we'll cash out

135
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,480
and leave this place.

136
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,399
You have to trust me.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,600
I've only ever loved you.

138
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,319
Did you tell Bai Lan the same thing?

139
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,480
Of course, not.

140
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,199
Everything with her was just a game.

141
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,279
(The prey has taken the bait.)

142
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,399
(Today,)

143
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,759
(I will make sure they have no way out.)

144
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,279
You should give
a proper explanation to her.

145
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:19,959
Madam Bai,

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,319
Mr. Li has something to tell you.

147
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,319
I'll leave you two to it.

148
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,439
What are you holding?

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,040
His contract of servitude.

150
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,240
I've already obtained

151
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,200
Li Qingfeng's shares.

152
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,519
I'll count on you guys on Bai Lan's shares.

153
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,080
Then we can prepare to celebrate.

154
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,360
Why have you been wearing
these earpieces lately?

155
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,120
Since the accident,

156
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,639
the nerves in my ears
have been very sensitive.

157
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,159
Other earpieces aren't comfortable.

158
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,159
These fit me perfectly.

159
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,039
Qi Chuan gave them to me back then.

160
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,879
Today,

161
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,039
I'll use them

162
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,679
to repay you with a huge gift.

163
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,039
Sorry, my legs are still a bit shaky.

164
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,340
Hope you can understand.

165
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:26,960
Is it clear?

166
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,840
Be patient.

167
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,399
It's pretty messy between them.
