00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,260
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,039
(Indeed, people need
luxurious material possessions)

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:19,719
(to be happy.)

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,640
(Life here is already so hard.)

6
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,079
(Why should I let one or two comments)

7
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,039
(from someone ruin my mood?)

8
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:25,559
Zheng,

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:26,879
do you hate me?

10
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:33,560
No,

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,079
Miss Xia.

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,079
Is there anything else you need?

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,759
Zheng,

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,399
bring me a bottle of beer.

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:44,799
Okay.

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,280
Zheng,

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,280
pour me a cup of hot tea.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
If you want to make things difficult,

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,159
that would cost more.

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,079
Sorry, Sister-in-law pays higher.

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,920
Zheng,

22
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,640
who's the boss here?

23
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,040
Of course, it's you, Qi.

24
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,040
Then who is Qi's boss?

25
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:18,840
The General.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,319
The General's influence is huge
in Mangbei.

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,359
He's also Qi's uncle.

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:25,879
Really?

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,879
Since you have an incredible uncle,

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,840
why don't you be the good guy

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,760
and let him send me back home?

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,239
Why should I?

33
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,920
Petty jerk.

34
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,879
There, Xiamo.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,040
Don't be mad.

36
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,400
Calm down.

37
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,959
(If my passport isn't missing,)

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,599
(and you have such a powerful uncle,)

39
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,519
(I wouldn't even bother dealing
with you.)

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,079
(Each bead carries a blessing.)

41
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,280
(According to the local custom,)

42
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,040
(if you string them on this cord)

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,680
(and wear them,)

44
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,200
(it will ensure you and Qi
a lifetime of happiness.)

45
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,280
I hope I can smooth things with him

46
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,599
after giving him this bracelet.

47
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,360
Wucha God,

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,280
please watch over me

49
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,680
and leave this place quickly.

50
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,360
Do you really want to leave that bad?

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,759
Do you

52
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,639
want me to stay?

53
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,520
I mean,

54
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,479
since you don't like me,

55
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,879
why keep me here
to get on each other's nerves?

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,840
It's better to part on good terms.

57
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,000
For you.

58
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,680
Wishing you a peaceful

59
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,199
and fulfilling life ahead.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,319
You pray to god while defying the god,

61
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,439
ignoring them when things are fine
but turning to Him when you need help.

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
What a joke.

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,319
If you're not going to help, then fine.

64
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,919
But do you really need to say that?

65
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,919
So, are you willing to help me now?

66
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,120
No.

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,639
For the woman you hate the most,

68
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,919
you'd trouble your uncle,
who you dislike dealing with.

69
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,319
You're still as stubborn

70
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,599
as before.

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,639
Chaya,

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,039
my patience has a limit.

73
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,520
If I had been the one
to marry you that day,

74
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,199
I would be the person
you're favoring right now.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,680
I can't let her steal

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,000
your heart away too.

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,479
If you really burn it,

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
she'll never leave.

79
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,719
What are you wearing?

80
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,800
You know very well.

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,280
It's something
the Wucha couple always wears

82
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,639
as proof of marriage.

83
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,120
You would rather marry a stranger

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,919
only to push me away.

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,400
She won't stay long.

86
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,639
My father already knows she's not dead.

87
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,399
He has eyes at every exit port.

88
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,079
Now isn't the best time
to send her away.

89
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,079
Are you here to tip me off?

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,759
I may not like her.

91
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,319
But I detest my father even more.

92
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,680
Since you're not listening to reason,

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,639
I'll make it unbearable for you.

94
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,120
So you have no choice
but to send me away.

95
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't come any closer!

96
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,399
If you dare touch me,

97
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,680
I'll make sure everyone knows

98
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,240
you're a wife-beater!

99
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,120
Why are you here?

100
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,720
You shouldn't stay here with Qi Chuan.

101
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,079
You don't even understand
his relationship with Chaya.

102
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,839
He was only using you

103
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,079
to provoke Chaya.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,639
He didn't need to do that.

105
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,040
I think I'm prettier than Chaya.

106
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,480
Take this money.

107
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,839
You'll need it when you return home.

108
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,639
Don't forget your dream.

109
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:50,959
Xiamo,

110
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,160
how long has it been
since you last practiced the piano?

111
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,279
Didn't you say

112
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
you wanted to become a musician?

113
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,319
Go home.

114
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,480
Use the pass I gave you.

115
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,800
(He's right.)

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,439
(I haven't practiced the piano
for a long time either.)

117
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:14,920
(Xiamo,)

118
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,959
(have you forgotten)

119
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,639
(your dream)

120
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,000
(to become an outstanding pianist?)

121
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,199
(Ah, yes.)

122
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,360
(The result application
for the Philharmonic Orchestra)

123
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,279
(should be out by now.)

124
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,120
I must...

125
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,480
I must go home.

126
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,399
If you haven't learned
from your past mistakes,

127
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,879
you could try.

128
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,720
I'm not joking around.

129
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,560
I've waited for twenty years.

130
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,279
I've been waiting for this day to come.

131
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,680
(Invitation)
I'm about to perform at the Golden Hall.

132
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,279
Do you have any idea
how rare this opportunity is?

133
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,560
But

134
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,759
(Xiamo, leave. Sooner or later, I'll come find you.)
I tore up the pass

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,879
that Li Qingfeng gave me out of anger.

136
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,079
I know

137
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,560
you must have a way
to send me back, right?

138
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,920
Are there

139
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,720
any secret passages in Mangbei

140
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,959
or ways to sneak out?

141
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,560
No matter what method,

142
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,560
I have to get back.

143
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,639
Of course, there are.

144
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,399
But most likely,

145
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
you'll end up in a coal mine,

146
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,279
selling organs,

147
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,639
or even worse, in prostitution.

148
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,800
Any of those options

149
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,920
would be better than getting caught

150
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,079
by Jian Axin's people alive
when you try to leave here.

151
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,680
Don't try to scare me.

152
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,040
You don't have the right
to restrict my movement right now.

153
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,079
I want to leave right this instant.

154
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,040
No matter what the cost,

155
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,199
I'm willing to take a chance.

156
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,279
What you're doing now

157
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,800
will only cause more trouble.

158
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,720
I have no reason to rely on you anymore.

159
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
I can leave on my own.

160
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,439
I've told you this.

161
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,040
This isn't a place
you can easily leave as you please.

162
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,879
What else do you want from me?

163
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,040
Drink it.

164
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,000
From now on,
you can come and go as you please.

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,720
I won't stop you.

166
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,480
But I don't even know what this is.

167
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,399
What's in it for you if I drink this?

168
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,759
But once you step out that door,

169
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,360
it's a whole new world.

170
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,120
You need that courage.

171
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,360
I will think of it as drinking
the Mengpo potion.

172
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,639
Farewell.

173
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,980
(WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE
Chinese woman)

174
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,519
After her.

175
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,720
(All you have to do is call my name,)

176
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,039
(and the gods will hear your call.)

177
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:17,919
(Qi Chuan.)

178
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,519
Remove that cover from your face

179
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,399
so we can identify you.

180
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,320
I'll count down from five.

181
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:30,600
Five.

182
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:32,720
Four.

183
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,960
Three.

184
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,120
Two.

185
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,320
One.

186
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,639
(Qi Chuan,)

187
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,039
