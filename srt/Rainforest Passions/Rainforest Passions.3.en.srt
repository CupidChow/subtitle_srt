You

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,239
saved me again.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,559
Shouldn't it be you getting me
into trouble again?

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,440
How did you find me today?

7
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,640
All you have to do is call my name,

8
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,200
and the gods will hear your call.

9
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:39,920
Are they really that effective?

10
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,399
If that were true,

11
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,520
wouldn't you already be in love with me?

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,240
You have quite the imagination.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,679
Anyway, you saved me.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,359
So no matter what grudge you have
against Su Shide,

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,759
I will still repay you.

16
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,799
How exactly will you repay me?

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,159
Once I find that brat Li Qingfeng

18
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,439
and send him back home,

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,119
I'll repay you generously.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,640
Let's hope so.

21
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,519
Young Lady, should we go after them?

22
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,439
No need.

23
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,239
Don't let Father's men know about this.

a wedding night tradition?

What am I thinking about?

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,159
Why are you giggling?

33
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,359
I wasn't.

34
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,359
These are the women's items

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,959
you asked for.

36
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,759
(Has a daughter?)

37
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,919
Have you confirmed her identity yet?

38
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,479
We've gotten Su Shide's blood sample.

39
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,960
We'll find out soon enough.

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,100
(Find the truth)

41
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,879
(Brother was escorting
the ship carrying the Eyes of Wucha.)

00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,199

from Mangbei,)

46
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,599
(Su Shide, as the buyer,
collected an enormous insurance payout)

47
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,319
(and doubled his wealth.)

how many secrets are hidden)

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,120
today's shipment is urgent.

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,080
You need to head out now.

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:23,960
Okay.

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,879
Keep an eye on Jian Axin.

56
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,400
I'll meet up with you
after the delivery.

57
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,639
Wait.

58
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,599
Where are you going?

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,759
I have a delivery to make.

60
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,199
Remember.

61
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,319
Without my permission,

62
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,919
you're not allowed to leave this house.

63
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,960
But

64
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,639
it's boring to stay home alone.

65
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
You have no passport.

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,599
If you encounter patrolling soldiers,

67
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,680
you'll be arrested and jailed.

68
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,919
Mangbei's prisons aren't something

69
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,560
a pampered heiress like you

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,319
could handle.

71
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,159
I can't just hide in your house forever.

72
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm not

73
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,960
some notorious international fugitive.

74
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,120
Besides,

75
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,280
what if I urgently need to contact you?

76
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,280
That surveillance camera is equipped
with a signal-blocking feature.

77
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
You can use the internal line

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,039
to call my phone.

79
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,279
You're planning to monitor me?

80
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,680
I'm not into that kind of thing.

81
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,560
It's for safety.

82
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,000
What's the matter?

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,720
It does work.

84
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:56,839
Don't call me if there's nothing urgent.

85
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,120
Okay.

86
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,240
Testing, testing.

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,879
Qi Chuan, please respond.

88
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,360
Are you bored being home alone?

89
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,040
Yes.

90
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm in an unfamiliar place here

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,720
without any means of communication.

92
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,040
You're my only friend.

93
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:26,959
Maybe

94
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,560
if you bring me to find Li Qingfeng,

95
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,560
I'll stop bothering you.

96
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,199
I'll think about that.

97
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,279
He hung up on me.

98
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,360
(What's that?)

99
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,319
(He even has a piano?)

100
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,439
Where is Jian Axin heading this time?

101
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,120
Probably off
to salvage the sunken ship again.

102
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,240
Why is he so obsessed

103
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,439
with recovering the shipwreck?

104
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,600
Who wouldn't want
to find the Eyes of Wucha?

105
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,680
He's secretly salvaging the wreck

106
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,199
while hunting down Su Shide's daughter
at the same time.

107
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,560
Clearly, his involvement
with the ship is shady too.

108
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,000
For once, you're making sense.

109
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,639
(Why is she so quiet now?)

110
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,920
(Is she okay?)

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,680
It's her?

112
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,079
Xiamo,

113
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,160
the patrol soldiers are coming.

114
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,879
Go and hide now.

115
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,600
They're coming.

116
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,399
What now?

117
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,040
Calm down.

118
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm coming right away.

119
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,639
Xiamo is in danger.

120
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,879
I need to head back now.

121
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:05,879
Stop right there.

122
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,839
Don't move.

123
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,639
(Pu Ba,
Mangbei Patrol Officer)

124
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,639
We've received a report

125
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,600
that there’s an illegal immigrant here.

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,639
You're from China?

127
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,759
I came to find my relative.

128
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,039
Where's your passport?

129
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,399
Passport?

130
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,879
I might need time to find it.

131
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,080
I don't think you have one.

132
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:13,799
Follow me.

133
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:14,720
Follow me!

134
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,240
Let me go!

135
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,080
Come with me!

136
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,600
Let me go! What are you doing?

137
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,000
Mr. Qi Chuan.

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,919
What's your relationship

139
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,879
with this woman?

140
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,039
She's my wife.

141
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,879
We just held a wedding witnessed

142
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,080
by the Wucha God.

143
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,279
Okay, then.

144
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,399
Then please show me

145
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,080
your wife's passport.

146
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,320
Oh, your IDs are here.

147
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,799
How much do you charge per day?

148
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,519
This man spent a fortune on you.

149
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,559
Perhaps

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,159
I can afford you too.

151
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,840
Qi Chuan!

152
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,759
Are you forgetting who has my back?

153
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,960
If you offend me,

154
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,759
you won't be able

155
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,000
to get through this trouble!

156
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,960
It looks like

157
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,600
you're going head-to-head with me now.

158
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,159
Blame yourself for being
so obsessed with investigating

159
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,559
the shipwreck case.

160
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,879
Watch how I end you today.

161
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:28,720
Get him!

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Sir,

163
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:30,919
your phone is ringing.

164
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,559
Let it ring!

165
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,120
Get him!

166
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,600
You should answer it first.

167
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:42,279
Yes.

168
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:43,840
Yes.

169
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,840
What's your relationship

170
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,159
with General Ganchang?

171
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,759
Get out.

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,639
Have you two

173
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,840
become enemies now?

174
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,120
Don't worry about that.

175
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,799
Don't worry.

176
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,320
As soon as I have the ID details,

177
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,519
I'll leave right away.

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
I won't cause you any more trouble.

179
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,639
I've decided

180
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,840
to get your passport back

181
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,279
and find Li Qingfeng.

182
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,159
Why?

183
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,159
Let's just say

184
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,720
it's because you can play the piano.

185
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,840
(Three Years Ago)

186
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,519
(Your brother went out to sea
in your place.)

187
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,759
(You should've been the one who died!)

188
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,440
(Why are you still alive?)

189
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,080
(If he didn't go out to sea
in your place,)

190
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,399
