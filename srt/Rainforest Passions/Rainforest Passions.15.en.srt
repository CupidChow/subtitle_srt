=Episode 15=

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,839
The chip embedded in the Eye of Wucha

4
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:18,960
has recorded its entire journey.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,440
With concrete evidence,

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,480
the truth will come to light.

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,559
Honestly, when Li Qingfeng asked me

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,039
to retrieve the Eye of Wucha earlier,

9
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,960
I didn't think it mattered much.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,320
But now, everything has changed.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,839
I have to get it.

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:32,880
See this?

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,640
He gave me this decryption device.

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,520
The shackle on my leg had been unlocked.

15
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,200
At this time,

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,799
we

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,520
can only use each other

18
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,280
to achieve our goals.

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,719
The most important thing
you should do right now

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,399
is to leave here as quickly as possible.

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,119
But I am the best choice.

22
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:49,880
I'm in the best position
to get close to the Eye of Wucha

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,840
compared to all of you.

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,439
Am I right?

25
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:52,719
Or

26
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,359
you don't trust me?

27
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,680
Since you insist,

28
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,480
When the night falls,

29
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,159
I'll fire a shot to create chaos.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,799
Make your move after you hear the shot.

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,519
Doesn't it seem

32
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,000
like they're a better match?

33
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,519
Not at all.

34
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,760
He's your fiancé today.

35
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,879
This engagement was never genuine,
to begin with.

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,640
The feeling of disillusionment lasts
only a moment.

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,400
If

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,640
someone takes advantage of your trust

39
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,239
and turns around to hurt you,

40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,000
what would you do?

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,319
I would use his guilt

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,760
to control him,

43
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,560
and make sure he stays close.

44
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,599
But in the end,

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,039
we can't keep someone's heart.

46
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,919
What's with all
this imposing presence today?

47
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,240
Something doesn't feel right.

48
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,319
They're all security arranged by Pu Ba.

49
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,520
Pu Ba is your father's
most trusted person.

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,919
There's no need to worry.

51
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,159
Boss,

52
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,479
I've given it a thought.

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,319
If the deal for the Eye of Wucha

54
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,199
still follows the route I planned,

55
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,680
the price

56
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,639
will no longer be the original price.

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,840
Pu Ba,

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,280
are you trying

59
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,400
to drive up the price on me?

60
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,599
How could that be?

61
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,639
Have you forgotten

62
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,240
what I've given you

63
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,400
over the years?

64
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,039
I've had too much to drink today.

65
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,280
Let me raise another toast to you.

66
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,719
Boss,

67
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,560
we'll stick to the original price.

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,800
I'll drink to that.

69
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,680
The ball is about to begin.

70
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,520
I hope

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
you won't ruin my mood.

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,199
All right.

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,039
Sure thing.

74
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

75
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,839
tonight's ball is about to start!

76
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,399
Enjoy yourselves!

77
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,040
Later,

78
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
I'll introduce you
to tonight's main characters!

79
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,680
Come on!

80
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,519
- Great!
- Nice!

81
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,160
Come on.

82
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,120
Come on, let's go.

83
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
You should pay more attention
to your fiancée.

84
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,759
She seems like
she has something to say to you.

85
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,399
Is everything going smoothly?

86
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,399
Can you promise me

87
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,000
that no matter what happens,

88
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,399
you won't go against Qi Chuan?

89
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,759
What is Qi Chuan planning?

90
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,519
Qi Chuan is planning

91
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,839
to make a move on Jian Axin

92
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,040
when the lights go out.

93
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,199
That's a good thing.

94
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,079
The fewer bad people in this world,

95
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,399
the better for everyone.

96
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,000
But if Qi Chuan fails,

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,199
remember to retrieve the Eye of Wucha

98
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,519
during the chaos when he takes action.

99
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,399
After you retrieve the gem,

100
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,120
don't forget I've got a black car ready

101
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,879
to pick you up about 100 meters
to the north.

102
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,439
One last time,

103
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,759
please leave.

104
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,480
It looks like you've gotten
what you wanted.

105
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,000
Tell me what you're planning to do next.

106
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,480
I don't want to lie to you.

107
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,079
Your father really was a man
who did a lot of evil deeds.

108
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
You can tell him on me.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,319
I will respect every decision you make.

110
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,879
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,800
I apologize on his behalf.

112
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,680
You don't need to apologize
on his behalf.

113
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm not the judge.

114
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,040
Chaya,

115
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,759
thank you for all your help.

116
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,399
I know that.

117
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm willing to atone for his sins.

118
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,120
I am willing to spend my life for it.

119
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,120
I will talk him

120
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,000
out of his misguided belief.

121
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,839
I'll persuade him to change his ways.

122
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,600
You can't ask me
to sympathize with a murderer.

123
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,959
For all these years,

124
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,319
I've always done what you asked.

125
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,279
I don't mind that you are using me.

126
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,720
Let's focus the spotlight

127
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,120
on

128
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,240
the most important people tonight!

129
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,399
Please, I beg you.

130
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,439
For the sake

131
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,839
of how devoted I am to you,

132
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,879
don't leave him with no way out.

133
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,120
Xiamo,

134
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,920
you must get the Eye of Wucha.

135
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,560
That's the only way we'll have a chance.

136
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,120
What chance?

137
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,000
The chance between you and me.

138
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,120
You asked me why I left home

139
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,839
and what I couldn't face before.

140
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,759
I can finally tell you now.

141
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,120
It's because of you.

142
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,040
I don't want you to be just my sister.

143
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,040
I want to be with you.

144
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:00,959
Are you crazy?

145
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,120
Qi Chuan!

146
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:13,480
What are you doing?

147
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,360
What are you trying to do?

148
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,360
I never thought I raised a wolf!

149
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,710
- Run!
- Save yourselves!

150
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,199
Don't move!

151
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,600
Stay still.

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Let me go!

153
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,199
Behave!

154
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,959
- Move it.
- Walk!

155
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,120
Stop it!

156
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,319
You're father's
most trusted subordinate.

157
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,680
Think of a way.

158
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,040
Look at the situation yourself.

159
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,519
They are all regular forces.

160
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Going to save him now

161
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
is like walking into death.

162
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,199
How can you stay so calm?

163
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,800
Are you also part of this plan?

164
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,920
How could you think that?

165
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,959
Isn't the truth already clear enough?

166
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,759
Open your eyes and see for yourself

167
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,040
who your friends are

168
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,519
and who your enemies are.

169
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,120
You know it deep down.

170
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,039
The one who brought harm
into the house was you,

171
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,720
and the one who trampled
on your feelings was him,

172
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,639
Qi Chuan.
