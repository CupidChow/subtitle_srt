3
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:20,960
Let me go!

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,719
Let me go!

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:23,920
Let me go!

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,119
Is this your way of getting back at me?

7
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,640
What did Li Qingfeng do to you?

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,759
Twenty-four hours of meticulous care.

9
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,790
Everything you ask me to do,

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,079
he has already done for me.

11
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,960
He protected me very well.

12
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,439
He never forced me
to recall those painful memories.

13
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,420
If a person lost

14
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,039
an unforgettable memory,

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,640
she's already been emptied out.

16
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,920
Go ahead and do whatever you want.

17
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,620
Do you still remember

18
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,120
how you disliked the heat
when you were in Mangbei?

19
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,510
Once during a blackout,

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,480
I carried you away from the fridge.

21
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:18,799
You still remember?

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,910
You haven't lost
your memories completely.

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,090
So what if I remembered?

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,750
It doesn't matter anymore.

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,200
It was nothing
but my own sentimental fantasy.

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,359
Do you know

27
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,490
I dislike cold the most?

28
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,519
Stay and keep me company.

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,560
Xiamo,

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,120
have you ever thought of me

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,919
while being by Li Qingfeng's side?

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,360
Actually,

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,199
I think of you all the time.

34
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,039
I wonder

35
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,919
what should you do

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,360
and if you were living well.

37
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,639
I feel so guilty toward you

38
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,560
that I don't even know how to face you.

39
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,960
Does it please you
when I try to satisfy you?

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,360
(Mr. Qi,)

41
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,599
(I checked the medicine.)

42
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,090
(The pills Su Xiamo
is taking are just depressants.)

43
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,280
(They're not for treating
any kind of amnesia.)

44
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:31,840
I promise you.

45
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,639
Tomorrow, I'll go find Li Qingfeng.

46
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,599
I knew you'd agree

47
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,080
because of the money, right?

48
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,759
He is my safe haven

49
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,400
while you are the chaos.

50
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,719
Even so,

51
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,199
I'm willing to shatter myself

52
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,240
to discover the truth
of the outside world.

53
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,800
The truth?

54
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,039
The truth

55
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,960
will only be bloody.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,280
That is still better
than being an empty shell.

57
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,279
Go and search for her!

58
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,660
There's not a single lead
after a whole night?

59
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,720
Useless!

60
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:40,959
Xiamo,

61
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,660
why didn't you answer
your phone all night?

62
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,560
I was worried sick about you.

63
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,199
She spent all night with me.

64
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,879
We had a great time.

65
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,920
What did he mean by that?

66
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,040
Mr. Qi said

67
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,120
he would only invest in the company

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,399
and help resolve this crisis

69
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,839
if I became his personal assistant.

70
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,160
Also,

71
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,720
I'll invest after you pass

72
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,959
the so-called loyalty tests.

73
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,279
Tell him

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,690
that you want
to break off the engagement.

75
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,399
I want to break off our engagement.

76
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,000
Tell him

77
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,879
that you never loved him.

78
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,439
I never love you.

79
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,279
Xiamo,

80
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,920
come here.

81
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,439
Kiss me.

82
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,079
Well done.

83
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,690
You can come home with me now.

84
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,040
You scumbag!

85
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,480
Stop it.

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,690
Stop hitting him!

87
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,439
Are you all right?

88
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,079
I'll fulfill my promise to your company.

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,990
Consider it compensation

90
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,639
for your emotional damages.

91
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,279
Xiamo.

92
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,920
Why do you have to be so ruthless?

93
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,240
Are you feeling sorry for him?

94
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,000
Can't take it anymore?

95
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,480
If you can't take it, you can leave.

96
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,800
Because what I'm going to do to you next

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,990
will be even more ruthless
than what I did to him.

98
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,519
Stop testing me
with these pointless tests.

99
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,240
As if I'd believe you would let me go
if I got out of the car now.

100
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,720
Tell me

101
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,279
when I can meet Chaya.

102
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,600
That's not up to you.

103
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,879
In that case,

104
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,920
I have no obligation
to keep acting for you.

105
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,290
It looks like

106
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,159
the Wucha God

107
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,120
