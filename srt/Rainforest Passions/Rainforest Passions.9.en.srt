=Episode 9=

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,399
Actually, in terms of appearance,

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,519
you're also my type.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,280
But...

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,480
But what?

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,159
You have a terrible personality.

8
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:36,719
Help!

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,399
Qi!

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,679
Qi!

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,840
Get that woman...

12
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,039
No way...

13
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,479
It's early in the morning and you're...

14
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:45,679
You...

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,880
Both of you...

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,119
Calm down.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,960
She gave me

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,600
all these things.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,640
I'm here for a door-to-door business.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
I have exclusive channels

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,960
for custom jade jewelry.

22
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,240
You're the only one

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,319
in all of Mangbei
who can afford these prices.

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:04,920
What do you think?

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,840
Interested?

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
Where did you get these?

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,920
Qi's wife gave them to me.

28
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,439
Her family owns a jewelry group.

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,040
Why are all the women
who like Qi filthy rich?

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,760
I wonder who's richer between you two.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
Zheng sold these to me yesterday.

32
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,400
Are you denying
you didn't give these to him?

33
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:36,920
Misunderstanding.

34
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,439
It's all a misunderstanding.

35
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,560
These goods

36
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,680
are sort of real.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,519
They're lab-grown, that's all.

38
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,040
Manipulating words like this
is just plain shady.

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,400
You're clearly making a fool of me.

40
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,200
Zheng,

41
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,680
I didn't mean it like that.

42
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,040
I didn't know
you were going to sell them.

43
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,359
How about this?

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,519
After I go back home,

45
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,079
I'll give you the real goods
as compensation.

46
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,519
Do you know people
who sell fake goods in Mangbei

47
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,799
will get their hands chopped off?

48
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,439
Don't scare her.

49
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,719
I'll compensate you
for the cost you paid.

50
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,719
You should be more cautious

51
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,000
when judging women.

52
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't mistake stones for jewels

53
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,639
and end up being played by a fake.

54
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,000
Who are you calling a fake?

55
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,759
Some people wear fakes
like they're real.

56
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,199
Others wear real ones
and still look fake.

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,840
I may not have your background.

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,240
But I'm not scared of you at all.

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,759
You should know who you're provoking.

60
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,879
If it weren't for my mercy,

61
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,879
you'd already be a nameless corpse

62
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,360
in a desolate wilderness.

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,919
Here.

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,400
Do it.

65
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,400
You shameless,

66
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,919
lying con artist!

67
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,360
Yeah, I'm a con artist.

68
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,080
I not only scam money.

69
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,520
I scam marriages too.

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,439
So?

71
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,840
Are you furious now?

72
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,319
You...

73
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,240
That's enough.

74
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,280
Calm down for a bit.

75
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,400
Take care of Chaya.

76
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,840
Let's go.

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,199
Stop right there!

78
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,520
Oh, my dear Young Lady Chaya.

79
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,319
Have a seat.

80
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,520
Sometimes,
stepping back is the way forward.

81
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,759
The deal may fall through.
But at least we're still friends, right?

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,759
So,

83
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,960
where are we going?

84
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,560
We're going to meet my uncle.

85
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,680
The General?

86
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,240
So suddenly?

87
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,039
I need to put together an outfit.

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,919
Let's go.

89
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,919
This outfit is for your uncle

90
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,199
as a gift for our first meeting.

91
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,520
And this one

92
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,800
is for Chaya

93
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,280
to smooth things over.

94
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,280
Sometimes, it feels amazing.

95
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,599
It feels like the whole journey
has been guided by some divine power.

96
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,680
Every danger turns out
to be a false alarm.

97
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,719
I feel so lucky.

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,639
So you do realize you're lucky, huh?

99
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,360
Well, luck has its methods.

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,439
How about

101
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,920
I teach you a way

102
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,199
to train your luck

103
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,399
and summon your guardian angel?

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,079
I'm not interested.

105
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,000
Not interested at all?

106
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Maybe a little?

107
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,560
Close your eyes.

108
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,959
Then do a countdown
from five in your mind.

109
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,079
You have to keep your eyes closed.

110
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,199
Come on, close your eyes.

111
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,439
Five.

112
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,519
Four.

113
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,319
Three.

114
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,439
Two.

115
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,079
One.

116
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,680
You, Little Liar.

117
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,079
Look at that crowd there.

118
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,439
I'm going to check it out.

119
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,040
Five.

120
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,759
Four.

121
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,360
Three.

122
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,600
Two.

123
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,759
One.

124
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,240
(Little Liar,)

125
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,959
(where are you?)

126
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,040
(Do you know)

127
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,680
(you're also my guardian angel?)

128
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,639
I was supposed

129
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,680
to perform this piece as a solo recital

130
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,879
in the Golden Hall today.

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,879
Who would've thought
it would end up like this?

132
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
Actually, I've heard

133
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,480
of this piece before.

134
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,959
How is that possible?

135
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,600
I've never performed

136
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,319
this piece publicly before.

137
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,279
Did you confuse it with something else?

138
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,600
I saw you close your eyes.

139
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,959
I wasn't. The sand got in my eyes.

140
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,000
I can't believe someone actually fell

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,920
for the nonsense I made up.

142
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,319
But honestly, people would believe me

143
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,800
every time I lie.

144
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,959
But then

145
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,120
I would feel guilty for deceiving them.

146
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,319
Even if they don't call me out,

147
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,839
I usually end up exposing myself.

148
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,600
Actually, some time ago...

149
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,660

from the very beginning!)
