3
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:15,599
Xiamo.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,600
Get in the car.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,190
Time to leave.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,160
Get out!

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,079
There's a bomb!

8
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:00,439
Bomb...

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,519
There's a bomb...

10
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:27,959
Xiamo!

11
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,760
Xiamo!

12
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,400
Are you okay, Xiamo?

13
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,000
Xiamo.

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,319
It's me, Xiamo.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,480
Help...

16
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:40,879
Help them.

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,250
I'll send you to the hospital first.

18
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,239
Don't worry.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,239
You'll be okay.

20
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,040
Help them...

21
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,599
Oh, you don't have to.

22
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,610
I can take care of this.

23
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,830
Even if it costs me everything,

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,680
I'll see it through.

25
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,639
Qi,

26
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,960
good thing I've got some skills.

27
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,240
One left hook

28
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,039
and a right kick.

29
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,680
We cared

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,919
for her like a precious flower.

31
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,000
But she acts like
she's the flower on a cow...

32
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,560
Sorry, slip of the tongue.

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
I didn't mean
to say you're the cow dung.

34
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,159
(When you've succeeded,)

35
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,600
(you have to let me be the godfather)

36
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,520
(of your future kids.)

37
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,120
(You need to learn to be grateful.)

38
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,719
Zheng is truly unfortunate.

39
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:52,960
The doctor said

40
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,800
if they had arrived earlier,

41
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,639
he could have survived.

42
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,840
I arrived too late.

43
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,200
The incident
is still under investigation.

44
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,600
But this phone could at least prove

45
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,480
that Su Xiamo was at the scene.

46
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,160
The car belongs to Li Qingfeng.

47
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,199
He said someone privately drove away

48
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,399
the car he was repairing.

49
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,319
Even the dashcam

50
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,519
had been removed in advance.

51
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,920
Where are Li Qingfeng and Xiamo now?

52
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,920
After a simple bandaging
at the hospital,

53
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,879
Su Xiamo regained consciousness.

54
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,399
The two of them

55
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,600
caught a flight back home that night.

56
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,800
(We've endured too many trials,)

57
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,879
(and I've caused
you countless troubles.)

58
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,399
(I think)

59
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,660
(it's time to put an end
to all of this.)

60
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,240
(If you need a more specific reason,)

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,120
(I cannot abandon Li Qingfeng)

62
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,040
(because of you.)

63
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,680
So this is the decent girl
you spoke highly of.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,680
She left without a word.

65
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,519
Wasn't it to cover for her brother?

66
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,920
I really hope Zheng's death

67
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,680
will finally make you give up
your fantasies

68
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,439
about this woman.

69
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,439
I absolutely won't allow you

70
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,240
to remain obsessed with her.

71
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,839
From now on,

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,519
I have no feelings for her.

73
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,319
If I have any,

74
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,079
it's only hatred.

75
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,410
No matter where she escapes,

76
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,199
I will find her.

77
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,199
I'll make her regret

78
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,879
everything she's done.

79
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,500
(Licheng.
One Year Later)

80
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,079
Are you okay?

81
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,279
I'm okay.

82
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,399
Aren't you supposed
to be at the board meeting?

83
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,279
Why are you here?

84
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,800
I'm worried about you.

85
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,079
I told you

86
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,160
not to wear stilettos.

87
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,610
They're bad for your ankles.

88
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,120
I'm not that fragile.

89
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,990
You don't have
to take care of me so carefully.

90
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,380
Next time, wear the shoes
I bought for you.

91
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,879
Okay.

92
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,190
I'll get going first.

93
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,040
You bumped into me.

94
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,959
Instead of apologizing,

95
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,190
you even stomped on my flowers.

96
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,560
Apologize, huh?

97
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,720
Is this enough?

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,720
You must be mad.

99
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,199
Next time,

100
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,319
remember to be careful.

101
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:53,959
Do I...

102
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,959
Do I know you?

103
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,560
(You bumped into me.)

104
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,860
(Instead of apologizing,
you even stomped on my flowers.)

105
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,920
(Do I know you?)

106
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,160
I spent an entire year

107
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,040
to appear before you

108
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
with my current status.

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,880
I can't believe you pretended
to have amnesia.

110
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,280
After they returned from Mangbei,

111
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,440
Li Qingfeng used Xiamo's identity

112
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,590
to secure the position
of Vice Chairman of the group.

113
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,559
Later, Mr. Li publicly claimed

114
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,039
that Xiamo had gone abroad to study.

115
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,660
Although they fabricated
a year's worth of academic records,

116
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,960
during that time,

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,990
the two of them traveled
across several countries.

118
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,840
If it was for medical treatment,

119
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,960
that would make sense.

120
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,200
But today,

121
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,920
she truly seems like a different person.

122
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,759
In the past,

123
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,200
she would've been relentless.

124
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,950
Then again,
she's always been good at acting.

125
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,039
About tonight's dinner...

126
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,799
Proceed with it.

127
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,159
Draft the contract.

128
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,399
I want to give Su Shide

129
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,559
a huge gift.

130
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:14,799
Yes.

131
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,519
Didn't you always forbid me
from getting involved

132
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,320
in these matters?

133
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,960
Why did you insist
on having me here today?

134
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,519
We're meeting
a major investor this time.

135
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,919
With his funding,

136
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
we can safely overcome

137
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,600
this financial crisis.

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,420
That means

139
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,200
I'm meeting my future boss, huh?

140
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,080
The owner of this company

141
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,519
is very low-profile.

142
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,990
We can't find any information
about him in the industry.

143
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,399
However, I heard

144
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,610
he once attended your performance
at the Golden Hall.

145
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,639
So he's kind of your fan.

146
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,759
That's why

147
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
I brought you along.

148
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,480
I see.

149
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,759
It's you?

150
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,799
Why?

151
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,490
Is that the expression you use
when you see an old friend?

152
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,759
No.

153
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,600
I was just reflecting on

154
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,559
how remarkable you are, Mr. Qi Chuan.

155
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,200
After experiencing such pain,

156
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,380
you still manage
to embrace a new beginning.

157
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,039
It must be no easy feat

158
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,610
to climb to the peak, right?

159
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,159
Isn't it the same for Miss Su?

160
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,519
Do

161
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,000
you know me?

162
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,279
Don't you remember?

163
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,440
Ah, I remember now.

164
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,080
We did meet before.

165
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,320
Your misfortune has nothing
to do with her.

166
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,960
If you have a problem, direct it to me.

167
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,440
Mr. Qi, you were the one
who bumped into me today, right?

168
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,300
Seeing how you throw money around,
you really are lavish.

169
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,240
I still hope

170
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,240
we can have a pleasant collaboration.

171
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,990
I sympathize with the misfortune

172
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,879
you've endured before.

173
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,960
But it has nothing to do with her.

174
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,200
She has lost that part of her memory.

175
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,879
She's now my fiancée.

176
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,080
I only want to catch up with Miss Su.

177
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,840
It doesn't matter
if you don't remember anything.

178
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,080
After all,

179
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,840
I've forgotten it all as well.

180
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,400
Let's get down to business.

181
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,799
This is our cooperation proposal.

182
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,320
How did you do it?

183
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,750
Do you mean how I achieve today's scale?

184
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,559
That's easy.

185
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,720
I acquired Jian Axin's assets.

186
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,960
Our company's current valuation

187
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,840
is ten times that of yours.

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,820
What are your terms?

189
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,080
Please enjoy.

190
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,000
This is a specialty drink from Mangbei

191
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,990
that I specifically prepared
for Miss Su.

192
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,320
Drink it.

193
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,180
From now on,
you can come and go as you please.

194
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,880
I won't stop you.

195
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,780
But once you step out that door,

196
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,919
it's a whole new world.

197
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,759
You need that courage.

198
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,080
Miss Su,

199
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,279
perhaps you can regain your memories

200
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,279
after having your favorite drinks.

201
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,879
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

202
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,840
It's indeed a flavor I enjoy.

203
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,440
May I be excused to use the restroom?
