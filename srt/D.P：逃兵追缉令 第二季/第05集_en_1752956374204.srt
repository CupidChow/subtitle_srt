What's going on with the USB?

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,780
We left it with a shop we know

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,990
through one
of our administrative soldiers.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,450
I trust you'll take good care of it.

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,870
It could be very important to us.

11
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,050
We've met, yeah?

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,020
I'm Seo Eun,
and I'll be your attorney from now on.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,730
I opened my law firm a week ago.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
But, um…

15
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,450
I'm pretty sure I didn't appoint
any attorney, though.

16
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,790
Well, you didn't appoint me
directly, yourself.

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,580
We're suing the government
for compensation.

18
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,090
And your case is part of it.

Soon you'll be handed
a death sentence by the court.

22
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,230
You want to be locked up behind bars
for your whole life?

23
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,190
I'm not doing this because I like you.

24
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,780
But I…

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,660
I-I killed people. I… I shot them, though.

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,620
And?

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,750
You will take all the fault?

28
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,380
Do you want that?

29
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,970
Yeah, but why would you want…

30
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,430
There's nobody else on your team.

31
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,520
Not even yourself.

32
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,770
Because of people like me.

33
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,930
The government
is also at fault here.

34
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,430
And if it's true,

35
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,100
and they are at fault…

36
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,980
then why didn't you do anything?

37
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,310
What?

38
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,610
If he was so kind and diligent,
why didn't you do anything…

39
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,530
…when he was getting bullied?

40
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,500
11. AN JUN-HO

41
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,380

43
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,850
But no matter what you do,
it can't be copied.

44
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,720
And you can't send the files.

45
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,980
Anyway, I just have to
give you back the USB, right?

46
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,900
Uh, yes.

47
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,230
All right, let me remove it, then.

48
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
Wait…

49
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,030
I'll have a quick look.

50
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,450

the wounded Corporal Jeong Hyeong-beom…"

63
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,510
It wasn't an immediate death,
but an injury?

64
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,400
"Died waiting for a rescue helicopter."

65
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,080

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,250

Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta--ta-ta…

76
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,630
Okay, so was it only
in this direction?

77
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,470
-My baby! My God!
-I didn't do anything good…

78
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,840
-Oh, my god!
-I'm so sorry.

79
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,430
Sergeant Jung, take pictures
of the left-hand side and then the right.

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,440

85
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,200
Corporal Jeong Hyeong-beom.

86
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,160
Yes.

87
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,170
As you witnessed
in the demonstration previous…

88
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,960
…during the first round of shots
fired by Kim Ru-ri,

89
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,550
Corporal Jeong Hyeong-beom
was shot in his thigh.

90
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,800
His femoral artery was penetrated,

91
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,760
-and he died immediately.
-Excuse me.

92
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,350
Was there no prompt action taken
before Corporal Jeong Hyeong-beom's death

93
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,190
and the desertion of Kim Ru-ri?

94
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,530
The death was immediate,
so what sort of prompt action do you mean?

95
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,820
Since you came
all the way out to this base,

96
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,660
you can appreciate how remote it is,

97
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,080
far from other bases
and medical facilities.

98
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,460
So the first reports
of the incident were delayed.

99
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,670
Excuse me.

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,460
From what I can tell,
Division Records give 11:37 p.m.

101
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,920
as the time the incident
was first recognized.

102
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,970
What I don't understand, though,

103
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,140
is the record stating that after
the officer on duty heard the gunshots,

104
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,520
he contacted Division Headquarters
through the emergency network.

105
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,850
Then that would mean that almost
an hour and a half just went by

106
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,060
-before the Response Team arrived.
-We're still…

107
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,450
still in the midst
of organizing the information.

108
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,620
So, please, wait a little bit longer.

109
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,950
-General, I have a question!
-I have a question.

110
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,620
-Aren't you taking questions?
-Why the delay in the autopsy results?

111
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,870
-Please respond.
-Boy, all these complete idiots.

112
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,340
-I have a question. Sir, please wait!
-One comment, please!

113
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,130
-General!
-Please answer our questions, sir.

114
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,840
Shouldn't you be answering
these questions?

115
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,760
Sir! Sir!

116
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,260
General, why won't you answer
our questions?

117
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,470
-General! General!
-Sir, one comment!

118
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,680
We have questions for you.

119
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,020
Shin Hye-yeon, right?

120
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,350
You're a manager
at the human rights organization?

121
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,610
I'm Seo Eun, and you and I
will be working together.

122
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,820
on the class action lawsuit.

123
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,980
Pleasure to meet you.

124
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,200
Ah, nice to meet you.

125
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,910
One thing.

126
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,290
If you continue to poke
and prod them so openly…

127
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,420
it might make things harder.

128
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,420
It's like… trying to hit
a rock with an egg.

129
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,550
What's so bad about that, though?

130
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,760
The egg will get…broken.

131
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,060
But it still leaves a remnant.

132
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,480
The rock will be covered in egg.

133
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,150
Okay. I didn't mean to offend you.

134
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,610
See you around.

135
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Go ahead.

136
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,790
Ms. Shin Hye-yeon?

137
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,170
Yes, that's correct.

138
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,420
I have a tip for you.

139
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,630
The information
about the Kim Ru-ri incident--

140
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,170
And who am talking with?

141
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,130
I'll tell you in person.

142
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,220
We have procedures here.
First, email the information to me…

143
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,470
The cause of death for Jeong Hyeong-beom…

144
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,100
was hypoglycemic shock.

145
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,730
It was excessive bleeding.

146
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,940
If they'd been fast…

147
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,530
No, if they'd taken action
even within an hour, he could have lived.

148
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,330
Well, if you want to seem credible,
you can't just…

149
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,790
-And if this is just a prank--
-Daejeon Memorial Park.

150
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,710
What?

151
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,010
The columbarium. That's where we'll meet.

152
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,510
And how do you know…

153
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,760
I'll call you again with a time.

154
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,570
Still can't contact him?

155
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,780
Jun-ho's family… Have you been calling?

156
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,240
There's nothing coming up
after the bus terminal.

157
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,500
And he gave fake numbers
for his whole family.

158
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,050
So, should I… call Captain Lim about this?

159
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,680
He's on vacation for right now.

160
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,720
He's been handling a lot
so leave him alone.

161
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,480
Pack your bags
and go home already, Mr. Civilian.

162
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,900
Don't make any stupid decisions.

163
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,610
The Military Service Act says,

164
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,490
the discharge of an active duty serviceman
may be postponed

165
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,830
in order to participate in exercises
or important trainings.

166
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,960
You mad bastard.

167
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,550
If Jun-ho has actually deserted,

168
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,340
who else can track him down?

169
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,300
I have to agree with him.

170
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,180
Shit.

171
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
I mean, this is way too much.

172
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,230
How many times are you going to call?

173
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,110
I said I don't know.

174
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,950
How many times do I have to say it?

175
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,120
I really don't know.

176
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,370
It doesn't matter if he's my brother.

177
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,870
I keep trying to tell you, I don't know.

178
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,630
Stop calling me.

179
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,050
Hey, Mom, have you spoken to him?

180
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,470
Seriously, Jun-ho deserted?

181
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,350
What's his problem?

182
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,850
What a thoughtless bastard.

183
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,060
Your brother is not a thoughtless person.

184
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,440
Mom!

185
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,480
Are you taking my brother's side?

186
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,820
Gosh, I wish I was born first.

187
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,530
Come on.

188
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,070
Again?

189
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,290
Let me answer it.

190
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,590
I've been waiting for you.

191
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,800
And not anyone else.

192
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,180
Since you're his friend.

193
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,980
I'm very sorry.

194
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,400
Jun-ho…

195
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,990
We need to bring Jun-ho back.
I think that will be safe.

196
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,870
So if Jun-ho happened to call you--

197
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,620
Tell me something first, then.

198
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,950
Did Jun-ho…

199
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,290
do something really wrong?

200
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,590
Uh, no.

201
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,050
He hasn't done anything bad.

202
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,100
But the thing is…

203
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,430
he could be in danger.

204
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,020
We can't let him be in danger.

205
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,690
Jun-ho came by here.

206
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,280
Did he? You spoke with him, then?

207
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,460
MOM, I'M OKAY
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO DO

208
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,050
I'LL GET IT DONE AND THEN GO BACK

209
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,010
Just as we expected.

210
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,680
What we were afraid of.

211
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,680
What is he trying to do?

212
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,720
I'll just make one call.

213
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,690
Gi-yeong, hello.
We talked with Jun-ho's mother.

214
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,230
And Jun-ho did come by here.

215
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,610
Yeah. If you look closely,
this male is a lot larger than the female.

216
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,030
Ma'am,
try not to worry too much.

217
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,990
We'll do everything we can to find him.

218
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,590
Mmm. Mmm…

219
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,800
I have missed eating beef.

220
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,760
-Mmm…
-Well, eat up.

221
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,340
After all, this is your tax money.

222
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,270
You have such a nice way
of putting things.

223
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,690
Ah! A meal with no pressure?

224
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,570
Sounds good to me. Okay, yeah.

225
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,500
It's tax money, yeah?

226
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,040
No pressure once again.

227
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,250
It feels pretty absurd
to be saying this here,

228
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,590
but your son's a…

229
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,180
-Sit.
-…pitiful bastard.

230
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,340
Don't worry about another man's son.

231
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,600
-But you, I'm worried about.
-Yes, one moment.

232
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,640
Just because I tell you things,
you think you can capture my son?

233
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,730
Hmm?

234
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,770
Uh, can we have some more sauce?

235
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,940
Let's hear what you got for me.

236
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,120
It seems An Jun-ho is trying
to leak the information on the USB drive.

237
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,530
It could influence the lawsuit.

238
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,370
We have to take care of it,
no matter what.

239
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,830
But the USB can't be copied,
so as long as we catch him, we're good.

240
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,170
Wait a minute.

241
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,760
I thought of somewhere to go.

242
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,510
For certainty.

243
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,970
Keep on checking the list of classmates
and all the locations from his mother.

244
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,100
-And track his location.
-His cards, keep checking his debit cards.

245
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,600
And stay on top of that fake email too.

246
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,150
The IP should be traceable.

247
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,150
Yes, okay.

248
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,570
Hey, but…

249
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,490
You think any of this
will help us find him?

250
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,450
I don't. Only because
he was trained by the best.

251
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,570
Little shit.

252
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,620
Then do the other thing.

253
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,120
-I'm sorry, sir?
-You know, your method.

254
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,540
Do that Hollywood thing.

255
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,840
Oh, you want me to do an embodiment?

256
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,960
Yeah, so we can get into his head.

257
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,600
If I were him, then…

258
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,850
then I'd be calling me, right now.

259
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,480
Are you insane?

260
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,270
Calling a D.P. as you're deserting?

261
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,780
Hello?

262
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,650
Sergeant Han, it's An Jun-ho.

263
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,320
Hey, you crazy bastard!
Where are you? Get back now!

264
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,670
I know you're with Sergeant Park.

265
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,050
Is it just the two of you?

266
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,880
It's just us.

267
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,840
Hey, Jun-ho.

268
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,800
Well, obviously,
I don't understand your motivations.

269
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,390
-That USB--
-Sir, did you know about this?

270
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,350
What about it?

271
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,060
If you'd seen what was on the USB…

272
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,070
you'd have done the same thing as me.

273
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,370
Hey, Jun-ho.

274
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,870
About the contents,
I swear I had no information.

275
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,920
GI-YEONG, TALKING TO JUN-HO ON PHONE
TRACE LOCATION

276
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,960
I won't say something pathetic
like, "Some things can't be helped."

277
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,590
All right?

278
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,630
But we…

279
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,180
It is our duty to keep you safe.

280
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,680
This isn't something you can handle, punk!

281
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,770
Don't be a savior.

282
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,640
-Then who's going to?
-What?

283
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,110
If it just can't be helped, after all,

284
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,610
If that's the problem…

285
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,700
then who the hell
is gonna deal with it, huh?

286
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,370
Hey, Jun-ho, why is this your business?

287
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,460
Jun-ho, I'm going to capture you.

288
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,330
I really have to.

289
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,800
I know you have to.

290
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,130
You just wait and see.

291
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,680
Seriously, why?

292
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,560
Why does it have to be you?

293
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,190
I don't know either.

294
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,650
Do you think
you'll be at ease if you do this?

295
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,880
Do we have his location yet?

296
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,880
Let me check.

297
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,180
You know how good I am, right?

298
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,190
It's a café near Gwangmyeong Subway.

299
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,940
If he's at a station,

300
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,690
it looks like he's trying to go somewhere.

301
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,530
Call Gwangmyeong Subway and ask them
for cooperation, then report back to us.

302
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,450
No, no.

303
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,410
What you suspect, just go with it.
Report to me later.

304
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,040
Sir, I'll meet expectations.

305
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,790
You heard that?

306
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,420
Yes, I'm already expediting, sir!

307
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,260
Yes, very good.
You're becoming more like me.

308
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,520
Hello, this is Corporal Heo Gi-yeong.

309
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,890
Hey, Gi-yeong.
Come to my office for a minute.

310
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,060
Right now, sir?

311
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,310
Yes, right now.

312
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,570
Just hearing that from you is an honor.

313
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,110
Hello, sir, Corporal Heo reporting
to Commander's Office for…

314
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,410
Gi-yeong!

315
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,700
What took you so long to get here?

316
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,540
So you're Corporal Heo?

317
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,220
Have you found
An Jun-ho's location?

318
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,400
Attention!

319
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,730
Attention!

320
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,070
An Jun-ho of the 103rd Division D.P. Team
has deserted.

321
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,120
An officer tasked by the
Ministry of Defense to capture deserters

322
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,030
has become a deserter himself,

323
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,080
after stealing classified documents
on a thumb drive.

324
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,000
I want you to think
about what a grave threat

325
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,920
to national security we could be facing.

326
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,880
Yes, sir!

327
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,260
This has not been reported officially yet.

328
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,050
Currently, you're the only ones
with knowledge about this incident at all.

329
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,180
First principle is?

330
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,100
If you can't stop it, be sure
to make it so that it never happened.

331
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,560
Make sure to bring him in.

332
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,820
And whatever happens today,
you won't be on the hook for it.

333
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,030
That's it.

334
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,280
Sir!

335
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,880
I'm an hour away.

336
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,040
You're going to be there as well?

337
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,800
Yes. I'll be there on time.

338
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,640
Please check once more
that nobody's following you.

339
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,060
We're familiar with this kind situation.

340
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,850
But if what you told me is true,

341
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,850
this could potentially be
our lawsuit's biggest weapon.

342
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,110
So you should be careful as well.

343
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,950
Okay.

344
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
We'll meet soon.

345
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,660
One question.

346
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,910
How could you have known
about that columbarium?

347
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,170
Passengers taking
the KTX 203 train to Daejeon,

348
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,880
please get to platform.

349
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,920
The train will be departing shortly.

350
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,170
Well, uh…

351
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,340
I'll tell you all about that
when we meet as well.

352
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,770
Attention, passengers…

353
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,810
That's him, right?

354
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,400
We've located him, sir.

355
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,950
There's video footage of him
purchasing a train ticket for Daejeon.

356
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,860
Yes.

357
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,370
I understand.

358
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,790
An Jun-ho has boarded
the KTX train number 201.

359
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,120
All soldiers gather.

360
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,370
Team A, gather!

361
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,420
-Alpha, standby inside the train.
-Go!

362
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,130
Additional troops,
go to Gwangmyeong Station as planned.

363
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,590
Enter platforms cars one and six
from both directions.

364
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,300
An Jun-ho is the D.P.
with the highest arrest rate

365
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,640
in the entire division.

366
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,560
He will know exactly
how we plan to pursue him.

367
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,810
And he's also a skilled fighter.

368
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,440
Do not let your guard down for one moment.

369
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,690
Yes, sir.

370
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,690
Backup team is in place.
They'll jump in at the end.

371
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,890
-What do you say I try driving--
-You little punk, focus on navigating.

372
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,970
Who takes this path to the countryside?

373
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,150
Shit.

374
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,830
MILITARY USE
AUXILIARY STORAGE UNIT

375
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,350
Can I borrow your lighter?

376
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,430
You can keep it. I have another one.

377
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,910
Oh, my boy!

378
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,540
No! Woo-suk!

379
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,630
No!

380
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,300
Woo-suk!

381
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,870
If we all catch him,
must we split the reward?

382
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,540
What?

383
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,330
Wouldn't you agree, huh?

384
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,580
The two of us can capture him
instead of all 15 soldiers.

385
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,040
-So that must--
-Have you finally lost your fucking mind?

386
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,670
Hey.

387
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,550
Working on the outside, it's made you
forget about taking orders?

388
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,470
Huh?

389
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,970
Know your fucking place, goddamn it.

390
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
Sorry, sir.

391
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,360
That fucking little bastard.

392
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,610
That motherfucker wouldn't be able
to look me in the eye

393
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,860
If we'd met outside.

394
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,030
Shit!

395
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,490
Damn it.

396
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,990
Yeah?

397
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,160
It's occupied.

398
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,880
Forgive me.

399
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,790
Oh, fuck.

400
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,010
Shit.

401
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,770
Hey, you motherfucker!
Appreciate the reward, huh?

402
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,150
Ow!

403
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,780
Shit!

404
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,320
Son of a bitch!

405
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,690
Hey.

406
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,730
You're already dead meat, my good friend.

407
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,360
Fuck!

408
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,450
Do you even know how many soldiers
are coming after you now?

409
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,290
This train will soon
be arriving at Cheonan-Asan Station.

410
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,290
Please prepare.

411
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,890
Why didn't you just bring
sashimi knives with you?

412
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,800
Salute!

413
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,010
Are you trying to advertise
what we're doing here?

414
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,470
Put those away!

415
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,350
Get your shit together, you idiots.

416
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,150
Get prepared.

417
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,190
Sir!

418
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,740
Passengers taking
the KTX 203 train to Daejeon,

419
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,120
please go to Platform Number One.

420
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,630
Passengers taking
the KTX 203 train to Daejeon,

421
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,840
please go to Platform Number One.

422
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,560
This phone
is currently turned off.

423
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,900
After the beep, your call
will be forwarded to voicemail

424
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,270
and additional charges will be applied.

425
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,190
Damn it.

426
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,940
A Team's phones are turned off.

427
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,450
A Team, respond. A Team.

428
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,230
I'm sorry.

429
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,400
Stupid idiots, Jesus.

430
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,450
Thank you.

431
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,710
Look at that son of a bitch.

432
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,590
Everyone, off this train now!

433
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,630
-Hurry up, get on! Come on and run!
-Yes, sir!

434
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,140
-Sir, yes, sir!
-Sir!

435
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,140
Hurry up!

436
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,770
Get on, get on!

437
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,390
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

438
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,320
Private An Jun-ho, let's go.

439
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,910
I said let's go.

440
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,370
Target spotted.
All units, ready for action.

441
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,880
I'm sorry to do this.

442
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,550
Get him.

443
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,220
Get him!

444
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,810
Shit!

445
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,640
Goddamn it.

446
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,350
Get him!

447
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,230
Goddamn it!

448
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,150
Shit!

449
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,480
Curse this!

450
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,120
Hey!

451
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,380
Shit!

452
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,030
Shit!

453
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,120
Open the goddamn door!

454
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,070
Ah, shit!

455
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,170
Open this!

456
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,170
Open it!

457
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,510
Shit!

458
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,920
This train
will soon be arriving in Daejeon.

459
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,670
You son of a--

460
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,050
Thank you.

461
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,600
Hey, you went through a lot, asshole.

462
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,640
Damn it.

463
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,360
Hey.

464
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,570
What are you…

465
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,360
Are you trying to catch him
or beat a man to death?

466
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,320
Let go.

467
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,870
-Let go, asshole!
-Why would you beat him up?

468
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,290
Hello, Sergeant.

469
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,410
You are on board
a Mugunghwa-ho train headed for Busan.

470
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,130
The train will be departing shortly.

471
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,460
Please check you belongings.

472
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,340
You… bastard.

473
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,920
Ah!

474
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,100
Let go.

475
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,180
We are now departing. Thank you.

476
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,350
Let go.

477
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,190
You little…

478
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,360
Stop it!

479
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,120
Why are you beating him?

480
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,540
Park Beom-gu.

481
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,800
You're gonna take responsibility for this.

482
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,010
This whole entire affair.

483
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,890
Yes, I will.

484
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,180
I apologize.

485
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,480
Backup team, what's your location?

486
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,870
Attention, please.

487
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,700
The next train will be arriving soon.

488
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,540
Hey, Jun-ho!

489
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:17,800
…Cheonan, Pyeongtaek, Suwon, and Seoul,
please go to Platform Number Three,

490
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,340
and please stand clear of the yellow line.

491
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,050
An Jun-ho!

492
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:28,180
Again, the next train will be arriving
on Platform Number Three shortly.

493
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,640
Hey.

494
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,390
You made another mess, didn't you?

495
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,980
…please go platform Number Three.

496
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,730
Why are you here?

497
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,570
You bastard.

498
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,070
Exactly.

499
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,530
What do you think I'm doing here?

500
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,500
Shit!

501
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,460
Oh…

502
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,920
Have you totally lost your fucking mind?

503
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,750
Oh, shit.

504
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,210
Goddamn it!

505
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,150
You're only making it worse.

506
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,330
Shit.

507
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:41,460
SHIN WOO-SUK

508
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,320
EVIDENCE
ITEM USED TO COMMIT SUICIDE

509
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,830
One question.

510
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,330
How could you have known
about that columbarium?

511
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,750
I'll tell you all about that
when we meet as well.

512
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:13,550
I'M SORRY
