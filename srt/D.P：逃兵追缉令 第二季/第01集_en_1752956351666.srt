00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,010
EVERY MALE CITIZEN
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,140
SHALL FAITHFULLY PERFORM
MANDATORY MILITARY SERVICE

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,350
ARTICLE 3 OF THE MILITARY SERVICE ACT

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,850
I said get back!

5
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,620
SPECIAL DUTY TEAM

6
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,020
Jun-ho.

7
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,980
The kids won't know me after this.

8
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,490
You take responsibility.

9
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,850
7. THE RAINS

10
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,830
Hello, sir.

11
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,910
-So, what's going on?
-I'm sorry, sir.

12
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,950
We've been investigating this
for months,

13
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,540
and you can't even get one signature?

14
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,750
ROK ARMED FORCES HEADQUARTERS

15
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,590
Ah, you fucking morons
can't do a single thing right.

16
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,630
-Ah, damn it.
-Sir.

17
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,800
I said to get this done today.

18
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,050
Sorry, sir.

19
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,050
Are you going to ruin my day off?

20
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,890
Sorry, sir. We tried to have it done but…

21
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,230
I told my grandson
I'd build LEGOs with him today.

22
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,150
Put it together.

23
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,940
Yes, sir, I will.

24
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,330
-Sir!
-Sir!

25
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,360
HIGH PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
MILITARY INVESTIGATOR'S ROOM

26
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,860
OH MIN-U

27
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,240
What's with all the rain?

28
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,120
Okay. Shall we begin
another thrilling morning?

29
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,050
Just give us your signature
and you can go home.

30
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,970
D.P. Team Chief for the 103rd Division…

31
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,430
Sergeant First Class…

32
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,850
Park Beom-gu, ready?

33
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,940
In October 2014,
Private Shin Woo-suk of the 103rd Division

34
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,560
committed suicide by burning
charcoal briquettes inside his motel room.

35
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,110
On the 11th of the following month,

36
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,530
Private First Class
Choi Jun-mok, Infantry,

37
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,700
was apprehended on Subway Line 2.

38
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,080
Private First Class Jeong Hyeon-min,
CDC's deserter, was apprehended in Busan.

39
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,050
But you failed to apprehend
Sergeant Heo Chi-do of the Recon Unit.

40
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,680
Up to that point, your record wasn't bad.

41
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,180
But the end was the absolute worst.

42
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,260
My God.

43
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,850
In the Cho Suk-bong case,
based on the testimonies

44
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,610
of other soldiers and commanding officers,

45
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,440
it would appear Cho Suk-bong
was suffering from mental illness.

46
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,320
As a result of this illness,
he deserted on impulse,

47
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,370
thus lowering morale
and risking the lives of many soldiers

48
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,040
through criminal acts
and suicidal behavior…

49
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,580
Suk-bong suffered
from a mental illness?

50
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,210
I don't agree with the assessment.

51
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,010
I started out in the military
as a soldier in the 103rd Division.

52
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,890
And every day, I was beaten
from morning to night.

53
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,560
I was tortured
with the officer's toothpaste cap.

54
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,650
During lunch, they'd hit me
with a tray until it bent in half.

55
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,240
Why do you think
I became non-commissioned?

56
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,330
I thought I would get beaten less.

57
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,620
But superior staff
still kicked in my shins,

58
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,380
and they'd slap me in the living quarters,

59
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,750
and the sick part is that

60
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,840
the abuse will always get worse,
never better--

61
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,340
Sergeant Park Beom-gu, hey.

62
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,430
That's right. I thought I might develop
a mental illness, too,

63
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,260
unless I already have one of those.

64
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,140
If so, is all of that my responsibility?

65
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,270
Hey, Park Beom-gu.

66
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,410
Hey.

67
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,210
What?

68
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,130
You wanted a statement.

69
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,130
Hello!

70
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,090
Gosh! What a way to start the day. Huh?

71
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,930
Is this a bad time?

72
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,480
Hey, Mr. Warrant Officer,
we'll go and have a cup of coffee.

73
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,770
Ah, this weather is crazy.

74
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,690
It'd be rough in a couple of days
when they say we have to fix the trenches…

75
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,320
Jesus!

76
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,580
Ah, that fucking asshole.

77
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,540
He didn't even offer you
an instant coffee?

78
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,500
He's a warrant officer for Christ's sake.

79
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,590
I thought you were disciplined
and had to resign.

80
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,550
But I guess you found a way
to survive still.

81
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,760
Well, I didn't bust my ass
in the military academy just to get fired.

82
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,520
I heard that those connections
you make last forever.

83
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,230
Must be.

84
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,400
What are you even going on about?
I'm still unassigned here.

85
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,150
Sitting around in an office
that's like a military prison.

86
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,540
Sergeant Park.

87
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,540
I really don't want to be saying this.

88
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,130
Then don't say it. Right?

89
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,000
Jeez, come on.

90
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,710
God…

91
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,550
The Suk-bong case…

92
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,970
needs to be concealed.

93
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,730
Okay?

94
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,900
I mean, if you don't agree
to the written statement

95
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,320
and this goes to trial,
it's over for our division,

96
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,480
and you and me.

97
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,910
For Han Ho-yeol and An Jun-ho, too.

98
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,740
It's the right thing. Okay?

99
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,580
Talking to myself again.

100
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,960
Jeez, I wonder if the boys
are doing all right.

101
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,730
Salute. Private An speaking.

102
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,080
Yes, I'll be right there.

103
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,880
Huh? Jeez, I can't believe this.

104
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,930
We need to be on the same page.

105
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,430
Oh, he's here.

106
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,100
That was a long wait.

107
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,770
My apologies.

108
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,650
Here you are.

109
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,480
Goodness. It's wet. This is all wet.

110
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,070
It's not like you made
the workbook yourself.

111
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,780
Jeez.

112
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,410
Mom, let's hurry up,
it's time for my academy.

113
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,040
It's that late?

114
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,540
Good work.

115
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,790
Hurry up, already.

116
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,100
413 DAYS UNTIL DISCHARGE

117
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,400
You're crazy.

118
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,990
You fucking son of a bitch.
You think your duties are a joke?

119
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
I'm sorry, sir?

120
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,370
Dipshit, you heard clearly.

121
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,000
There's no hot water.

122
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,290
You might have your business outside,
but aren't you in charge of the boiler?

123
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,920
But, sir, that's just impossible,
I checked it before I--

124
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,590
Hey, you fucking shit, you back talking?

125
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,590
You fucking son of a moron.
Do you have a death wish? Look.

126
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,850
Hey, are you saying, like, I broke it
on purpose to fuck with you? Is that it?

127
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,270
Huh?

128
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,350
Hey.

129
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,110
Are you bullshitting to avoid it?

130
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,150
No, I'm not. I'll get it fixed, sir.

131
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,160
Shit.

132
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,990
That buddy-fucking trash motherfucker.

133
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,920
Isn't Heo Gi-yeong
such a fucking moron?

134
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,210
That asshole Gi-yeong
needs a good beating.

135
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,130
Hey, take care of him, okay?

136
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,760
-Yes, sir.
-Was that prick? Damn.

137
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,850
Sorry, I just need a minute
to check the boiler.

138
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,110
Do I know you?
Who are you to salute to us?

139
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,730
-What?
-Hey.

140
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,820
-Yeah?
-What are you doing?

141
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,740
Who are you talking to right now?

142
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,700
Why is this stuff on the floor?

143
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,990
Hey, you see a ghost or something?

144
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,460
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

145
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,590
Now… look over there
and say "motherfucker," okay?

146
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,840
-Uh…
-Just say it, bastard.

147
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,420
What? What is it, huh?
Cat got your tongue?

148
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,770
Motherfucker.

149
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,190
Good job, good job.

150
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,020
-Let's go?
-Yes, sir.

151
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,940
Damn, that was fucking funny.

152
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,860
That trash needs to learn his lesson.

153
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,080
NINTH MP COMMANDER
LTC CHUN YONG-DUK

154
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,990
TENTH MP COMMANDER
LTC YANG DU-GWAN

155
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,920
Just why won't that smell go away?

156
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,250
Jun-ho.

157
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,250
Good work running that errand.

158
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,550
Sir, it was no problem.

159
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,130
Ah, well… My wife is just
so serious over our son's education.

160
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,550
It's really a pain.

161
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,100
Right then.

162
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,520
Also, what is his name?
The original D.P. team leader?

163
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,900
-Han Ho-yeol was the team leader.
-Right.

164
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,570
How does he spend more time
in the hospital than over here?

165
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,780
Has it been three months now?

166
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,990
Is he faking it or something?

167
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,320
Well, anyway.

168
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,950
Eventually, we need to fill that position.

169
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,790
Hmm?

170
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,580
Speaking of which,

171
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,090
Jun-ho, since you're such
an experienced ace,

172
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,960
you should take over as leader.

173
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,130
And Se-ung…

174
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,300
Private Park Se-ung!

175
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,390
…can join you, and you'll work
as a team from now on.

176
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,390
Does that sound good? Hmm?

177
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,730
-I'm not even a corporal, though…
-Private Park Se-ung!

178
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,100
Sounds good, yes?

179
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,150
So then, what do you think?

180
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,820
Private Park Se-ung!

181
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,320
-Great.
-Private Park Se-ung!

182
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,490
So reliable.

183
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,910
Private Park Se-ung!

184
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,450
Yes, all right.

185
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:25,950
Good luck!

186
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,500
MILITARY POLICE COMMANDER'S OFFICE

187
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,340
Jun-ho!

188
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,060
You've grown up a lot
to have a junior under you.

189
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,020
Even so…

190
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,940
you can't forget me, okay?

191
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,740
Do you understand?

192
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,470
What is this?
You're weaseling your way out again?

193
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,680
-What about the boiler?
-Sir, it's working fine.

194
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,850
I'll check again when I get back.

195
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,770
MILITARY POLICE

196
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,770
And him? The new guy became a D.P., yeah?

197
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,810
Yes, sir, he did.

198
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,860
Hey, new guy. You know
what D. P. means, new guy?

199
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,110
Private Park Se-ung.

200
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,280
-The meaning of D.P. is…
-Yes?

201
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,030
…Deserter Pursuit.

202
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,740
The team responsible
for arresting escaped soldiers.

203
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,040
You're wrong, idiot.
D.P. stands for…

204
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,620
Dipshit Prick.

205
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Careful.

206
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,420
This guy will give you a serious beating.

207
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,890
Salute.

208
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,930
Salute!

209
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,780
Excuse me, sir?

210
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,110
Is 1993 the year you were born?

211
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,280
Yes, that's right.

212
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,320
I was also born then.

213
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,080
I, um…

214
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,670
Somebody said to me, uh…

215
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,170
we could speak informally
when we're out, so…

216
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,890
I'm sorry, sir! Never mind!

217
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,220
Okay. Speak informally.

218
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,940
Wait for me, Jun-ho.

219
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,820
Which month, though?

220
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,370
Since it's your first time in,
I'll just explain the basics.

221
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,160
Wow, okay.

222
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,910
It's not hard, but if you
have questions, just ask.

223
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,830
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

224
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,880
Just learn slowly,
one thing at a time.

225
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,010
-Hello, sir.
-Hey, welcome back.

226
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,880
Wow, it's been a long time without this.

227
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,720
Oh, I missed this smell.

228
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,730
So as the name suggests,
D.P. pursues deserters.

229
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,890
That's what the team is about.

230
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,150
-Hmm.
-Uh…

231
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,520
Okay.

232
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,990
Deserters will normally use their log-ins
to play a game,

233
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,110
or so they can email their girlfriends.

234
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,280
But hey, Jun-ho…

235
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,370
I don't really need
to know all this, okay?

236
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,330
What?

237
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,040
I felt cooped up,
and so I asked to be sent out here.

238
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,340
The Captain already handled things
through my father.

239
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,550
I heard how you D.P. soldiers
leave every morning after roll call.

240
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,800
You live a sweet life
since you get to leave.

241
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,600
Now you get to come out like this as well,
every day until you're released.

242
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,390
Isn't that amazing?

243
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,560
How do you drink your coffee? Hot? Iced?

244
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,110
How much ice?

245
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,820
You do drink it iced, right?

246
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,490
You seem like an iced coffee
kind of guy. You just look like one.

247
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,990
And what about the deserters?

248
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,530
Let them be.

249
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,790
When it's time to go home,
it doesn't really matter if I catch them.

250
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,160
My time won't be extended
or get shorter either.

251
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,330
And to be honest,
let's say I go out there,

252
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,250
arrest somebody who might want to get
some type of revenge, you know.

253
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,550
What happens after that?

254
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,300
Who's responsible then?

255
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,630
You agree?

256
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,510
Yeah, sounds about right.

257
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,010
Obviously, jeez.

258
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,520
Die, die! Good luck in the next life.

259
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,890
Damn it.

260
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,540
Yeah, I'm doing fine.
They're all fucking suckers.

261
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,510
Yeah. Really, you know, in here, just…

262
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,760
All I have to do is act and play the fool

263
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,890
to have everybody just eating
out of my hand.

264
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,520
Yeah, that's right.

265
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,440
Yeah, I mean I have an immediate senior

266
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,730
but I buttered him up a little,
and he fell for it.

267
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,690
That weak bastard, honestly.

268
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,610
I'm really gonna take him down a notch.

269
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,740
I will, but damn,
I'm just feeling things out right now.

270
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,910
That son of a bitch! Yeah!

271
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,510
Damn it.

272
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,310
Hey, Horseshit Heo.

273
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,520
It must be great for you, Mr. Horseshit,
to have people looking out for you.

274
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,900
What late-night snack
is it today? Oven-roasted hotteok?

275
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,700
An orange-flavored drink, sir.

276
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,580
You fucker. I said to bring me
the apple ones. I like apples.

277
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,950
He like apples.

278
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,540
Hey, you fucking bitch.

279
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,880
Just because you hang around
those D.P. bitches,

280
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,470
you think you're somebody now?

281
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,090
Suk-bong…

282
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,680
died because of you shits, okay?

283
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,060
You bastards made all that fuss
about catching him

284
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,140
and our specialty team was dispersed.

285
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,060
And the atmosphere got really fucked up.

286
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,020
Right?

287
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,440
Why do you pretend
to be a victim like that?

288
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,780
Well, you little bastard?

289
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,740
Back when Hwang Jang-soo was all over him,

290
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,700
you were right there bullying him, too.

291
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,080
You little…

292
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,200
This bastard
has some fucking nerve.

293
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,870
You better watch your mouth.

294
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,290
Hey.

295
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,340
Watch yourself.

296
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,670
-Stomp on him.
-Stomp on him.

297
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,130
-You son of a bitch!
-Go join in.

298
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,340
You fucking bitch!

299
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,390
-Got some fucking nerve, moron.
-Son of a bitch!

300
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,800
-Hey, get up.
-You little shit!

301
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,970
-Moron!
-What a bitch.

302
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,060
Son of a bitch.

303
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,440
How do you fucking like that?

304
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,480
Stupid bitch.

305
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,040
Jun-ho-kun.

306
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,840
Nothing has changed at all.

307
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,340
Not one bit.

308
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,020
I asked you…

309
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,310
to take responsibility.

310
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,570
You beat the shit
out of that Horseshit Heo.

311
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,490
Good job.

312
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,580
Well, the rod
always works better.

313
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,910
And what's with this bastard?

314
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,460
Hey. Aren't you on duty?

315
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,500
I guess he finally lost his goddamn mind.

316
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,000
Hey, what are you doing?

317
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,920
I asked what you're doing,
you fucking bitch.

318
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,260
Why did you do that?

319
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,670
What?

320
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,970
Why did you beat up Corporal Heo Gi-yeong?

321
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,350
Ah, you saw that?

322
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,520
Then can you tell me
why you just got hit by me?

323
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,190
Jesus, there's just no hope
for this worthless piece of trash.

324
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,610
Hey.

325
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,530
You must think you're some kind of
special and distinguished bastard, right?

326
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,740
But you're a measly soldier
doing grunt work same as everyone,

327
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,700
so what makes you act like that?

328
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,130
And how have I been acting?

329
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,750
Do you have to be such a little bitch?

330
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,180
Fucking little bitch!

331
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,180
So if I tell you
not to hit somebody,

332
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,810
If I say it's wrong, morally…

333
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,770
Does that…

334
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,030
make me worthless?

335
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,700
You belong in prison.

336
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,160
Private An Jun-ho?

337
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:28,760
Cuff me.

338
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,100
That's your duty.

339
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,480
What?

340
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,270
Cuff me, I said.

341
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,120
Hey, An Jun-ho!
What's going on?

342
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,710
What's going on here, you bastards?

343
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,800
Well, you made
the right decision.

344
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,720
I feel bad for Suk-bong,
but we have to put it on him.

345
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,060
CHO SUK-BONG WAS IN AN UNSTABLE STATE
AND TOOK HWANG JANG-SOO HOSTAGE

346
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,690
HE SUFFERED FROM A MENTAL ILLNESS

347
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,860
PETITIONER PARK BEOM-GU

348
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,920
Can I please have a cigarette?

349
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,990
This really is
the right thing to do, isn't it?

350
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,200
For the boys?

351
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,090
Yes, of course.

352
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,620
Hmm?

353
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,130
This is a real situation!

354
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,630
-Alpha Company, Alpha Company!
-Second Platoon!

355
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,970
Hey, what's happening here?

356
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,220
-Sir.
-Sir.

357
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,180
There's just been a mass shooting
at the 18th Armored Brigade.

358
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,470
The shooter still seems to be
in the garrison area.

359
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,470
What?

360
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,850
The personal details
of the perpetrator, sir.

361
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,110
What are you doing?

362
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,070
What? Who is it?

363
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,030
What? No fucking way.

364
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,950
Alpha Company, run, run, run!

365
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,420
Open your eyes, fat-ass!
Open them!

366
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,800
Is your mother a fat-ass too?

367
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,180
-Fat-ass…
-That fucker.

368
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,970
Hey, Hyeong-beom.

369
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,730
Based on our report,
Private Cho has had…

370
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,650
Hey, fat-ass.

371
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,520
…not have known the difference
between reality…

372
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,400
You should have changed before roll call,
you worthless piece of shit.

373
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,990
Hey, Hyeong-beom,
you better train your junior.

374
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,620
He needs to be better than you are.

375
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,450
The suspect, Private Cho,
was a Military Police soldier…

376
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,910
You fat-ass fuck.

377
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,670
Sources say Cho
had trouble adjusting to army life

378
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,790
and had been receiving special treatment.

379
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,960
Did you shoot yourself in the head, too?

380
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,210
…difficulties,
it has now come to light,

381
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,880
was a history of mental illness
and depression.

382
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,840
Why can't you get anything right?

383
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,110
…has left the public in shock…

384
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,950
You kept your ammunition?

385
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,870
…hit by a car and badly injured.
Military authorities…

386
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,790
What are you… doing?

387
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,310
STOP HARASSING YOUR COMRADES

388
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
Salute!

389
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,500
Se-ung, about yesterday, I…

390
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,670
Private Park Se-ung!

391
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,550
Sir, about before,
I'm really sorry about what happened.

392
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,590
Please forgive me!

393
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:43,970
Se-ung, it's not that--

394
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,680
It's just I don't really know anything,

395
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,430
and that's why I acted
that way last night.

396
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,890
I'm so sorry about it.

397
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,650
Se-ung…

398
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:54,650
Salute!

399
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,240
Hey, D.P.s, you should get ready
to head out now.

400
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,280
Jeez. An armed deserter is loose.

401
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,740
Re…

402
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,460
Really? Really, an armed deserter?

403
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,500
Does that mean
he has a gun?

404
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,750
There was a shooting in the barracks.

405
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:18,920
Wait…

406
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:23,010
Do D.P. soldiers also handle all that?

407
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,510
What happened?

408
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,220
Who was…

409
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,640
How is something
like this even possible?

410
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,190
Se-ung, sorry, can you
please give us some privacy?

411
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,190
Ah, yes, of course I will.

412
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Salute.

413
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,740
Oh… Uh…

414
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Well, you…

415
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
I mean…

416
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,040
Maybe you don't know
running around on the outside.

417
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,550
But anyone…

418
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,470
could do that, you know.

419
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,850
Even me.

420
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,060
You sticking up for me yesterday,

421
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,900
I'm not the slightest bit grateful.

422
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,780
Not everyone is you.

423
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,910
I'm sorry, I…

424
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,330
didn't think enough about it.

425
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,960
I'm really sorry.

426
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,090
-I…
-Don't be.

427
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,340
That's not why I'm here.

428
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,880
INVESTIGATION DIVISION

429
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,770
Sir.

430
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,900
Spooked by a ghost, huh?
Did you think I died?

431
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,370
Have you been released?

432
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,300
You punk, it's not like
I was serving time, right?

433
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,670
What color of socks do I have?

434
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,010
Well, they are white.

435
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,110
You heard, right?

436
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,360
You need to hurry up and get ready.

437
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,450
Yes, sir. I'll call my teammate right now.

438
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,530
Park Se-ung?

439
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,030
He's not going.

440
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,290
He's leaving D.P. because he's too scared.

441
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,460
But D.P. works in pairs.
Who will come with me?

442
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,540
Who do you think?

443
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,680
-Hey, give me one of those.
-Wake up.

444
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,480
Sit up straight,
or your neck will get worse.

445
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
It's better to wake up
and do something.

446
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,270
It reeks of cigarettes in here.

447
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,360
That's so stupid.

448
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,240
We're getting familiar, huh?

449
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,370
Now, I looked at your CT scans
and there are no problems.

450
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,910
You even got an MRI
and there's nothing wrong.

451
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,870
Then what could it be?

452
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,590
I'M NOT SURE

453
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,670
Still not able to speak?

454
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,380
NO

455
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,510
So, these are just
my own thoughts.

456
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,350
But is it more like
an illness of the mind?

457
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,940
Are you familiar with PTSD?

458
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,070
And when did you even write this?

459
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,820
Hmm. Well, anyway…

460
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,610
Be honest and tell me,

461
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,700
can you really not talk at all
or are you just refusing to?

462
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,240
…that he returned
to his barracks after his shift

463
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,200
and opened fire on the other soldiers.

464
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,790
The military and police are carrying out
a large-scale search

465
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,210
in order to discover
the soldier's whereabouts.

466
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,500
Let's hear now from Park So-hui.

467
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,630
Soldiers wearing combat gear
stormed the streets of the city

468
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,470
while conducting a search mission.

469
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,760
Local police are assisting the military
as they pursue a soldier named Kim Ru-ri,

470
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,270
a deserter from the 18th Armored Brigade.

471
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,140
Reportedly, Private Kim deserted his base

472
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,810
armed with a K2 rifle and hand grenades…

473
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,980
You know Private Cho Suk-bong, don't you?

474
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,400
I heard you came in together.

475
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,900
According to the police,

476
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,530
-Private Kim made an…
-Oh, Zoro?

477
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,280
Yes.

478
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,870
And the police
found the evidence.

479
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,660
However, as news of the incident spread,
word has come that the military…
