1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,010
EVERY MALE CITIZEN
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,140
SHALL FAITHFULLY PERFORM
MANDATORY MILITARY SERVICE

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,810
ARTICLE 3 OF THE MILITARY SERVICE ACT

4
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,530
Get up.

5
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,330
Do you know why you're getting hit?

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,000
Because of a single bad apple, you hear?

7
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,600
Arts and Film Department, Jang Sung-min.

8
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,430
It's you, isn't it?

9
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,930
The bastard who wants to play Nina
in The Seagull.

10
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,560
Yes, sir.

11
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,810
All my workshop finals were an A-plus.

12
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,320
So I'm fully qualified--

13
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,780
Jeez, you psychotic bastard.

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,200
Nina's a woman's role, though.

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,370
Anton Chekhov wrote it that way,
you moron.

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,250
Early in the quarter, the professor said

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,920
young artists shouldn't be afraid
to reinterpret the classics so…

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,210
God, you fucking bastard.

19
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,510
You gay bastard.

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,130
Why are you meddling with this, huh?

21
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,930
Right! You got a letter at the dorms.
Have you seen it?

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,910
Congrats. The gay bastard
is going to the military.

23
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,770
Sergeant Han Ho-yeol and
Private An Jun-ho of the 103rd Division…

24
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,230
9. CURTAIN CALL

25
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,230
…you're both being presented with
this award for your exemplary actions.

26
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,240
408 DAYS UNTIL DISCHARGE

27
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,490
To our… battle-tested soldiers.

28
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,870
The pride of the 103rd Division!

29
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,250
Great job but still…

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,790
You foolish little shits.

31
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,630
To go that far, huh?

32
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,050
No respect for your precious souls.

33
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,890
How could you just jump
into a risk like that?

34
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,560
Didn't you consider the emotional effect
it would have on me?

35
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,230
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

36
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
Still, you guys did so great!

37
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,360
Goodness, you did so well.
Come to your commander.

38
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,700
No, no, no.

39
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,530
Come to your dad!

40
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,700
Okay, I'll take the photo now.

41
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,750
Okay, ready?

42
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,830
-One, two, three.
-Okay, smile.

43
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,210
And open it.

44
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,630
Two, three.

45
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,130
We did it!

46
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,090
I was 100 percent sure
you'd be dragged off to military prison.

47
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,560
I also find it a bit of a surprise.
An award?

48
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,390
Since Ru-ri was cuffed
by the commander himself,

49
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,730
everybody's tossing around compliments
and putting a bow on things.

50
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,820
Captain Lim was reinstated too.

51
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,570
How long will our
reward vacation be then? Hmm?

52
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,780
Two weeks? Or three?

53
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,450
How about a discharge, huh?

54
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,120
Oh. Sounds pretty acceptable to me.

55
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,910
You want medical discharge?

56
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,040
Okay, now get out.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,550
But a reward…

58
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,590
Are you leaving?

59
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,100
Salute.

60
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:01,930
Salute.

61
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,940
Should I just get discharged
for medical hardship?

62
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,940
Sergeant Han, what will you do
once you're discharged?

63
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,320
All of a sudden?

64
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,070
Well, I'll run…

65
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,910
a management company.

66
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,540
One look at somebody's face

67
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,460
and I can immediately tell if that person

68
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,710
is gonna end up a successful entertainer.

69
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,790
But, Jun-ho…

70
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,800
-Yeah, I don't see an actor. Hmm?
-That's good.

71
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,220
-Because I don't plan on becoming one.
-Hey D.P.'s.

72
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,640
-Sir.
-Sir.

73
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,680
So, have you examined
this deserter's personals?

74
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,890
Oh, forgive me, sir,
I guess you've done it already.

75
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,150
Oh, this punk getting cocky
at the end.

76
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,650
The police contacted us,

77
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,610
and this is a person
who slipped by us before.

78
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,240
His name is Jang Sung-min.

79
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,530
-Would you remind repeating?
-Hey, what's wrong with you?

80
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,660
Jang Sung-min of the Artillery
Battalion Corps. Satisfied?

81
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,920
Yes? What is it?

82
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,420
Why are you being this way? Huh? You okay?

83
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,380
CORPS ARTILLERY BATTALION
JANG SUNG-MIN

84
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,470
TEN MONTHS AGO

85
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,590
Yes, my babies!
I see you there.

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,930
Keep it going, girls!

87
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,600
A vodka soda.

88
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,320
Hey. Don't do that stuff.

89
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,120
Ah, shit. I hate that son of a bitch.

90
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,600
What's the matter with these guys?

91
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,730
Oh, what's up with today?

92
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,860
Nina's still touching up her face.

93
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,150
Corporal Jang Sung-min?

94
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,290
PRIVATE JANG SUNG-MIN
SLUT OF THE BARRACKS

95
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,920
GIVES ONE HELL OF A BLOWJOB
FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,040
FUCKING FAGGOT
PICK UP THAT SOAP FOR ME

97
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,880
That's you, right?

98
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,300
It's you. It is.

99
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,090
Hello, my name

100
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,520
is Private Han Ho-yeol from the D.P. Team
of the Military Police.

101
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,810
Jesus!

102
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,640
Now I'm frightened.

103
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,810
Move back now. Move back.

104
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,940
You gonna use that?
Seems like a bad plan of action.

105
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,200
So how about we just--

106
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,660
Please, leave!

107
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,200
-Please, please.
-Hey, Jang Sung-min.

108
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,830
Please. Go away, please.

109
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,990
I want to help you.

110
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,950
Just leave me, just leave me.

111
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,580
-Please.
-Let's head back.

112
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,710
Please go away!

113
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Jeez. Come on out already.

114
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,310
Oh, damn it.

115
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,020
Hey. Why aren't you done? Jeez!

116
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,110
What?

117
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,190
W-what the hell?

118
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,530
Huh? What is this? Hey…

119
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,110
Private Han.

120
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,490
Hey! Han Ho-yeol!

121
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,160
Hey, come on. Snap out of it, snap…

122
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,120
Jang Sung-min, you crazy bitch!

123
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,290
Oh, fuck.

124
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,510
Excuse me. Do you happen to know
a man named Jang Sung-min?

125
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,890
How many times do I have to
tell you, I don't know him? So annoying.

126
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,640
-Please look at the photo.
-You still here?

127
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,270
Oh, what a bother.

128
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,390
Try Luli. Shoo, now. Shoo.

129
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,400
-Can I borrow that?
-Sergeant Han Ho-yeol?

130
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,320
W-what?

131
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,660
Uh, do you feel sick?

132
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,410
I'm fine.

133
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,000
When my heart feels
so completely without burden,

134
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,960
I get amazingly calm.

135
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,170
I'll take your word for it.

136
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,710
That's the truth.

137
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,670
Okay.

138
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,170
Yoohoo.

139
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,430
We've been here all day.

140
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,510
This man is driving me crazy.

141
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,550
What? I can't hear you?

142
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,890
Hello? Hello?

143
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,100
I'm hanging up, okay? I can't hear you.

144
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,440
Jeez, honestly now.

145
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Hey! Be quiet, you bastards!
For god's sake!

146
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,270
-Eat this, huh?
-Hey, damn it. That's enough.

147
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,860
Will you be quiet? You bastards!

148
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,030
I mean, honestly.

149
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,030
Jesus!

150
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,780
You probably don't want to eat that.

151
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,290
It's over a week old.

152
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,870
Well, anyway.

153
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,210
We happened to discover this.

154
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,460
We managed to bring in a petty criminal.

155
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,540
Ah, wait… Here.

156
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,590
Anyway, that petty criminal's
the type who messes around

157
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,050
in all kinds of illegal things,
down to the most trivial.

158
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,890
Like a private detective agency
or a kind of service center.

159
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,430
Jang Sung-min's name turned up
on his list of clients.

160
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,310
That's the deserter
you're looking for, right?

161
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,480
-What was his service request?
-Oh.

162
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,360
Well,  I'm not sure.

163
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,200
Which is the reason why the two of you
will have to meet him.

164
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,370
It will be exciting for the two of you.

165
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,540
-Uh…
-The three of us, right?

166
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,120
-You guys, two D.P.'s.
-Yeah.

167
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,120
-A joing operation?
-Yes.

168
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,380
-Oh,  me too?
-Yeah, the three of us.

169
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,880
-Right?
-Oh, well…

170
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,340
We would really like that. But just look
at this pathetic state of affairs, huh?

171
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,300
We've barely got our heads on. Okay?

172
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,300
Our holding cell isn't big enough
for a group that size. No space.

173
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,430
-But I'm not familiar with Itaewon.
-Just a moment.

174
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,270
Hey, that man, what's he doing here?

175
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,810
Hey, sir. Stop crying to the police
and call a lawyer.

176
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,270
A lawyer!

177
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,940
You can't just keep coming in here.
Call a lawyer.

178
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,320
Come on! It…

179
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,450
So the person who stabbed
Ho-yeol was Jang Sung-min?

180
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,950
Wasn't he an actor in the Film Department
or something? Hmm…

181
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,370
He had good grades, too.

182
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,500
At a high school festival,

183
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,080
he was nominated for a best actress award.

184
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,540
Oh, best actress? Huh?

185
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,510
For the role of Nina
in Chekov's The Seagull.

186
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,510
Heartbreaking female character.

187
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,310
The name of the play itself
refers to Nina.

188
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,100
Wow, Sergeant! How do you know
so much about theater?

189
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,440
It was my dream once.
I was in the high school drama club.

190
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,230
Hamlet ring a bell?

191
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,030
Huh…

192
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,280
If you check the web,

193
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,830
there are three legendary long-term
deserters from the army, you know.

194
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,080
Number one's an officer
who embezzled government funds

195
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,410
who's been gone for eight years,

196
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,460
then Jang Sung-min
who stabbed Sergeant Han.

197
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,840
He's been running for five years.

198
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,340
Who's number three, then?

199
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,010
An old guy from the Korean War.

200
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,010
Nobody's concerned about him.
Have some dumplings.

201
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,600
Hey, Gi-yeong.
You have a real knack for this.

202
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,470
It could be a career there.

203
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,350
To become the fourth long-term deserter?

204
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,690
-Such a punk.
-Ow.

205
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,400
Ow.

206
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,950
-File an anonymous complaint.
-Mm-hmm.

207
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,280
So Jang Sung-min
was in Itaewon this whole time?

208
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,120
There wouldn't be any better place
for Sung-min than here.

209
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,910
Anyway, the meeting's all set up, right?

210
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,210
Yeah. And he definitely
didn't suspect anything either.

211
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,590
-Okay. Perhaps.
-You the guys who called?

212
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,970
We spoke, yeah?

213
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,800
Uh…

214
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,310
TIGER SERVICES

215
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,520
The password.

216
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,190
Roar, roar?

217
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,200
Come with me.

218
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,160
Jeez, how did you know? How'd you know?

219
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,950
The company name
has "Tiger" in it?

220
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,410
Honestly, that's amazing.

221
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,460
-Oh, damn.
-I guess. Hurry up.

222
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,600
Ah, jeez. This feels pretty weird.

223
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
For me too, you know.

224
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,970
On those unsolved crime shows,

225
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,390
a car like this always appears
right before someone loses an organ.

226
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,770
Let's come back some other time.

227
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,110
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Just be natural and leave.

228
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,540
So, what are you doing here?

229
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,340
Well, we're looking for a guy.

230
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,510
A guy?

231
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,970
-Yes.
-Yes.

232
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,550
Meow, meow.

233
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
Tweet, tweet.

234
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,180
-What?
-Mm…

235
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,310
The password is "meow, meow," assholes.

236
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,370
Meow.

237
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,530
Get out.

238
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,620
Good evening, friends.

239
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,960
So good to see you.

240
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,210
You're in
for an impressive beating today.

241
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,210
What an easy job. Lucky day.

242
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,170
-You're hardworking men.
-Beat 'em good.

243
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,050
Commendable.

244
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,430
What do you bastards do? With the police?

245
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,220
-Us, police? No way.
-Ah, no, no, that's not us. No way.

246
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,470
You assholes.

247
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,640
Hey, go for it.

248
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,730
-All right.
-Oh, come on.

249
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,610
Everyone, freeze!

250
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,820
Huh?

251
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,070
-Don't you move, assholes!
-Hey. come in.

252
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,820
You two okay?

253
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,740
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Here, here!

254
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,530
You bastards,
every move we make,

255
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,280
-you'd get a whiff of us.
-Fucking shithead.

256
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,540
Ah, shit.

257
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,870
Just wait.

258
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,790
Catch them all.

259
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,960
Stop them! Stop them!

260
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,590
Get back now.

261
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,430
Watch out, shitheads!

262
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,140
Oh, God! Oh, God! Okay!

263
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,390
Look, over there. Look!

264
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Out of my way! Out of my way!
Damn it, move!

265
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,950
Hey!

266
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,740
Stop following me, you fucking bastards!

267
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,950
Move out of the way!

268
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,740
I'm sick of this shit.

269
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,240
-Oh, for god's sake.
-Go away!

270
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,040
Crazy bastards!

271
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,000
Hey, let me borrow this.

272
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,960
Oh, fuck!

273
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,130
What the hell?

274
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,750
Oh!

275
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,510
-Are you guys all right?
-There he goes.

276
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,680
Get on. We're following him.

277
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Jesus. Shit!

278
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,480
Fucking bastard, he's following me.

279
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,530
Fucking guy! My god! This dumb
motherfucking bastard won't stop!

280
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,490
Stop following me, you son of a bitch!

281
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,370
Go away, you motherfucker!
I'm not getting caught, do you hear me?

282
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,620
I will never ever be caught!

283
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,120
Goddamn it, go away!

284
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,550
Quit following me.

285
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,300
Oh.

286
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,020
I didn't get caught.

287
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,650
Nice try, though, asshole.

288
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,900
I feel great.

289
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Still chasing me?

290
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,120
Oh, you creepy motherfucker.

291
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,160
This fucking guy!
I can't believe it.

292
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,750
Sir. Excuse me, sir!
Why aren't you moving?

293
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,840
Goddamn it!

294
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,930
He keeps chasing me.

295
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,510
Out of the way! Whoa!

296
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,290
Ow.

297
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,710
Damn it.

298
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,800
Huh? What's that thing?

299
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,140
Beep, beep. Beep, beep.

300
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,850
Coco is on the way with freshness.

301
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,770
Yes, I did it. Yes.

302
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,480
I won the race.

303
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,520
Beep, beep. Beep…

304
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,860
Oh, hey.

305
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,820
Hmm.

306
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,030
Huh?

307
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,500
Hey, you. Climb aboard. Come on.

308
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,960
-Bastards!
-What are you even doing with your feet?

309
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,130
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

310
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,340
Giving up would be better.

311
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,260
Hop on. You must be thirsty.

312
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,640
-Here. Huh?
-Damn it!

313
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,720
What's he doing?

314
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,980
Hey, ma'am. Could you make a right?

315
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,100
-This only goes straight.
-What?

316
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,650
EXIT 2
ITAEWON

317
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,400
Jun-ho, at the subway entrance,
right in front.

318
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
I'm here as well.

319
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,490
Cheers.

320
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,040
Water, water, water, water.

321
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,370
What are you doing?

322
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,670
Mm. Mm-mm…

323
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,330
Hey, bro.

324
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,630
Hey, meow, meow.

325
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,380
How've you been?

326
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,180
Huh?

327
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,510
Back off! You bastard!

328
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,390
Fuck, get out!

329
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,890
How much farther
are you gonna chase me, you asshole!

330
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,730
-To the end of the world?
-Huh?

331
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,440
Damn it.

332
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,030
Sergeant Han.

333
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,490
You always show up at the end
to do the cool part.

334
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,500
-This is Jang Sung-min.
-I mean, come on.

335
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,510
I've given new identities
to a million guys.

336
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,090
-How am I supposed to recognize them all?
-Well, you bastard.

337
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,720
How about you take a look,
since it's been so many people? I swear.

338
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,970
-You two, all yours.
-Yeah, thank you.

339
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,930
I'm sorry, but…

340
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,400
we never took a request from any soldier.

341
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,030
Wait a minute.

342
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,320
Oh, Nina?

343
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,030
Wait, I know.

344
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,080
He said that he'd just stabbed someone.

345
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,790
He came in all crying.

346
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,920
Ah…

347
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,630
I have to run away.

348
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,930
Help me, please.

349
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,640
I'm begging you. Can't you just help me?

350
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,520
I'll give you whatever money I make
on a regular basis.

351
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,640
Goddamn it.

352
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,940
You shouldn't behave this way here.
People will think I'm some kind of jerk.

353
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,320
Then help me out here!

354
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,240
Save me, please.

355
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,740
If I ever have to go back to that place…

356
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,070
Hey, sissy!

357
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,620
Aw, the sissy's crying. Poor little queer.

358
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,670
My God! Don't you have
any shame, huh?

359
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,960
I'm going to die for real.

360
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,170
Hey. You dying is your own
personal circumstance, okay?

361
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,390
And the condition we have for providing
this service is do you know? Hmm?

362
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,810
Put that down. Hey, come on!

363
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,350
Long as I'm gonna die,
I guess it should be here.

364
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,190
It will be better to do it now
while I'm still outside.

365
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,280
Goddamn it!

366
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,440
Please.

367
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,820
Please, please.

368
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,870
Please help me.

369
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,910
So I sent him to Incheon.

370
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,500
Because we couldn't handle it on our end.

371
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,550
And he looked so desperate.

372
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,350
I told him to go to the people
who create new identities

373
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,230
for undocumented immigrants.

374
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,900
-What?
-Hmm…

375
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,870
A little bit different than a Chekov play.

376
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,000
Hurry up and get out here.

377
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,960
Let's get to work. Work!

378
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,300
Ah. All right. Good morning.

379
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,560
-See you soon.
-Yeah, okay.

380
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,590
Whoa, whoa!

381
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,430
Whoa! Whoa!

382
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,600
-Watch out!
-Hey, move, move!

383
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,770
Are you okay?

384
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,600
Jesus!

385
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,900
Listen, this is why
you have to rest at night.

386
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,150
Why do you insist
on working two jobs, huh?

387
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,030
You could have been paralyzed
by this thing.

388
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,080
Yes, I'm sorry.

389
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,120
Sir, I apologize.

390
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,380
Hey, isn't our friend Nina
such a good singer?

391
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,630
Yeah, she is.

392
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,060
Makes me feel really weird.

393
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,030
It makes me feel…

394
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,530
A bit of hatred, really.

395
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,030
But there's pity as well.

396
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,830
A weird mixture.

397
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,460
Well, how about…

398
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,300
we let Sung-min just keep running?

399
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,050
Like with Heo Chi-do, you know?

400
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,020
Will that help Sung-min, though?

401
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,520
Oh, I'm corny.

402
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,190
What is this? I mean,
what's gotten into me?

403
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,490
No compassion.

404
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,160
Nothing trivial.

405
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,030
-Yes, all right.
-Yes.

406
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,580
Gi-yeong, it's Ho-yeol.

407
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,090
This… Gosh. It seems like
he's somewhere in East Incheon.

408
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,390
But finding him like this
might take some time. Uh…

409
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,100
Hey, D.P.

410
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,890
You won't be able to find him
no matter how hard you look.

411
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,640
When we investigated,

412
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,060
we discovered
they made him identification.

413
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,480
Oh. Do you mean a fake ID?

414
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,480
A passport.

415
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,610
After spending years hiding,

416
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,160
I'm not really sure
where he's trying to go right now.

417
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,490
So I… I think you should get some help
from the cops one more time on all this.

418
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,500
Jeez. What are you going to try
and make us do this time?

419
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah…

420
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,380
So that catty bastard
that we caught last time?

421
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,130
Oh, that's hot. Yeah.

422
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,550
So, the fellow above him makes fake IDs.

423
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,310
He's famous as a matter of fact. Yeah.

424
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,720
Hmm.

425
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,730
Yeah, so, for us, then?

426
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,270
We need to catch the old guy
so we can close this case.

427
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,610
Yeah?

428
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,150
TIGER SERVICES BOSS
OLD MAN, HEIGHT 170 CM, SLIM BUILD

429
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,900
Let's do one more
joint operation, okay?

430
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,750
Password.

431
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,840
Meow, meow.

432
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,730
Hey, what's the time?

433
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,490
Uh, sir, you've come?

434
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,360
Hey! I'm lowering it now.

435
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,360
-Okay, lower it.
-Sir, you're here?

436
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,700
Get this out of the way.

437
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,830
-Come out.
-Move. Sir, you're here?

438
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,950
-Wow, jeez.
-Looks good here.

439
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,920
-Quite a different scale from Itaewon.
-Come on.

440
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,210
-Tell me about it.
-Right here.

441
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,800
I heard you two
are looking for a job?

442
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,640
Yes.

443
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,640
It's an honor to meet you. Um…

444
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,730
If you help us, I'll put…

445
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,650
We'll both put our… lives
on the line for you.

446
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,860
Whatever you need, sir.

447
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,070
Anyone who comes to the Incheon Coast

448
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,870
must be a person
who has run out of lifelines.

449
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,750
Let me hear the reasons you have.

450
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,840
Then I'll share my decision
about letting you join me.

451
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,340
What should we do?

452
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,550
But if…

453
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,350
you lie even once…

454
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,850
I'll tear your insides out.

455
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,100
And some lucky fish
will eat you for a snack.

456
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,940
We're… both deserters from the army.

457
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
We're what?

458
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,120
Yes. We're deserters.

459
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,700
We were in the middle of serving
our mandatory military service.

460
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,460
Really, you're army deserters?

461
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,170
Yes.

462
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,540
You're running from the military?

463
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,250
Oh. What's happening? Are you all right?

464
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,880
No, no, no. No.

465
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,390
Five decades have passed.

466
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,640
But it still appears in my nightmares.

467
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,100
God, what a hellish place.

468
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,230
Even now, it feels like someone
might come chasing after me.

469
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,940
I understand exactly how you feel.

470
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,320
Are you saying…

471
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,450
that stupid place
has not gotten any better?

472
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,160
-Unbelievable.
-Sorry?

473
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,960
Hire these boys immediately
and show them the ropes.

474
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,420
-Sir, thank you very much.
-Yes.

475
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,340
Yes. Go ahead.

476
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,420
Should we bring that man in, though?

477
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,470
He's a deserter.

478
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,100
Hey, aren't you cops?

479
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,260
Whoa! What?

480
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,850
Huh? What?

481
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,940
Oh, we often hear we look like cops.

482
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,400
This is a call from the Itaewon guys.

483
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,570
-Hey. I think they're cops.
-Come on!

484
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,070
Hey!

485
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,580
Have we ever run away before?

486
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,290
Uh, usually we're the ones chasing people.

487
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
-Mm-hmm.
-Catch them!

488
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,960
Let's get them!

489
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,000
That's it!

490
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,210
Watch out!

491
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,220
Nine o'clock! Nine o'clock!

492
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,340
Don't come any closer!

493
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,720
Whoa, whoa!

494
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,400
Push! Push!

495
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,280
Oh, fuck! Go up!

496
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,030
No! Don't let them get away!

497
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,740
-Come on!
-Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

498
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,040
Come on! Come on!

499
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,790
Whoa!

500
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,550
Crap!

501
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,630
Get them!

502
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,430
Don't let them get away!

503
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,680
-Oh, God!
-Damn it!

504
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:43,100
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

505
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,860
Stop them!

506
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,150
Shit.

507
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,070
Attack!

508
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,660
Hurry up and go!

509
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,300
Ah! Shit!

510
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,590
Fuck, where did he go?

511
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,550
Jeez. Where the hell did he go?

512
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,630
Shit.

513
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,890
Find him!

514
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:18,930
-Oh!
-Hurry up!

515
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,060
Jeez! Where the hell could he be? Fuck!

516
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,480
-Where is he?
-Damn it.

517
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,440
That bastard!

518
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,900
Thanks for that.

519
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,490
What's up with your outfit?

520
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,830
Huh?

521
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,370
You really haven't changed.

522
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,120
Still the neighborhood hooligan.

523
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,290
How are you here?

524
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,380
Are you well?

525
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,630
Well, you helped with that.

526
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,340
Jesus! Where the hell did he go?

527
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,430
Hush.

528
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,100
Come along.

529
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,180
Find him!

530
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,060
Uh, no… This…

531
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,200
How could we meet like this?

532
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,950
It's really amazing.

533
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,580
You're still a soldier, huh?

534
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,130
Are you Private First Class now?

535
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,800
You… haven't changed much either.

536
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,680
Well, are you out here
looking for someone?

537
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,970
That's pretty much my role.

538
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,770
Wow! There's a bar
even in a place like this.

539
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,600
Actually, this place is pretty famous.

540
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,900
We have live music, too.

541
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,410
Do you know her? Nina?

542
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,790
She's our star… was our star.

543
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,230
Thanks very much. Thanks very much.

544
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,230
Thanks, everybody. Thank you so much.

545
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,480
Thanks very much. I appreciate it.

546
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,700
Thank you for taking the time.

547
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,070
Your voice is so beautiful.

548
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:41,990
Thank you.

549
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,160
You said your name is Nina?

550
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,870
JI YU-NA
MUSICAL THEATER PRODUCER, DIRECTOR

551
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,420
Ms. Ji Yu-na.

552
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,340
You know me?

553
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,800
Yes, of course.

554
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,720
Ev-everybody who performs
like me knows you.

555
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,890
Then I'll get right to the point.

556
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,430
Would you like to work together?

557
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,020
I'm making Chekhov's The Seagull
into a musical.

558
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,730
It's going to be experimental.

559
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,360
And it happens that you're already Nina.

560
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,110
Nina, really?

561
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,530
Ah, but… Oh, I don't know--

562
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,580
The workshop will be
in the West End of London.

563
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:32,120
And we're going to collaborate with
choreographers and stage crew there.

564
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,750
Assuming you're up for it, we can
arrange it for you to leave right away.

565
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,380
You have a passport?

566
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,350
Yeah, yeah.

567
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,070
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
JANG NINA

568
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,700
Hmm…

569
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,500
The passport was made perfectly,
so you won't have any issues.

570
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,460
Stay strong and work hard.

571
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,010
You don't need to run away anymore.

572
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,390
You've just been reborn.

573
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,110
Nina, it's tomorrow, right?
You going to England.

574
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,780
Yes.

575
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,150
Thank you for all you've done
this whole time.

576
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,740
But you never even asked…

577
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,580
exactly who I am.

578
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,080
Or what I'm doing here.

579
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,170
Typical questions.

580
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,510
And what about me?

581
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,390
Who are you?

582
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,350
You're Nina, the great singer.

583
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,030
Want to be best friends starting now?

584
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,700
As soon as I get back,

585
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,660
shall we drink to this, then?

586
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,710
Cool.

587
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,250
Cool.

588
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,610
I'd like it if Nina wasn't apprehended.

589
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,330
You must have it hard too.

590
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,670
Always out chasing after someone.
Arresting them.

591
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,260
I guess.

592
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,510
You know, people like us…

593
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,100
are really lucky.

594
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,810
It wouldn't be at all strange…

595
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,730
if I was the one being chased.

596
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,280
Do you feel relieved?

597
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,370
Not quite.

598
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,790
I…

599
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,300
just feel pretty sad.

600
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,270
It's my time to leave.

601
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,270
The three million won.

602
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,910
You didn't mention it.

603
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,830
Next time I'll buy you dinner.

604
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,910
A meal worth three million.

605
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,590
Attention Asiana Airline passengers.

606
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,340
Passengers with baggage,
come up to the counter and check…

607
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,390
Hey, hurry up already, will you?

608
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:57,930
What happened?

609
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,640
The police rounded up
every last one of them.

610
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,020
You look pretty good yourself, huh?

611
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,650
Since he was trying to leave the country,
there'll definitely be some data.

612
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,030
Yeah, that one right over…

613
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,660
-You're here.
-Hi.

614
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,040
There was an incident that day,
so I found it quickly.

615
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,210
What incident?

616
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:23,870
Uh…

617
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,710
First, please give this a look.

618
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,770
Your passport, please.

619
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,320
Jang Nina?

620
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,630
This happens a lot.

621
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,590
Sorry, but could you make it quick?
I'm worried that I'll miss my flight.

622
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,560
Why is it like this?

623
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,350
Yes, just one moment, sir.

624
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,770
Wait, I…

625
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,300
Jang Nina?

626
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,260
We really didn't know.

627
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,720
Would you please come over here
for a second?

628
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,770
We just wanted him to sit and wait
while we check the issue.

629
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,730
Whoa, whoa!

630
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:30,130
Ah!

631
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,100
Oh!

632
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,110
] Oh, my god!

633
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,070
Are you all right?

634
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:01,740
Is he okay?

635
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,370
I'll call 911.

636
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,580
-Wait.
-No, you can't call anyone.

637
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,120
No, no. Don't!

638
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:24,970
He ran out of the airport like that.

639
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,520
In his condition,
he couldn't have gone far.

640
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,610
Why don't we just hand this over
to the police?

641
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,870
I think we've done
everything we can already.

642
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,040
Ah, no.

643
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:56,500
Let's follow.

644
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,120
It's okay.

645
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,000
It's okay.

646
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,120
I'm really sorry.

647
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,460
I contacted the police
and they recovered the body.

648
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,840
They say the cause of death
was tetanus and excessive bleeding,

649
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:51,680
coupled with malnourishment
which caused the shock.

650
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:54,350
At any rate, good job.

651
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:56,930
Don't let this bother you too much,
and come back safely.

652
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,780
Back when

653
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,330
you asked me what I wanted to do
after my discharge…

654
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,540
Well…

655
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,630
I'm not really sure

656
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,340
what I'm supposed to do.

657
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:32,550
I mean, some people want something so much
that they would die for it.

658
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,720
But I'm just not sure

659
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,560
what work I'm supposed to do.

660
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,990
There were so many things
I wanted to do once I got discharged.

661
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,580
But I can't remember them.

662
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,250
I can't remember any of them.
