5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,150
Oh.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,950
Oh.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,900
Newtype.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,530
This must be Suk-bong's friend.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,750
Look at that, I guess the military
was rough on this guy too.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,170
Oh, great.

11
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,050
Did you find anything?

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,180
Nothing important, sir.

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,060
What about you?
Any luck finding Cho Suk-bong?

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,720
Stop slacking off.

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,890
Actually, look, you son of a bitch.

16
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,100
Is that language really necess--

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,070
He never listens.

18
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,360
Probably why he's not promoted.

00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,110
Ru-ri, where are you?

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,240
-You motherfucker.
-Pathetic.

22
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,410
Hm?

23
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,540
Pay attention!

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,580
Come on. You son of a bitch.
You're gonna leave it like that?

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,750
Now we all have to pick up your slack?

26
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,880
-Huh, fat-ass?
-Jeez.

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,880
These jerks are everywhere, I suppose.

28
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,090
-Fuck.
-Hey.

29
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,300
What's your gun's serial number?

30
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,800
Hey, assholes!

31
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,100
I'm Military Police,
and this base is under investigation.

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,310
Salute.

33
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,980
What's this about, huh?

34
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,770
-It's nothing, sir.
-Nothing my ass.

35
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,440
You fuckers better get lost!

36
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,940
Yes, sir.

37
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,200
Come on, let's go.

38
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,160
Oh.

39
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,160
I'm pretty cool.

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,880
Private First Class Kim Ru-ri
of the Transport Regiment.

41
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,550

HEAVILY ARMED SOLDIER ON THE RUN

44
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,340
If only I'd talked
to him back then.

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,590
Told him that I'd help him.

46
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,790

409 DAYS UNTIL DISCHARGE

48
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,540
Can we get approval on this
before filming?

49
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,500
We can't have any mistakes.

50
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,800
Hello. You came.

51
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,340
I appreciate it.

52
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,420
Jun-ho, you did well.

53
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,680
Thank you, sir.

54
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,890
The mood's pretty intense.

55
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,850
It seems this one's important.
All these people…

56
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,730
They're trying to put
the fire out.

57
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,480
And this one's the size of a forest fire.

58
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,110
When will Corporal Han be back?

59
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,900
Isn't he still recovering?

60
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,370
He's pretty shook so I assume he's not.

61
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,240
He said he wanted to.

62
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,910
He'll be here.

63
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,840
They're here.

64
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,630
-There they are.
-Here we go.

65
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,010
Wait, wait…

66
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,230
-Oh, God, why her?
-Hello, everyone.

67
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,520
My name is Lieutenant Colonel Seo Eun,
and I'm the deputy in charge.

68
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,610
I will lead this investigation.

69
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,990
-Please refer to the press release that…
-Are you kidding me?

70
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,410
What we know, so far,

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,910
is that a tragic shooting took place
at a nearby military base.

72
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,000
It was a day like any other.

73
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,160
Nothing special.

74
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,880
Our soldiers were going about
their peaceful daily lives on the base.

75
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,720
Now, because of this tragedy,
our fellow soldiers lost their lives.

76
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,760
The criminal who pulled the trigger

77
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,720
fled and is at large.

78
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,600
This deserter is armed.

79
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,360
The Armed Forces Headquarters
has made its priority

80
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,070
bringing this criminal in
as quickly as possible.

81
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,150
-We also mourn the souls of our…
-"Criminal," really? "Criminal."

82
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,650
I'm bothered by their word choice.

83
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,780
That's what she's good at.

84
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,700
Spinning things the way she wants.

85
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,040
Now, we will release
the photos from the scene.

86
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,080
The images are disturbing.

87
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,090
Please take this into consideration
before viewing them.

88
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,800
PHOTOGRAPHS FROM CRIME SCENE

89
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,350
Why would they show these photos?

90
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,680
First and foremost,

91
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,810
we must capture the shooter,
Private Kim Ru-ri, alive.

92
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,230
That being said, due to the risk posed

93
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,020
to the soldiers pursuing him
and to civilians,

94
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,610
the military is ordered to use
any means to subdue him.

95
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,820
Then it's shoot to kill, huh?

96
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,450
Considering Private Kim's
pattern of behavior…

97
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,870
Well, that's their plan.

98
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,870
-…do not approach him.
-We're not like that. Right, Jun-ho?

99
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,710
What's the goal of the D.P.?

100
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,880
To get them back. Without bloodshed.

101
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,010
Correct.

102
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,680
We will find him.

103
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,180
This is breaking news.

104
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,100
A shooting has taken place
at a military base in Gyeonggi-do,

105
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,020
and an armed deserter is on the loose.

106
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,060
According to a briefing
at the Armed Forces Headquarters,

107
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,900
the casualties are said
to be two dead and 11 injured.

108
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,780
-Private Kim Ru-ri's armed and on the run…
-Mommy, I'm scared.

109
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,610
as military has already begun
an operation to catch him.

110
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,990
RU-RI'S COUNTRY CHICKEN

111
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,740
Shame on you!

112
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,660
DISGRACE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD!
HOME OF A MURDERER

113
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,460
Get out of there!

114
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,920
Psycho!

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,420
I know you can hear me!

116
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,300
Please move back! No pushing!

117
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,850
Hyeong-beom!

118
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,480
Get out! Now! Hurry! Go!

119
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,320
-They just dropped me off.
-Control the crowd!

120
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,610
-Yes, sir, I will.
-You have to stay back.

121
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,200
Get the fuck out already!

122
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,950
Shit.

123
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,410
-Hey, sir!
-Hey, coming through. Excuse me.

124
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,160
Hyeong-beom, my boy!

125
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,080
Hey, look! She came out!

126
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,290
Why?

127
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,730
My baby Ru-ri, he has asthma.

128
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,440
His inhaler is going to run out.

129
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,400
I don't know if my boy's okay.

130
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,630
Well, my son…

131
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,510
he's dead now, do you understand?

132
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,270
But what? Did you say asthma inhaler? Huh?

133
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm so sorry.

134
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,650
I'm so sorry.

135
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,320
But listen,

136
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,740
I know Ru-ri has done
something unforgivable.

137
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,240
But they pushed him too far…

138
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,710
They all would say he was a "fat-ass."

139
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,750
And he said they took insecticide
and sprayed his face!

140
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,550
My god, you're crazy.

141
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,340
You've completely lost it.

142
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,340
They tortured my boy!

143
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,470
They cursed and beat him!

144
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,520
Were you listening? My son is gone!

145
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,310
Killed by your son!

146
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Stop!

147
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,320
Bring my son back!

148
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,320
That's enough!

149
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,820
Get back!

150
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,030
-My son!
-That's enough!

151
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,490
He killed my son! Do you get it?

152
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,620
I'll never see my boy again!

153
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,080
Enough!

154
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,920
Bring him back!

155
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,250
Oh, shit.

156
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,100
-Let go of her now!
-He killed my son.

157
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,680
I don't want to use force.

158
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,480
Hold the line!
Get in front of them!

159
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,680
Is that you, Corporal?

160
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,690
RU-RI'S COUNTRY CHICKEN

161
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,190
MURDERER

162
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,910
Are you mad at me
or something, Corporal Han?

163
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,620
When you were in the hospital,
you never reached out.

164
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,420
JUN-HO! I'M A SERGEANT NOW!

165
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
Why are you…

166
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,350
What's that about?

167
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:28,030
SORRY, I'M NOT ABLE TO SPEAK RIGHT NOW

168
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,620
Why'd you come here then?
You should've stayed in the hospital.

169
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,750
I KNOW YOU NEED ME BY YOUR SIDE

170
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,840
Are you serious?

171
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,720
Was that pre-written?

172
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,800
YES

173
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,550
NO

174
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,310
I'M NOT A WEIRD PERSON

175
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,980
WHAT CAN I DO?

176
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,460
The general is in the middle
of a trial, right?

177
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,380
Yes.

178
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,050
Colonel Eun, did you mean
to provoke Kim Ru-ri

179
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,630
earlier today at the briefing?

180
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,390
You need to provoke to install fear.

181
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,220
The hope is that it will prevent others
from helping him.

182
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,270
I'm concerned about the timing.
Even if we apprehend Kim Ru-ri--

183
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,140
I've been speaking with the general.

184
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,980
I know what he wants.

185
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,820
Our military should be free
of a tragedy like this.

186
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,490
But when it does happen…

187
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,320
we must quickly quiet things down.

188
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,830
Yes, I'm from the 103rd Division
and we're going in there.

189
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,670
-I'm sorry--
-Let me in. Get out of my way, kid.

190
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,340
-Now's not a good time, sir. You can't--
-The hell I can't.

191
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
It's all right.

192
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,930
Colonel Seo Eun.

193
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,600
So Warrant Officer Oh
was in here with you, huh?

194
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,350
If it's about something private,
there's the door.

195
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,190
Or you'd better change your tone.

196
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,360
I mean, you just had to go and say
you'd shoot to kill if he's found.

197
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,070
You barely tried to hide it.

198
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,410
So that's what you heard.

199
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,870
I guess you've come here
to defend the shooter?

200
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,040
Uh, no, not at all, ma'am.
Our approach is to--

201
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,330
Sergeant Park.

202
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,330
Have a seat, please. Yeah, it's okay.

203
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,040
-Okay.
-Who are you?

204
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,420
Salute.

205
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,590
Sergeant First Class Park Beom-gu,
Military Police.

206
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,590
Wasn't this man under investigation?

207
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,800
Why is he here?

208
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,430
D.P.'s are usually involved
in the mission.

209
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,850
-They're going to provide assistance.
-Yes.

210
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,110
Private Kim Ru-ri
has always been a soldier

211
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,020
who couldn't mingle with other people.

212
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,110
His addiction to brutal animations
meant he couldn't separate reality.

213
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,780
from his warped mind.

214
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,200
What's more,
when he first transferred to the unit,

215
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,200
he was classified
as a special care soldier

216
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,660
and entered into a green camp.

217
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,750
Normally, a soldier would leave
after two weeks, but he stayed for five.

218
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,960
-Sound right?
-Animation?

219
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,250
You're trying to build this narrative
out of nowhere.

220
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,710
Aren't you?

221
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,260
It just seems like
you haven't thought this through.

222
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,760
After an incident like this,
you don't want to push him into a corner.

223
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,850
Don't you see?

224
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,230
Here we go. Your narrow attitude.

225
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,100
The one that's always
straddling the fence.

226
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,070
What's this about?

227
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,740
Would you prefer that someone get hurt
like with Cho Suk-bong?

228
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,650
Watch your mouth!

229
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,450
No, you watch your mouth.

230
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,170
Don't end up with these
fucking regrets like I did. Okay?

231
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,460
On a side note,

232
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,880
don't call the kids anymore.

233
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,800
Just meet them on your appointed days.

234
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,840
Yeah, right! They're the ones calling me
saying they can't stand being around you!

235
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,850
Now I know why they hate you,
your arrogance.

236
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,350
Thanks, Captain, that's all.

237
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,020
Lim Ji-seop, you're dismissed.

238
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,960
Yeah, got it.

239
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,880
-Did you meet up with Ho-yeol?
-Go to hell.

240
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,750
-Yes, but there's an issue.
-What?

241
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,920
-Well, he can't… he can't speak.
-Oh, great, why not?

242
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,090
He must be joking, right?

243
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,050
-I don't think so, sir.
-What is this?

244
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,100
And I'm not sure if he won't or can't but…

245
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,810
Sergeant Park, look.

246
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,720
Hurry!

247
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,100
-Get over here.
-Well, I have to call you back.

248
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,890
-That's crazy,
-Uh-huh.

249
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,560
-Hey!
-He's completely lost it.

250
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,230
The killer is filming himself?

251
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,070
This is creepy.

252
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,440
Hello, my name is Kim Ru-ri.

253
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,450
ARMED DESERTER KIM RU-RI
INTERNET LIVE STREAM

254
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,780
I'm the armed deserter.

255
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,370
I did shoot my senior officers that day.

256
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,620
They harassed me, nonstop.

257
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,880
I only shot them because I thought
they'd kill me first.

258
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,140
They kept saying unspeakable things
about my mother.

259
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,930
They used to shoot bug spray in my eyes.

260
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,230
- He's trying to use the media?
-And would hit me.

261
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,600
The commanding officers knew
but would look the other way.

262
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,440
I…

263
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,030
-What the hell?
-I really thought they're gonna kill me.

264
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,700
I shot them in self-defense.

265
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,780
This is unbelievable.

266
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,950
But…

267
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,490
the military is hiding it.

268
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,670
All the torturing they did,

269
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,750
it's all being left out.

270
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,960
They left it out.

271
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,380
How I was being bullied every day,
it's all being left out.

272
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,100
They only talk about the fucking shooting!

273
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,520
This is not
how I'll be remembered.

274
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,440
Oh!

275
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,320
Are you okay?

276
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,160
I'll tell the truth of how it went down!

277
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,620
You lying motherfuckers!

278
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,510
LIVE STREAM HAS ENDED

279
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,720
-What do we do?
-Oh, no.

280
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,640
The shooter has made a video
and shared it with…

281
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,810
This whole thing is spiraling
out of control.

282
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,980
He's in over his head.

283
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,070
-Come with me.
-Huh?

284
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,660
What is it?

285
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,520
Honestly…

286
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,940
I'm so scared.

287
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,910
When I think about…

288
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,370
the truth…

289
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,840
that my child could…

290
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,970
could actually do something so terrible.

291
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,450
My Ru-ri was always gentle and kind.

292
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,360
This is my fault.

293
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,410
What will happen to Ru-ri now, huh?

294
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,540
What will they do?

295
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,380
He can still live though?

296
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,430
Save my son.

297
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,600
Please.

298
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,270
I'm begging you, please save him.

299
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,650
HIGH PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
MILITARY INVESTIGATOR'S ROOM

300
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,320
OH MIN-U

301
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,080
MILITARY USE
AUXILIARY STORAGE UNIT

302
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,800
Yeah? The materials
are ready to go, right?

303
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,340
What are you talking about?

304
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,760
I'm on my way.

305
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,260
Those useless bastards, jeez.

306
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,980
Why is he here all alone
with all that's going on right now?

307
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,560
It's his office, he probably needed
to get his toothbrush.

308
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,780
This isn't the barracks.
This is Armed Forces HQ.

309
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,650
We could end up in deep shit.

310
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,070
Are you coming or not?

311
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,910
Oh, God.

312
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,210
Go in already.

313
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,090
We've got these bastards.

314
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
An open investigation

315
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,760
and they have a classified secret?

316
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,800
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT

317
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,760
Even a general could go down
for keeping a secret like this.

318
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,140
Any guess on the password?

319
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,520
Come on, Sergeant Park,
how would I know that?

320
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,850
-I don't know.
-Why not type in Hwarang cigarettes.

321
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,600
Jesus, help me out--

322
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,780
What the hell are you doing?

323
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,290
"What the hell are you doing?"

324
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,710
Wow, did he just say that?

325
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,920
I'm the higher-ranking officer here,
yet have I ever seen you salute me? Huh?

326
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,090
Captain Lim?

327
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,800
Hey, man.

328
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,560
Officer Oh,

329
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,930
you see my rank?

330
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,520
Your computer password…

331
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,480
I'm gonna need it.

332
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
Huh?

333
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,230
What is it? You punk!

334
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,820
Hey! What are you doing?

335
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,920
You two idiots.

336
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,880
You son of a bitch.

337
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,520
It's time, get the soldiers in position.

338
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,440
He hasn't been using the buses
or the subway.

339
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,320
It seems he's more cautious
than we thought.

340
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,530
We haven't been able to get CCTV.

341
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,330
Even with the help of the D.P. teams
from nearby units…

342
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,580
…we need more time.

343
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,840
I mean, if you keep moving so slow,
how do you expect to catch him?

344
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,710
Kim Ru-ri's rifle was found.
He must have discarded it.

345
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,470
So that's good news.

346
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,800
Well, don't tell the press
about it.

347
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,930
There's nothing to be gained.

348
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,310
As for now…

349
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,350
the bait is already set. Is it a go?

350
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,160
PRINCESS

351
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,250
Hello, honey.
Sorry, I'm working right now.

352
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,460
Mom, Dad needs your help.

353
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,380
What's this about?

354
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,750
I don't know. He just said
to open the door for him.

355
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,720
I'm confused. How is he calling, huh?

356
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,400
It's the same as it always was.

357
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,280
You cause a mess,
and I have to clean it up.

358
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,370
So how did you call Jin- a?

359
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,700
I blocked your number on her phone.

360
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,670
You have two phones?
So you can still talk to the kids?

361
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,960
Hey, I had some extra cash
so I bought a burner.

362
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,050
Damn you…

363
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,550
Sorry.

364
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:11,930
Colonel Seo, let us help you
locate Kim Ru-ri.

365
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,520
That won't be necessary.

366
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,060
The deserter will come to us.

367
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,440
You can't be serious.

368
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,280
What have you done now?

369
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,490
After the spring rain ends,

370
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,000
I think it'll be nice to go
and watch the cherry blossoms…

371
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,120
Welcome, sir.

372
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,330
Cherry blossoms are expected to reach
peak bloom on April 4th…

373
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,290
-Do you have, uh, inhaler?
-…on April 10th in the central regions…

374
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,800
Let me check, one moment.

375
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,050
…favorite time of the year.

376
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,840
We can expect some rain before then,

377
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,930
so don't forget your umbrella.

378
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,840
This just in.

379
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,890
We have an update on the shooting
in the 18th Armored Brigade.

380
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,560
A violent scene erupted in front
of the home of Private Kim,

381
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,430
the deserter who murdered fellow soldiers.

382
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,730
Here with the details
is Reporter Kim Mun-su.

383
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,150
This was
a peaceful neighborhood

384
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,820
until this morning,
when a dangerous scene unfolded.

385
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,200
Family members of the victims
of the recent shooting incident

386
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,240
held a protest in front of the restaurant,

387
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,580
shouting abusive chants
and throwing stones.

388
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,870
This footage was taken in front
of a restaurant this morning.

389
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,620
A woman comes out of the restaurant,

390
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,540
and one of the victims' family member
slaps her in the face.

391
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,500
The unapologetic attitude
of Private Kim Ru-ri's mother

392
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,380
outraged the victims' families…

393
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,260
which eventually led
to a violent commotion.

394
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,430
This footage spread quickly
on social media,

395
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,760
and people are outraged.

396
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,680
Mom…

397
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,060
-Some think the actions against the woman…
-Those sons of bitches!

398
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,560
Those assholes!

399
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,150
Other's understand the backlash.

400
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,940
-Mom.
-The footage has already aired.

401
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
They didn't blur her face in the video.

402
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,490
He has to show up now.

403
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,910
And we'll be ready for him.

404
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,700
How could you do something like this
when you're a mother?

405
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,830
You can't be serious?

406
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,210
I explained to you,

407
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,710
if someone dies
or gets hurt in this situation…

408
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,460
We should make sure Kim Ru-ri
doesn't get hurt either.

409
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,260
That's just as important.

410
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,300
You call yourself soldiers.

411
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:20,140
And yet here you are defending Kim Ru-ri,
who murdered fellow soldiers.

412
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,860
He could throw a grenade
at innocent people any moment.

413
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,690
Continue to wait in here.

414
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,370
I met him before all this.

415
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,620
Kim Ru-ri and I have met.

416
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,380
So are you Luffy?

417
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,800
Yes, sir, I'm Luffy.

418
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,020
We knew that there was an issue
at that base, but…

419
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,520
we couldn't do anything about it.

420
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,410
I'm asking for one more chance,
to see if we can persuade him.

421
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,280
It's worth a try, ma'am.

422
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,670
Please help us out here. Yeah?

423
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Well, I'm sorry.

424
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,060
Don't let them leave.

425
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,350
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

426
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,120
Our only play left
is with your cell phone.

427
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,870
So what's your plan now?

428
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,420
If Kim Ru-ri decides to show up
to an angry mob, they'll put him down.

429
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,970
We can't allow it.

430
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,140
Don't end up
with these fucking regrets like I did.

431
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,400
Okay?

432
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,790
If it was that hard on him,
he should have just deserted.

433
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,330
Why shoot all those people?

434
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And if he was going to do that,
he should have just died with them.

435
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,880
Don't you think?

436
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,300
Oh…

437
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:58,930
Yes, sir.

438
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,940
The general is approaching.
Check the positions of the soldiers.

439
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,940
Our ETA is 30 minutes from now.

440
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,030
-Attention!
-Attention!

441
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,820
As of this very moment,
this operation area is tier one.

442
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,120
Establish a one kilometer perimeter.

443
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,660
No one other than
military personnel is allowed.

444
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,580
-Understand?
-Yes, sir!

445
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,660
Block them, block them!

446
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,210
-Hey! Stop this!
-What are you doing? We have questions.

447
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,000
-Push! Push!
-Hey! Hurry up!

448
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,550
Hey, what are you doing?

449
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,010
What is all this?

450
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,260
-Stop! Get back!
-Secure the perimeter!

451
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,970
-Yes, sir!
-Don't just stand there.

452
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,340
Push them out, you idiot!

453
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,390
What's the point of all this?

454
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,220
-Hey!
-Mm… Mm…

455
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,390
Sergeant Han?

456
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,310
Hey, what are you doing?
Put this on and get ready!

457
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,200
Sniper Two, you're out.

458
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,080
Everyone,
back to your positions!

459
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,290
Yes, sir!

460
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:14,630
DO NOT ENTER

461
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,840
Sergeant Han.

462
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,590
You okay, man?

463
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,930
Hey. Hey, get the fuck up.

464
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:25,010
I need assistance here.
He's not feeling well!

465
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,060
Hey, shut up, asshole.
He'll sit out for now.

466
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,810
Get over here,
you undisciplined shitheads!

467
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,150
Fuck this.

468
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,610
Rest up.

469
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,370
Stay put. Come on, sir.

470
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,540
You're obviously not well.
How could you help like this?

471
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,840
All units…

472
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,840
stand by for the order to shoot.

473
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,590
I repeat.

474
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,760
-Stand by for the order to shoot.
-Come on.

475
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,180
Don't worry about it.

476
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,180
It'll all be fine.

477
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,440
We're three minutes out.
Get ready, soldiers!

478
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,860
-Stand by!
-Yes, sir!

479
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,360
-Where is she?
-We have to do a thorough search.

480
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,490
There's his mother.

481
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,490
What's going on?
Why are you sending people away?

482
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,580
Well, ma'am, Ru-ri will be here soon.

483
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,290
Ru-ri, really?

484
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,120
Yes.
We need you to cooperate with us.

485
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,670
Why do you have your gun?

486
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,380
Don't worry about it,
It's in case of an emergency.

487
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,130
Hang on. Why are you all
wearing your guns?

488
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,300
I said, we need you to cooperate with us.

489
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,890
-This way, ma'am.
-Let go.

490
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,850
-Come on.
-What are you planning to do to my son?

491
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,850
-Ma'am, you're coming with us.
-I'm not going.

492
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,060
-Let get her outside.
-Let go!

493
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,190
-Easy, ma'am, okay? Come on.
-Let me go now!

494
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,270
Stop it, you sons of bitches!

495
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,700
Ru-ri!

496
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,500
Get out of my house now.

497
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,210
Kim Ru-ri.

498
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,750
Surrender and--

499
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,250
I said get out!

500
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,260
Everyone better get the fuck out.

501
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Get out! Right now!

502
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,850
Sure, yeah.

503
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,520
Ru-ri! Ru-ri!

504
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,610
Clear out, ma'am!

505
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,440
Come on!

506
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,490
It's him! He's got a grenade!

507
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,200
Fall back!

508
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,330
I have eyes on the target!

509
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,460
It's him!

510
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,750
Everyone back! Back!

511
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,920
Get back, everyone!

512
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

513
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,220
-Stop! Stop!
-Hey! Whoa! Whoa!

514
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,720
Easy…

515
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,350
All right! Don't back down!

516
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,020
Everyone, raise your guns!

517
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,570
Form a line!

518
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,610
Don't move!

519
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,780
Why?

520
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,950
Why?

521
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,750
Why?

522
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,590
Private Kim Ru-ri, we have you surrounded!

523
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,470
Release the hostage
and put the grenade down!

524
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,140
I repeat!

525
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,310
We have you surrounded.

526
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,390
Release the hostage
and put the grenade down!

527
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,600
Target in sight. He has a hostage.

528
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,020
Copy.

529
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,570
He has a hostage.

530
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,160
My sniper is ready. Give the order?

531
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,160
It's your call
as commander-in-charge.

532
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,000
Why would you ask me that?

533
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,550
EUN, DO ME A FAVOR JUST THIS ONCE

534
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,920
WE HAVE TO SAVE THE KID!

535
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,390
We're approaching the site.

536
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,270
I repeat, Kim Ru-ri,

537
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,140
we have you surrounded!

538
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,230
Drop the grenade
and release the hostage immediately!

539
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,570
Kim Ru-ri, this is your final warning!

540
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,530
Kim Ru-ri, this is your last chance.

541
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,780
Is this how you want to die?

542
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,610
You bastards.

543
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,280
This is so unfair.

544
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,490
You all blame me! It is unfair!

545
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,830
Private Kim Ru-ri.

546
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,510
What are you doing? Get back!

547
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,640
You were pushed too far, I know.

548
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,020
You, uh, are about to hurt
an innocent man, Ru-ri.

549
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,940
What about how they all bullied
and hurt me then, huh?

550
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,070
Doesn't anybody care about that?

551
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,070
If you keep going,
they'll put you to death.

552
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,370
That's right, I know.

553
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,000
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Stop, stop, stop.

554
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,050
-Hands up!
-Take aim. Stand your ground!

555
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:49,960
Try me!

556
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,130
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Take aim!

557
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,630
-Don't do it!
-Come at me!

558
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,760
Hold your ground, gentlemen!

559
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,470
-Shoot me! You fucking bastards!
-Stand your ground!

560
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,930
Fire on my order only!
Hold your fire!

561
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,070
Come on, you bastards! Why wait?

562
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,900
I said get back!

563
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,760
Listen to me carefully.

564
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,090
We have to save Kim Ru-ri.

565
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,680
We sat and talked with him.

566
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,560
We have to do everything to save him.

567
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,440
We have to do something!

568
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,270
Are you listening to me?

569
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,980
-Are you listening?
-Mm…

570
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,570
Hey, Han Ho-yeol!

571
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:01,240
WHAT CAN I DO?

572
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,790
Hey! Get him out here!

573
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,710
-Hey, get in there.
-Come over here now! Come on, hurry!

574
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,670
Now!

575
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,170
-To your positions!
-Hey, you! Get over here.

576
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,750
-Come here! Come here!
-Yes, sir!

577
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,010
Shoot me!

578
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,680
-Shoot, assholes! Try me!
-Shit.

579
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,350
-Take aim!
-We're all going to fucking die today!

580
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,180
Shoot me!

581
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,060
Just shoot me!

582
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,480
I said shoot me!

583
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,350
-Whoa, whoa…
-Hold your fire!

584
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,860
You motherfuckers!

585
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,740
-Shoot me!
-Hey, Kim Ruri!

586
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,240
Sergeant Han?

587
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,490
What's he doing?

588
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,700
I'm filming this right now.

589
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,040
You're on a live stream!

590
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,000
-Hey, put the camera away!
-That way…

591
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,710
they won't open fire.

592
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,510
Hey, what are you doing?

593
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,220
-Turn off the camera!
-Turn the camera off!

594
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,300
-Somebody grab him.
-This is driving me crazy

595
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,930
Don't fucking move!

596
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,060
Whoa, whoa…

597
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,390
I said, don't move!

598
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,100
-Someone get the guy with…
-An Jun-ho!

599
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,850
Don't just stand there!

600
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,480
Somebody grab that guy!

601
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,190
Shit.

602
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,610
Stop! Come back !

603
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,530
Hey! Go, get them!

604
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,740
-Get them!
-I'm sorry.

605
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,570
-I'm sorry.
-Open up,

606
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,910
What the hell are you doing?

607
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,330
-What is this?
-Watch out!

608
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,250
Move now!

609
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,960
Ru-ri!

610
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,880
We know each other!

611
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,630
We've met before!

612
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,340
I've met you before!

613
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,970
That's why I'm sorry!

614
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,680
-Stop filming!
-If you feel abused,

615
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,350
you need to survive this, okay?

616
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,060
Have a trial.
And face the punishment for it!

617
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,680
Private Kim Ru-ri!

618
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,110
We're trying to help you out!

619
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,730
You're not really trying to die! Right?

620
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,740
Private Kim Ru-ri,
you have to live!

621
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,650
You have to!

622
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,070
Get him! Get him!

623
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,410
Sir, they're streaming it online.

624
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,000
If the sniper takes him out…

625
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,590
Man, this rain won't stop.

626
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,470
We've contacted
the service provider.

627
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,930
The connection will be cut off soon.

628
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,980
You hear me, asshole?
I said, stop filming!

629
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,310
AN ERROR HAS OCCURRED

630
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,520
-What happened? No.
-Open up.

631
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,400
Push!

632
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,200
Shit!

633
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,780
Hey!

634
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,490
Stay still!

635
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,960
Don't!

636
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,210
Enough!

637
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,350
The situation is becoming dangerous.

638
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,100
Give me the order, ma'am.

639
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,700
Snipers, ready. On my command.

640
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,760
Private Kim! Hey!

641
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:57,140
No! Don't do it!
Get away! Get away!

642
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,150
What do you think you're doing?

643
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,320
Don't do it!

644
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,670
Mom.

645
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:27,970
Mom.

646
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,030
Mom.

647
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,030
You're okay, son.

648
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,080
Mom. Mom.

649
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,590
Oh, Mom.

650
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,810
Mom. Mom.

651
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,980
It's okay, son.

652
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,900
Mom.

653
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,840
Well, fuck me.

654
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:03,730
Put it away.

655
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,490
Incompetent bitch.

656
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,530
Guns down!

657
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,220
It's all right.

658
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,440
Private Kim Ru-ri
will receive due punishment.

659
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,650
And I will give you my word
it will be a fair trial.

660
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,740
Don't just stand there!

661
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,700
Escort Private Kim's mother
someplace warm.

662
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,290
We did it.

663
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,250
He lives.

664
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,250
He lives.

665
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:32,230
CHUNGMUDAE CHURCH

666
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,840
I have no excuse, sir.

667
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:57,760
But we'll make sure Colonel Seo
is held responsible for it.

668
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,220
And we'll punish the 103rd Division
soldiers who disobeyed orders.

669
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,820
Punish them how?

670
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,320
They should get an award.

671
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,790
I apologize, sir.

672
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,330
Start using your head.

673
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,120
Sorry, sir.

674
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,090
As I explained to you before all this,

675
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:34,380
the Kim Ru-ri trial puts us
in a bad position.

676
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,510
COMPLAINT AGAINST THE STATE
FOR DAMAGES FOR VICTIMS OF MILITARY

677
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,800
People from all over are looking
into our operations.

678
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,600
If the press and human rights centers
take aim at us,

679
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,810
the National Assembly will get invvolved.

680
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,190
The snowball effect of this
can cause irreparable damage.

681
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,330
Early morning yesterday, there was a
confrontation with the armed deserter,

682
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,210
But with the military's prompt response,

683
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,090
the situation ended
without any harm to civilians.

684
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,420
Under the advice of authorities,
the armed deserter,

685
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:23,100
Private Kim Ru-ri, turned himself in
and was safely taken into custody.
