Oh, sorry.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,050
It's been so long since I've been
on shift. I forgot how to do it.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,300
You're a mess, that's embarrassing.

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,430
Hand it over.

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,340
Here.

16
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,640
The safety always stays on.

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,270
The seal can't get damaged,
even if they're blanks, or it's your ass.

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,350
You hear me?

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,230
Yes. I'm sorry.

20
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,020
Here.

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,950
You ever think about
how dangerous this is?

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,040
Every soldier here,

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,330
they're armed with one of these.

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,830
Jun-ho.

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,460
Keep your thoughts in check, Jun-ho.

26
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,090
What the hell are you gonna do
when I go home?

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,810
You've got a point.

28
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,000
10. THE CHARRED REMAINS

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,800
What a treat, our former
deputy commander, Seo Eun,

30
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,970
at our shabby division.

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,310
To what do I owe the honor
to be graced by your presence.

32
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,220
It's such a privilege to have you.

33
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,440
Can't you show a little kindness
to someone who's about to be discharged

34
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,600
after being forced out?

35
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,690
I wish I could play back all the things
you've said to me over the years.

36
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,400
Touché.

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,400
Well, this is my karma, I guess.

38
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,780
On that night,

39
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,290
why didn't you order the snipers
to kill Kim Ru-ri?

40
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,290
If you had done what you were told…

41
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,340
-It's not that I didn't, I couldn't.
-I mean…

42
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,180
To be honest, I thought that I could
become someone like General Ja-woon, but…

43
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,430
in the end, I couldn't.

44
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,440
Here you go.

45
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,780
MILITARY USE
AUXILIARY STORAGE UNIT

46
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,280
As you know, these aren't people
you should take lightly.

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,530
I took this as insurance.

48
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,990
But it's locked
and I couldn't view it at all.

49
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,330
So good luck opening it.

50
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,660
So you want to get back at those pricks
but I need to take all the risks?

51
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,370
Really?

52
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,210
Are you scared?

53
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,840
Me scared?

54
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,380
I'll show you scared.

55
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,670
What am I? A child?

56
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,560
DBS

57
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,560
Man! Why would he send us
to a place like this?

58
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,940
I never thought
I'd go to a news station. Huh!

59
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,190
I sent the USB you gave me
to an external source.

60
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,480
Gi-yeong vetted it.

61
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,490
Perfect. Good work. Thank you.

62
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,740
What is the Ministry of Defense's
position regarding the criticism

63
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,250
that is being leveled at them
by the press and the public?

64
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,160
Right.

65
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,710
DEBATE ON ABOLITION OF MILITARY COURT

66
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,540
We should consider
the unique nature of our military.

67
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,550
North Korea is a security threat
that requires constant monitoring.

68
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,300
JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL GU JA-WOON

69
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,630
And that is why
the trial reflects the integrity

70
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,590
of our nation's military complex.

71
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,600
And the fact that the coverage
by our media is so distorted

72
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,930
should be looked at unfavorably.

73
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,350
Yes, so to the concerns expressed
by the press and public…

74
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,900
…your response is to allow

75
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,230
for the judicial process
to speak for itself.

76
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,070
Did he call us just to show off?

77
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,190
…professor and general
within the Ministry of Defense…

78
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,570
Hello, gentlemen.

79
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,950
-Sir.
-Yes, have a seat.

80
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,290
Well, huh?

81
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,130
I appreciate you trekking out here.

82
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,050
Uh, why did you ask us to meet, sir?

83
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,230
This is Staff Sergeant Na Jung-seok.

84

MILITARY PERSONNEL RECORDS
NA JUNG-SEOK

85
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,440
He died after saving a soldier
from a GP landmine.

86
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,740
It was an open and shut case.

87
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,570
That is until his friends and family
raised suspicions.

88
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,120
What does this have to do with us?

89
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,620
The Human Rights Division

90
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,200
requested the details
surrounding the case.

91
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,830
They want to…

92
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,500
investigate.

93
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,630
When it happened, there were accusations.

94
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,590
"The military is lying to us."

95
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,600
"The true story is out there."

96
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,970
"He was probably murdered
and they're covering it up."

97
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,480
These stories spread even in the military,

98
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,270
including the officer
who placed him on that post.

99
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,940
Captain Lim Ji-seop.

100
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,370
The EOD log

101
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,790
had clearly stated at the time,

102
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,960
that the old landmine

103
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,760
Staff Sergeant Na detonated that night,

104
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,470
couldn't have caused the damage
his corpse exhibited.

105
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,180
Exactly!

106
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,310
There you go. I'm sick of it.

107
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,230
I've had it with conspiracies
about our military.

108
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,690
I've decided… the best way forward,

109
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,740
is for the men who have
expressed suspicions…

110
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,250
to be the ones to reopen a case like this.

111
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,620
I know you're a Brigadier General,

112
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,750
but, sir, we, uh…
only take orders from our division.

113
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,000
One second.

114
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,970
-Yes?
-Sergeant Park.

115
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,850
Whatever they ask you to do,
it'll be approved by the unit.

116
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,310
So do as they say, all right?

117
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,530
So you know, I'm taking a top man
with me on this one.

118
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,160
If you mean Ho-yeol,
we can't deploy him

119
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,910
because his last leave was delayed.
If you're talking about Jun-ho--

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,540
Are you gonna let those bastards
push us around? Huh?

121
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,960
They called me out!

122
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,590
He even brought up Jung-seok again,
that son of a bitch!

123
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,680
Were you two close to each other?

124
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,220
You and Sergeant Na?

125
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,360
The night before Jung-seok died…

126
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,950
he called me.

127
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,330
This is Lim Ji-seop.

128
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,540
Hey, brother.

129
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,670
How are things? It's been a minute.

130
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,380
Jung-seok?

131
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,510
You crazy bastard,
it's the middle of the night.

132
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,840
Yeah, buddy, I just…

133
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,340
I was thinking about old times,
you know? And, uh…

134
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,930
There was this one time, uh…

135
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,190
It was when I became an NCO.

136
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,440
I sat down with you
and you told me that… it would be fine.

137
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,820
That's what you said.

138
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,120
That everybody's guessing.

139
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,620
Right?

140
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,710
Something wrong?

141
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,960
Brother…

142
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,960
That's the truth, right?

143
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,220
Everybody's just grasping
at straws, right?

144
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,340
Uh…

145
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,760
Yeah,
and the GP is intense as hell.

146
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,640
The sergeants are on your case?

147
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,100
Are they out of control?

148
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,900
Listen, just…

149
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,200
If you're right about something,
don't let them push you around.

150
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,240
It happens. Okay?

151
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,790
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have called so late.

152
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,870
Mm…

153
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,390
That was the last time
I spoke to him.

154
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,220
Jung-seok died the next day.

155
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,020
Something didn't feel right, you know?

156
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,610
I shouldn't have just hung up like that.

157
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,340
At the time
of Staff Sergeant Na's death,

158
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,300
there was only one person
who didn't give an alibi.

159
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,630
His name was Shin A-hwi.
He was a squad commander at the time.

160
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,550
Now, he should be nearing
the end of his service.

161
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
Sorry.

162
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,560
I know this isn't D.P. work.

SHIN A-HWI

164
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,280
No, I mean…

165
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,910
It's no problem.

166
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,210
Now that we're up north,
it's different than I expected.

167
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,170
What kind of place is GP?

168
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,800
It's almost like an island.

169
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,050
It's very isolated.

170
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,430
I have to warn you, Jun-ho,
it won't be easy this time around.

171
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,150
An investigation isn't only
about what you see.

172
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,490
We can't be sure
of what the GP soldiers are hiding.

00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,100
We're here.

DMZ GUARD POST

180
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Welcome.

181
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,810
Thank you for coming such a long way.

182
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,820
The GP is at your service.

183
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,860
Expect our full cooperation.

184
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,240
Heo Tae-san.

185
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,830
-Yes. Captain Lim Ji-seop.
-Right.

186
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,330
-Sir!
-At ease.

187
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,290
-Private An Jun-ho.
-Ah, right, right, right.

188
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,580
Oh, wow.

189
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,880
Hey, what happened to your car?

190
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,210
It's no big deal.

191
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,380
Shall we?

192
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,930
Follow me.

193
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,980
At ease.

194
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,620
And here we are, come in.

195
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,250
Okay, here it is. The observation post.

196
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,710
Take a peek.

197
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,590
I won't charge you to look
so don't be shy, all right?

198
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,590
CRUSH COMMUNISM

199
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,720
Yeah.
The GP is a fascinating place, right?

200
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,140
They're so close.
The North Koreans are right there.

201
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,230
NORTH KOREAN GUARD POST

202
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,650
Yes, it really is interesting.

203
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,610
Sometimes on a shift,

204
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,490
they even wink at us
through the telescope.

205
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,740
This place hasn't changed
since I was a cadet.

206
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,660
Yeah.

207
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,910
That's right.

208
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,410
My concern is that
if an incident did happen here,

209
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,080
how would it reach the outside?

210
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,580
You're probably hungry.

211
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,840
-I'll show you to your quarters--
-Show us the location of the landmine.

212
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,460
Mm.

213
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,780
Right there.

214
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,570
That's where
Staff Sergeant Na Jung-seok died.

215
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,990
Everyone,
watch where you step.

216
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,330
LANDMINES

217
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,790
There are still landmines here
that haven't been removed yet,

218
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,370
so stay alert.

219
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,710
Yes, sir.

220
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,340
Let's get this done quick.
It's cold. Okay?

221
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,340
I'll treat you boys to a snack, huh?

222
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,340
Yes, sir!

223
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,510
Commander!

224
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,220
-Yeah, Shin A-hwi?
-Sir…

225
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,720
I think I stepped on one.

226
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,230
Okay.

227
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,610
Okay.

228
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,400
You heard me tell you
to watch where you step, right?

229
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,650
You okay?

230
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,200
All right everyone, step back.

231
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,530
Back up.

232
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,700
Step back slowly. Slowly.

233
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,620
Oh.

234
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,300
Shin A-hwi. A-hwi.

235
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,510
-Shin A-hwi.
-Yes, sir?

236
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,930
Pull yourself together, okay?

237
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,650
Lift your boot, okay?

238
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,400
Lift your boot up, it's all right.

239
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,490
Uh…

240
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,910
Hey, Shin A-hwi.

241
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,750
Get your shit together!

242
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,680
Nice to meet you,
Sergeant Shin A-hwi.

243
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,140
You were right next to Staff Sergeant Na
when he died from that explosion, right?

244
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,850
Yeah.

245
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,270
Na Jung-seok saved your life, Sergeant.

246
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,730
But at the time of the incident,
you were a private. Is that right?

247
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,570
-That's right.
-So, tell me, hmm?

248
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,410
When Sergeant Na stepped on the landmine,

249
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,250
you were standing right in front of him
and saw it happen, right?

250
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,170
Yeah.

251
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,340
Can you explain the circumstances
to us one more time?

252
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,300
Yeah.

253
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,840
What?

254
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,090
Get a load of this asshole.

255
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,050
What asshole?

256
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,480
Hey…

257
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,060
What?

258
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,190
We're not leaving until you talk.

259
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,660
This bastard, Shin A-hwi, is
the only one who didn't reveal an alibi.

260
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,910
The way the case was handled was odd too.

261
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,800
Not even a week after his death,

262
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,510
and he's designated as a person
of distinguished service.

263
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,100
They didn't investigate
or do a proper autopsy for him.

264
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,640
They planned on covering
their tracks on this one quickly?

265
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,360
Being on the frontline puts the GP
in their own league.

266
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,730
Okay?

267
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,690
I was serious about things
not getting out.

268
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,400
I'm not sure I like how it shook you.

269
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,140
Wow. Didn't mean to scare you, guys.

270
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,520
Sorry.

271
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,810
This darn wiring,
it's not working again, every time.

272
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,730
Sorry, it'll be rough like this.
I apologize.

273
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,740
What was that just now?

274
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,530
Ah! It's to prep for the North Koreans.

275
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,160
Courage training.

276
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,450
The doghole you saw on your tour.

277
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,750
Yeah, that was made during the Korean War.

278
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,540
When the war was over,

279
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,010
the North Korean soldiers
would sneak across

280
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,550
and kill a lot of soldiers here at the GP.

281
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,880
What to do? Huh?

282
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,810
Just take it laying down?
We captured their soldiers.

283
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,640
We stuffed them in barrels,
set them on fire.

284
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,730
Operation Barbecue, they called it, right?

285
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,310
Good God.

286
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,110
That's the way it is here, I guess.

287
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Lieutenant Heo.

288
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,030
Yes?

289
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,660
You've been getting on my nerves
since we arrived.

290
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,960
As a superior, I would urge you to stop
with this strange welcome.

291
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,340
Furthermore, I came here because
questionable things have happened.

292
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,380
And I will get to the bottom
of every one of them so watch it.

293
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,390
Even if you…

294
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,600
knew the truth,
it wouldn't change anything.

295
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,640
Care to repeat that?

296
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,850
Captain.

297
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,310
I go on leave tomorrow.

298
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,070
So I suppose this is goodbye.

299
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,360
Get some rest, sir.

300
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,580
Ma, your son's home!

301
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,750
I'm on leave, my last one!

302
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,460
Hey, Mom, I haven't eaten all day.
I waited to eat with you.

303
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,220
I'd love dried squid.
I've been craving that!

304
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,220
I guess I'm talking to thin air.

305
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,430
If she moved, she should have told me.

306
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,230
-Just looking at it…
-Huh? Right? Huh?

307
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,940
You know
at those company parties,

308
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,360
the glasses get mixed up
so I don't know which glass is mine.

309
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,240
And I have to drink,
so for now I'll just grab any glass.

310
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,570
Has anyone else drank from the top of…

311
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,660
I think people would have put their mouth
a lot on this part, but I drink from here.

312
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,000
And then I look down the glass,
then another person comes along…

313
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,340
It sure seems like
they wanted this swept under the rug.

314
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,510
We need to find the reason
they would try to wrap it up that quickly.

315
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,800
Also, there's something that rubbed me
the wrong way in the initial report.

316
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,720
What is it?

317
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,730
There's a soldier,
he kept confronting his Sergeant,

318
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,860
and was about to get transferred away.

319
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,360
The commander was Sergeant Na.

320
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,480
The soldier was Shin A-hwi.

321
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,490
Do you mean Shin A-hwi
that Sergeant Na saved from the mine?

322
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,410
They were at odds with each other?

323
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Exactly. There's something there, right?

324
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,000
Look into it.

325
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,760
According to the information
we gathered,

326
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,520
you and Staff Sergeant Na
were not on, um… very good terms, right?

327
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,190
Ah…

328
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,940
That worn-out conspiracy again.

329
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,570
The theory…

330
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,200
that the GP soldiers had something to do
with what happened that night.

331
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,080
So we created a story about it
to cover it all up?

332
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,830
We just want to hear about
the circumstances of that day again.

333
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,830
The circumstances, huh?

334
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,340
Could you be any more vague?

335
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,970
That depends on who you ask.

336
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,640
I saw him die with my own eyes.

337
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,480
Would you want
to keep reliving that memory?

338
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,270
I'm sure you wouldn't, huh?

339
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,860
Well, that's not my concern.

340
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,280
All right?

341
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,610
I want you to take a look
at this document.

342
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,820
Go ahead.

343
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,040
That night, you and Sergeant Na
were the only two who entered

344
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,410
the restricted area
where the landmine was, right?

345
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,630
And?

346
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,090
I have an alternative explanation.

347
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,430
LANDMINES

348
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,390
I know what
you're all trying to hide.

349
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,530
Hey.

350
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,360
Were you waiting here long?

351
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,950
Oh, no, no, but…

352
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,120
Was there something you want to say?

353
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,370
-Oh.
-Huh?

354
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,540
-It's about my time off.
-Oh, that?

355
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,960
Well, unfortunately,
the last time you took the leave days--

356
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,720
You're fucking kidding me.

357
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,590
Huh?

358
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Nothing.

359
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,050
I didn't mean it.

360
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,060
Hey.

361
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,480
You have a lot of experience here, I know.

362
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,860
You're feeling the stress of being
a commander so young. But…

363
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,900
I need more respect
as the senior commander, okay?

364
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,120
I'm sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.

365
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,160
Now that I'm sorry, what then, huh?

366
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,750
Hey. I don't know what to tell you.

367
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,460
How'd a fucking sheep became a commander.

368
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,670
You won't get off my case.

369
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,260
Hey, watch out around here, asshole.

370
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,630
You think I don't know?

371
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,510
You're so fucking right, sir.

372
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,260
I've been rotting away here
for fucking years!

373
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,560
-Stop.
-Huh?

374
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,440
Hey, I'm just joking.

375
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,820
Get up. Here.

376
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,870
Stupid fat-ass.

377
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,630
You punk.

378
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,020
Some story.

379
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,650
Did you come up with that
all on your own?

380
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,410
If you keep this cute attitude up…

381
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,870
I'll gladly hand in a report
that shows all of you assholes

382
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,290
are trying to cover this up.
so watch it, all right?

383
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,250
Based on what evidence?

384
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,010
Nobody knows what happens here.

385
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,630
Right?

386
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,090
How's this attitude?

387
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,270
You little sack of shit!

388
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,730
I'll cut that tongue out
of your motherfucking mouth!

389
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,310
-You hear me?
-Captain, please.

390
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,980
This won't make things better.

391
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,360
Am I dismissed?

392
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,820
We're running drills now.

393
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,700
Fucking dipshits.

394
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,470
Hey, how much does this go for?

395
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,930
No way, crazy.

396
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,640
You like this one?

397
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,560
Yeah, the kids will like it.

398
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,110
That didn't sound very sincere.

399
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,610
Why did you ask me here?

400
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,450
Colonel Seo gave Captain Lim
the thumb drive, didn't she?

401
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,750
-Thumb drive? I have no idea--
-You're a really bad actor.

402
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,380
Bring it to me.

403
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,170
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking…

404
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,260
That drive has classified
military information.

405
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,520
This one should do the trick.

406
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,610
Colonel Seo is trying to mess with us
since she got fired, that crazy bitch.

407
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,900
But she should know the limits.

408
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,320
-This one, please.
-Yes, sir.

409
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,700
I don't know what's on it.

410
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,080
But I wonder what could get you to go
to these lengths. You're threatening me--

411
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,410
You wonder what's on it?

412
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,460
It has the cases we manipulated.

413
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,040
-I also had something on hold, ma'am.
-Okay.

414
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
What?

415
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,920
Your move.

416
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
What will you do?

417
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,720
Do you think you can expose us?

418
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,020
What kind of a goddamn fool
do you take me for?

419
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,730
But you're not alone, are you?

420
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,480
Do your son and wife like living in Jeju?

421
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,240
And your mom still lives in your hometown.

422
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,240
Huh?

423
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,280
Here you go.

424
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,120
You bastard, just take the toy, Jeez!

425
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,540
You're not curious?

426
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,920
Why we would send your team

427
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,710
way up to the GP, all of a sudden?

428
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,930
Get out here.
Tell him yourself, would you?

429
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,480
Han Ho-yeol, it's an emergency!

430
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,070
I think something has happened
to Captain Lim and Jun-ho.

431
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,280
The GP is out of cell phone range.

432
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,290
Yes, sir!

433
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,080
-I'll head out right now!
-Stop shouting.

434
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,460
Come as fast as you can, okay?

435
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,760
Once D.P., D.P. always.

436
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:18,730
DMZ POLICE

437
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,530
MILITARY PERSONNEL RECORDS

438
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,600
There's a bastard like that
at every base.

439
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,770
A person who rips apart
his fellow soldiers and commanders

440
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,230
they see as weak.

441
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,360
I guarantee he gave Jung-seok
the same attitude, right?

442
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,660
Huh?

443
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,450
Captain, I don't blame you
for being upset,

444
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,500
and I see what you're saying
but you can't just--

445
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,410
It isn't.

446
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,210
I know it's that bastard.

447
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,670
-But, Captain--
-Look.

448
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,970
While he was defying a superior,
Jung-seok died by accident.

449
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,720
All of these sons of bitches
covered it up from here.

450
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,510
These assholes knew
they'd be dead if it got out.

451
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,980
It's just it's a possibility
that's how it happened, but…

452
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,860
Nothing is certain yet.

453
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,570
-We need to look at this in a more calm--
-Calm down?

454
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,110
Are you defying me as well?

455
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,290
We have to be certain.

456
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,580
Right?

457
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,250
Hey, I'm open! I'm open!

458
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,170
-Right here! Pass it here…
-What are you doing?

459
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,210
Yes, there we go! Take it--

460
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,300
Shin A-hwi!

461
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,010
Oh, come on!

462
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,970
Captain! Please don't.

463
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,480
I just want to be certain, okay?

464
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,850
-Hey… Don't.
-No one remembers anyway!

465
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,820
Stop! Captain!

466
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,570
Open up!

467
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,450
-This isn't us!
-You barely just arrived here.

468
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,820
Unlock the door!

469
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,740
But your expression's changed.

470
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,950
You hear me? Open the door!

471
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,160
It really has.

472
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,250
I'd never have fucking guessed it.

473
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,380
All right, what now?

474
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,590
It's always the powerless commanders
that talk shit.

475
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,730
-Ah!
-All right, you asshole!

476
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,490
Last chance before I tear you apart,
you motherfucker!

477
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,070
Sergeant Na Jung-seok…

478
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,080
He was a very close friend of mine, okay?

479
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,040
All right? And he was
a really good soldier, too.

480
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,370
What does that have to do with me, huh?

481
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,080
Captain Lim!

482
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,290
Open the door!

483
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,260
Captain! Captain!

484
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,090
How close are you?

485
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,930
If there's a road block,
break through, and I'll--

486
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,840
Take that dick out of your mouth
and speak up.

487
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,630
Is that a trick
that your mother taught you?

488
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,800
Fucking talk, you bastard!
What's wrong with you? Hmm?

489
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,680
Why does it matter?
You won't even believe me.

490
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,600
So why keep asking me?

491
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,360
I'll believe it when I decide to,
you stupid son of a bitch!

492
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,110
Huh?

493
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,240
That story…

494
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,960
Tell me.

495
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,040
-You know…
-What?

496
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,590
The barbecue story.

497
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,930
It started when men defected
to the North from the South

498
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,010
because of the propaganda broadcasts.

499
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,480
They dug a hole under the fence to catch
the Northern soldiers to set an example.

500
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,400
Aren't you getting tired
of this dumb story?

501
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,730
You keep telling it.

502
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,900
But…

503
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,530
The stupid commanders,

504
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,820
they kept the tunnel we made open and…

505
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,160
That night they celebrated their kills,

506
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,960
and they got so drunk
that they passed out cold.

507
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,260
The North Koreans appeared
with a flamethrower.

508
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,090
After that…

509
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,600
you couldn't recognize the bodies.

510
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,010
There was charred human flesh
on the floor.

511
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,980
They covered lockers.

512
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,440
The ceiling.

513
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,020
Everywhere.

514
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,230
Everywhere.

515
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,660
That was fun.

516
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,370
That was the funnest version by far.

517
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:03,700
Hmm?

518
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,460
But why tell that old story?

519
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,670
You wanted to know.

520
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,840
The circumstances.

521
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,510
What do you expect me
to do? Hmm?

522
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,810
Here.

523
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,640
Let me see up close. Show me.

524
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,900
Show me, you asshole!

525
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,690
Hey, why are you showing me this?

526
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,400
What's this all about?
Let me see. Come on!

527
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,610
Let me see! Oh, you want me
to burn you some more?

528
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,530
Is that what you want? What is it?

529
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,740
-Come on!
-Fuck!

530
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,780
-What? What? What is it, huh?
-Fuck!

531
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,140
Die you motherfuckers!

532
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,850
Go to hell! Go to hell!

533
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,020
Die! You sons of bitches!

534
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,330
Oh!

535
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,000
Get out of the way, sir!

536
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,710
Did you hit him?

537
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,590
What?

538
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,800
Oh, my god!

539
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,310
-Over there…
-Hmm?

540
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,980
Damn it. They set us up.

541
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,150
Soon the investigation will end,
and it will yield us a result.

542
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,480
And the media will see us
in a positive light.

543
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,530
Ah…

544
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,540
Good work to you, too.

545
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,920
Yes.

546
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:11,850
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight

547
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:33,410
The truth behind the GP investigation
was different than we expected.

548
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,930
This may be surprising…

549
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,890
but the person who breached
our codes of behavior…

550
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,060
it wasn't A-hwi.

551
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,900
Is this fucking bitch
cheating on me, or what?

552
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,610
Why isn't she picking up?

553
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,740
-Huh?
-Hey, what?

554
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,030
You bitches better fuck off
all right? Or else, huh?

555
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,200
-Yes, sir.
-Now fuck off.

556
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,830
What is that guy's problem? Honestly.

557
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,540
It was Staff Sergeant Na Jung-seok.

558
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,130
This is Lim Ji-seop.

559
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,970
Hey, brother. How's everything going?

560
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,810
It's been a minute.

561
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

562
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,140
It's been fucking way too long now.

563
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,350
I was thinking
about the old times, you know?

564
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,230
I knew you fucking said that buddy.

565
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,150
Since these little fuckers
don't know shit,

566
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,900
you gotta fuck them up
before they get smug.

567
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,360
That's what you said, right?
You did, right?

568
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,320
Yeah, okay.

569
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,330
I knew I was right! Those fucking bitches!

570
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,670
Fuck!

571
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,750
LANDMINES

572
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,390
A-hwi.

573
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,560
-Yes, sir.
-Uh…

574
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,940
You fucking bastard! You fucking bastard!

575
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,940
I said I'd kill you
if I caught you communicating

576
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,440
with a commie again, didn't I?

577
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:27,820
Sir, the fence needed repairs.

578
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,490
I'm just kidding, you bastard!

579
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,160
I was just kidding.

580
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,040
You dumbass, it's your mommy
and daddy who need to be inspected.

581
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,840
Shin A-hwi.

582
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,170
Yes, sir.

583
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,800
The GP is so goddamn boring,
don't you think?

584
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,090
-No, sir.
-You lying bastard. Come here.

585
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,300
I'll make it fun for you.

586
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,100
A-hwi, you little piece of shit!

587
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,100
-You better respond to my orders, damn it!
-Private Shin A-hwi.

588
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,360
Okay.

589
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,650
You see that doghole
in the fence, right? Huh?

590
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,820
In the '60s, it was used to go over

591
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,240
and kill the bastards who were
broadcasting Northern propaganda.

592
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,240
Right?

593
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,830
Those cold-blooded agents

594
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,460
killed every last bastard
up there that night.

595
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,460
They burned the bodies in barrels.

596
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,210
-Private Shin A-hwi.
-Okay.

597
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:29,630
Do you know the funny part
of the story, huh?

598
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,380
They didn't close the fucking fence hole.

599
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,930
Wow. What happened?

600
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,680
Sergeant Na.

601
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,930
-There's a lot of mines--
-You motherfucker! Don't be so scared!

602
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,150
The EOD says this area is clean, A-hwi.
Don't worry, all right?

603
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,530
So now look at what happened, huh? Huh?

604
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,910
Look, look. A flamethrower. Fuck.

605
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,780
We took 'em.

606
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,910
Stop it!

607
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,370
I'm sorry.

608
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,420
Have you lost your shit, man? You're dead.

609
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,540
-You fucking bastard!
-No, wait! Be careful--

610
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:37,160
If we told the truth,
A-hwi would have faced a court-martial.

611
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,990
Honestly, they worked us hard.

612
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,620
It wouldn't have been easy
even if he claimed innocence.

613
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,210
So we all agreed to cover up the truth.

614
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,590
Good work, everyone.

615
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,930
But after that…

616
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,140
A-hwi changed.

617
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,640
Damn it!

618
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,820
Huh? Stop looking at me!

619
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,910
Fucking look away, bitches.

620
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,820
General Gu Ja-woon…

621
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,370
He knew all this before he sent us there.

622
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:33,670
This is it.

623
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,260
He drafted this article
before we were even assigned.

624
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,350
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATED IN A REINVESTIGATION
ORDERED BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION

625
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,780
UNKNOWN CALLER

626
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,280
Yes?

627
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:05,580
How does it feel?

628
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,120
Since you love the truth so much,
how does it feel to know the whole story?

629
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:15,590
Knowing the truth of this case,
are you going to expose it?

630
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,720
Just think about it.

631
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,520
Was Na Jung-seok a man
who gave up his life

632
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,520
to save his junior soldier?

633
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,980
Or was he a tyrant,

634
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,480
who enjoyed abusing his soldiers?

635
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,610
Well…

636
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,910
if you pick the latter,

637
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:48,540
I guess the pension
that Na Jung-seok's parents receive

638
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,000
will disappear too.

639
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,590
Can I speak with him?

640
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,340
What is the reason you're doing this?
Will you explain that?

641
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:04,930
Why did you use us?

642
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,010
So you stop getting moronic ideas.

643
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,640
These ideal brainless ideas that you have…

644
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,900
That you can do something.

645
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:19,070
Did you open the box?

646
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,490
What are you talking about?

647
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,610
That toy I got.

648
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,580
Oh, shit!

649
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:28,330
What is it?

650
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,430
Come on!
When did you even do this fucking--

651
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,100
Bring the USB to me.

652
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,020
This isn't something you can handle.

653
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:58,020
Shit.

654
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,080
A MILITARY CULTURE CREATED TOGETHER

655
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,410
Wait, what USB?

656
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,120
Well, Gi-yeong sent it
to some external shop in Yongsan.

657
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,500
Did you happen to notice
how Beom-gu's mood is so bad right now?

658
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,090
Let's do a good job.

659
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,090
It's not hard.

660
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,590
All you have to do is go there
and bring it back.

661
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,510
-Yes, copy that.
-Mm.

662
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,350
Also…

663
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,600
It's paramount that you don't open it up.

664
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,770
You'll leave a record.

665
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,480
-Yes, copy that.
-Mm.

666
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,450
…case that happened
three years ago.

667
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,120
The mood is uneasy
concerning the shooting incident

668
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,990
and the GP case
that is being reinvestigated.

669
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,000
As this controversy
regarding what the truth is

670
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,420
and who is responsible unfolds,

671
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,380
some are preparing a lawsuit
against the government

672
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,460
for compensation for damages.

673
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,010
Alongside civic groups,

674
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:07,630
our center is preparing a lawsuit
against the government

675
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,510
for compensation for damages.

676
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,890
The families of the deceased
and the people connected

677
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,180
to the countless cases within the military

678
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,440
where the truth was covered up
or downsized,

679
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,440
are also taking part in the lawsuit.

680
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,730
There are opinions
that this lawsuit is a ploy

681
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,690
to get people
like Private Kim Ru-ri acquitted.

682
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,200
SHIN HYE-YEON, ADMIN MANAGER
CENTER FOR SOLDIERS' HUMAN RIGHTS

683
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,240
DEMANDING THE TRUTH
BEHIND MILITARY COVER-UP

684
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,160
Kim Ru-ri played a role
in those people's deaths,

685
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,330
and he should be held responsible.

686
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,540
But we shouldn't dismiss…

687
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,590
that the government also had a role.

688
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,680
Both the victims
and the perpetrator of that case

689
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,890
were within a government system.

690
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,640
So the government

691
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:00,980
is an accomplice.

692
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,320
They are implicated.

693
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,900
The government is also at fault here.

694
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:12,660
And if it's true,

695
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,370
and they are at fault…

696
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,210
they should openly admit it.

697
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,540
We need tips from all of you.

698
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,800
I hope you have the strength
to do what's right.

699
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,600
Third Platoon, good morning!

700
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,100
Third Platoon, good morning!

701
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,850
Third Platoon, good morning!

702
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,020
Han Ho-yeol!

703
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,240
What could it be,
first thing in the morning?

704
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,240
Did you come to wake me in person
since I'm being--

705
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,200
It's Jun-ho. Tell me where he is.

706
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,450
He came back, right?

707
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,090
Why do you ask?

708
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,680
PRIVATE FIRST CLASS
AN JUN-HO
