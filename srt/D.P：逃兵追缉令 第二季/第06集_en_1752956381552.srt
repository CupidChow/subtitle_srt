ARTICLE 34 OF THE CONSTITUTION
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,940
Jun-ho, hey!

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,900
Don't worry. We're the only ones
in the world looking for this guy.

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,070
Come on, drink up, huh?

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,450
D.P.!

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,530
That's right, let loose.

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,910
Welcome to the Dirty Players Club!

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,330
Only then do we catch the bastard.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,800
Wake up, Jun-ho.

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,970
Why do you look so hideous?

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,310
So how have you been?

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,810
Remember how I got kicked out of the unit
right after you beat the hell out of me?

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,980
After that…

17
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,820
because of these rumors
of how I was a deadbeat loser,

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,570
my father lost his reelection.

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,910
And due to the fact
that he took out loans,

20
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,990
our family's got fucking wrecked now.

21
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,170
I wanted to study abroad
after I got discharged.

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,460
I can't study shit, man.

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,430
I became a non-com
and extended my service to survive.

24
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,930
Are you saving to study abroad?

25
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,140
I spent the whole last year
building my body. Why?

26
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,360
So the next time I saw you, I'd kill you.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,610
It's amusing, isn't it?

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
You haven't changed at all.

29
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,910
Can you bastards shut
your damn mouths?

30
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,340
Hot-headed kids like you can't separate
your personal life from the work, can you?

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,420
You should've checked the contents
before you destroyed it,

32
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,630
you goddamn idiot.

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,720
I'm sorry, sir.

34
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,560
All right, it's done. Fuck!

35
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,700
What is this?

36
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,530
DON'T JUST THROW AWAY YOUR COMPUTER
CALL ME FOR REPAIRS AND BACKUP!

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,950
So you're saying
there's no way to copy this?

38
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,120
But there has to be something you can do.

39
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,540
I don't usually do stuff like this, okay?

40
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,800
If we switch out the chip
with this one here,

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,560
then that chip would be empty.

42
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,350
Okay?

43
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,690
What the fuck?

44
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,440
Is the original at that shop?

45
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,320
Do I look like a moron?

46
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,030
12. THE DAY

47
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,910
Sir!

48
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,660
A MILITARY CULTURE CREATED TOGETHER

49
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,630
You crazy bastards.

50
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,090
You assholes have lost your damn minds.

51
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,170
Showing insubordination
to a superior officer.

52
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,880
This is an unbelievable disgrace!

53
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,430
You disobeyed your mission.
You helped him get away.

54
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,180
He's not just a deserter,
he stole top-secret intel.

55
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,930
It's a matter of national security,
do you understand?

56
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,270
Apologies, sir.

57
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,480
Han Ho-yeol.

58
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,690
Fuck, your entire military service
amounted to a pile of shit. Jesus!

59
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,570
Even your final days.

60
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,780
Oh, God.

61
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,030
And Beom-gu,

62
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,950
You let yourself be swayed by these
lower-rank bastards, for fuck's sake?

63
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,370
Okay, we're all finished here.

64
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,540
Right. Great work.

65
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,550
You're on standby.

66
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,720
Don't even think about
stepping off this base.

67
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,810
This drives me crazy.

68
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,820
The way things are,
won't Jun-ho be court-martialed?

69
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,200
It looks like it.

70
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,950
He could go to military prison if
they charge him with aggravated assault.

71
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,290
What the hell is on that USB that
could cause him to take things this far?

72
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,460
-Sergeant Park--
-Don't ask what I plan on doing,

73
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,750
because I don't know yet.

74
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,630
No, that's not it.

75
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,390
My delayed discharge,
I think I'm ready now.

76
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,350
What are you doing now?

77
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,060
He said my service amounted to shit

78
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,730
so I should speak with him,
in private, before I go.

79
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,110
Salute.

80
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,320
Bye-bye.

81
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,400
Hey, Han Ho-yeol! Wait!

82
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,530
I'm free!

83
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,290
-Sir, there's a phone call for you.
-What is it?

84
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,380
They said it's urgent.

85
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,090
Moron, I asked you what it is?

86
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,840
Hello?

87
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,810
Who are you?

88
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,180
Wow.

89
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,150
Being discharged is so nice.

90
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Hello.

91
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Hello, everyone.

92
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,860
Nice to see you.

93
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,450
Whoa.

94
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,620
Well, look at that.

95
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,410
I chose the perfect outfit
for the vibe in here.

96
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,250
You said you wanted to see me?

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,170
Oh, no. I said you'd want to meet with me.

98
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,640
Your email was surprising
to say the least.

99
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,850
Hello.

100
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,980
I am Lieutenant Colonel Yang Du-gwan,

101
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,060
Commander of the 103rd Division,
Military Police.

102
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,900
General Gu Ja-woon…

103
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,990
…already knew the truth
had been covered up,

104
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,620
at the time I sent Captain Lim
and Sergeant Park to the GP.

105
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,620
During the investigation,
he offered rewards and pressured me,

106
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,290
their direct commander.

107
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,040
He threatened me with his influence

108
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,250
over personnel appointments.

109
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,710
What did you do?

110
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,050
Huh?

111
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,470
What?

112
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,060
You better explain yourself.

113
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,230
The soldier, Park Se-ung…

114
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,150
Private Park Se-ung.

115
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,030
Se-ung's father runs an academy
and you used your power,

116
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,950
to get your son accepted, right?
You paid for it with our unit's account.

117
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,400
Why could that be?

118
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,580
So he could go to high school
over in… the States. Boston.

119
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,910
It's a green card hack… to dodge the army.

120
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,250
-Hey, hey!
-Huh?

121
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,460
Don't blank out on me.

122
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,550
I'm gonna need one favor.

123
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,260
What an idiot.

124
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,190
So then…

125
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,860
what do you hope to achieve here?

126
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,070
It's the word of one person.

127
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,450
Want one?

128
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,820
You smart-ass bastard.

129
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,080
Don't you dare!

130
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,500
If you so much as touch a hair on my head,

131
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,250
I'll blast that recording
all over social media.

132
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,670
I know you're a big shot,
but there are others bigger than you.

133
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,760
So what do you want?

134
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,270
You have to put a stop
to the arrest warrant,

135
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,560
and suspend all your operations.

136
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,350
Then, I'll bring you
the original USB before the trial.

137
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,230
Ah…

138
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,280
Putting your neck out for your junior?

139
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,240
This means you work for us.

140
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,820
Does Park Beom-gu agree
with this course of action?

141
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,490
What about An Jun-ho?

142
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,580
Jun-ho's feelings on this are immaterial.

143
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,750
All I care about is keeping Jun-ho
safe from harm.

144
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,470
So, what's it feel like
being in cuffs?

145
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,730
Just shut up.

146
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,980
Jun-ho, you're going to military prison.

147
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,280
It makes that little jail
on the base look like a resort.

148
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,450
Hello, sir.
I'm transporting the prisoner now.

149
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,790
Turn the car around.
Come back to the office.

150
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,670
-Repeat that, please?
-I said come back to the base.

151
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,290
The arrest warrant wasn't issued.

152
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,130
Is there a problem, sir?

153
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,090
I thought you said
transport him to prison

154
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,920
-and then go to Yongsan to find the USB--
-Staff Sergeant Park Sung-woo.

155
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,430
Stop running your mouth.

156
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,550
It's an order.

157
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,220
Sorry, sir. Hello?

158
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,060
Shit. What the fuck is that?

159
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,320
This is total fucking bullshit.

160
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,990
How many people have you put under arrest?

161
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,160
What?

162
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,370
I wonder if you've cuffed anyone before?

163
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,710
What the fuck are you going on about now?

164
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,090
You've got a big head.

165
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,050
Little Jun-ho's…

166
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,180
a big boy now.

167
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,640
No, it's not that.

168
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,600
I've cuffed a lot of people.

169
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,400
I've found these can break.

170
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,490
Motherfucker.

171
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,460
Oh, shit…

172
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,110
Why won't this fucking open?

173
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,820
Yeah, run, you asshole.

174
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,570
-I'm gonna kill you next time I catch you.
-Oh, shit.

175
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,910
Fuck.

176
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,260
If that's the problem…

177
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,940
then who the hell
is gonna deal with it, huh?

178
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,150
HAN HO-YEOL

179
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,990
I STOPPED JUN-HO'S ARREST WARRANT
FROM BEING ISSUED

180
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,240
I'LL FIND THE USB DRIVE AND PROTECT HIM

181
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,740
DON'T TRY TO STOP ME

182
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,220
Sir, there's someone here
looking for Jun-ho.

183
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,350
What?

184
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,230
Jun-ho's still missing.

185
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,690
Yes, she said if not him,
that maybe, um, the two of you could meet.

186
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,910
You and I have met before…

187
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,040
…when my little brother
was in the hospital.

188
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,430
There's something I need to hear.

189
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,020
Or maybe there's something
you need to tell me.

190
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,910
EVIDENCE
ITEM USED TO COMMIT SUICIDE

191
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,240
A while ago,
a man came to pay his respects,

192
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,370
he said he was my brother's junior.

193
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,870
Jun-ho.

194
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,420
Jun-ho wasn't your brother's junior.

195
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,470
He's the D.P. who pursued your brother.

196
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,180
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,860
There's no way
I can forgive him.

198
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,360
For all that's happened.

199
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,700
I can't say
that I understand it either.

200
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,750
But I know Jun-ho
was going to tell you the truth later.

201
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,460
To take the responsibility.

202
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,060
You bastard. You killed him.

203
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,560
After Shin Woo-suk…

204
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,480
-Bastard!
-Get off him!

205
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,480
Your younger brother dying that way,
Jun-ho became desperate.

206
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,570
Stop!

207
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,580
It was almost as if, he kept trying
to find an answer where there was none.

208
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,080
It was the same for all of us,

209
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,630
but for Jun-ho, especially.

210
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,670
What are you saying?

211
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,720
That's all just bullshit and you know it.

212
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,140
Well, you're not wrong.

213
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,980
Around here,

214
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,520
we can't really do much.

215
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,320
Listen to you…

216
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,160
Like nothing can be done about it.

217
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,410
I'm sick of it.

218
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,260
Not giving up on the answer
to that question…

219
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,260
…it drove me…

220
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,100
and it cost my family…

221
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,200
Do you believe that Private Kim Ru-ri
deserves the death penalty?

222
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,080
Corporal Jeong Hyeong-beom
was shot in the thigh.

223
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,170
He didn't receive medical attention
for over an hour.

224
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,420
He died due to blood loss.

225
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,470
The USB that An Jun-ho
wanted to give to me

226
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,130
had evidence that supported that.

227
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,140
You're saying it was the military
that made Corporal Jeong die?

228
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,850
-That could be a stretch.
-Yes!

229
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,100
However, they have a duty.

230
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,900
A promise to our soldiers.

231
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,490
To protect them and save them

232
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,910
when the soldiers got injured.

233
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,330
You're right.

234
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,460
Sometimes I think…

235
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,630
about how the military is,
and I don't know if…

236
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,970
I could send my child to serve.

237
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,170
Mom.

238
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,170
Jun-ho.

239
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,600
Your face…

240
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,400
Have you eaten yet?

241
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,570
You always ask the same question.

242
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,620
Thank you for the food.

243
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,870
Eat the rest.

244
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,390
Please don't worry, Mom.

245
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,270
I have to finish something,
then I'll go back.

246
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,690
Bye.

247
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,160
Your base called.

248
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,660
The man said to please call.

249
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,750
He said he was your superior.

250
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,380
The man who called me,

251
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,380
he sounded desperate, son.

252
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,600
How many times do I have to tell you?

253
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,310
He took the original.

254
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,480
Cut me some slack, all right?

255
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,360
Gi-yeon's my friend.
You know, we're brothers in arms.

256
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,070
Heo Gi-yeong, I'm gonna kill him.
Such a jackass.

257
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,490
Sir, I only need a little information.
It would really help me.

258
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,530
I really don't remember anything.
I'm telling you.

259
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,240
It's time for you to go! God!

260
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,800
Sergeant Park, if you're gonna try
and stop me--

261
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,840
No.

262
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,140
Let's do as you said. Find the USB
and hand it over to Gu Ja-woon.

263
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,470
What made you suddenly
change your mind, though?

264
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,520
While taking Jun-ho, he ran away.

265
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,980
With how this has played out,

266
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,320
we have to catch him first,
and hand over the USB.

267
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,530
That's our best play.

268
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,950
It's not my top choice,

269
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,700
but we can't let him go to prison.

270
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,000
Jun-ho will definitely show up
at the trial tomorrow.

271
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,660
Don't miss him.

272
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,920
Yes, sir.
I'll catch him no matter what.

273
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,420
Today is the day.

274
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,970
The trial for the lawsuit
of the Military Human Rights Center

275
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,260
has brought upon the government
for compensation…

276
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,390
"OUR SON" WHEN HE ENLISTS
"YOUR SON" WHEN HE GETS HURT

277
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,180
Here in front of the courthouse,

278
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,520
people from the Human Rights Center
are demanding state compensation,

279
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,230
while the victims' family members
are protesting against the lawsuit

280
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,060
and protection of the criminals.

281
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,110
Colonel Seo.

282
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,000
Excuse me…

283
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,290
Attorney Seo.

284
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,420
Thanks to a certain someone.

285
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,720
There he is.

286
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,060
You're waiting for him, right?

287
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,810
Your star witness here,

288
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,520
I wouldn't bank on him saying too much.

289
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,240
I'm so sorry.

290
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,450
Are you really that desperate?

291
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,000
Not only are you representing yourself
in the trial,

292
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,830
you're silencing the witness.

293
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,130
Jeez, how unimpressive.

294
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,510
Ma'am, say what you will.
But what's relevant here,

295
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,720
is that you have
no material witness today.

296
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,890
How are you the best judge
on whether she has

297
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,300
a material witness or not?

298
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,360
-You--
-We're down 100 points and…

299
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,360
losing the testimony of Kim Ru-ri
is just another point.

300
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,740
Consider yourself warned.

301
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,830
This woman fights till she breaks.

302
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,830
Great.

303
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,500
So as a husband and wife,
you will break together.

304
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,640
-Jesus.
-So if we're…

305
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,720
101 points down…

306
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,810
how do you expect we win?

307
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,810
He's on the way.

308
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,360
We stall them until the USB arrives.

309
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,820
I spoke with him on the phone.

310
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,750
All rise.

311
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,510
Please be seated.

312
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,190
We will now begin the trial
for compensation for damages,

313
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,100
PLAINTIFF

314
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,360
filed by the Military Human Rights Center,
the plaintiff,

315
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,270
DEFENDANT

316
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,030
against the State, the defendant.

317
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,830
You will see that these cases
and evidence of this trial,

318
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,830
were put together for show
by the plaintiff.

319
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,750
Shall we examine one?

320
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,880
One case in question

321
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,630
involves a senior officer
beating an unruly soldier.

322
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,260
The junior officer fought back
and assaulted the senior officer.

323
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,720
This case has already been to trial.

324
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,390
The lawsuit claimed
that the military was negligent,

325
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,600
and the situation lacked proper oversight.

326
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,560
The verdict was decisive.

327
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,610
The fight was an impulsive
violent eruption

328
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,240
that the commanding officers
could not have foreseen.

329
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,120
Our state supervisors
and officers who were there

330
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,370
could not be held responsible.

331
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,830
And now,

332
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,670
Kim Ru-ri here impulsively
started shooting fellow soldiers,

333
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,420
a tragedy no one could have predicted.

334
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,750
The comparison
of Kim Ru-ri's case to this one

335
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,630
is unfair and cannot serve as precedent.

336
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,880
In the case of Kim Ru-ri, he suffered
constant verbal and physical abuse

337
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,890
while he was honoring his service.

338
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,930
Even though administrators
witnessed instances of abuse,

339
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,930
it seems that they overlooked
and condoned this behavior.

340
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,110
Do you have any intention
of substantiating these claims?

341
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,320
There is a case where compensation
was awarded to a soldier

342
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,110
-who attempted suicide due to depression--
-The soldier with depression

343
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,030
-did not shoot his fellow soldiers.
-Yes.

344
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,070
Nobody else was shot, that's true.

345
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,620
The point is, one of the main factors
was the lack of action by the State,

346
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,580
which is why they were found responsible.

347
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,460
That is why this case
should serve as precedent.

348
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,540
The defendant should not use
inappropriate precedents

349
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,840
to denounce the claims
made by the plaintiff.

350
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,890
To get to the case at hand,

351
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,970
the one central
to the plaintiff's lawsuit,

352
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,560
Kim Ru-ri's case,

353
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,850
it happened at 22:07 hours,
on the 4th of April.

354
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,150
Private Kim finished guard duty.

355
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,110
When he entered
the barracks, he was still armed.

356
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,240
He then fired 14 rounds of live ammunition

357
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,610
at unarmed soldiers
resting in their barracks.

358
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,030
-As a result…
-Is he crazy?

359
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,120
eight soldiers were wounded,
and two were murdered in cold blood.

360
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,500
Your Honor, unlike the plaintiff,
this is not just a claim.

361
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,290
This is the simple truth.

362
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,000
The investigation shows the facts,

363
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,340
which are backed up
by the forensics of the crime scene

364
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,130
and Kim Ru-ri's own confession.

365
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,390
This means the government fulfilled
its responsibilities.

366
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,680
Objection, Your Honor.

367
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,640
In terms of Jeong Hyeong-beom's death,
it's still unclear whether he died

368
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,690
-immediately due to the shooting--
-Do you have evidence to prove this claim?

369
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,810
Also, if Jeong Hyeong-beom's death
wasn't immediate,

370
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,650
is he not still responsible?

371
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,150
If nothing was done when he could
have been saved, it's neglect.

372
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,700
You heard her say "if," didn't you?

373
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,700
Even the plaintiff's counsel
is confused about their main argument.

374
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,950
The facts are simple.

375
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,000
Private Kim Ru-ri came in
and shot down his fellow soldiers,

376
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,500
showing no remorse!

377
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,130
Fourteen rounds of ammunition!

378
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,510
Who could do such a thing,
to their friends in arms.

379
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,010
Yet somehow…

380
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,850
it's the State who's responsible?

381
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,520
Your argument makes no sense.

382
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,530
I'm curious to know
what you all think about it?

383
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,260
COURTHOUSE - BACK ENTRANCE
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

384
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,770
I told you I'd catch you, kid.

385
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,450
You want to be the hero
and throw the last punch, huh?

386
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,120
Beom-gu sent me.

387
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,500
You've done all you can.

388
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,460
Let's stop this now.

389
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,130
I don't believe I've done all I can.

390
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,010
Just give me the USB.

391
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,350
I need it, or you'll end up going to jail.

392
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,600
Remember Suk-bong?

393
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,610
Back then…

394
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,690
we did all we could then, right?

395
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,910
Uh-huh.

396
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,950
In any case, it doesn't matter.

397
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,790
I have to put you into custody,
just until the trial is over.

398
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,500
Wow, fuck.

399
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,800
The camaraderie is touching.

400
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,260
Oh, is this some kind of D.P. reunion?

401
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,600
Sorry, Ho-yeol, but Jun-ho is mine.

402
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,390
I found Jun-ho, sir.

403
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,860
Okay. First check the USB

404
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,150
and then--

405
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,280
Are you ready?

406
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,870
That crazy son of a bitch.

407
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,500
Well, the USB's either here
or there anyway.

408
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,810
This time's not so easy.

409
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,310
You asshole.

410
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,610
Hey, Park Sung-woo!

411
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,820
Shit.

412
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,490
Damn it.

413
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,210
Where do you think you're going,
motherfucker?

414
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,850
Fuck.

415
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,430
-Son of a bitch!
-Give me the USB!

416
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,730
Shit.

417
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,240
Do you feel better?

418
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,280
Getting revenge.

419
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,700
Beating me up makes the anger go away?

420
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,950
Shut up, asshole!

421
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,080
You don't know what I've been through!

422
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,920
You're doing this

423
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,970
to ease your guilty conscience.

424
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,970
Shit.

425
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,810
Fuck.

426
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,030
The storage lockers in the station,
meet me there.

427
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,290
Plaintiff, do you have
any evidence to submit?

428
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,370
If you don't, uh…

429
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,710
Wait. Wait, you requested
that a witness give testimony.

430
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,170
Then come,

431
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,260
-Kim Ru-ri, please take the stand.
-Your Honor…

432
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,760
I would like to request
a different witness.

433
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,020
Plaintiff calls Captain Lim Ji-seop
to the stand,

434
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,890
an officer of the Military Police.

435
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,440
Captain Lim was not only involved
in the Kim Ru-ri incident,

436
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,530
but also with the case
concerning Cho Suk-bong,

437
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:45,490
which likely influenced
the Kim Ru-ri incident.

438
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,860
He was the officer in charge
of the platoon.

439
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,780
That is a reach.

440
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,370
And nobody had more access
to this than the Captain.

441
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,910
I would urge this court

442
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,370
to listen to what the captain has to say

443
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,250
and form their own conclusions

444
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,300
about who is really accountable.

445
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Now, now…

446
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,850
I will allow the request.
Take the stand, please.

447
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,150
Captain Lim Ji-seop,
please come forward.

448
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,410
You D.P. bitches!

449
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Enough.

450
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,610
Park Sung-woo.

451
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,070
What?

452
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,030
I…

453
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,250
I'm sorry…

454
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,210
…about everything.

455
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,500
Don't fucking apologize,
you son of a bitch!

456
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,470
Did you think I knew
that bastard would die, huh?

457
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,970
Huh? How could I?

458
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,010
I never knew he would kill himself.

459
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,560
Hey, you son of a bitch!

460
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,980
Sung-woo, fucking stop it now, please!

461
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,650
Fuck the D.P.

462
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,780
Jesus.

463
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,030
It's over, okay? Shit!

464
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,000
Jun-ho, let's go, okay?

465
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,040
Please, I'm asking.

466
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,840
The USB, you jerk.

467
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,270
I'm so sorry.

468
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,850
Just hand it over, asshole!

469
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,940
Stop.

470
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,230
Come here. Give it to me, damn it.

471
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,030
Give it to me.

472
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:33,990
Damn it.

473
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,200
What the fuck are you doing?

474
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,960
Jesus! Give it to me, you bastard!

475
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,880
I do solemnly swear to tell the truth,

476
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,340
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

477
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,840
under pains and penalties of perjury.

478
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,640
Plaintiff's counsel,
you may begin your questioning.

479
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,690
Yes. Witness.

480
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,560
Can you tell us and the court

481
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,320
any information you know
related to this case?

482
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,370
One thing that I know that I believe
Attorney Seo already stated,

483
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,580
is in the case of Corporal Jeong,

484
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,170
he was shot in the thigh
during the first round of shots

485
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,630
that Kim Ru-ri fired.

486
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,340
The arrival of the rescue helicopter
was delayed, and he was…

487
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,350
alive for approximately
an hour and a half.

488
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,850
What is he saying?

489
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,070
Your Honor.

490
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,070
Objection.

491
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,610
He is making unsubstantiated claims--

492
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,570
You would know if you are a part
of the Korean Military, as I am,

493
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,830
that what I'm telling you
right now can happen

494
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,620
and is not impossible at all.

495
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,620
Please.

496
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,040
As a witness, only say
what you can substantiate.

497
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,000
Okay.

498
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,130
Till now…

499
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:22,350
during my tenure, as a captain serving
in the Republic of Korea Army,

500
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,390
I have never seen anything
as terrible as this before.

501
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,650
So then what on earth are we
supposed to do in that situation?

502
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,040
What could we have done that could be
considered the right response?

503
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,630
It's a simple answer.

504
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,930
We wait for an order to come in.

505
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,400
Please save me.

506
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,690
I would like everyone here
to imagine this once.

507
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,690
Please, help.

508
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,320
Mom.

509
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,240
It's a remote area.

510
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,750
On the front lines, right at the DMZ.

511
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,290
In order for a rescue helicopter to fly
over an area that's close to the border,

512
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,630
they would have needed
permission from the command.

513
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,470
REQUEST FOR RESCUE HELICOPTER PUT ON HOLD

514
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,590
STAND BY UNTIL ORDERS ARE RECEIVED
FROM HIGHER COMMAND

515
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,140
Someone save me, please!

516
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,810
Someone!

517
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,690
And we all know…

518
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,030
We all know that at times those
in higher command are not there

519
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,610
so they don't grasp the urgency

520
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,620
and there is a delay before we get
an official to give us permission.

521
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,000
Does that make it okay
for a person to kill

522
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,910
because he was brutally abused?

523
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,750
No, I don't believe it does.

524
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,420
Does a person deserve to die
because he abused someone?

525
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
No, I don't believe they do.

526
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,800
So what is your point then?

527
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,090
Here's the point I'm trying to make.

528
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,930
Nobody should have to die waiting,

529
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,470
waiting on a captain like me to get
the order from a superior to save them.

530
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,940
Cho Suk-bong.

531
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,280
Kim Ru-ri.

532
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,110
Jeong Hyeong-beom.

533
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,620
Even Na Jung-seok.

534
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,540
It's because of the systems we created.

535
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,670
Those are your opinions.
We've heard enough.

536
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,010
It's the individual
that is at fault in all those--

537
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,970
Then why do all those individuals
happen to be lumped together?

538
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,260
For what reason
did they join the military?

539
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,810
To protect this country,
that's why they all joined the military.

540
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,980
They all lived together,
and one of them tried to kill the others.

541
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,240
The State's somehow not responsible?

542
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,280
There's no proof or direct correlation?

543
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,820
Can you tell me what these soldiers
signed up to defend

544
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,830
and what kind of country is behind it?

545
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,790
Objection!

546
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,420
This entire testimony is objective…

547
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,710
and unsubstantiated--

548
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,390
I guess you came to find the USB?

549
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,980
I'm sorry, Sergeant Han.

550
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,950
I don't have the USB anymore.

551
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,660
What's that mean?

552
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,040
Your Honor.

553
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,790
I would like to submit evidence

554
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,550
that will substantiate
Captain Lim Ji-seop's testimony.

555
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,130
Corporal Jeong's autopsy report

556
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,880
and a second about Kim Ru-ri
that tracked his bullets.

557
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:33,310
It is evidence that proves
that it was not an immediate death.

558
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,230
Well done.

559
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,020
This is the initial report
before any revisions were made.

560
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,610
The source of that evidence is unknown.
That evidence is inadmissible.

561
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,110
I am the source.

562
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,370
Military Police, Sergeant Park Beom-gu,
Your Honor.

563
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,580
You're Military Police.

564
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,960
Now remember who you are!

565
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,210
You're welcome, sir.

566
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,170
Sergeant Park,

567
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,670
it's me, An Jun-ho.

568
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,050
My mother said you wanted me to call you.

569
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,770
Hello, this is Shin Hye-yeon.

570
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,480
I heard the whole story.

571
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,440
About what happened back then.

572
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,030
And what it was
that you wanted to tell me.

573
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:32,660
I'm sorry.

574
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,620
You don't need to be sorry.

575
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,000
For you and I…

576
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,340
what matters is tomorrow.

577
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,930
I'll be the one to deliver the USB
to the court tomorrow.

578
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:03,060
During the trial, Captain Lim will drag
things out by testifying as a witness.

579
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,860
Wait, I'm confused.
What do you mean by that?

580
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,070
Sung-woo, Oh Min-u, and Ho-yeol
will chase you and Ms. Shin.

581
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,570
You and Hye-yeon
need to create a distraction.

582
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:20,410
-Sir, what do you mean…
-Just listen, you punk. It's okay.

583
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:22,410
Trust me.

584
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,380
Jun-ho…

585
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,670
The USB, where is it?

586
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,380
Hang on.

587
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,050
This was all a distraction to buy time?

588
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,890
Hey, dumbass, don't you see?

589
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,310
Beom-gu tricked the both of us.

590
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,650
Did you think exposing them
would be that easy?

591
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,820
I will now announce
the verdict taking into account

592
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,280
the plaintiff's evidence.

593
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,830
The judicial assessment and verdict

594
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:04,080
concerning the compensation due
in this lawsuit,

595
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,210
that was filed by the plaintiff,
the military victims and related persons,

596
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,420
against the defendant, the State,

597
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,800
is as follows.

598
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:17,930
Verdict.

599
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,100
The court accepts the plaintiff's claim

600
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,850
in regards to compensation against
the State, which includes the military.

601
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,020
It also includes commanders,
prosecutors, and investigators.

602
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,280
However…

603
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,910
the acknowledgement includes some cases.

604
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,870
As for the other cases,

605
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,880
it was decided
that some evidence is needed.

606
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,920
Therefore, the ruling would be delayed.

607
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:02,600
The court is now adjourned.

608
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,210
Don't… Don't worry.

609
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,630
I'm… I'm sorry.

610
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,590
I'm… I'm sorry.

611
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,220
I'm sorry. I'm…
I'm sorry for all I've done.

612
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,600
Mom, don't worry.

613
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,890
Mom, don't worry.

614
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,100
Take care of yourself.

615
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,310
Mom, don't worry!

616
00:46:58,610 --> 00:46:59,610
It's over.

617
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,830
Great work.

618
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,630
You too.

619
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,260
I guess this counts as a tie?

620
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,600
You know there will be consequences.

621
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:44,410
Shit.

622
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,080
Sir.

623
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,920
Sergeant First Class Park,

624
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,250
you are charged with leaking
classified information and violating…

625
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,670
Oh, no. Sergeant Park.

626
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:51,140
Let's have a smoke, then we'll go.

627
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,230
Why would you…

628
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:04,740
Why…

629
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,410
Why… Why did you do that, Sergeant Park?

630
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,250
I'm the one who started this.

631
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,040
Think about what you've done.
You didn't see this coming?

632
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,180
Hey, D.P.'s.

633
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,020
Hey, D.P.'s!

634
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,770
Yes… Yes, sir.

635
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,570
Enjoy life when you're on the outside.

636
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,780
And don't slack off too much, you punk.

637
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,330
Okay.

638
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,500
After your stint in jail, continue to
work hard and serve with integrity

639
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,540
until the end.

640
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,880
Even if it's a shithole.

641
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,510
Understood?

642
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,180
Mm… Yes.

643
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,900
It's okay.

644
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,320
It's okay, boys.

645
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,960
Oh, shit.

646
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,540
Let's go.

647
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:07,860
CORRECTIONS

648
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,120
Is this a joke?

649
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,550
See, didn't I say that this would be
taking things a bit too far?

650
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:29,220
You were so creative
getting yourself into prison,

651
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,970
I thought you'd like to eat creative too.

652
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,430
You bastard, I swear…

653
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,140
No problem, I'll eat it.

654
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,720
Give it here.

655
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,060
Well done.

656
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,980
But, sir, will this be worth it?

657
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,030
You're locked up in here, sir,

658
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,570
and we didn't even win--

659
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,910
Did we lose, then?

660
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,830
Next time, we'll win.

661
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,590
Stop saying dumb crap,

662
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,510
and go get me some cigarettes
at the commissary.

663
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:15,890
But smoking's not allowed.

664
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,600
And I'm taking this opportunity
to sneak one.

665
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,680
All right.

666
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:22,230
Come on.

667
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,940
Let's go.

668
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:47,340
I wonder why you didn't let me join you?

669
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,210
Hmm?

670
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,590
You've taken all the blame.

671
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,300
Well, if someone has to lose his job,

672
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:58,350
it's better it's a lowly sergeant
than the captain.

673
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,930
Not everyone gets to be the hero.

674
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:07,860
You had to stay. Someone needs
to take care of the boys, you know.

675
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,570
Sergeant Park Beom-gu.

676
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:19,830
You know…

677
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,460
You've taught me so very much.

678
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,040
I appreciate it.

679
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,770
The tofu was my idea.

680
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:46,850
Of course it was.

681
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:02,410
TO INCHEON

682
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:07,920
TO YONGDAM-RI

683
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,970
Hmm. To think it's our last time
in a terminal together.

684
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,180
Does it make you sad?

685
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,810
I don't feel sad one bit, okay?

686
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,100
I couldn't feel better.

687
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,150
-I'll always keep in touch.
-Don't bother.

688
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:35,400
I have never seen a junior
contact their superior after a discharge.

689
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:38,950
And I hate when people contact me
on a personal basis.

690
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,700
Let's stop here.

691
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,250
Hmm…

692
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:49,830
Jun-ho.

693
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,260
I guess we're all done now, right?

694
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:05,930
What are you talking about?
I don't think I've even gotten started.

695
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,980
-The 3:30 p.m. bus…
-Oh, my bus is here.

696
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,070
…will soon be departing.

697
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:21,030
All passengers, please come
to the boarding zone to board the bus.

698
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,530
I repeat.

699
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:28,620
The 3:30 p.m. bus to Incheon
will soon be departing.

700
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,130
All passengers, please come
to the boarding zone to board…

701
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:35,300
It'll take a long time
to get there so rest up.

702
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,670
Sleep is vital for a D.P., you know?

703
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:43,890
Brother…

704
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,150
Goodbye.

705
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,740
See you.

706
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,990
Seriously,
is he gonna come or what?

707
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,580
-Why aren't they coming?
-Don't be mad.

708
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,330
-Hey, guys.
-Hey. Sorry, I'm really late.

709
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,290
-It wasn't me.
-So annoying.

710
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,590
It's him. He went to the bathroom.

711
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,460
You guys
wanna get coffee after this?

712
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:00,550
-Come on.
-Yeah.

713
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:08,390
Let's go.

714
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,060
Come on.

715
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,900
Hey, what are you doing?

716
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,940
I've met so many people
in the military.

717
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,400
And I've said goodbyes to many, too.

718
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,280
Will they remember me?

719
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,200
Will I be able to remember them?

720
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:19,540

00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,000
Private Jun-ho, report to the front gate.

723
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:44,380
I repeat. Private Jun-ho,

724
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:50,800
Let's go and enjoy this, huh?

725
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,680
Excuse me. Are you the one
who's looking for…

726
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,890
Hello, Jun-ho.
