1
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,320
Go back.

2
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,039
Go back where?

3
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,420
The palace?

4
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,800
You can go wherever you want.

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,560
You are free.

6
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,500
Even if I want to leave this place?

7
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,680
I will keep the six palaces empty

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,400
and wait for you forever.

9
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,800
You don't have to do this.

10
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,610
You are the Emperor.

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,440
Continuing the royal bloodline

12
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,640
and preserving the throne is your duty.

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,440
Your harem has few children.

14
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,440
You should be recruiting more consorts.

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,920
If it were before,

16
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,770
I would have done so.

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,080
But people are like rainbows,

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,210
you only know they exist when you encounter them.

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,200
Meeting you

20
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,000
has made my life vibrant.

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,160
Meeting you,

22
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,600
I finally understood that love

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,860
can permeate the soul.

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,250
Meeting you,

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,810
I refuse to settle for less.

26
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,120
But you should know,

27
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,680
even though it was all an act back then,

28
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,740
I still took that fake pregnancy pill

29
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,480
and might be infertile forever.

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,240
I don't care.

31
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,930
Then what do you care about?

32
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,600
I only care

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,920
if you have

34
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,079
even a little bit of genuine feeling for me.

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,880
My mother once said

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,600
that earning a man's true affection is important,

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,860
certainly important,

38
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,640
but as a woman,

39
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,440
one should also have the courage and confidence to leave at any time.

40
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,480
So...

41
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,000
Therefore,

42
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,460
I want to give you a chance to make me stay.

43
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,940
My husband.

44
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,520
Your Majesty.

45
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,960
Have you heard?

46
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,000
The great victory at the border.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,760
We've annihilated over 200,000 enemy troops.

48
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,880
The border victory.

49
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,210
Really? Prince Huai is truly formidable.

50
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,760
It's Prince Huai.

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,440
Prince Huai has won.

52
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,680
Heng.

53
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,160
My lord has won.

54
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,960
Jing.

55
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,720
I have something for you.

56
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,780
Your Highness.

57
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,490
How are you feeling?

58
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,080
Ruya! Ruya!

59
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,320
If we stand together in the snow today,

60
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,210
we'll grow old together in this lifetime.

61
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,159
I'm sorry.

62
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,520
In this life,

63
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,409
I failed to return his deep affection.

64
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
He sacrificed for you and for me,

65
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
for thousands of common people.

66
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,280
Let's spend our lifetime repaying that debt.

67
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,160
Empress Coronation Ceremony

68
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
Thank you.

69
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,480
This is mine.

70
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,200
In the third month of early spring,

71
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,840
Xiao Heng changed the era name to Hengru.

72
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,520
Ji Ruya was crowned as Empress.

73
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,080
Thus began an era of dual imperial rule.

74
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,360
They promoted worthy officials and appointed people based on merit.

75
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,480
They severely cracked down on corruption in government.

76
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,680
They achieved peace and prosperity throughout the realm.

77
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,840
The Emperor and Empress shared a deep love,

78
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,320
living in perfect harmony,

79
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,640
hand in hand for life.

80
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,120
Little.
