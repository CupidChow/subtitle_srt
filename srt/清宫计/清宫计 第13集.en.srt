1
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,560
Your Majesty,

2
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,280
Your Highness,

3
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,720
my sisters,

4
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,440
I am merely a merchant's daughter

5
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,940
fortunate to enter the palace by Your Majesty's favor.

6
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,960
I don't wish to be

7
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,860
the cause of constant turmoil in the palace.

8
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,039
If that's the case,

9
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,640
then I

10
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,810
would rather leave the palace.

11
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,200
Lan'er,

12
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,800
this is not your fault.

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,860
How could I bear to treat you this way?

14
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,320
Hear my decree.

15
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,560
Lady Li has shown poor judgment

16
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,080
and shall forfeit half a year's allowance.

17
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,960
If such an incident occurs again in the palace,

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,650
I will not be so lenient.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,860
Tonight I shall

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,700
visit Lanyu Pavilion.

21
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,639
Lan'er.

22
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,680
What's wrong?

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,680
Your Majesty,

24
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,640
Lady Li was telling the truth.

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,640
I am indeed not Yu Lan.

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
You mean...

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,530
I had no choice but to enter the palace.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,240
But I never intended to harm you.

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,400
Since the martial arts grounds,

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
since the day you saved me,

31
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,610
I've had my suspicions.

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,680
It's just that

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,079
there are some things I didn't want to investigate too deeply.

34
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:36,960
Actually,

35
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,480
Lan'er,

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,440
I've been waiting for the right moment,

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,690
waiting for you to truly accept me,

38
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,680
to tell me everything yourself.

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,410
Then, Your Majesty,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,760
would you like to hear a story?

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,880
I will.

42
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,520
Once there was a woman

43
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,160
whose father served as an official in the court.

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,090
He was honest and loved the people.

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,000
That woman

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,200
grew up under her father's protection.

47
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,160
But one day,

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,640
her father

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,320
was killed on false charges of corruption.

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,060
Her family was destroyed,

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,890
and she had to be very careful with every move.

52
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,620
She had no choice but to use those around her.

53
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,440
Your Majesty,

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,480
if you were used by this woman,

55
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,440
what would you do?

56
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,400
Perhaps

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,130
it's different from what you imagine.

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,000
Different?

59
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,760
That person

60
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,800
is waiting for the woman to give her true heart.

61
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,120
Prince Huai!

62
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,040
Stay back!

63
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,640
Run quickly!

64
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,600
He is the murderer!

65
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,890
Catch the assassin!

66
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,320
Quickly!

67
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:43,980
After them!

68
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,760
Prince Huai,

69
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,280
how are you?

70
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,300
How are your injuries?

71
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,890
Just some minor wounds,

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,460
I'll recover in a few days.

73
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,020
You were injured because of me after all.

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,720
Why don't

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
you rest in my chambers for a while?

76
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,760
A prince staying in a concubine's chambers late at night

77
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,220
wouldn't be appropriate.

78
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,960
Dr. Qin.

79
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,680
I have matters to discuss with the prince.

80
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,720
You may go now.

81
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,159
Your Highness,

82
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,159
are you all right?

83
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,130
I'm fine now.

84
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,920
Fortunately, I was rushing to the palace to deliver a message to you.

85
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,380
That's when I encountered that man in black.

86
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,000
I just didn't expect

87
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,480
that he would also have that jade pendant.

88
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,800
Who is he exactly?

89
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,400
By the way,

90
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,540
I've found Lord Ji's former aide, Zhao Heng.

91
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,520
He's willing to testify.

92
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,010
This is his confession.

93
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Just as I thought.

94
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,680
The account books and treasury silver used to incriminate my father

95
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,560
were all fake.

96
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,000
Unfortunately, we haven't located the real account books yet.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,060
I will leave the palace to continue the investigation.

98
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,260
You tracked down clues for me,

99
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,660
and got injured for me.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,660
You've done more than enough.

101
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,900
I just want to make amends for my regrets.

102
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,480
Regrets?

103
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,159
We had already alerted our enemies.

104
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,480
Lord Ji had evidence in hand

105
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,409
yet still insisted on proceeding.

106
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,040
If I hadn't let my guard down,

107
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,560
perhaps he wouldn't have fallen into the trap

108
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,490
and been framed.

109
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,000
So you were his ally.

110
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,500
You knew he was just a civil official.

111
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,520
You knew what you were doing was extremely difficult.

112
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,000
You knew he was in danger.

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,440
I...

114
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,280
When he needed you,

115
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,200
where were you?

116
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,000
When he was being assassinated,

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,130
where were you then?

118
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,680
Ruya.

119
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Everything was my fault.

120
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,280
It was all my negligence.

121
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,000
If I hadn't obeyed my royal brother's command

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,060
to fight in the war,

123
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
perhaps Lord Ji wouldn't have ended up like this.

124
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
I don't care about your grand cause.

125
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,720
The court can have many officials,

126
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,760
but I only have one father.

127
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,640
I just want my father back.

128
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,360
Ruya.

129
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,039
Let go of me.

130
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,860
I appreciate everything you've done for me.

131
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,170
But this happened so suddenly.

132
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,000
I need some time to calm down.

133
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,480
Please go back first.

134
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,560
Ruya.

135
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,160
Go.

136
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
Leave.

137
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,360
Ruya.

138
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
I never wanted any of this to happen.

139
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,560
If you need anything,

140
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,800
I will do everything I can to help you.
