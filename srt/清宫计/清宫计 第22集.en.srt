1
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,920
Yaoqin.

2
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,200
Thank you, Father.

3
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,320
Run!

4
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,360
Father!

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,759
Run!

6
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,440
Father!

7
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,880
Father.

8
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,800
I've finally cleared your name

9
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,360
and avenged you.

10
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,620
Good riddance.

11
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
Good riddance.

12
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,440
You've caused me so much suffering.

13
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,800
Has the Empress gone mad?

14
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,920
Mad.

15
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,440
I am the legitimate daughter of the Nangong family

16
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,920
and mother of the Third Prince.

17
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,720
I am the supreme Empress of the Great Zhao Kingdom.

18
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,360
You're the one who's mad!

19
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,290
How dare you falsely accuse me!

20
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,160
I am innocent!

21
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,020
Such madness and impropriety

22
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,840
disgraces our nation. Guards!

23
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,920
Demote the Empress to a commoner.

24
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Wait.

25
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,090
Brother, the Nangong family is powerful.

26
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,240
Without direct evidence

27
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,200
linking the Empress to this matter,

28
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,280
hastily deposing her

29
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,560
could cause unrest.

30
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,610
We must think this through carefully.

31
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Very well.

32
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,880
Confine the Empress to Fengzao Palace.

33
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,840
And him too,

34
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,450
imprison him there as well.

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,440
Yes,

36
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,160
I am innocent.

37
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,000
I am innocent.

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,600
Don't worry. I will find evidence.

39
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,220
After all this commotion,

40
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,180
I finally understand something.

41
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,130
You were sent to the Cold Palace

42
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,680
because you were conspiring with my royal brother.

43
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,279
Is that so?

44
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,480
That's right.

45
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,960
What are you reading?

46
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Your Majesty.

47
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
I've told you there's no need for formalities between us.

48
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,000
The way of heaven preserves heavenly principles and eliminates human desires.

49
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,580
Since when did you start reading such boring books?

50
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,850
I find it quite reasonable.

51
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,240
Why is that?

52
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,040
Your Majesty,

53
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,690
you have already helped me so much.

54
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,080
But I dare not indulge in your favor

55
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,480
for fear of forgetting what I truly seek.

56
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,760
So I boldly

57
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,940
ask Your Majesty to help me once more.

58
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,440
Tell me.

59
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,880
What if my enemy

60
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,920
is someone you cannot touch?

61
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,160
I promised you

62
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,560
I would clear your father's name.

63
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,940
What if it harms the state?

64
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,880
I know you've always blamed me for listening to slander

65
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,720
and wrongly condemning your father.

66
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,440
Actually, that was a plan

67
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,800
your father and I agreed upon.

68
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,320
First, we let your father be imprisoned

69
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,800
to make the Nangong family careless enough to reveal themselves.

70
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,480
However,

71
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,690
I never expected the Empress would send people to kill your entire family.

72
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,320
Your Majesty,

73
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
I want you to act in a play with me.

74
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,570
The Empress has spies everywhere.

75
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,480
To get Ruya into the Cold Palace,

76
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,960
we needed to devise a plan.

77
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,360
I just never expected she

78
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,180
would go so far as to fake a pregnancy.

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,640
I never expected Qin Moyan's betrayal

80
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,570
would send me to the Cold Palace sooner than planned.

81
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,280
But fortunately, everything is still under control.

82
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,340
So that's how it is.

83
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,400
I'm still no match for my royal brother.

84
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,720
I come from the Nangong family.

85
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,280
Once an Empress,

86
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,800
always an Empress,

87
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,360
forever an Empress.

88
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,760
Your Majesty,

89
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,920
these jade hairpins have been newly polished for you.

90
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,520
You need to wear it properly.

91
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,080
Yes.

92
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,480
The kingfisher feather hairpin

93
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,720
I am the only one in the world worthy of wearing it.

94
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,440
Have you

95
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,360
figured out a solution?

96
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,250
Where is the light? Where is it?

97
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,760
Give me back my life!

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,880
Ghost!

99
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,080
In this deep palace.

100
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,560
How many women and their families have you destroyed?

101
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,320
You murdered royal heirs and loyal officials.

102
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,159
You poisonous woman, die!

103
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,640
They deserved it.

104
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,370
I was born into the Nangong family.

105
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,840
Only I am worthy to bear the Emperor's son.

106
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,880
Only my child deserves to rule the world.

107
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Those lowly women are not worthy.

108
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Not worthy.

109
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,240
So you've harmed countless people.

110
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,480
What did you use to harm them?

111
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,960
Poison, poisoned needles, everything.

112
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,360
Where did you hide them?

113
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,570
In the shrine. All in the Buddhist shrine.

114
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,970
You finally confessed.

115
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,440
You... you all...

116
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,920
I never thought

117
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
that you would be afraid of something too.

118
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,160
A mere ghost made you confess everything.

119
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,360
No.

120
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,800
Impossible.

121
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,680
Why am I like this?

122
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,680
I am from a noble family.

123
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,340
Gods, ghosts, Buddha,

124
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,290
I have never feared any of them.

125
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,120
It's you.

126
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,080
That's right.

127
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,760
I poisoned your hairpin

128
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,770
to make you mentally unstable.

129
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Your Majesty, look at this woman.

130
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,520
She has seduced so many men.

131
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,400
She has the mark of inferiority branded in her bones.

132
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,840
Only I

133
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,880
Only someone as noble as I

134
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,100
am worthy of your majestic presence.

135
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,080
Each with our own strengths.

136
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,040
Only I

137
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,160
can stand beside you to stabilize the court and palace.

138
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,400
To rule the world.

139
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,720
You deceived the emperor - that is disloyalty.

140
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,600
You tarnished your ancestors' honor - that is unfilial.

141
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,040
You poisoned children - that is inhumane.

142
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,720
You framed the innocent - that is unjust.

143
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,160
You are disloyal, unfilial, inhumane, and unjust.

144
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,040
You have noble status

145
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,960
but lack noble character.

146
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Take Lady Nangong to prison to await trial.

147
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,490
Yes, sir.

148
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,680
No.

149
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,800
I don't want to be imprisoned.

150
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,880
I refuse to lose.

151
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,160
Ji Ruya.

152
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,160
It's all because of you, you bitch.

153
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,680
Ruya.

154
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,170
I've been your empress for 8 years.

155
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,610
You've always focused only on state affairs.

156
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,840
Never caring about love.

157
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,280
Why?

158
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,720
Why her of all people?

159
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,180
You don't deserve to know.

160
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,520
I can't accept this.

161
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,600
I won't accept this.

162
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:39,880
Meow.

163
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:39,880
Little.
