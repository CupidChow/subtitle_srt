1
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,820
So that's how it is.

2
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,660
That's why you came to the palace.

3
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,860
So you approached me because of this.

4
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,370
I am the daughter of a condemned official.

5
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,570
Your Majesty may punish me as you wish.

6
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,880
I will accept anything.

7
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,280
You deserve punishment.

8
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,680
All this time...

9
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,120
Why didn't you come to me sooner?

10
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,280
If you had come to me earlier,

11
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,180
I would never have let you suffer so much.

12
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,800
Your father's case,

13
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,680
I will help you investigate it thoroughly.

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,120
I only passed judgment because the evidence seemed conclusive.

15
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,580
It was never my intention.

16
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:02,920
Lan'er.

17
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,000
Can you forgive me?

18
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,440
From now on,

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,580
there will be no more resentment or secrets between us.

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,960
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,360
Your Majesty.

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,520
I am feeling better now.

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,880
You mean...

24
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,560
From today,

25
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,730
Lan Fei will be promoted to Noble Consort.

26
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,080
Mo Yan,

27
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,330
you're here.

28
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
What does sister truly desire?

29
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,460
I only wish to stay together until our hair turns white.

30
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,060
To have one person's heart alone.

31
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,680
I will protect sister

32
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,850
and fulfill her dreams.

33
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,130
Sister's wishes have changed.

34
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,920
You've fallen in love with the Emperor.

35
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,480
The moon waxes and wanes.

36
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,060
People always change.

37
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,520
I accompanied you into the palace

38
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,320
and walked with you all this way.

39
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,320
You know your wishes have always sustained me.

40
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,420
I haven't changed.

41
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,960
Mo Yan.

42
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,640
Please.

43
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,410
Even if you have to lie to me.

44
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,580
Tell me your feelings for him are just pretense.

45
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Mo Yan, I've always seen you as a brother.

46
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,000
As my closest person.

47
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,240
I don't want to see you upset.

48
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,480
Cousin.

49
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,159
Lady Qing.

50
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,560
The Empress has gone out.

51
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,280
Please wait here for a moment.

52
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,760
I've been asking my cousin for that storybook for ages.

53
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,120
But she refused to give it to me.

54
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,320
So Danfeng was hiding it here all along.

55
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,240
First-rank officials: 1,000,000 taels.

56
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,080
Second-rank officials: 500,000 taels.

57
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,960
How could this be?

58
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,120
Impossible.

59
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,680
My cousin is the Empress.

60
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
How could she?

61
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,520
How could she be involved

62
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,000
in selling government positions?

63
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,440
It's impossible.

64
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Xianglian, look.

65
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,160
This sachet

66
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,890
suits Qing'er's lively personality perfectly.

67
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,500
Your Highness and Lady Qing are so close.

68
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,880
Your Highness! Lady Qing!

69
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Lady Qing was found drowned in the pond.

70
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,440
How is that possible?

71
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,820
Your Highness.

72
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,260
Lady Qing has known how to swim since childhood.

73
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,240
How could she possibly drown?

74
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,700
Your Highness,

75
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,679
what is this?

76
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,240
If anything happens to me,

77
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,360
you must give this to Consort Lan.

78
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,299
Your Highness,

79
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,570
what are you saying?

80
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,400
How could anything happen to you?

81
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,360
If...

82
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,160
If nothing happens, that would be best.

83
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,400
But...

84
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,120
But...

85
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,680
And she was clutching this jade pendant tightly in her hand.

86
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,960
There must be more to her death, Your Highness.

87
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,200
This jade pendant...

88
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,960
Before Concubine Qing died,

89
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,640
she insisted I deliver this to you.

90
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,160
Jiya.

91
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,760
You know who the murderer is, don't you?

92
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,240
Jiya.

93
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,600
Tell me.

94
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,400
Making deals with demons

95
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,320
always comes at a price, doesn't it?

96
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,120
I sacrificed my kindness,

97
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,960
my compassion.

98
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,720
This time,

99
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,480
it's my life.

100
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,800
So my father's death was indeed connected to the Empress.

101
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,340
Your Highness.

102
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,520
Xianglian.

103
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,520
Leave the palace immediately

104
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,720
and make sure this reaches Prince Huai.

105
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,880
Yes.

106
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,720
Qing'er.

107
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,650
Why were you so foolish?

108
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,360
Why were you so foolish?
