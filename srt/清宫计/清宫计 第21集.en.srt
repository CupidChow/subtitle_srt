1
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,360
Just go.

2
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,580
I won't go with you.

3
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,080
Lan'er.

4
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,960
Lan'er, come with me.

5
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,820
I'll protect you with my life.

6
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,580
Your Highness.

7
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,039
I'm not worth it.

8
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,210
You have your own future ahead.

9
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,850
While I'm already trapped.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,729
I can't return your affection.

11
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,920
Lan'er.

12
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,130
Let's go.

13
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,000
Lan'er.

14
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,160
You'd rather die

15
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,600
than leave with me?

16
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,660
If you don't leave now,

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,060
I'll die right in front of you.

18
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,760
Go!

19
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,560
Xiao Jing.

20
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,079
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,840
I have things I must do.

22
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,040
The path ahead is difficult.

23
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,640
I can't drag you down with me.

24
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,810
Did I scare you just now?

25
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,720
I... I was just trying to kill you.

26
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,960
Why did you save me?

27
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,560
We of the Ji family

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,680
cannot ignore those in need.

29
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,520
Ji family?

30
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,970
Which Ji family?

31
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,050
The Empress?

32
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,490
When will you allow me to take the Imperial Consort away?

33
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,160
Why the hurry?

34
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,520
Once my third son becomes Crown Prince,

35
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,720
I will grant your wish.

36
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,280
Don't you all agree?

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,040
I'll grant your wish - with both of your corpses.

39
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,920
The Chancellor speaks wisely indeed.

40
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,079
Yes, yes, yes.

41
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,079
Daughter.

42
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,680
Father.

43
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,120
His Majesty today

44
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,160
specially invited you and your disciples

45
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,760
saying he wants to hold a family banquet.

46
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,280
For His Majesty to be so ceremonious,

47
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,600
it shows that our Nangong family

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,640
has risen to a higher position in His Majesty's heart.

49
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,200
Daughter, well played.

50
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,690
Thanks to our cooperation from both inside and outside.

51
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,520
Father-in-law has arrived.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,800
Your Majesty.

53
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,840
Your Majesty addressing me this way,

54
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,000
I am deeply humbled.

55
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,880
I said this is a family banquet,

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,640
everyone need not stand on ceremony.

57
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,120
Rise.

58
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,519
Thank you, Your Majesty.

59
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,440
I invited the Prime Minister and all disciples today

60
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,240
firstly for a family gathering.

61
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,360
To punish the traitors and restore the reputation of loyal officials.

62
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,800
You're alive.

63
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,520
Guards!

64
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,480
Arrest the criminal consort!

65
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,320
I am here.

66
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,080
Who dares to be so impudent?

67
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,880
Your Majesty.

68
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,700
I, Ji Ruya, daughter of Ji Yanlun,

69
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,100
have come with irrefutable evidence

70
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,260
to expose Prime Minister Nangong

71
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,240
for framing loyal officials

72
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,680
and bringing disaster to our country.

73
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,340
You are Ji Yanlun's daughter.

74
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,240
Your Majesty.

75
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,640
I beg Your Majesty to see the truth.

76
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,200
Framed.

77
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,520
Is that so?

78
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,240
The truth

79
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,720
will be revealed by solid evidence.

80
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,760
Ji Ruya, present the evidence.

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,320
Handwritten by the Empress, by her followers,

82
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,810
and by the Prime Minister himself.

83
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,440
The Ji family is upright,

84
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,570
yet they accelerated the conspiracy.

85
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,440
After imprisonment, eliminate them all,

86
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,500
leave no one alive.

87
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,320
What a fine handwritten secret letter.

88
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,520
What a fine plan to eliminate everyone.

89
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,600
Seals, tokens, handwritten letters,

90
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,480
all the evidence is here,

91
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,280
solid as a mountain.

92
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,100
How dare you still claim you were framed?

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,960
Your Majesty,

94
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,800
the token.

95
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,960
And also.

96
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,140
There are letters.

97
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,160
They're all forgeries.

98
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,920
Experts will verify their authenticity.

99
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,380
Besides, I have a witness.

100
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,650
The witness is here.

101
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,120
My husband, do you remember me?

102
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,080
You...

103
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,360
Your Majesty,

104
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,280
I was the Prime Minister's 24th concubine.

105
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,180
He sent me into the palace.

106
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,600
They wanted me and the Empress to deceive His Majesty

107
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,760
and frame loyal officials.

108
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,640
But Grand Master Ji Yanlun

109
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,480
once saved my entire family's lives.

110
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,940
I had no choice but to feign madness and flee to the Cold Palace.

111
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,720
Every word I speak is true.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,800
This silver was fabricated by the Chancellor to frame the Ji family.

113
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,640
The Chancellor used this

114
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,800
to falsely accuse Ji Yanlun of embezzling from the treasury.

115
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,930
You wretched woman!

116
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Shut your mouth!

117
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,159
I'll strangle you to death!

118
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,760
How dare you slander me!

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll kill you, you worthless woman!

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,720
I'll teach you to slander me! Guards!

121
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,680
I am here.

122
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,720
Let's see who dares

123
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,120
to silence someone before His Majesty.

124
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,480
Your Majesty.

125
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
You just called my father your father-in-law.

126
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Even if he has committed some wrong,

127
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,040
please forgive him.

128
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,320
Forgive?

129
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,220
Then who will forgive the upright Minister of Ceremonies?

130
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,760
Who will forgive the innocent elders and children whose entire families were slaughtered?

131
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,960
Who will forgive

132
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,450
those promising young men who died at your hands?

133
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,800
Your Majesty.

134
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,280
You cannot kill me.

135
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,320
I have countless followers.

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,240
If you dare touch me,

137
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,530
Internal affairs, military secrets, agricultural taxes, and commerce.

138
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,280
How many people would be implicated?

139
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,680
It's just the death of one

140
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,960
Grand Master of Ceremonies.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,530
Even if you are the Emperor,

142
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,680
you dare not shake the foundation of the state.

143
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,200
You!

144
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,640
Cannot kill the Chancellor!

145
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,560
It will shake the foundation of our nation!

146
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,360
Yes, Your Majesty, you cannot execute the Chancellor!

147
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,220
It will destabilize the country!

148
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,560
You cannot kill me!

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,760
Please reconsider, Your Majesty!

150
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,440
You cannot undermine the foundation of the state!

151
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,640
Chancellor Nangong.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,640
You've sold titles, formed factions for personal gain.

153
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,640
Persecuted the loyal and treated lives as worthless.

154
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,200
Your countless crimes are beyond measure.

155
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,840
If I were to believe your silver tongue

156
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,570
and let you escape punishment,

157
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,500
where would heavenly justice be?

158
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,220
What would remain of our laws?

159
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,080
Prince Huai.

160
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,400
Here.

161
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,080
Take Chancellor Nangong and his followers away.

162
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,120
Execute them!

163
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,480
Come!

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,060
What are you doing?

165
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,920
Your Majesty, spare me!

166
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,880
You cannot kill me!

167
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,040
You cannot kill this old minister!

168
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,440
You cannot undermine the foundation of the state!
