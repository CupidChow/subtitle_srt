1
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:29,640
Moyan.

2
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,640
After Prince Huai took your medicine,

3
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,900
is there any chance he remembers what happened that night?

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,400
Absolutely impossible.

5
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,600
Why do you ask?

6
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,000
I saw him in the Imperial Garden today.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,920
He was being vague,

8
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,960
pressing me with questions,

9
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,890
as if testing me.

10
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,080
Since Prince Huai is no longer a suspect,

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,759
from now on,

12
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,680
you should avoid contact with him.

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,720
Jiya now completely trusts me.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
I must help her

15
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,880
gain authority over the six palaces

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,640
so I can secretly gather more information.

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,639
Therefore, the flower viewing ceremony

18
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,100
cannot have any mistakes.

19
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,560
Sister,

20
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,290
don't worry,

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,960
I'll help you.

22
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,850
Let's meet in the Imperial Garden.

23
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,600
Returning what belongs to its rightful owner.

24
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,860
I recently acquired a new musical score.

25
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I wonder if Lady Lan would be willing

26
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,320
to discuss it with me.

27
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,100
Your Highness,

28
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,480
you are of royal blood.

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,200
If someone sees us meeting here,

30
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,320
you might be fine,

31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,600
but I

32
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,600
would face a terrible fate.

33
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,810
Beautiful Lan, you need not worry.

34
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,210
If I wanted to tell my royal brother

35
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,410
about you drugging him that night,

36
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,020
I would have reported it already.

37
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,200
Yulan doesn't understand what you're saying.

38
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,720
Ji Ruya.

39
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,690
Are you calling me, Your Highness?

40
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,040
I am Yulan.

41
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,040
Who is Ji Ruya?

42
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,180
Father's poetry collection.

43
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,680
Lord Ji's essay 'On Imperial Examination Reform'

44
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,740
pointed out numerous flaws in the examination system.

45
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,680
He restored integrity to the examination hall.

46
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Such an upright and honest official

47
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,480
was wrongfully accused in the end

48
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,940
and met with a tragic fate.

49
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,650
Miss Ji, do you not think

50
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,000
he deserves justice?

51
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,120
Regarding Lord Ji's case,

52
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,760
I've heard something about it.

53
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,720
However,

54
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,400
Your Highness should seek out someone from the Ji household,

55
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,360
not me.

56
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,040
Miss Ji,

57
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
you schemed your way into the palace

58
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,659
and pretended to get along with your sister.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,600
I believe

60
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,930
you only want to seek justice for your father.

61
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,130
But have you considered

62
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
that those assassins who dared to kill in broad daylight,

63
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,080
so openly and brazenly,

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,280
must have powerful forces behind them?

65
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,320
I believe

66
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,880
that within this palace,

67
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,440
the only ones who can help you

68
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,570
are my royal brother

69
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
and myself.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,530
I have a way to clear Lord Ji's name.

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
You can trust me.

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,900
Your Highness,

73
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,100
what do you want in return?

74
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
Nothing but justice.

75
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,460
I've been in the palace for some time now,

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,260
but the word 'justice'

77
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,500
is something I haven't heard in a long while.

78
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,440
Then consider that I've grown tired of being an idle prince

79
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
and occasionally

80
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,159
wish to do something righteous and honorable.

81
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,740
What is Concubine Li doing in Concubine Yushu's chambers?

82
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,640
Insect.

83
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,840
Where is Yu Shufei?

84
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,560
Yu Shufei is never late.

85
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,500
Something must have delayed her.

86
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,760
The flower appreciation ceremony now begins.

87
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,400
Flowers bloom with enduring charm.

88
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,000
Even in winter frost, we still admire flowers.

89
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,080
Very good.

90
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,159
Yu Shufei is truly breathtakingly beautiful.

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,559
I wish to present the dahlias I've carefully tended

92
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,600
to Your Majesty.

93
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,320
Dahlias are the most difficult to grow.

94
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,400
You've managed to make them so vibrant.

95
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,260
You must have put in great effort.

96
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,480
Yu Shufei,

97
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,680
what's going on here?

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,760
Impossible!

99
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,800
I've been growing these dahlias in my chamber.

100
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,120
How could this happen?

101
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,240
I did this.

102
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,240
It was you?

103
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
Why would you do this?

104
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,040
Lady Lan.

105
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,240
You've just entered the palace

106
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,080
and already learned such dirty tricks?

107
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,680
Guards!

108
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,400
Seize her at once!
