1
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,080
A concubine committing suicide is a grave offense.

2
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,720
Jiya should have been buried in the traitors' cemetery.

3
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,400
I have taken her body

4
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,330
and buried her with Lord Ji.

5
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
She said our lives are like ants,

6
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,370
while that person has absolute power.

7
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,080
Who could

8
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,400
that person be?

9
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,720
Within the imperial palace,

10
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,300
those with absolute power

11
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,759
are only the Xiao and Nangong families.

12
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,280
By the way.

13
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,560
Lord Ji previously

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
had political disputes with Chen Ruguang.

15
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,820
After Lord Ji's death,

16
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,720
the position of Governor-General

17
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,000
was filled by him.

18
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,759
Chen Ruguang...

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,800
If I remember correctly,

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,760
he belongs to the Empress's maternal family, the Nangong clan.

21
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,820
Are you suggesting

22
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,979
the mastermind behind this is...

23
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,680
No matter who it is,

24
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,920
I will fight till the end.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,120
Whether it's the court or the harem,

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,000
they cannot continue to destroy lives.

27
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,440
Jiya.

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,120
I still can't do as you ask.

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,520
If I don't clear my father's name,

31
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,800
I cannot rest in peace.

32
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,440
I've always loved these dahlias,

33
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
but feared they might seem too gaudy

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,370
and displease His Majesty.

35
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,640
Jiya.

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,520
These are your favorite dahlias.

37
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,200
I hope wherever you are now,

38
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,960
you can be happy.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,660
As for what remains to be done,

40
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,880
leave it to me.

41
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,890
Your Highness, Concubine Yushu has committed suicide.

42
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,640
A mere pawn

43
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,480
actually tried to escape my control.

44
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,640
Originally, Concubine Chun and Ji Jiya kept each other in check,

45
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,280
but then this Yulan appeared out of nowhere.

46
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,159
She has ruined

47
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:40,090
the situation I've carefully maintained for years.

48
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,640
They're all useless.

49
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,840
Mother mentioned during her last visit

50
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,520
that my cousin Qing'er

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,040
has grown into quite a beauty.

52
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,520
Understood.

53
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,850
I will arrange for her to enter the palace.

54
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,680
Luo.

55
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,600
Miss Qing.

56
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,200
Please.

57
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,640
Miss Qing.

58
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,159
We've been waiting for you.

59
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:54,290
The Empress has made all the arrangements in the palace.

60
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,380
Whose sedan chair is that?

61
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,930
It's Concubine Lan.

62
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,040
So that's Concubine Lan who has been troubling my cousin.

63
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,760
Yes.

64
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,660
But once you enter the palace, Miss Qing,

65
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,480
you will surely surpass her.

66
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,080
Of course.

67
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,240
Cousin.

68
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,520
Qing'er, you're here.

69
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,000
Come.

70
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
Qing'er.

71
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,040
The palace is nothing like home.

72
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,820
You must be extremely careful with your words and actions from now on.

73
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,120
Especially around Lady Lan.

74
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,480
She has always been calculating.

75
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,120
One careless moment and you'll fall under her spell.

76
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,200
And into her trap.

77
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,130
You must not bring shame to our family.

78
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,920
I understand.

79
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,760
I've heard

80
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,820
she's merely a merchant's daughter.

81
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,440
I will do everything in my power

82
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,040
to keep Lady Lan in check

83
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,700
and ease your burden, Cousin.

84
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,600
Truly worthy of being a daughter of the Nangong family.

85
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,280
I'll make arrangements right away

86
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,410
to secure you a position as a talented lady in the palace.

87
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,320
Danfeng.

88
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,560
Who are you?

89
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,640
I have never seen you before.

90
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,560
I

91
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,920
You are the Emperor.

92
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,159
Your servant pays respects to Your Majesty.

93
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,480
I am Talented Lady Qing.

94
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,120
This must be Consort Lan.

95
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,530
I entered the palace but hadn't yet met Your Majesty.

96
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,480
Please forgive my offense just now.

97
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,890
Talented Lady Qing.

98
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,290
From now on, we'll be good sisters.

99
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,200
I have a blood sister at home.

100
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't deserve to be called sister by Consort Lan.

101
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,480
Little kite,

102
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,650
I'll get it down for you right away.

103
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,040
Oh, it's you.

104
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,760
Thank you.

105
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,480
Just now.

106
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Thank you for saving me just now, Lady Lan.

107
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
I believed the rumors before

108
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,440
and misunderstood you in many ways.

109
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,960
Not only did you not blame me,

110
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,360
but you even saved me.

111
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,280
Before entering the palace,

112
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,800
my father taught me

113
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,460
that it's better to avoid trouble in the palace.

114
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,360
Why did you save me, Lady Lan?

115
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,250
Because you remind me of my sister.

116
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,960
I couldn't save her.

117
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,240
Now I must save you.

118
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
If Lady Lan doesn't mind,

119
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
please consider me as your sister.

120
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
In this vast palace,

121
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,040
I will have gained a good sister.

122
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,240
Good.

123
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,160
From now on, we are sisters.
