1
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,560
Dressing like the Empress Dowager

2
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,520
is truly disrespectful.

3
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,800
His Majesty specially arranged this welcoming banquet for the Empress Dowager.

4
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,720
Lady Lan,

5
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,800
if you want to steal the spotlight,

6
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,860
you needn't choose today of all days.

7
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,440
Mother.

8
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,160
Lan is usually most proper.

9
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,920
Today,

10
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,520
there must be some misunderstanding.

11
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,080
She didn't mean to offend you.

12
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,160
Your Highness,

13
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,960
I heard from His Majesty

14
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,800
that you went to the mountains for 81 days of fasting

15
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,400
to pray for our border soldiers.

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,720
I truly admire you,

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,920
so I sought these seven-treasure glass beads.

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Each of these treasures

19
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,160
symbolizes my reverence.

20
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,320
I never meant to offend you.

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,480
I

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,540
beg for your forgiveness.

23
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,120
Lady Lan, so young,

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,600
yet with such compassion for the people.

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,160
Compared to you, I fall far short.

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,240
But I still wish to do what little I can.

27
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,040
If you have time in the future,

28
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,040
you may visit my palace to copy scriptures and chat.

29
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,920
It would be my honor.

30
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,720
Rise.

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,880
Yes.

33
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,240
Mother.

34
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,079
Today I use tea instead of wine

35
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,210
to welcome you back.

36
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,960
This banquet is rather dull.

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,160
Why don't you ladies show your talents?

38
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,890
To please the Empress Dowager?

39
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,570
Sister Li's dance is the finest in the palace.

40
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,720
Would you

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,780
like to bring a smile to the Empress Dowager's face?

42
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,980
When did this wretch become the Empress's ally?

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,960
Your Highness,

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,200
Sister Li's dance lacks proper dignity.

45
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,240
It might disturb your peaceful retreat.

46
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,000
I recently learned at the Imperial Music Bureau

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,720
a new blessing dance

48
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,480
that would be perfect to welcome you back.

49
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,440
Granted.

50
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,560
Yes.

51
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,240
I'm merely a poor imitator,

52
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,500
please don't blame me for my inadequacy.

53
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,080
Your filial devotion is commendable.

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,640
A reward for you.

55
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,240
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

56
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,640
Sister Lan,

57
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,160
pleasing the Empress Dowager

58
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,600
isn't just about sweet talk.

59
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,079
I wonder

60
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,000
what talents you possess.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,800
I heard that a few days ago,

62
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,720
there was music from zither and flute in the Imperial Garden.

63
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
I thought new musicians had joined the Imperial Orchestra.

64
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,440
I went to see for myself,

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,200
but to my surprise, it was

66
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,680
Sister Lan.

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,800
With Prince Huai.

68
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,240
Prince Huai.

69
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,560
No wonder Sister Lan's zither skills are so exquisite.

70
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,680
That day, the masterful performance of 'Phoenix Seeking Its Mate'

71
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,480
was so captivating it could summon a real phoenix.

72
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,040
In the past, Consort Xi and the late Emperor

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,520
fell in love while playing 'Phoenix Seeking Its Mate' together.

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,720
They outshone the Empress who is now our Empress Dowager.

75
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,800
This Consort Chun really doesn't mind stirring up trouble.

76
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,760
Consort Yushu,

77
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
aren't you allied with Lady Lan?

78
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,800
She has touched the Empress Dowager's sore spot.

79
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,400
I'll see how you handle this.

80
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,080
Your Majesty.

81
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,600
My zither skills are poor.

82
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't wish to embarrass myself before the Empress Dowager.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,720
Perhaps

84
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,120
I could compose a poem instead.

85
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,080
Sister Lan, don't be so modest.

86
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,440
Your zither skills are the finest in the imperial harem.

87
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,560
But this 'Phoenix Seeking His Mate'...

88
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,890
What if I wish to hear it?

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,640
Yes.

90
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,090
I obey Your Majesty's command.

91
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,360
Someone has deliberately placed a thorn

92
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,690
where my fingers would touch the strings.

93
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,720
Mother,

94
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,320
I heard Lan'er playing the zither

95
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
and was suddenly inspired

96
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,720
to perform a sword dance.

97
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,440
Please don't blame me.

98
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,000
Your Majesty,

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
I changed the music at the last moment.

100
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,120
Please forgive me.

101
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,400
Why did you change from 'The Phoenix Seeks His Mate'

102
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,130
to 'The Battle Breaking Song'?

103
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,480
Your Majesty,

104
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
I've heard that

105
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,080
when the late Emperor led his troops to battle,

106
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,840
you accompanied him to boost morale.

107
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,480
You were truly a role model for all consorts.

108
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,720
As a woman,

109
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,640
I believe we shouldn't

110
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,800
indulge in frivolous love songs,

111
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,330
but rather contribute to inspiring courage.

112
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,800
Very good!

113
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,159
You, Lady Lan,

114
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,800
are quite extraordinary.

115
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,600
I am very pleased.

116
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,200
Guards!

117
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,960
Announce my decree.

118
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,920
Lady Lan, the Imperial Concubine,

119
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,200
possesses the ambition to reach for the stars,

120
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,660
is hereby promoted to Imperial Consort Lan.

121
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,440
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

122
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,960
I have already summoned the imperial physician.

123
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,160
Your Majesty, it's just a minor injury.

124
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,680
The fingers are connected to the heart.

125
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,210
How can you call this minor?

126
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,700
Does it still hurt?

127
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,080
Prince Huai has arrived.

128
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,520
When I was visiting the Empress Dowager,

129
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,600
she noticed the Imperial Consort's injured hand

130
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,000
and specially sent me to bring

131
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,330
some excellent healing ointment for her.

132
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,060
Quite a few people are concerned about your injury.

133
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,560
Give it to Eunuch Zhao.

134
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
On behalf of myself and Consort Lan,

135
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,370
thank the Empress Dowager.

136
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,160
Your Majesty,

137
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,280
this is improper.

138
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,010
I am the standard of propriety.

139
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,560
I will confiscate all of Ajing's flutes sooner or later.
