1
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,720
Sister Ruya.

2
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,800
I never betrayed you.

3
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,320
I know. I know.

4
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,760
I was wrong.

5
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,280
It was my fault.

6
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,000
Hold on.

7
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,120
Stay with me.

8
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Don't give up.

9
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,960
I will save you.

10
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
When you recover,

11
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,200
we'll drink and celebrate together, okay?

12
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,640
Yes.

13
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,120
I love your wine the most.

14
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,680
Promise me.

15
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,400
Be happy.

16
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Moyan.

17
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,360
Don't die.

18
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,440
Moyan.

19
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,560
Your wine is truly exceptional.

20
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,640
It's my honor to taste it.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,720
They say drinking under the moonlight

22
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,079
grants your wishes.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,160
What do you wish for?

24
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,920
I only wish to grow old together.

25
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,850
To have one person's heart.

26
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,920
I will protect you.

27
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,040
And fulfill your dreams.

28
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,800
As long as you're well, I'm happy.

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Do you know how much I've suffered?

30
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,000
So you want to destroy me?

31
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,120
Sister.

32
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,560
If you're determined to seek revenge,

33
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,680
I will help you.

34
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,880
Even if it costs me my life.

35
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,600
Moyan, I've always seen you as my brother.

36
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,040
My closest person.

37
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,500
I don't want to see you sad.

38
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,560
The Nangong clan is destroyed.

39
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,360
The Great Zhao Dynasty is in turmoil.

40
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,800
Neighboring countries are taking advantage of the chaos to invade.

41
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,200
The border is under urgent threat.

42
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,120
Prince Huai, grateful for his royal brother's lifelong protection,

43
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,800
volunteers to lead the army,

44
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
marching to the frontlines with his troops,

45
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,880
determined to turn the tide.

46
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
Defending the homeland.

47
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,460
Your Highness,

48
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,080
I wish you victory in battle.

49
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,490
Return triumphant.

50
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,960
I will.

51
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,520
Are the supplies ready?

52
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,000
Your Majesty, all supplies are prepared.

53
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,010
What I said in the Cold Palace was sincere.

54
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,840
I know.

55
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,420
But I carry my family's vendetta,

56
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,360
and I don't want to drag you into it.

57
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,040
Ruya,

58
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,520
you don't want to involve me,

59
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,360
yet you're willing to open your heart and conspire with my brother.

60
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,600
Don't you understand

61
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,880
the difference?

62
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
My brother is a man

63
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,920
with meticulous thoughts.

64
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,780
Return safely.

65
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,080
He always handles state affairs with patience and careful planning.

66
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
Kill more enemies for me.

67
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

68
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,520
The Nangong family has officials throughout the court.

69
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,600
He could have replaced them gradually.

70
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,330
But for your sake, he's willing

71
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,200
to cut off his military and political support with his own hands.

72
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,659
He cleared your name as quickly as possible.

73
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,400
You should know why he did this.

74
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,440
I was such a fool,

75
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,570
pushing you toward him step by step with my own hands.

76
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,080
Ruya,

77
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,460
if there is a next life,

78
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,320
I hope I meet you one day before my brother does.

79
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,360
Ajing.

80
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,200
Success.

81
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,360
Let's go.

82
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,080
Yes.
