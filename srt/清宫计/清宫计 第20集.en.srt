1
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,920
I didn't destroy you.

2
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,440
I'm saving you.

3
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,760
Don't you dislike the Emperor?

4
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,090
The Empress promised me

5
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,920
that if I help her son become Crown Prince,

6
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,080
she'll let us go.

7
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,479
Sister! Sister!

8
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,440
Let's go back to our life before entering the palace.

9
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,160
So happy,

10
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
carefree,

11
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,890
drinking and chatting.

12
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,840
Shall we?

13
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,479
Let go of me!

14
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,800
Stay away!

15
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,680
Sister!

16
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,759
Sister!

17
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,500
Don't come closer!

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,520
I have endured the Consort for half a month.

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,680
Today I've finally vented my anger.

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,360
In this world, besides me,

21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,690
who deserves to stand beside His Majesty?

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,840
Besides the royal children with my bloodline,

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,680
who else deserves His Majesty's attention?

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
Your Highness is so strategic,

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,920
truly a female Zhuge Liang.

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,960
Even Imperial Physician Qin has been won over by you.

27
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,280
Look,

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,079
the kingfisher feather gold hairpin he presented

29
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:38,840
makes Your Highness look even more beautiful.

30
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,280
After today's blow to the Consort,

31
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,200
His Majesty will soon remove that wretched woman

32
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,000
from his heart completely.

33
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,800
When that day comes,

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,640
it will be time for me to eliminate all my enemies.

35
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,320
His Majesty the Emperor arrives!

36
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,580
Greetings, Your Majesty.

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,120
Your Majesty.

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
What's wrong?

39
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,920
All the concubines treat me as

40
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,560
a tool for gaining favor and eliminating rivals.

41
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
They're all deceiving me, using me.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,600
Your Majesty.

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,320
You still have me.

44
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,000
Those concubines from official and merchant families

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,840
are filled with vulgar and shallow ideas to their core.

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,500
They don't deserve your love.

47
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,480
But I

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,320
will use my innate wisdom and virtue

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,160
to always stay by your side, assist you,

50
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,040
and stand beside you overlooking the world.

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,760
Empress,

52
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:47,880
I was wrong.

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,079
I will never again waste

54
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,810
a single glance on those women.

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,160
Only you

56
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,740
deserve my sincere devotion.

57
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,760
Your Majesty,

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Prince Huai has entered the palace.

59
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,520
Have him wait in the imperial study.

60
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,880
Yes, sire.

61
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,240
I'll be back shortly.

62
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,600
I need to speed up my actions.

63
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,320
Since I was banished to the Cold Palace,

64
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,650
I haven't seen any food.

65
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,640
No matter what,

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,200
I must survive.

67
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,400
Survive.

68
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,600
Only then can I clear my father's name.

69
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,040
You're the villain he sent to kill me.

70
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,280
I'll kill you.

71
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,880
I'll kill you.

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,159
It's time.

73
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,920
Who are you?

74
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,180
I'm the one who's here to kill you.

75
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
You work for the Empress.

76
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,250
Since you already know,

77
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,120
you all must die.

78
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,800
Good thing I arrived in time.

79
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,460
Otherwise you'd be in danger.

80
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,400
Thank you.

81
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,320
I heard Your Highness was inspecting the river embankment recently.

82
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,720
Why did you suddenly return to the capital?

83
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,440
I heard you were banished to the Cold Palace.

84
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:38,880
I...

85
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,360
You came back specifically to plead for me.

86
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,720
What did His Majesty say?

87
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,840
Will I ever leave the Cold Palace alive?

88
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,540
Royal Brother.

89
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,600
Prince Huai.

90
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,960
You cannot go in there.

91
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,920
His Majesty has confined Concubine Lan to the Cold Palace.

92
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,360
The affairs of my harem

93
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,240
you seem to hear about quite promptly.

94
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,800
What exactly did Concubine Lan do

95
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
to make you so angry, Royal Brother?

96
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,480
Fine.

97
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,040
No matter what she did wrong,

98
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,640
someone who has been suffering

99
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,360
since she entered the palace,

100
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,440
even if her methods were somewhat extreme,

101
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,900
she can still be forgiven.

102
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,000
She trampled on my sincere feelings.

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,280
Her crime is unforgivable.

104
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,760
So Your Majesty intends to keep her locked in the cold palace

105
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,800
until she dies?

106
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,600
If that's the case,

107
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,040
let me take her away.

108
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,640
Xiao Jing.

109
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,280
If you don't want her,

110
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,840
I do.

111
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,159
From now on,

112
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,250
I will do everything in my power to protect her

113
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,780
and ensure she never suffers any harm again.

114
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,480
You dare covet my woman?

115
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,440
Perhaps you want to take my throne as well?

116
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,800
His Majesty must be furious this time.

117
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,130
He won't show any mercy.

118
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,850
Never mind all that.

119
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,960
Come with me.

120
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,919
I won't go with you.

121
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,130
I have more important things to do.

122
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,640
Even if I die,

123
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,010
I want to die in this palace.

124
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,880
If you die,

125
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
what meaning would my life have?

126
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,880
These words,

127
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,770
I had planned to keep them in my heart forever.

128
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,450
But since I've already spoken,

129
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,900
I'll tell you everything.

130
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,600
Lan'er.

131
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,200
In my heart,

132
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,720
I've long reserved a place for you.

133
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,440
I've been deeply infatuated with you

134
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,240
and have admired you for so long.

135
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,760
I can give up my future and titles.

136
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,840
I only wish to protect you, care for you,

137
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
and make you happy for the rest of your life.

138
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,780
Your Highness.

139
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,980
I am already His Majesty's woman.

140
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,440
Besides, my intentions are questionable.

141
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,880
I...

142
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,120
I don't care.

143
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,760
Your status,

144
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,840
your scars,

145
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,320
your past,

146
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,610
I don't care about any of it.

147
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,000
Lan'er,

148
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,520
I beg you,

149
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,600
come with me.

150
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,720
Will you?
