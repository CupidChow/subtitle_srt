1
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
However,

2
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,690
since you don't seek the Emperor's favor,

3
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,840
what do you want?

4
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,840
All I ask for

5
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,520
is to live in peace.

6
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,640
Since you've given me a gift,

7
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,880
I

8
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,340
will also give you my most cherished person.

9
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,680
Xiangian,

10
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,520
from today on,

11
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,880
Lady Lan will be your mistress.

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,280
Yes.

13
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,259
Thank you, Consort Yushu.

14
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,020
Your Highness,

15
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,280
this Lady Lan is currently in the Emperor's favor.

16
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,960
Can we really trust her?

17
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,720
Let's test her.

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,720
We have nothing to lose.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,080
Besides, what the palace has no shortage of

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,360
is jealous people.

21
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,360
Spread the news that newly arrived Lady Lan

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,520
has allied herself with me.

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,560
Guess what?

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,690
Will Consort Chun let her live to see the new year?

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,320
You have a fever.

26
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,440
Why are you still accompanying me for a walk in the Imperial Garden?

27
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,920
You should go back immediately.

28
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,579
It's nothing, Your Highness.

29
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,320
Go back.

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,740
Greetings, Consort Chun.

31
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,090
How dare you!

32
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,650
You dare to bump into me?

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,690
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

34
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,680
Who do you think you are?

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,480
Your Highness,

36
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,440
this is the newly arrived Lady Lan.

37
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,320
So it's you.

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
I thought as much.

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,680
Like servant, like master.

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,079
Since you can't discipline your servants,

41
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,840
I'll do it for you.

42
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,450
How dare you stop me?

43
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,700
Your Highness.

44
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,680
Xianglian is my maid,

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,040
not under your authority.

46
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,280
I'm going to see His Majesty now.

47
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,760
Perhaps you should come with me,

48
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,160
and let His Majesty decide.

49
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,020
What do you say?

50
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,320
How dare you use His Majesty to pressure me!

51
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,240
Your Highness,

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,520
this is the Imperial Garden,

53
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,720
there are many people around.

54
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,800
His Majesty dislikes quarrels among concubines.

55
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,130
We shouldn't stay long.

56
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,400
Fine.

57
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,600
Lady Lan,

58
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,520
you just wait.

59
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,600
Let's see how long your arrogance lasts.

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Are you all right?

61
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,120
Thank you for saving my life, Your Highness.

62
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,920
But...

63
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,400
Aren't you afraid

64
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,720
that I might be a spy sent by Consort Yu Shu?

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,960
So what if you are?

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,640
And so what if you're not?

67
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,360
Now that you're one of mine,

68
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,760
I will treat you well.

69
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,720
Your Highness...

70
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,240
I entered the palace when I was 8 years old.

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,280
Within these palace walls,

72
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,540
few have ever treated me as a human being.

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,560
No one has ever been so kind to me.

74
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,040
From now on,

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,960
I will

76
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,360
follow your every command without question.

77
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,020
If you're willing to trust me.

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,760
Good.

79
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,680
Where is that flute music coming from?

80
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
You don't know, Your Highness?

81
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,280
Prince Huai is skilled in music.

82
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,340
He often comes here to play his flute.

83
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,360
Many palace maids secretly come here to listen.

84
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,160
Prince Huai.

85
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,840
It's all too easy.

86
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,440
I've finally caught you.

87
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,360
Who was playing the zither here just now?

88
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,400
Your Highness,

89
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
it was Lady Lan who just entered the palace.

90
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,920
So it's her.

91
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,800
Brother.

92
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,360
I've investigated the outskirts of the capital.

93
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,290
There is indeed a Miss Yulan there,

94
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,580
and her entry date to the palace matches.

95
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,600
But I feel there's something suspicious about this.

96
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,730
I seek your judgment on the matter.

97
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,340
A common merchant's daughter

98
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,050
with such refined manners,

99
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,159
who resembles her so closely,

100
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,490
and happened to save me.

101
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,800
So many coincidences.

102
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,360
If this isn't someone's scheme,

103
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,820
then it must truly be fate.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,960
Since she has become my Lady Lan,

105
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,680
I shall investigate this matter myself.

106
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,300
What secrets does this Miss Yulan

107
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,320
actually have?

108
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,520
Your Majesty,

109
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,480
you must stand up for me!

110
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,720
This Lady Lan just entered the palace

111
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,320
yet she dares to talk back to me,

112
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,240
and I can't even discipline a palace maid.

113
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
From now on,

114
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,770
won't the palace be thrown into chaos?

115
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,600
Speak no more before Buddha.

116
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,160
Silence.

117
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,780
It's not your first day in the palace.

118
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,040
Newcomers always have some temper.

119
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,240
Your Majesty,

120
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,440
but this Concubine Lan is of humble birth

121
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,200
yet she dares to be so presumptuous.

122
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,120
Now

123
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,000
she has even won His Majesty's favor.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,040
His Majesty rarely visits the harem as it is,

125
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,800
and now his favor cannot be shared equally.

126
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,370
Whom His Majesty favors

127
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,250
is not for you to comment on.

128
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,160
Your Majesty,

129
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,440
I know

130
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,520
you are the mother of the nation

131
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,780
with a generous heart.

132
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,200
But this Concubine Lan

133
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,330
has now allied with that vixen Ji Jiya.

134
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,040
With these two together,

135
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,840
I fear all royal heirs will be from their families.

136
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,720
The matter of heirs concerns the welfare of the nation.

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,440
As Empress,

138
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,800
I naturally hope that the concubines

139
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,360
can bear many children for the royal family.

140
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,000
But I wonder what kind of branches

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,860
and leaves they'll be sprouting.

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,400
I fear there may be scandalous affairs in the palace.

143
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,159
Silence!

144
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,900
Don't speak nonsense.

145
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,120
Your Majesty,

146
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,840
there's something you don't know.

147
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,400
There are rumors in the palace.

148
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,039
Concubine Lan and Prince Huai

149
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,560
were playing music together in the Imperial Garden,

150
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,020
appearing very intimate.

151
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,800
This is true,

152
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,080
absolutely certain.

153
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,520
Then we must be vigilant.

154
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,120
Rest assured, Your Majesty,

155
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,120
I will unmask her pretense.

156
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,320
This way, His Majesty

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,040
will no longer favor her.

158
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,960
I will handle this matter.

159
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,620
Concubine Lan,

160
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,100
His Majesty invites you to view lanterns at Guibao Palace.

161
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,240
At this hour?

162
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,120
I understand.

163
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,520
Xianglian,

164
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,720
help me change my clothes.

165
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,560
Yes.

166
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,000
This person...
