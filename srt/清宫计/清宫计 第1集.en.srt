1
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,160
By the grace of Heaven

2
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,920
the Emperor decrees:

3
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,080
Ji Yanlun, Censor of the Supervisory Bureau,

4
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,880
is guilty of corruption

5
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,440
and embezzlement.

6
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,120
His property shall be confiscated

7
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,400
and he shall be exiled 3,000 li away.

8
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,039
By imperial order.

9
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,720
Sigh.

10
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,259
You've been honest all your life.

11
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,000
Someone must have falsely accused you.

12
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,490
I'll go to the palace to find my sister.

13
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,039
To seek justice for you.

14
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,770
Be careful what you say.

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,280
The capital is full of intrigue.

16
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,039
Your sister can barely protect herself in the palace.

17
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,520
You have a kind nature.

18
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,720
You must not act rashly.

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,360
You cannot.

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,280
Lord Ji.

21
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,320
Lord Ji.

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,960
You are an upright official.

23
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,220
You have been wronged.

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,040
Orders from above.

25
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,680
Exterminate Ji Yanlun's entire family.

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,240
Father!

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,880
Look out!

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,650
Who's there?

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,400
Father!

30
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,400
Ruya, run!

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,200
No!

32
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,840
Father!

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,480
Run now!

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,040
No!

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,680
Run!

36
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,120
Run quickly!

37
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,360
Don't let her escape!

38
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,960
After her!

39
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,560
No!

40
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,370
Sister Ruya.

41
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,900
You're finally awake.

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,370
How are you feeling?

43
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,360
Why am I here?

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,560
The Empress Dowager fell ill.

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,640
I was summoned to the palace to attend to her for a month.

46
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,040
When I suddenly heard about what happened to your family,

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,600
I was beside myself with worry.

48
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,360
I had hoped to find an opportunity

49
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,000
to speak to His Majesty on your father's behalf.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
But unexpectedly,

51
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,680
the Emperor suddenly issued an edict.

52
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,920
Fortunately, I had sent servants ahead

53
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,380
to keep watch at your door.

54
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,880
They happened to see you being hunted down.

55
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,720
In the chaos, they managed to rescue you.

56
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,280
I'm sorry, sister.

57
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,560
Although we saved you,

58
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,000
we

59
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,210
couldn't save your father.

60
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,050
My entire Ji family was massacred.

61
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,040
This blood debt

62
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,000
I must avenge.

63
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,240
Father.

64
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,800
You lived your life with integrity,

65
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,040
serving the court with complete devotion.

66
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,560
Despite the Emperor's wrath,

67
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,960
you upheld your duty as an imperial censor.

68
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,200
But

69
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,540
why do good people not receive good fortune?

70
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,490
No matter who wants to harm you,

71
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,880
I

72
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,800
will definitely avenge you.

73
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,040
For the entire Ji family,

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,720
I will seek justice.

75
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,400
Sister,

76
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,760
if you're determined to seek revenge,

77
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,220
I will certainly help you,

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,040
even if I'm

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,240
shattered to pieces.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,680
Brother,

81
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,880
nice shot.

82
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,040
Thank you for your courtesy, Your Majesty.

83
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,860
Be careful, Your Majesty.

84
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,240
Protect the Emperor!

85
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,040
Yes.

86
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,159
Your Majesty.

87
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,380
After them!

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,800
Summon the royal physician!

89
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,440
Yes.

90
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,280
It seems the palace

91
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,880
will have a new arrival soon.

92
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,240
The Empress is quite generous.

93
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,840
I come from a military family

94
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,370
and despise these tactics for gaining favor.

95
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,850
If I can't stand the ones already here,

96
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,240
imagine how I feel about the newcomer.

97
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,840
What?

98
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
Is a military family somehow noble?

99
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,409
Those without favor are the truly lowly ones.

100
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,400
I think

101
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,290
things are about to change in this palace.

102
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,170
This face appearing at the hunting ground

103
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,660
is it merely a coincidence

104
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,300
or is there a grand conspiracy behind it?

105
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,840
Your Majesty.

106
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,880
I've arranged for the Imperial Guards to search the palace,

107
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,080
but this person is agile and wearing palace attire.

108
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,880
It will take considerable effort to find them.

109
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,680
To attempt assassination in the heavily guarded palace

110
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,210
this is no ordinary person.

111
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,040
I will investigate thoroughly.

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
How are the palace maid's injuries?

113
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,850
Your Majesty

114
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,400
is out of danger

115
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,250
but the arrow was poisoned.

116
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,560
I will give her the antidote later,

117
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,720
but for a full recovery,

118
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,450
she needs to rest for many days.

119
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,360
How can she look so much like her?

120
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,200
Where am I?

121
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,160
So it's true.

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,120
I look just like her.
