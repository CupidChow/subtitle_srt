1
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,400
Where am I?

2
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,320
Indeed,

3
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,289
I look just like her.

4
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,840
Dr. Qin,

5
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,720
please save me.

6
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,160
I can see your complexion is poor.

7
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
I'm afraid you have a serious illness.

8
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,920
Yes,

9
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,880
Dr. Qin,

10
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't want to die.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,160
Please save me.

12
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,720
The Imperial Medical Bureau

13
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,120
technically shouldn't allow this.

14
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,039
No, no,

15
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,880
Dr. Qin,

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,160
I've served in the palace since childhood.

17
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,600
Whatever gold or jewels you want

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,660
to cure my illness,

19
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,920
I can get them for you.

20
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,920
Well then,

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,130
I don't want any treasures.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,960
I only need one piece of information.

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,240
In His Majesty's heart,

24
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,960
there has always been someone he cherishes.

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,320
In his youth,

26
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,560
he often sketched portraits of this woman.

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,960
The person in the painting

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,290
already resembles you.

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,760
This way,

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,320
the resemblance is now ninety percent.

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,570
No wonder my dear sister gained the Emperor's favor.

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,640
Though we share only a father,

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,760
she still has seventy percent of that resemblance.

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,720
However,

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,560
this will soon become my weapon.

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,400
You're awake.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Your Majesty.

38
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,920
Don't move.

39
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Mind your wound.

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,800
Can you tell me

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,640
who you are

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,250
and why you risked your life to save me?

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,079
My name is Yulan.

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,000
I only wanted

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,700
to catch a glimpse of Your Majesty at the archery field.

46
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,640
But unexpectedly,

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,160
I discovered someone planning to assassinate you.

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,000
So I

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,960
disturbed Your Majesty.

50
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,240
Please forgive me.

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,720
Your eyes

52
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,280
remind me of someone I once knew.

53
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,440
That is my honor.

54
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,640
You are virtuous and beautiful,

55
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,840
and you saved my life.

56
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,400
I will make an exception and grant you the title of Beauty.

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Would you accept?

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,720
I...

59
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,400
I must decline.

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,480
I wouldn't dare.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,460
Although I am merely a merchant's daughter,

62
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,520
I have been influenced since childhood

63
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,240
by my parents' loving relationship.

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,100
I long for a lifelong marriage with just one person.

65
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
But Your Majesty,

66
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,020
you are the supreme ruler,

67
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,760
the Son of Heaven.

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,200
How could you

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,690
belong to someone as lowly as me alone?

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,440
For someone as humble as I am,

71
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,920
being able to glimpse at Your Majesty from afar

72
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
is more than enough.

73
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,800
What is there to fear?

74
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,560
Yulan.

75
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,240
Lan.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,560
I will bestow upon you the title of Beauty

77
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,420
and will protect you completely.

78
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,480
But if I am simply given the title of Beauty,

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,200
it might cause discontent among others

80
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,400
and disturb the peace in the harem.

81
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,160
From now on, you'll be by my side.

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,920
You don't need to be strong anymore.

83
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
As for your title,

84
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,760
after you've recovered from your injuries,

85
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,820
I will bestow it with great ceremony.

86
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,960
When that time comes,

87
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,920
you must not refuse again.

88
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,000
Your Majesty,

89
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,600
Lady Yulan is severely injured.

90
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,360
At this moment,

91
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,960
I'm afraid she can hardly process such joyful news.

92
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,840
Perhaps we should let her recover first,

93
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,800
then receive your royal favor.

94
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,400
Very well.

95
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,240
Take good care of her.

96
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,780
I will come back later.

97
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,159
Farewell, Your Majesty.

98
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,560
Farewell, Your Majesty.

99
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,640
It's just entering the palace.

100
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,500
Why suffer such a serious injury?

101
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,240
Do you know there was poison on that arrow?

102
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,720
Compared to the lives of over a hundred people in my Ji family,

103
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,650
this little injury means nothing.

104
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,480
By the way,

105
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,640
what happened to the assassin?

106
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,370
Don't worry.

107
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
My ancestors were Imperial Guards.

108
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,280
I've already taken care of everything.

109
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,360
He's not seriously hurt.

110
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,160
You don't need to worry about it.

111
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,050
Thank you for planning this for me.

112
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
You've disguised me.

113
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,680
I'm no longer Ji Ruya, daughter of the Minister of Ceremonies,

114
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,740
but Yulan instead.

115
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Is it worth it?

116
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,920
This palace entry

117
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,040
was meant to gain the Emperor's favor

118
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
and investigate the case inside the palace.

119
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,640
But unexpectedly, by chance,

120
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,600
I saw the jade dragon pendant on Prince Huai.

121
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,520
Indeed, my father's matter

122
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,720
is connected to someone in this palace.

123
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,720
I fear

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,940
that Prince Huai is the one who killed my father.

125
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,180
This vengeance

126
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
must be settled by my own hands.

127
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,320
What about

128
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,560
the Emperor?

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,720
Things obtained too easily

130
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,720
are never treasured by men.

131
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,600
Young man,

132
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,160
could you please return my kite?

133
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,960
Of course.

134
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you.

135
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,280
I haven't asked which family you're from yet.

136
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
Your Majesty is reminiscing again.

137
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,640
I wonder

138
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,440
who this lady really is

139
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,770
that she could touch the Emperor's heart.

140
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,040
Even as Emperor,

141
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,100
I find it hard to defy fate.

142
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,840
What do you think of Yulan?

143
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,400
Brother,

144
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,680
Lady Yulan's identity is questionable.

145
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
About bringing her into the palace,

146
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,170
please reconsider carefully.

147
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,800
But as you just said,

148
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,280
I am the Emperor now.

149
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,720
What I once lost,

150
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,040
I will never let go again.

151
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,610
Brother,

152
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,560
you are the person I trust most.

153
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,680
The task of investigating Yulan's identity

154
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,480
I leave to you.

155
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,050
Brother.

156
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,920
Don't disappoint me.

157
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,960
That woman resembles her so much.

158
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,480
Is it

159
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,450
really just a coincidence?

160
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,840
Please calm down, Your Highness.

161
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,360
A country girl

162
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,570
dares to compete with me for favor?

163
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,940
Your Highness.

164
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,280
These

165
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,340
are precious gifts from His Majesty,

166
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,920
one of a kind in the world.

167
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,720
Getting upset over someone so lowly

168
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,050
would be such a waste, wouldn't it?

169
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,730
These are just material possessions.

170
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,720
Nothing special about them.

171
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,240
If I wish,

172
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,210
His Majesty will send more.

173
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,400
I will not allow anyone

174
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,159
to steal this honor from me.

175
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,440
But Your Highness, your father

176
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,640
has been sentenced to exile.

177
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,919
Fortunately, someone attempted assassination,

178
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,159
and he died.

179
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,320
His Majesty might be pleased about that.

180
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,040
I think we should still be very careful.

181
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,760
Please calm down, Your Highness.

182
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,240
I deserve to die for my offense.

183
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,560
I shouldn't have mentioned your painful memories.

184
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,020
Shut up!

185
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,960
How dare you meddle in my family affairs?

186
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,360
Lady Li.

187
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,800
You've always been clever and eloquent.

188
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,560
Why are you suddenly

189
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,400
so careless with your words today?

190
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,960
You'd better be careful.

191
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,820
Misfortune comes from the mouth.

192
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,400
Please calm down, Your Highness.

193
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,440
How dare I?

194
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,440
I wish to make amends.

195
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,680
I

196
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,120
am willing to eliminate what troubles Your Highness.

197
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,380
Since she wants to transform from a sparrow into a phoenix,

198
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,600
let her experience

199
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,520
the price of such ambition.
