1
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,560
Qing'er.

2
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,920
Have you forgotten what I told you?

3
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,800
How could you associate with Lady Lan?

4
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,320
Cousin.

5
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,880
I remember everything you told me.

6
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,039
But life in the palace is so boring.

7
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,160
And I think Lady Lan is a good person.

8
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,360
I think she has bewitched you.

9
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,200
Cousin.

10
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,880
Enough.

11
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,720
I'm tired.

12
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
You may leave now.

13
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,960
Empress.

14
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,000
Please don't be angry.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,729
Concubine Qing is still young.

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,130
She's not up to the task.

17
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,200
Empress.

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,720
Concubine Li has pledged her loyalty to us many times.

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,640
Why not

20
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,560
use her?

21
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,520
Ruya.

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,340
Concubine Lan.

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,240
You should address me as Imperial Sister-in-law.

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,120
These days

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,560
you've been deliberately avoiding me.

26
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,740
Your Highness,

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,140
our positions are different.

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,360
Does it have to be this way?

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,720
Otherwise, what does Your Highness think

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,050
we have left to discuss?

31
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,410
What if I tell you

32
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,240
that I came to see you this time

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,280
because there are new leads

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,880
regarding Master Ji's case?

35
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,480
Trust me.

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,610
Come with me.

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,320
Lady Lan,

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,280
I didn't expect to catch you

39
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,079
in the act so quickly.

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,520
Giddyup!

41
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,920
I never thought my father's former subordinate

42
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,960
would actually have kept my father's belongings.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,520
Lord Ji left a letter

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,020
with his subordinate in the suburbs.

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,620
When he learned

46
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,320
that Lord Ji still had a daughter in this world,

47
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,160
he insisted on meeting you

48
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,760
before he would hand over the letter.

49
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,720
So I had to bring you out of the palace

50
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,640
to find him in person.

51
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,720
But leaving the palace like this

52
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,050
violates palace rules.

53
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,880
I'm escorting you out as a dancer from the Imperial Music Bureau.

54
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,810
Once we're done,

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
I'll take you back immediately.

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,600
Lady Ji.

58
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,280
There's no need for thanks between us.

59
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,760
Your father was a man of integrity.

60
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,820
If not for these unfortunate events,

61
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,079
perhaps we would have met under different circumstances.

62
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,880
But now everything has changed.

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,280
Stop the carriage!

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,240
Whoa!

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,060
What are you doing?

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,850
Get down!

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,520
We're under orders to search.

68
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,320
Who dares

69
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,520
to stop my carriage?

70
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,650
Prince Huai,

71
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,920
there's been a theft in the palace.

72
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,380
Everyone coming and going must be searched.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,800
I'll go check.

74
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,200
Your Highness, excuse our rudeness.

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,959
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

76
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,320
We're only following orders.

77
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,519
Who gave you the nerve

78
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,160
to question my people?

79
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:23,960
You.

80
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,640
This dancer looks unfamiliar.

81
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,810
Your Highness, please ask this girl to step down.

82
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,130
Why did you bring me here

83
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,440
in the middle of the night?

84
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,240
Your Majesty,

85
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,120
I'm too embarrassed to say.

86
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,840
Please see for yourself.

87
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,159
Seventh Brother,

88
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
why are you here?

89
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Your Majesty.

90
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,580
Royal Brother.

91
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,720
Lady Lan, why are you here?

92
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:04,960
My dear,

93
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,720
His Majesty favors you greatly,

94
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,920
yet you sneak out of the palace at night.

95
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,840
Are you planning to elope with Prince Huai?

96
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,800
That's not true.

97
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,480
Then why are you here at night,

98
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,240
dressed like this?

99
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,440
Can't explain yourself?

100
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,240
Your Majesty,

101
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,640
please don't be angry.

102
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,360
I'm sure Lady Lan didn't mean any harm.

103
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,000
Perhaps she and the Prince

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,360
have some urgent matter to discuss.

105
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,920
You're in a hurry to leave?

106
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,640
Silence!

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,320
My affairs with Lan

108
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,180
are none of your business.

109
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,320
Guards!

110
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,360
Escort Lady Li back to her palace and confine her there.

111
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

112
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,040
Your Majesty.

113
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,770
Prince Huai.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,320
We grew up together in the palace,

115
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,330
and I've granted you free access to the court.

116
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,440
But Lan is now my consort,

117
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,130
and other men should keep their distance.

118
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,040
Don't you agree?

119
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,160
Brother.

120
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,720
This matter has nothing to do with Consort Lan.

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,360
I needed her assistance with something.

122
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

123
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,880
I will explain everything to you later.

124
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,920
But I truly have an urgent matter now.

125
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,500
May I leave the palace?

126
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,420
In your dreams.

127
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,320
My affairs with Lan are not for you to meddle in.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,560
Yes,

129
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,600
it's not for you to interfere.

130
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,860
You should go back now.

131
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,890
Leave immediately.

132
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,940
This doesn't concern you.

133
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,560
Then I shall take my leave.

134
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,880
The matter you entrusted me with,

135
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,540
I will certainly complete it.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,800
What's wrong?

137
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,280
Are you too distant from me now?

138
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,050
Don't you have anything to tell me?

139
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,920
I have nothing to say.

140
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,440
You and Prince Huai were in the same carriage late at night.

141
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,840
Isn't that eloping?

142
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,159
I trusted you wholeheartedly.

143
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,020
I defended you in front of others.

144
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,650
But you need to give me an explanation.

145
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,600
If I tell Xiao Heng the truth now,

146
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,800
I'm afraid the time isn't right yet.

147
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,920
But if I don't tell him,

148
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,920
I might not make it through tonight.

149
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,040
You wanted to meet my brother outside the palace in private.

150
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,440
Is it so hard to give me an explanation?

151
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,000
Speak.

152
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,640
I have a matter of life and death

153
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,130
that requires Prince Huai's help.

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What matter?

155
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,860
I don't think Your Majesty wants to know.

156
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,680
You still don't want to open up to me?

157
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,210
I am the Emperor.

158
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,560
What do you want?

159
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,280
What I can give you

160
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,940
is far beyond what Prince Huai could ever offer.

161
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,920
What secrets do you have that you can tell Xiao Jing

162
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,120
and ask him to handle,

163
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,159
yet refuse to mention to me?

164
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,120
What exactly do you want me to do?

165
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,820
I've been patient for a long time.

166
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,600
But I always feel

167
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,400
that everything I do means nothing to you.

168
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,100
If that's the case,

169
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
I might as well just take you by force.

170
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,000
Let me go! Let me go!

171
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,440
Under your pillow...

172
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,770
You've been hiding a dagger all this time.

173
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Are you that unwilling to be with me?

174
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,000
Do you hate me that much?

175
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,640
No.

176
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,460
It's not like that.

177
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,740
It's not like that, Xiao Heng.

178
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,120
I...

179
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,290
It's not what you think.

180
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,640
I want to believe you.

181
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,880
To believe you still have genuine feelings for me.

182
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,560
But I hope we can be honest with each other

183
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,610
and leave no more barriers between us.

184
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,640
All right.

185
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,680
I'll tell you.

186
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,300
Since you want to know,

187
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,340
I'll tell you everything.

188
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:00,960
Xiao
