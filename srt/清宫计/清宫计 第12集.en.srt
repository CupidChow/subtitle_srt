1
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,760
You dared to reveal the Ji family's affairs to others.

2
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,560
What?

3
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,600
I did not.

4
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,080
This has nothing to do with me.

5
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,320
Then do you know

6
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,080
Prince Huai has been inquiring about your family's old case everywhere recently,

7
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,200
and he possesses the Ji family's jade pendant.

8
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,259
You still claim you're not involved?

9
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,800
You know

10
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,280
our master despises those who bite the hand that feeds them.

11
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
I've always been grateful for the kindness shown to me.

12
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,920
I would never commit such betrayal.

13
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,440
You'd better be.

14
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,890
Though a cocoon may seem plain,

15
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,479
when it transforms into a butterfly,

16
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,080
it becomes dreamlike and magical.

17
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,080
If one only lingers on the fleeting beauty of flowers,

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,400
one will miss the spectacular sight of colorful butterflies in flight.

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,000
Have I seen you before?

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,720
Could it really be her?

21
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,040
Who?

22
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,320
You.

23
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,579
How did you get in here?

24
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,200
Why wasn't I notified?

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,360
Does a sister need to be announced

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,020
when visiting her own sister?

27
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,640
It really is you.

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,160
You owe me.

29
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,360
Give it back to me.

30
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,600
Guards!

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,040
Come quickly!

32
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,960
We meet again.

33
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,560
Sister.

34
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,420
Why did you really come to the palace?

35
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,760
What else do you want to take from me?

36
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,079
The Emperor's favor?

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,130
Or my position as Imperial Consort Yu Shu?

38
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,480
What more do you want?

39
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,579
Father died unnaturally.

40
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
What do you think?

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,800
I've already told you.

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,930
None of this has anything to do with me.

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,360
You were the one who was supposed to enter the palace.

44
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,000
You all ignored my wishes.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,240
And forced me into the palace.

46
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,960
Trapping me in this palace.

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,480
I hate him. I hate all of you.

48
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,520
I haven't had a father for a long time.

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
Ji Jiya.

50
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,400
You're still so stubborn.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,720
Isn't it true?

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,280
Everything has always been yours since childhood.

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,640
They made the decision to send me to the palace.

54
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,440
When did they ever care about me?

55
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,820
If they didn't care about your feelings,

56
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,210
then how did you escape your lowly status?

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,000
What nonsense are you talking?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,529
Ji Jiya, listen carefully.

59
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Your mother was born of low status.

60
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,420
Father spent a fortune to change her status.

61
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
Your mother wanted you to enter the palace.

62
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,160
They wanted to secure a good future for you.

63
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,960
But you misunderstood their good intentions.

64
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
You're lying!

65
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,760
My mother came from a respectable family.

66
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,840
How could she be of low status?

67
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,280
You're lying!

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,360
That's not true!

69
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,560
Indeed.

70
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,520
Of course you wouldn't know.

71
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,409
Because Father couldn't bear to let you know.

72
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,720
If it weren't for Father,

73
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
you would have been despised by everyone.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,880
Married off to some commoner to live out a miserable life.

75
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,160
He loved you so much.

76
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,520
He planned everything for you.

77
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,480
And you?

78
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,880
You stood by and did nothing when he was in trouble.

79
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,720
If you had pleaded with the Emperor,

80
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Father wouldn't have fallen so far.

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,460
And villains wouldn't have had the opportunity to strike.

82
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,320
I didn't know.

83
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,600
I didn't know it was like this.

84
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,320
I was just afraid.

85
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,960
I was afraid... I...

86
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,560
You were afraid that everything you had gained

87
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,090
would vanish into thin air.

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,880
Ji Jiya,

89
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,120
you are the truly selfish one.

90
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,880
Do you know what Father said

91
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,200
before he died?

92
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,130
Be careful what you say.

93
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,600
The capital is full of intrigue.

94
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,480
Your sister can barely protect herself in the palace.

95
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,740
You have a kind nature.

96
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,040
You must not act rashly.

97
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,200
Lady Li.

98
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,760
Why did you summon all the sisters to my palace?

99
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,960
What is this about?

100
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,760
Yes, indeed.

101
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,480
Don't gather us together for no reason.

102
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,840
Sister Li.

103
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,320
I see you're no longer in favor,

104
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,720
so you're trying to curry favor with the Empress.

105
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,760
Sister Pure Consort.

106
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,680
Don't be impatient.

107
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,010
The gift is coming soon.

108
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,920
Greetings to Your Majesty.

109
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,800
Who is this person?

110
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,840
In response to Your Majesty,

111
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,360
I am a cloth merchant from Dye Fragrance Street.

112
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,280
How dare you rashly bring a mere cloth merchant

113
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,200
into the palace?

114
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,060
He is no ordinary cloth merchant.

115
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,320
He is Orchid Consort's uncle.

116
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,580
Orchid Consort, do you acknowledge your guilt?

117
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,200
What crime have I committed?

118
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,680
Orchid Consort, do you recognize this man?

119
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,800
I do not.

120
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,240
Did you hear that?

121
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,900
She says she doesn't know him.

122
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,690
She doesn't even recognize her own uncle.

123
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,000
Yulan has no uncle.

124
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,840
How is that possible?

125
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,040
Your mother had a difficult labor when giving birth to you.

126
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,920
It was your aunt

127
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,000
who specially sought out the best midwife in the entire city

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,760
to save both you and your mother.

129
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,960
How dare you say you don't have an uncle?

130
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,240
Yes.

131
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,040
I heard from my mother

132
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,680
that you gambled and whored around,

133
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,080
borrowed a lot of money from her,

134
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,740
and almost,

135
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,040
almost ruined our family.

136
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
In the end, my grandfather had to step in

137
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,360
to cut ties with you.

138
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
When my family fell on hard times,

139
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,920
he was too proud

140
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,360
and turned his back on his own family.

141
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,800
Now you know I've entered the palace

142
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,680
and made it big,

143
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,160
so you come claiming to be my relative.

144
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,880
Fine.

145
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,800
Then pay back the 50 taels you owe my family.

146
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,530
I still have the loan agreement in my possession.

147
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,160
Lady Ji.

148
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,040
Without clarifying the matter,

149
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
you rashly brought someone into the palace.

150
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,120
Do you realize

151
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,480
this is the crime of framing a consort?

152
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,760
Your Majesty,

153
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,520
this

154
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,240
villain deliberately concealed information from me.

155
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,880
You all.

156
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,920
Your Majesty.

157
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,200
I have discovered something else

158
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,600
that is absolutely true.

159
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,320
When Yulan was born,

160
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
on her left forearm,

161
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,360
there was a magnolia-shaped birthmark.

162
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,159
Isn't that right?

163
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,419
It's absolutely true.

164
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,120
What?

165
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,500
You don't dare to show it to everyone.

166
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,080
You mean this, right?

167
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,720
This...

168
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,400
This...

169
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Lady Ji.

170
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,480
No matter how much you envy Lady Lan,

171
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,940
you shouldn't go this far.

172
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Impossible.

173
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,160
