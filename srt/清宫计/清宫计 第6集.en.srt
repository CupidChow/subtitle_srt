1
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,090
I never expected

2
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,640
that Lady Lan would have read 'The Jade Flute Collection'.

3
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,840
I came across it by chance.

4
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,240
Just skimmed through it.

5
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,480
'Wild birds also rejoice in spring,

6
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,690
At night the jade flute envies the clear sky.'

7
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,079
Do you know what these lines mean?

8
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,320
Why don't you follow me to the hall,

9
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
have some wine,

10
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,650
and interpret it together?

11
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,520
Alright.

12
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,720
What a beauty Lan is.

13
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,520
No wonder she claims to have no interest in competing for favor.

14
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,680
She already has someone in her heart.

15
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,760
Your Highness,

16
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,420
should we inform His Majesty about this matter?

17
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,340
Do you understand?

18
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,780
Your Highness,

19
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,290
have a drink.

20
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,329
Who exactly are you?

21
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,640
Why did you enter the palace?

22
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,400
And why

23
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,079
did you bring me here?

24
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,880
Your Highness,

25
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,160
you're hurting me.

26
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,520
I don't understand what you're talking about.

27
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,640
The 'Jade Flute Collection' was written by a flute master from the previous dynasty.

28
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,040
It was lost from the palace long ago.

29
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,880
Few people in the palace have even seen it.

30
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,880
You're just a merchant's daughter.

31
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,980
How could you possibly know about it?

32
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,600
It was His Majesty.

33
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,800
There was a copy in His Majesty's Wende Hall.

34
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,880
I was curious

35
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,680
and borrowed it to pass the time.

36
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,240
Curious.

37
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,100
Then why did you put something in my wine?

38
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,440
I... I didn't.

39
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,320
You didn't?

40
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,840
Your Highness.

41
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
You're so close to me.

42
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,560
Do you want to feed me wine?

43
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
It's just sour plum powder.

44
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,600
It's a folk recipe

45
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,580
to enhance the flavor of wine.

46
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,360
I just thought I'd found someone who understands me,

47
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,020
but I never expected Your Highness to misunderstand me like this.

48
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,120
I...

49
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,060
If Your Highness cares for me,

50
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,520
please help me get my handkerchief.

51
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,040
Don't let me look so disheveled.

52
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,320
What have you done?

53
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,460
Your Highness.

54
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,159
Drugs don't have to be put in wine.

55
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,920
You actually put it in the handkerchief.

56
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,880
This drug is colorless and odorless.

57
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,200
Once inhaled,

58
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,060
it first makes one's body go limp.

59
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,720
Then you lose all reason

60
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,450
and answer any question asked.

61
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,960
Just like being drunk.

62
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,240
After tonight,

63
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,120
you will forget everything.

64
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,720
What exactly do you want?

65
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,780
This jade pendant,

66
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,320
where did you get it from?

67
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
This has always

68
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,360
been my possession.

69
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,320
You're lying.

70
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,200
Tell me.

71
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,520
Did you kill Ji Yanlun?

72
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,800
I did not.

73
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,440
Speak.

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,040
I have never killed Ji Yanlun.

75
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,080
You...

76
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,720
Lan'er is too weak

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,800
to accompany His Majesty.

78
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,600
May Buddha bless us.

79
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,080
May His Majesty be healthy

80
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,340
and free from worries.

81
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,540
With your kind intentions

82
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,320
I feel completely at ease.

83
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,760
Your Majesty.

84
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,040
Your Majesty, why are you here?

85
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,480
Weren't you reviewing documents at Wende Hall?

86
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,410
If I hadn't come,

87
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,210
how would I know about your devoted heart?

88
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,480
Why pray before Buddha, my dear?

89
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,720
I am the Emperor

90
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,920
and your husband.

91
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,940
If you need something,

92
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,220
just tell me directly.

93
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,720
Your Majesty.

94
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,440
You...

95
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,920
My lady.

96
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,320
Lan Meiren

97
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,800
Yu Shufei indeed asked me to report you

98
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,159
for having an affair with Prince Huai.

99
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,690
She already has many spies outside my palace.

100
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,240
Even without you,

101
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,200
the news of Prince Huai meeting me here tonight

102
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,730
would still reach her ears.

103
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,400
It's better

104
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,440
to let it come from your mouth.

105
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,840
This way, it strengthens your position

106
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,300
and gives us time to deal with the aftermath.

107
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,200
But you

108
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,640
must be careful.

109
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,240
Mo Yan said

110
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,170
no one in this world can resist the power of this drug.

111
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,560
It seems the culprit is not Prince Huai.

112
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,520
That being the case,

113
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,159
I must establish deeper roots in the palace

114
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,620
to find the real mastermind behind all this.

115
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,120
Sister Ruya,

116
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,200
the poison in your body has been completely cleared.

117
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
You can rest assured.

118
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,440
By the way,

119
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,040
have you found out anything about that jade pendant?

120
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,640
After extensive inquiries,

121
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,160
I learned this is premium white jade tribute from the Western Regions.

122
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
There are only three pieces in the entire country,

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,880
carved into pendants

124
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,040
and given to three people.

125
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,240
Besides the one owned by Prince Huai,

126
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,960
the other two are in the imperial harem.

127
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,720
Really?

128
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,920
Have you discovered

129
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,120
the whereabouts of those two pendants?

130
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,400
Although I'm a royal physician,

131
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,920
it's not appropriate for me to inquire too much about palace matters.

132
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,080
But I can confirm

133
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,400
that the person in black is inside the imperial harem.

134
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,720
I've already persuaded His Majesty

135
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,160
and Prince Huai to investigate this matter.

136
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,690
If even they cannot uncover

137
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,360
the background of this person in black,

138
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,440
I fear it's no simple matter.
