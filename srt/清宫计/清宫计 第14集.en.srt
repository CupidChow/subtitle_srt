1
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,120
Ruya.

2
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,000
I never wanted this to happen.

3
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,400
If you need anything,

4
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,100
I will do everything I can to help.

5
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,640
I have something to tell you.

6
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,479
They already know

7
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,140
that you're investigating your father's case.

8
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,840
You must be very careful.

9
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,920
Do you know something?

10
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,640
I've said enough.

11
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,300
Take care of yourself.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,040
Ji Jiya.

13
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,160
Father.

14
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,820
You served your country and your people.

15
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,360
But have you ever thought about

16
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
what would happen when you're gone?

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,200
What about my sister and me?

18
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,120
What am I supposed to do now?

19
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,440
Father.

20
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,300
Sister's wine is truly exceptional.

21
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,120
It's my honor to taste it.

22
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,360
I've heard that drinking under the moonlight

23
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,820
can make wishes come true.

24
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,920
Sister's wine is truly exceptional.

25
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,280
For me to taste it

26
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,880
is my honor.

27
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,040
He certainly won't let this go.

28
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,720
How should I respond to this?

29
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,520
That Lady Lan has been in close contact with Prince Huai.

30
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,960
She probably knows something.

31
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,690
She absolutely cannot remain.

32
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,120
This

33
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,960
is your last chance.

34
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Report!

35
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,640
Your Majesty! Something terrible has happened.

36
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,000
Consort Yushu has poisoned herself

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,530
and is on the verge of death.

38
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,159
How is she?

39
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
Though it's not a lethal poison,

40
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,490
it has already spread throughout her organs.

41
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,970
She cannot be saved.

42
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,050
In that case,

43
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,740
I'll wait outside.

44
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,320
You two should

45
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,120
say your final words.

46
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,200
Jiya.

47
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,120
Jiya.

48
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,370
After fighting all my life,

49
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,880
I still lost in the end.

50
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,960
And now I've come to this pitiful end.

51
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
Sister.

52
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
It's been so long since I heard you call me that.

53
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,159
Sister.

54
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,120
Why did we end up like this?

55
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,880
We used to

56
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,480
play happily at father's feet.

57
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,940
Dreaming together about our future.

58
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,240
How did we suddenly

59
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,020
become palace rivals scheming against each other?

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
Such pitiful, wounded souls.

61
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,040
My life can't be restored now.

62
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
If I can die in your arms,

63
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,920
at least I'll have come full circle.

64
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,100
Did someone force you to drink it?

65
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,280
Who was it?

66
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Sister.

67
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,440
Don't investigate any further.

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,840
You can't fight against them.

69
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,580
Don't try to play games with that person.

70
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,600
Jiya.

71
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,240
You know who the killer is, don't you?

72
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,920
Jiya.

73
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,280
Tell me.

74
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,120
Making deals with demons

75
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,800
always comes with a price.

76
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,920
Isn't that right?

77
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,600
I paid with my kindness,

78
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,680
my compassion,

79
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,360
and this time with my life.

80
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,800
Sister.

81
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,840
In this life,

82
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,320
I've failed you.

83
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,480
In the next life,

84
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,040
I'll be your sister again.

85
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,000
Never mind.

86
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,320
You probably

87
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,370
don't want a sister like me anyway.

88
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
Jiya.

89
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Hang in there.

90
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,920
I won't let anything happen to you.

91
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,850
I won't let anything happen to you.

92
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,280
You're the only family I have left.

93
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,480
Jiya.

94
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,600
Sister, don't cry.

95
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,920
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,320
Don't cry, sister.

97
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,000
Jiya.

99
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,880
Jiya.

100
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,520
Jiya.

101
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,760
Sister.

102
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,680
By the time you read this letter,

103
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,090
I will probably no longer be alive.

104
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
You must feel quite pleased.

105
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,840
When we were at home,

106
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,640
I always loved to argue with you.

107
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
And now,

108
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
in the palace.

109
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,680
Just destroy it.

110
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,340
I will still compete with you.

111
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,720
Sometimes I don't even know

112
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,810
if I'm fighting for someone else's affection

113
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,700
or just fighting for your attention.

114
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,200
The palace is a place that devours people.

115
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Desire distorts one's true nature.

116
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,280
Kindness becomes the greatest weakness.

117
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,840
If you're not strong enough,

118
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,160
you'll be nothing but prey.

119
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,040
We're at their mercy.
