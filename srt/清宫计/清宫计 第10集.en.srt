1
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,600
I won again.

2
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,360
I won again.

3
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,560
How boring.

4
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,800
Your Majesty's chess skills are superb.

5
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,240
I am no match for you.

6
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,720
I doubt that.

7
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,620
Lan'er, what troubles your mind?

8
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,400
Tell me.

9
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,440
I will protect you.

10
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,600
Your Majesty.

11
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,039
Lady Lan has been too intimate with Prince Huai lately.

12
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,320
If this continues,

13
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,780
it will harm the royal family's reputation.

14
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,920
Lan'er, are you thinking of someone?

15
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,800
Why would Your Majesty say that?

16
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,440
If something troubles you,

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,560
just tell me.

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,560
I will share your burden.

19
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,890
Now is not the time to reveal the truth.

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,800
The Emperor must not know.

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,660
I'm worried about Jiya's matter.

22
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,199
Your Majesty.

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,200
With Your Majesty's favor,

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,080
how could I have any worries?

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
I thought we understood each other.

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,200
It seems

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,440
I was mistaken.

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,760
Your Majesty.

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
I...

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,640
Enough.

31
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,920
When you've thought it through,

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
we'll talk again.

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,760
Your Majesty.

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,450
Where are you going?

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,079
To see Lady Li.

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Prepare the imperial carriage!

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,800
Lihua Palace

38
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,370
Yueru

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,240
Your Majesty.

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,160
Are you going to Lihua Palace now?

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,240
What Lihua Palace?

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,490
Let's return to Zhaoyang Hall.

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,840
Your Highness.

44
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,040
Greetings, sisters.

45
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,760
These days in the palace,

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,020
I hear Lady Li is the most favored,

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,960
while the old faces are forgotten.

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,760
No tears for old acquaintances.

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,600
I heard His Majesty hasn't visited Lan Yu Pavilion for seven days.

50
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,040
It seems he's truly grown cold.

51
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,300
Seven days is nothing.

52
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,360
I say 70 days,

53
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,640
700 days,

54
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,360
better if he never sees that vixen again.

55
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,240
The flowers in the Imperial Garden

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,480
have bloomed in waves after waves.

57
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,440
How could anyone stay in favor for a hundred days?

58
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Lady Lan has only been favored for such a short time,

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,760
and now His Majesty has grown tired of her.

60
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,680
I suppose he's bored of her.

61
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,640
I heard Lady Lan has been spending her days with Prince Huai,

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,720
exchanging flirtatious glances,

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,160
behaving inappropriately.

64
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,360
She doesn't act like a proper consort at all.

65
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
She deserves to be abandoned by His Majesty.

66
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,280
She thought she was so special,

67
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,450
but she's nothing extraordinary.

68
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,120
Exactly.

69
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,960
Lady,

70
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,560
if His Majesty doesn't visit again,

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,280
who does she think she is?

72
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,480
I'm afraid she'll...

73
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,440
What?

74
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,120
Palace people excel at flattering the powerful and stepping on the weak.

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,720
Why don't you humble yourself a bit

76
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,920
and go to His Majesty?

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,080
I won't go.

78
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,320
The time isn't right.

79
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,040
Your Majesty.

80
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,900
That's what happened in the Imperial Garden today.

81
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,960
Lady Lan

82
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,300
must have suffered great injustice.

83
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Summon her for me.

84
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,400
Summon Lady Lan.

85
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,210
Who told you I wanted to see her?

86
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,960
She thinks quite highly of herself.

87
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,880
She doesn't share her thoughts with me.

88
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,520
Nor does she come to me when wronged.

89
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
In her heart,

90
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,250
is there any place for me at all?

91
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,480
And you say you don't care.

92
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,480
Who allowed you to presume my intentions?

93
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,680
I am the Emperor.

94
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,409
What can't I have if I desire it?

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,040
Your Majesty.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,960
Your servant

97
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
has a plan.

98
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,100
Don't you have any fresh dance moves?

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,159
Forget it.

100
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,760
I'll have someone escort you back.

101
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,600
Yes.

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
I shall take my leave.

103
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,840
Your Majesty.

104
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,040
Have I done something wrong?

105
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,880
You've done nothing wrong.

106
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,840
I just

107
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,240
lost interest suddenly.

108
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,160
You may go.

109
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,200
Your Majesty.

110
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,530
What do you think of my suggestion?

111
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,240
How is it?

112
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,920
How?

113
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,840
Should I go in or not?

114
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,800
But if I just go in like this,

115
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,720
wouldn't I lose face?

116
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,300
Who said I was looking for her?

117
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,200
I just think

118
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,760
the moonlight outside Lan Yu Pavilion is nice.

119
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
I only want to enjoy the moon.

120
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,680
The moon.

121
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,960
It is I who needs to see Concubine Lan,

122
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,760
not Your Majesty.

123
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,640
She seems quite happy when I don't come.

124
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm leaving.

125
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,480
Your Majesty.

126
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,640
Your Majesty, shouldn't you

127
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,440
be with Consort Chun right now?

128
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,450
You seem to enjoy when I accompany others.

129
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,720
How could I?

130
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,400
I am but a humble woman.

131
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,320
Your Majesty has so many consorts.

132
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,180
If Your Majesty decides to neglect me, then so be it.

133
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,159
Such a humble woman,

134
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:57,000
yet you make me worry so much.

135
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
When I don't come,

136
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,900
couldn't you come see me instead?

137
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,120
Heartless.

138
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,440
Then, Your Majesty,

139
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,900
will you still use others to make me jealous?

140
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,840
You're jealous.

141
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,820
Then I must be at fault.

142
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,000
The Empress Dowager will return to the palace in a few days.

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,880
I will prepare

144
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,360
a welcoming banquet for her.

145
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,200
When the time comes,

146
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,000
you must prepare yourself well.

147
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
I have already prepared.

148
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,440
I plan to play music at the welcoming banquet.

149
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,050
Would Your Majesty like to hear it?

150
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,760
The Empress Dowager's procession returns to the palace.

151
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,240
Your Majesty prays for the nation's blessing

152
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,520
and attends to every matter personally.

153
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,160
I can never match such virtue.

154
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,760
I'd like to offer you a toast.

155
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,080
Your Majesty.

156
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,760
The Empress Dowager is devoted to Buddhism

157
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,320
and has observed the Five Precepts for years.

158
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,850
She doesn't touch alcohol.

159
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,220
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

160
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
I didn't know.

161
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,980
Ignorance is no crime.

162
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
You may leave now.

163
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,560
Mother.

164
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,570
That is my newly appointed Concubine Lan.

165
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,720
She has a virtuous character

166
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,850
I am very fond of her.

167
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,400
I am Concubine Yu.

168
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,720
Paying my respects to the Empress Dowager.

169
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,760
May you enjoy eternal happiness

170
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,020
And boundless fortune for years to come.

171
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,280
It's good that you have a new favorite.

172
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,200
But you should distribute your favor equally in the harem.

173
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,680
Yes.

174
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,520
I understand.

175
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,200
You may rise.

176
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,400
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

Sister Lan, this string of beads.

178
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,280
This looks familiar.

179
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,120
It seems identical to the Empress Dowager's.
