1
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,400
Your Majesty.

2
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Does it look good?

3
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,560
Lan'er, you look stunning

4
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,240
in anything you wear.

5
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,840
Lan'er.

6
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,960
What's wrong, Lan'er?

7
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,560
It hurts. It hurts so much.

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,200
Lan'er!

9
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,320
Lan'er!

10
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,520
Your Highness!

11
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,560
What happened to her?

12
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,620
Doctor! Summon the royal physician!

13
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,520
Yes, sir.

14
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,000
Your Majesty...

15
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,240
The Noble Consort appears to have been exposed to heart-devouring poison.

16
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,520
Heart-devouring poison?

17
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,640
This poison mainly comes from the Western Regions.

18
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,840
Women who touch it with their skin will be severely poisoned.

19
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,520
The pain feels like one's heart is being devoured.

20
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,120
Fortunately, we discovered it in time.

21
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,079
I will give the Noble Consort the antidote

22
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,160
which will neutralize the poison.

23
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,640
Why would such a thing appear in my palace?

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,660
Xianglin replaced the musk with heart-devouring poison.

25
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,160
Empress, you can't escape now.

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,640
Your Majesty.

27
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,200
I started feeling unwell after wearing

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,480
the clothes gifted by the Empress.

29
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
Are you saying...

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,160
Please have the physician thoroughly examine

31
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,090
if there's poison on that garment.

32
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,000
Wait.

33
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,280
Before investigating the clothes I provided,

34
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,140
perhaps the physician should check if the Noble Consort is pregnant.

35
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,760
Empress, what are you implying?

36
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,960
The physician has examined me many times

37
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,520
in front of His Majesty these past days.

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,760
Are you suggesting I conspired with the physician to deceive the Emperor?

39
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,040
Don't worry, my dear.

40
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,329
The royal physician will know after an examination.

41
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,880
With the fake pregnancy pills,

42
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,800
what tricks can you possibly pull?

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,640
Your Majesty,

44
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,480
the Noble Consort is not pregnant.

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,600
What?

46
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,520
Impossible!

47
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,000
Your Majesty,

48
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,080
please,

49
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,330
please summon another physician.

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Summon all the imperial physicians

51
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,200
to My presence immediately.

52
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,200
Noble Consort is not with child.

54
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,680
You're lying!

55
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,160
I wouldn't dare, Your Highness.

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
Your Highness is weak and deficient in vital energy,

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,460
but there is absolutely no pregnancy pulse.

58
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,080
My diagnosis is the same.

59
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,940
How can this be?

60
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,720
Could all these physicians be in collusion with the Empress?

61
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm here to check Your Highness's pulse.

62
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,900
Thank goodness Moyan is here.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,860
Noble Consort,

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,730
the fake pregnancy pills have lost their effect.

65
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,620
You can't hide it anymore.

66
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,680
What did you say?

67
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,440
Your Majesty,

68
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,420
the Noble Consort recently bribed me with this.

69
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,040
She asked me to make fake pregnancy pills for her.

70
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,120
She planned to bring down the Empress by faking a pregnancy and miscarriage.

71
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,580
I foolishly agreed in a moment of confusion.

72
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,180
However...

73
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,240
However what?

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,600
But these pills are extremely harmful to the body.

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,640
They may cause infertility.

76
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,600
As a physician,

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,800
I couldn't bear the guilt on my conscience.

78
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,400
Later, I added ingredients to the Noble Consort's daily tonics

79
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,130
that would neutralize the fake pregnancy pills.

80
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,360
I hope Your Majesty will consider

81
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,000
that I have seen the error of my ways.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,060
Please forgive me.

83
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,360
Moyan!

84
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:56,960
You...

85
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,320
Is what he said true?

86
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,920
If Your Majesty still doesn't believe it,

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,480
let the palace matrons examine the Consort.

88
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,640
A woman who has never been pregnant

89
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,540
is different from one who has.

90
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,280
Matron.

91
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,800
Yes.

92
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,320
Your Highness.

93
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,650
Examine her thoroughly for me.

94
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,440
Yes.

95
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,280
Let go of me!

96
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,920
What right do you have to examine me?

97
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,720
What if I order an inspection?

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,760
So everything they said is true, isn't it?

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,640
Yes.

100
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,040
Why?

101
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,800
I know what you've been plotting.

102
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,600
You used me. I don't care.

103
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,880
I was willing to be used by you.

104
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,290
But why did you take fake pregnancy pills?

105
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,180
Do you despise having my child that much?

106
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,600
Yes.

107
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,000
After all this time,

108
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,800
have you never had genuine feelings for me?

109
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,240
Never.

110
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,080
I...

111
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,400
I never want to see you again.

112
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,300
Imperial Consort,

113
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,880
you have trampled on His Majesty's sincere affection,

114
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,080
deceived with a fake pregnancy and framed the Empress.

115
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,320
Your crimes are unforgivable.

116
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,880
Guards!

117
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,320
Strip the Imperial Consort of her title.

118
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,560
Banished to the Cold Palace

119
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,800
never to leave again.

120
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
Sincerity?

121
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,980
Who has ever shown me true sincerity?

122
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,000
I have.

123
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,200
You?

124
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,240
Mo Yan.

125
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,120
In the entire palace,

126
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,970
you were the person I trusted most.

127
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,240
Why did you betray me?

128
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,760
Why?

129
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,320
Sister Ruya.

130
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,440
Do you love me?

131
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,120
I would die for you, don't you believe me?

132
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,960
Let go of me.

133
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,400
Every time I see you with His Majesty

134
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,460
or with the Prince,

135
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,740
I want nothing more than to kill them.

136
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,240
I've been suppressing my love for you.

137
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,960
As long as you're happy, I'm happy.

138
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,840
Do you know

139
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,970
how much I've suffered?

140
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,760
So you decided to destroy me?

141
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,320
When did you

142
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
start conspiring with the Empress?

143
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,080
The day you became His Majesty's woman.
