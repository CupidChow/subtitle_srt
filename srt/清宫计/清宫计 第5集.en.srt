1
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,320
Your Majesty.

2
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,920
Your Majesty.

3
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,610
That eunuch is indeed suspicious.

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,120
It's the love incense.

5
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,170
Brother.

6
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,320
Lady Lan.

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,660
What's wrong with you?

8
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,880
This is bad.

9
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,500
It's the love incense.

10
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
This is terrible.

11
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,720
Help...

12
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,800
I'm burning up.

13
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,040
Lady Lan.

14
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,040
Lady Lan,

15
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,329
stay conscious.

16
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,170
Lady Lan.

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Your Highness.

18
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,260
Your Highness,

19
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,920
I've finally found you.

20
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,640
What's so urgent?

21
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,610
According to palace servants,

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,040
Prince Huai and Lady Lan were seen

23
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,200
entering Guibao Palace one after another.

24
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,000
And there were some

25
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,540
indecent sounds coming from inside.

26
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,040
They must be engaging in

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,100
an illicit affair within the palace.

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,760
Lady Chun.

29
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,380
Don't speak nonsense about this matter.

30
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,760
This could

31
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,520
damage the royal family's reputation.

32
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,680
Your Highness, you'll see for yourself when you go there.

33
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,840
I assure you

34
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,760
it's absolutely true.

35
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,680
Lady Lan.

36
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,840
I've blocked my acupuncture points,

37
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,880
but I can only resist this love incense temporarily.

38
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,920
Today's incident

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,780
is likely a trap set by someone with ill intentions.

40
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,480
Lady Lan.

41
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,760
Don't go.

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,840
Don't leave.

43
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,120
Don't abandon me.

44
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,920
This is bad.

45
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,200
Don't leave me.

46
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,380
How dare you, Lady Lan!

47
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,840
She dares to have an affair with the prince

48
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,120
and commit such indecent acts in the palace.

49
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,880
Guards!

50
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,279
Seize this woman who disregards palace rules

51
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,720
and behaves with such wanton immorality!

52
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,240
Yes!

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,810
I'd like to see who dares to be so impudent.

54
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,480
Your Majesty!

55
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,440
How can it be you?

56
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,880
This is my kingdom,

57
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,760
my home.

58
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,600
She is my woman.

59
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,520
Am I not allowed to come here?

60
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,040
As for you all,

61
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,540
coming here in the middle of the night with the Empress.

62
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,600
What?

63
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,159
Do I need your permission

64
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,320
to favor my own concubine?

65
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:45,960
No,

66
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,760
that's not it.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,320
I heard that

68
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,840
Lady Lan and Prince Huai

69
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,680
were committing indecent acts in the Guibao Palace.

70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,600
That's why I specially invited the Empress to investigate.

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,880
I did it all for you!

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,520
Your Majesty.

73
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,600
For my sake

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,280
You spread rumors just for my sake

75
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,340
and falsely accused Lady Lan.

76
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
Pure Consort

77
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,240
I've told you before

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,880
that such treasonous matters

79
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,740
should never be based on hearsay.

80
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,480
Yet you still spread rumors with such conviction.

81
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,880
Hurry and accept your punishment from His Majesty.

82
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,640
Your Majesty

83
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,760
please forgive this humble servant.

84
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,440
Enough!

85
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,160
I've spoiled you too much.

86
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,200
Guards!

87
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,480
At your service.

88
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,440
Consort Chun has made baseless accusations,

89
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,720
spread rumors,

90
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,520
and trespassed into the palace.

91
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,180
Confine her for three months.

92
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,200
The Empress has failed to manage the harem properly,

93
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,530
her supervision is lax.

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,720
Reduce her salary for half a year.

95
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

96
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,880
Your Majesty.

97
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,600
Get out!

98
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,520
All of you, get out!

99
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,920
Thank you for coming in time, brother.

100
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,000
About the aphrodisiac incense...

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,720
Someone must have deliberately arranged this

102
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,200
to lure us both here.

103
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,280
The palace intrigues never end.

104
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,280
You've suffered so much, Lan'er.

105
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,360
My lady, I went to investigate.

106
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,760
There was indeed something suspicious at Guibao Palace.

107
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,220
Someone had lit aphrodisiac incense there.

108
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,840
Then I'll go with the flow.

109
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Go quickly to Zhaoyang Palace and inform His Majesty.

110
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,800
We can use this to eliminate our enemies.

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,330
I'll put myself in the game.

112
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,280
It's worth it.

113
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,290
Brother.

114
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
Lady Lan's poison

115
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,600
requires you to cure it personally.

116
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,720
I shall take my leave now.

117
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,520
Your Majesty.

118
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,730
Brother.

119
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,460
What are you doing?

120
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,159
The antidote for the aphrodisiac incense.

121
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,120
She has been affected by the incense.

122
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,450
I cannot take advantage of her situation.

123
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,400
Your Majesty! Something terrible has happened!

124
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,200
Someone has taken Lady Lan away.

125
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,720
What?

126
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,940
My lady has been taken.

127
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,020
But she doesn't seem worried.

128
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,800
No one has ever dared to use me as a pawn.

129
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,600
However,

130
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,120
if that person is you...

131
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,920
Where does the melancholy flute sound come from?

132
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,780
One melody from the south brings all things to life.

133
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,460
Wild birds also rejoice with the spring.

134
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,850
At night, the jade flute plays, envying the clear skies.

135
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,250
I was quite abrupt that day.

136
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,120
Are you feeling much better now?

137
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,720
I'm feeling much better now.

138
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,049
Thank you, Prince Huai.

139
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,559
Prince Huai always carries his flute.

140
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,960
These scholars pride themselves on being refined.

141
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,220
You should be careful.

142
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,680
I specially instructed the imperial kitchen

143
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,760
to prepare some dishes to replenish your blood and energy.

144
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,560
What's wrong?

145
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Don't you like it?

146
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,400
Your Majesty.

147
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,160
I'm having my period.

148
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,400
So I'm feeling a bit unwell.

149
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,540
That's why I have no appetite.

150
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,940
As long as you're getting better,

151
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,440
I can rest easy.

152
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,360
Then tonight...

153
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,280
Tonight I'll be reviewing memorials at Zhaoyang Palace.

154
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,040
You should rest well.

155
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,300
No need to attend to me.

156
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

157
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,440
You're so kind.

158
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,010
No need to see me out.

159
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,540
Go back and rest early.

160
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,440
Yes.

161
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,080
Xianglian.

162
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,340
Did you find the flute I asked for?

163
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,480
Get some rest early tonight.

164
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,000
You don't need to attend to me.

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,720
Yes.
