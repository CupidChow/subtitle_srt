1
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,160
How is it?

2
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,400
Qing'er died for me.

3
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,479
The Empress already knows my identity.

4
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,520
I must move faster to bring her down.

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,200
What do you plan to do?

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,460
I've been favored for a long time.

7
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,600
I need to have a child now.

8
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,560
You mean...

9
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,000
The false pregnancy pills I asked you to make

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,460
how are they coming along?

11
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,120
You'll be diagnosed as pregnant the next day.

12
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,780
However...

13
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,720
This medicine is extremely harmful to the body.

14
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
It may cause infertility.

15
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,760
As long as I can avenge the entire Ji family,

16
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,640
what does this matter?

17
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,960
Your Majesty.

18
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,280
The palace consorts are deeply connected with court officials,

19
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,560
pull one thread and everything is affected.

20
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,720
I know you have your preferences now,

21
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,079
but I must speak frankly.

22
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,490
Please don't let one magnolia tree

23
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,800
cause the entire imperial garden to wither,

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,600
affecting everything else.

25
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,480
I have indeed been favoring the Imperial Consort lately,

26
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,280
neglecting the other consorts.

27
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,040
Fortunately, you reminded me in time,

28
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,280
so I won't be lost in romantic affairs

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,740
and disappoint the senior court officials.

30
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,680
It is my duty.

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,900
I hope Your Majesty doesn't find me nagging.

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,840
Having such a wise empress as you,

33
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,040
is all I could ask for.

34
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
Bring the tribute from Dongling Kingdom,

35
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,920
the glowing green fox pendant.

36
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,180
I wish to reward the Empress generously.

37
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,079
Yes.

38
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,560
This glowing green fox pendant is extremely rare,

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,740
there's only one in the entire world.

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,360
I am not worthy of such a gift.

41
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,440
You are my empress.

42
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,500
If you're not worthy, then who is?

43
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,800
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,320
I just heard about that green fox pendant.

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,680
I want one too.

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,810
Have you forgotten what you just promised me?

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,079
Am I carrying your royal heir

48
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,420
and still not worthy of a fox pendant?

49
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,500
Noble Consort,

50
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,860
are you with child?

51
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,200
I just summoned several royal physicians.

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,720
They all confirmed I'm over two months pregnant.

53
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,780
That's wonderful!

54
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,540
My Consort,

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,440
you will surely bear me

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,970
a brilliant little prince.

57
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,040
Your Majesty.

58
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,760
The Emerald Fox pendant.

59
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,740
From this day forward,

60
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,920
whatever you desire,

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,360
I will give it all to you.

62
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,720
Your Majesty,

63
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,560
you are so kind.

64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,920
This is only the beginning.

65
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,680
The Emperor rewards his Consort.

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,480
Your Majesty.

67
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Your Majesty.

68
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,760
Your Majesty.

69
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,640
Your Majesty.

70
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,880
Your Majesty.

71
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,280
The Imperial Consort

72
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,520
Your Highness.

73
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
Are you all right?

74
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
Today is the 15th.

75
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,159
His Majesty will surely come to my chambers.

76
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,360
I told you to prepare the meal. Why did you come back?

77
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,159
Your Majesty,

78
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,560
I just ran into Eunuch Zhao.

79
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,120
Why don't we let him tell you himself?

80
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,200
Your Majesty,

81
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
His Majesty will be spending tonight with the Imperial Concubine

82
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,600
and won't be coming here.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,880
I understand.

84
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,450
There's one more thing.

85
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,680
The Imperial Concubine heard that before you were married,

86
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,720
you were skilled at needlework.

87
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,200
She requests that you personally

88
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,480
embroider a pearl and silver robe for her,

89
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,720
symbolizing prosperity for her and the royal child.

90
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,120
Of course,

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,880
this is also His Majesty's wish.

92
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,360
I understand.

93
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,720
Lady Lan.

94
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,560
She's gone too far.

95
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,920
Taking advantage of carrying the royal heir to humiliate you.

96
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,320
Making you personally sew clothes for her.

97
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,280
She's just from a merchant family.

98
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,080
Is she worthy?

99
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,800
Yes.

100
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,000
Of course she is.

101
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,280
My lady.

102
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,080
I heard that in the Empress's palace

103
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,840
many teacups and vases were broken.

104
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,400
She must be

105
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,060
absolutely furious with you.

106
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,080
When a dog is cornered,

107
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,540
it will jump over the wall.

108
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,880
She won't tolerate this pregnancy.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,530
What are you so happy about?

110
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,280
Your Majesty.

111
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,210
I've told you

112
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
that you're pregnant

113
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,040
and needn't bow to me.

114
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,480
Yes.

115
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,760
This is...

116
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,690
This is a safety knot I made myself.

117
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,060
It's a bit ugly.

118
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,080
Your Majesty...

119
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,800
I

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,200
just want to keep you and our child safe.

121
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
It's a pity

122
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,880
I'm destined to disappoint you.

123
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,400
Your Majesty,

124
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,520
the clothes you asked me to embroider

125
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,080
for the Noble Consort's sister are ready.

126
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,140
Please take a look.

127
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,480
The inner embroidery shows a hundred blessings,

128
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,040
and the outer silk is smooth.

129
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,240
The Empress truly has exquisite taste.

130
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,300
It's so intricate and beautiful.

131
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,280
I love it.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,760
Your Majesty,

133
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,320
I want to wear it right now.

134
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,880
Good. Attend to the Noble Consort's change of clothes.

135
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,520
Yes.

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,730
She couldn't resist after all.

137
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,760
The threads of this garment were soaked in large amounts of musk.

138
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,480
Once worn,

139
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,040
not even the greatest physician could save her.

140
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
But the Empress is very shrewd.

141
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,080
If you miscarry after wearing the clothes she sent,

142
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
suspicion could easily fall on her.

143
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,200
Xianglian.

144
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,660
Go check the Empress's chambers.

145
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,320
In the Empress's palace,

146
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,850
there must be a garment identical to this one.

147
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,400
Find it

148
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,650
and replace it with the heart-consuming poison.

149
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,960
Yes.

150
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,000
Your Majesty.

151
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,240
You cannot escape the charge of attempting to murder the favored concubine today.
