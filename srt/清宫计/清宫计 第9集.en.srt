1
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,520
Seize her now

2
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,400
before she disturbs His Majesty.

3
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,039
Wait.

4
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,400
Your Majesty.

5
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,039
May I step forward to take a closer look?

6
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,680
How did Lan'er manage

7
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,010
to create such a wonder?

8
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,720
The ancients say,

9
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,280
cicadas shed their shells beyond the dust,

10
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,840
butterflies dream among misty waters.

11
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,400
Though silkworm cocoons appear plain,

12
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,880
once they break free and transform,

13
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,480
they become dreamlike and magical.

14
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,000
If one only lingers on flowers,

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,800
admiring their fleeting beauty,

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,360
and lacks patience to wait,

17
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,200
they will miss

18
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,730
the breathtaking splendor of colorful butterflies in flight.

19
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,200
Could she be...

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,720
Lan'er's ingenuity

21
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,160
is truly remarkable.

22
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,280
Your Majesty,

23
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,120
this is all thanks to Consort Yushu's excellent guidance.

24
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,040
I

25
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,640
am merely helping the Consort with her duties.

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,620
What reward should I bestow upon you all?

27
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Your Majesty.

28
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,240
It's my honor to bring comfort

29
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,500
to you and the Empress.

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,520
Relay my decree.

31
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,130
Ji Ya is granted authority to manage the six palaces.

32
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,360
Lady Lan is promoted to Concubine Lan.

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,640
Well done.

35
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,120
I had no idea

36
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,640
you were so capable.

37
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,050
It's all thanks to your guidance, Your Highness.

38
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,579
Did I also teach you the butterfly language?

39
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,410
I heard it from my parents when I was young.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,730
Impossible.

41
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,160
My sister's fate remains unknown.

42
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,960
If you were really her,

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,620
how could I not recognize you?

44
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,560
It's impossible.

45
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,760
You helped me gain authority over the six palaces.

46
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,240
I'm in an excellent mood.

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,330
This is a seven-jeweled crystal necklace from Siam.

48
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,120
At the Empress Dowager's welcoming banquet,

49
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,960
don't embarrass me.

50
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,800
However, this isn't what I wanted.

52
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,520
What I promised you,

53
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,050
I will not go back on my word.

54
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,180
Thank you, Your Highness.

55
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
Concubine Lan,

56
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
why have you come to the Palace Affairs Office yourself?

57
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,520
Sister Yu Shu Fei hosted the flower appreciation ceremony.

58
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,880
His Majesty was greatly pleased

59
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,360
and rewarded her with the position to manage the six palaces.

60
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,840
Sister is too busy to get away,

61
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,760
so she asked me

62
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,200
to help her review the accounts.

63
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
I see.

64
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,440
The palace accounts are ready.

65
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,100
Please review them, Lady Lan.

66
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,600
Reviewing accounts is tiring for the eyes.

67
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,330
Lady Lan, please have some tea.

68
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
You may leave.

69
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,480
Yes.

70
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,360
How could it be her?

71
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,490
Lady, be careful not to catch cold.

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,640
Lady, is something troubling you?

73
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Xianglian.

74
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,720
Have you ever heard

75
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,240
the story of Emperor Zhu Yougui of Later Liang?

76
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,520
Never.

77
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,600
Emperor Zhu Yougui killed his father to usurp the throne.

78
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,520
But he had a brother

79
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,840
named Zhu Youzhen.

80
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,280
If you were Zhu Youzhen,

81
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,560
what would you do?

82
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,040
My lady.

83
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,520
Though I'm not educated,

84
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,120
I understand what's right in my heart.

85
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,040
No matter what,

86
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,640
righteousness comes first.

87
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,600
Righteousness...

88
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,960
Jiya.

89
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,320
Why don't we

90
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,160
just destroy it?

91
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,720
Buddha.

92
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,040
Tell me,

93
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,240
was Jiya the one who poisoned them?

94
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
Father.

95
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,360
If it was truly your own daughter,

96
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,280
my own sister,

97
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,720
how am I supposed

98
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,880
to avenge this terrible blood debt?
