1
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,900
Your Highness.

2
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,680
You wretch!

3
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,280
How dare you deceive me!

4
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,039
Consort Yushu,

5
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,400
why do you say such things?

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,560
You claim you only want to live peacefully,

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,760
yet you repeatedly seduce His Majesty.

8
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,760
I don't care if it was intentional

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,720
or not.

10
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,400
Today will be your last day alive.

11
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,760
Your Highness, Your Highness,

12
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,220
I approached His Majesty only for your sake!

13
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,460
Your Highness!

14
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
Spreading lies.

15
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,760
Do you think I would still believe you?

16
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,500
Your Highness.

17
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,320
I...

18
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,560
I approached His Majesty

19
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,600
to persuade him to give you the authority

20
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,720
to organize the Flower Festival.

21
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,560
It was all

22
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,360
to help you obtain

23
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,640
the power to manage the six palaces.

24
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,600
Your Highness.

25
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,130
You still try to deceive me?

26
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,040
The Flower Festival is hosted by the Empress every year.

27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
How could it possibly be given to me?

28
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,480
That mouth of yours

29
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
is truly silver-tongued.

30
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,079
What a pity.

31
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,360
In the future,

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,360
you'll never speak again.

33
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,760
Concubine Yushu, receive the decree.

34
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,240
The Empress is gravely ill.

35
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,770
Thank you for recommending me to His Majesty.

36
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,760
Concubine Yushu is virtuous.

37
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,090
His Majesty sees it all.

38
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,160
I

39
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,880
merely went with the flow.

40
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,640
This flower viewing ceremony is a harem tradition.

41
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,360
It aims to celebrate before autumn's chill,

42
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,490
showcasing the beauty of prosperity.

43
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,280
Each concubine

44
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
carefully nurtures her own flowers

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,640
to present before His Majesty.

46
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,890
I actually like these dahlias,

47
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,090
but I fear they might seem too gaudy

48
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,050
and displease His Majesty.

49
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,400
Lady Lan.

50
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,720
Tell me,

51
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,160
what flower should I choose

52
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,290
to win His Majesty's exclusive favor?

53
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,160
In this garden,

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,360
flowers indeed compete with their beauty,

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,720
making it more lively.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This peony,

57
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,640
elegant and dignified,

58
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,519
holds the main position in the palace.

59
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,000
And this datura,

60
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,980
bewitchingly beautiful,

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
yet contains hallucinogenic poison

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,330
that requires caution.

63
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,600
And this rose,

64
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,080
though unassuming,

65
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,880
is best at climbing

66
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,640
and secretly wounding others with its thorns.

67
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,000
What do you mean by that?

68
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,920
Every flower

69
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,800
is most beautiful

70
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,060
when it blooms freely.

71
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,440
So there's no need to restrain yourself

72
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,300
for someone else's preferences.

73
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,800
In my humble opinion,

74
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Your Highness only needs to show

75
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,160
It seems I should plan an alternative strategy.

76
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,420
your most beautiful side to His Majesty.

77
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,880
Your Highness,

78
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,280
I still don't understand

79
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,370
why you're helping Consort Yushu.

80
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,440
If you were to host the flower viewing ceremony,

81
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,370
wouldn't you gain His Majesty's favor more quickly?

82
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,320
A tree that stands out will be broken by the wind.

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,380
His Majesty is suspicious by nature.

84
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,800
If

85
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm too aggressive,

86
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,200
it might backfire.

87
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,520
Besides, my goal

88
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,960
was never about the power struggles within palace walls,

89
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,290
but to uncover who truly killed my father.

90
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,880
If the flower viewing ceremony goes well,

91
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,280
and Jiya obtains the authority to manage the six palaces,

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,159
it will be easier for me to secretly investigate

93
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:46,090
the whereabouts of the remaining two jade pendants.

94
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,440
Xianglian,

95
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,440
I want to walk alone for a while.

96
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,159
You go back

97
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,080
and prepare the things I asked for.

98
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,760
Yes.

99
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,840
If not him,

100
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,200
then who else could it be?

101
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,730
What a coincidence,

102
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,940
meeting the beautiful Lan again.

103
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,410
Greetings, Your Highness.

104
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,460
Don't you have anything to explain to me?

105
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,360
What do you mean, Your Highness?

106
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,340
Your Highness, please don't.

107
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,780
Men and women should maintain proper distance.

108
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,760
This is my jade pendant.

109
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,520
Why is it in your possession?

110
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,800
I found it in the Imperial Garden that day.

111
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,530
So it belongs to Your Highness.

112
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,720
Two days ago.

113
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,880
Did you see me?

114
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,600
Of course I did.

115
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,040
Have you forgotten?

116
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,700
We met by chance in the Imperial Garden that day.

117
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,090
I'm referring to that hour specifically.

118
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,300
Your Highness.

119
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
At that hour.

120
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,280
I was with His Majesty.

121
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,840
Why are you two here together?

122
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,200
Your Majesty.

123
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,780
Royal Brother.

124
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,920
I was attacked and lost consciousness in the Imperial Garden last night.

125
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,159
Lady Lan happened to find my jade pendant.

126
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,360
I came to ask about it.

127
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Attacked?

128
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,800
Could the assassin from that day

129
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,060
still be in the palace?

130
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,040
Your servant pays respects to Your Majesty.

131
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,500
Greetings to Prince Huai.

132
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,210
By the way, Brother.

133
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,360
Fortunately, Imperial Physician Qin was passing through the Imperial Garden last night.

134
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,280
He saved me when I was unconscious.

135
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,480
If Physician Qin hadn't come by in time,

136
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,900
I might have died in the Imperial Garden.

137
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,880
No need for thanks, Your Highness.

138
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,160
It's my duty.

139
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,680
Has Your Highness fully recovered?

140
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
I have recovered.

141
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,540
He's unconscious now.

142
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,440
The effect will last for three hours.

143
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
I'll place him in the Imperial Garden.

144
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,000
There will be no trace left.

145
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,850
But if he asks about you.

146
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,050
Don't worry.

147
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,880
I have a plan.

148
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,600
Then why is Lady Lan here as well?

149
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,360
Your Majesty.

150
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,080
I was admiring flowers in the Imperial Garden with Consort Yushu.

151
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,200
When the wind started to blow,

152
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,480
I feared catching a cold again.

153
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,200
So I took a shortcut back to the palace.

154
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,440
I didn't expect to run into Prince Huai here.

155
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,700
You should be careful.

156
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,240
I was concerned about your illness.

157
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,570
I intended to visit you.

158
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,840
But now I see

159
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,880
you're much better.

160
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,720
Your Majesty, I...

161
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,610
Seventh Brother, your injuries haven't healed.

162
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,680
You should return to your residence.

163
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,600
I will send someone

164
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,330
with tonics to your residence.

165
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,130
When you're ill,

166
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,840
don't wander around.

167
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
I shall take my leave, Your Majesty.

168
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,320
Your Majesty.

169
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,000
The Chancellor has urgent matters to report.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,800
Dr. Qin,

171
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,100
please take good care of Lady Lan.

172
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,240
Yes, sir.

173
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
I was wounded by an assassin.

174
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,880
