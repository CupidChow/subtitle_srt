00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,840
Mr. Lu.

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,959
The price for your meal is

22
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,080
3,880 yuan.

23
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,360
Cantaloupe bacon roll

24
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,759
costs 80 yuan.

25
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,960
Pan-fried salmon

26
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,639
is 200 yuan.

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,639
Australian lobster is 600 yuan.

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,759
With the service charge, it’s totally

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,400
1,000 yuan.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,879
About the

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,439
extra 2,000 yuan,

32
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,120
it’s charged for the dessert soufflé.

33
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,080
I made it by myself.

34
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,199
I kneaded the dough

35
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,719
and whisked the eggs all by myself.

36
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,439
The materials are in fact not that expensive.

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,080
What deserves is

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
the kindly feelings of a young charming girl.

39
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,479
I’ll eat.

40
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,479
Is it really unworthy?

41
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,919
What?

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,639
What is it?

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,159
What I mean is that

44
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,719
the desert

45
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,120
is really unworthy of 2,000 yuan?

46
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,919
No. It’s worth it.

47
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,919
Then will you try some more?

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,719
OK.

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,240
Thank you, sir. 5,000 yuan, please.

50
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,840
Enjoy your meal!

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,319
It should be 4,000. Why is it 5,000 now?

52
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,039
The clothes cost money!

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,719
The bangs cost money.

54
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,479
I’ve been in the Quan’an SS Couture for you.

55
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,360
Doesn’t it look nice?

56
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,800
It’s nice.

57
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,759
Then hurry. Just return after finishing eating.

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,920
OK.

59
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,279
It probably won’t be yummy since it is cold.

60
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,600
See you next time.

61
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,040
It’s a trap.

62
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
Absolutely a trap!

63
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,600
The little girl wants to seduce you with charm

64
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,360
so as to cheat you out of your money.

65
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,720
It’s impossible. I...

66
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,240
I will never be seduced.

67
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,279
No!

68
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,040
She could never be seductive to me.

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,399
Right. It’s impossible.

70
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,439
I won’t...

71
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,480
Well, I get it. I see, Boss.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,279
Wines and beauties are parts of human nature.

73
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,199
Don’t underestimate the power of love.

74
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,720
No, you don’t understand what I mean.

75
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,240
I understand it.

76
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,120
Listen,

77
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,360
particularly in the couple with big age gap,

78
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,879
the man will generally be controlled

79
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,040
by the young lady.

80
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,800
It’s terrible.

81
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,279
What do you mean?

82
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,360
I mean you are quite passive right now.

83
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
You should make a change.

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,120
How?

85
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,480
Come.

86
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,000
It’s dangerous.

87
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,360
It’s not.

88
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Boss, listen to me,

89
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,160
you don’t think I am good at doing other things.

90
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,839
OK.

91
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,360
But about managing the ladies,

92
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,240
you can ask anybody else.

93
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,439
Almost every lady in the city

94
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,279
knows me, Meng Xinjie.

95
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,360
You are not better than me in this aspect.

96
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,600
You are rich,

97
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,480
but it’s useless.

98
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,600
Money doesn’t help. Or just by staring at me.

99
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,240
Don’t stare at me.

100
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,600
You know?

101
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,000
We can compete if you refuse to obey.

102
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Say that again!

103
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,720
Yeah, it did stretch the truth.

104
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
But that’s not what I really meant.

105
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,279
Please don’t take it to heart.

106
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,240
Repeat it.

107
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,639
We can compete if you refuse to obey.

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,160
The previous state.

109
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,199
You, you... Don’t stare at me.

110
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,519
We can compete if you refuse to obey.

111
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,600
Your state.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,480
You... Don’t stare at me.

113
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
We can compete if you refuse to obey.

114
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,680
That’s it.

115
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,240
Keep it. Repeat it for 1,000 times.

116
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,519
No. No. Please don’t.

117
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,879
Never sleep if you can’t finish.

118
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,800
Then I will affect your sleep.

119
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,879
Don’t stare at me.

120
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,279
We can compete if you refuse to obey.

121
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,240
One.

122
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,639
Don’t stare at me.

123
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,920
We can compete if you refuse to obey.

124
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,160
Two.

125
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,879
Don’t stare at me.

126
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,240
We can compete if you refuse to obey.

127
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,959
Three.

128
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,160
Three.

129
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,720
Don’t stare at me.

130
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,079
We can compete if you refuse to obey.

131
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:04,920
Don’t laugh.

132
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,759
Don’t stare at me.

133
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,920
We can compete if you refuse to obey.

134
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,480
Four.

135
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,240
Don’t stare at me.

136
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,120
We can compete if you refuse to obey.

137
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,600
967.

138
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,120
Don’t stare at me.

139
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,639
We can compete if you refuse to obey.

140
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,759
968.

141
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,860
The flowers...

142
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:38,040
- Are for you...
- How do you know I need roses?

143
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,399
You are so nice.

144
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,439
I guessed...

145
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,040
It’s very fresh.

146
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,240
Just wait.

147
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,240
OK.

148
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,120
If you failed in giving her the flowers,

149
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,759
use plan B.

150
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,480
Remember,

151
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,720
it must be the setting sun at 5 p.m.

152
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,960
For a man reading in the sunset,

153
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,159
it must be of a 90° angle

154
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,360
between the face and the setting sun.

155
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,399
In this case, it will look like he was

156
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,600
cast a gold glow by the setting sun.

157
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,360
Nobody can avoid the charm.

158
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,919
Fussy Lu. You know what?

159
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,120
The roses you bought are really...

160
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,519
No admittance. Chef only.

161
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,799
Can you just stay out of here?

162
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,120
Though I’m not the chef,

163
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,360
I’m your distinguished guest.

164
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,360
A guest should wait out there.

165
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,039
Why are you standing here?

166
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,159
You look crazy.

167
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,600
I’m afraid somebody has evil designs

168
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,799
and is trying to poison me.

169
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,879
So I come here for supervising.

170
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,480
Is it a good reason?

171
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,320
Trying to poison you?

172
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,240
Right.

173
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,720
Trying to poison me.

174
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,279
Challenge me?

175
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,000
Surprise?

176
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,840
Drink slowly.

177
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,360
It’s been a while.

178
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,159
Meng Xinjie.

179
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,279
Um.

180
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,240
I heard that you could speak Finnish

181
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,200
when we had dinner together last time.

182
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,440
What a coincidence!

183
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,600
We just have a client from Finland.

184
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,039
It seems like a tourism company.

185
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,840
They are promoting high-end tours in Suhai.

186
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,799
No colleague dares to accept it.

187
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,480
So difficult.

188
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,000
It’s hard to get an interpreter of the language.

189
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,279
But later I remembered that

190
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,240
you can speak Finnish.

191
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,720
So I just accepted it.

192
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,600
I even made a pledge to the Director

193
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
that I will reach the cooperation.

194
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,720
So

195
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,759
I’m here asking you for help.

196
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,600
Be the interpreter for me.

197
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,720
How do you think?

198
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,200
Well. Fine. I admit

199
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,720
that I’m proven wrong.

200
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,519
I said the words during the last dinner

201
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,759
completely because

202
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,279
I was afraid you would waste money on me.

203
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,759
So,

204
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,639
if my words

205
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,000
hurt you,

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,840
I’m here apologizing to you sincerely.

207
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,480
Why don’t you say something?

208
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,240
Meng Xinjie.

209
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,720
As a lady, I’m making an apology to you here.

210
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:06,600
As a gentleman,

211
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,279
how can you put on airs like this?

212
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,919
Fine. Fine.

213
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,440
I get it now.

214
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,279
Right.

215
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,240
You wanted to date me but failed,

216
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,960
so you are taking revenge on me, right?

217
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,840
OK.

218
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,519
Just name your price.

219
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,000
I can pay for your interpretation.

220
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,159
I lost my voice.

221
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
You were fine when I contacted you last time, right?

222
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,759
You were so talkative.

223
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,000
It’s just because I talked too much.

224
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,279
You talked too much?

225
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,799
How can I trust you?

226
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,519
You can just tell me if you can’t speak Finnish.

227
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,679
How can you cheat me with this kind of tricks?

228
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,159
You talked too much?

229
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,039
Can talking change you into a dummy?

230
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Why didn’t you say

231
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,480
that disco dancing lames you?

232
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,919
You can tell me. I can speak...

233
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,279
Silver pout with rose fluid.

234
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,240
Fussy Lu.

235
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,480
The roses you bought are really fresh.

236
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,679
I don’t like the name Fussy Lu.

237
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,039
Maybe another.

238
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,159
Another?

239
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,720
Brother Jin.

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,440
It sounds too genial.

241
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,240
But I can settle for it.

242
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,960
Brother Jin.

243
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,360
Shameless.

244
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,639
Jin...

245
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,519
Silver pout with rose fluid.

246
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:39,720
600 yuan.

247
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,200
Roast mushroom in olive oil with hot spring eggs.

248
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,159
300 yuan.

249
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,240
And another one is fresh...

250
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,279
Try some.

251
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,360
I’m not interested in the things girls love.

252
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,600
I made it myself.

253
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,200
In that case,

254
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,000
I will eat it myself.

255
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,679
It’s naturally sweet and sour.

256
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,480
Great.

257
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,919
Since you’ve made it,

258
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,279
I can’t put your efforts in vain.

259
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,480
Let me try one.

260
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,759
How do you think?

261
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
The sugar surface is too tough.

262
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,480
The haws are too sour. It’s very general.

263
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,759
What?

264
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,480
Come.

265
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,519
What?

266
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,519
It’s some sugar at the corner of your mouth.

267
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,759
The other side.

268
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,039
Let me help you.

269
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,960
I mean you are

270
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,720
quite passive right now.

271
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,039
You should make a change.

272
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,480
Hold on.

273
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,160
Don’t move.

274
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,920
There is some sugar on your hair too.

275
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,440
My hair?

276
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,960
Don’t move. You can’t see it.

277
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,720
You may make it worse.

278
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,039
Don’t move.

279
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,680
Maybe you were too careless when you made it.

280
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:14,759
There is still some.

281
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,440
I... I have to go wash the dishes.

282
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,160
I haven’t practiced for a long time.

283
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,680
Now I’m a bit unfamiliar with it.

284
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,160
It is great.

285
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,279
600 for the meals. 2,000 for the performance.

286
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,160
No problem.

287
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:44,920
I’m signing it now.

288
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,279
Sorry, I forgot my pen.

289
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:47,960
Do you have one?

290
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,240
Yes. I do have some.

291
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,200
I have pens.

292
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,079
Please wait.

293
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,480
Just take your time.

294
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,079
Please wait for a while.

295
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:00,799
No hurry.

296
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:05,759
Don’t...

297
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,720
I will wait for you.

298
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,680
Let me help you.

299
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,480
That one. The one above.

300
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,359
The one above?

301
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,319
OK.

302
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,359
The pink one or the colorful one?

303
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,319
The pink.

304
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,519
Or the colorful bag beside it?

305
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,559
I’m asking you.

306
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,359
The pink one?

307
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,480
That one. The above one.

308
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,400
Which one?

309
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,359
I still haven’t signed the bill.

310
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,920
Maybe next time.

Thank you.

315
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,000
Did you add it up wrong?

316
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,440
Will you check it again?

317
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,160
It’s wrong?

318
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:13,799
Seems I really made a mistake.

319
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,359
One dish more.

320
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,279
How to do with it?

321
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,160
Generally, people in the restaurant

322
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,440
will serve for free.

323
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,359
Free?

324
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,599
OK. You are the boss.

325
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,240
Thank you.

326
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,599
The dishes were delicious.

327
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,200
Thank you.

328
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:42,440
See you tomorrow.

Roast... In olive oil.

330
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,920
Oh. Excuse me. I’m sorry.

331
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,680
Sorry.

332
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,559
It’s OK.

333
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,799
How could it be OK?

361
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,480
I’m fine.

362
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,279
How about the “scam”?

363
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,440
It goes well.

364
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,759
How much the rest debt is?

365
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,000
No idea.

366
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,960
All right. I have to hang up now.

367
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,079
I’m cracking the nuts.

368
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,440
Cracking the nuts? Hold on.

369
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,680
Why are you doing that?

370
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,519
I’d like to make some caramel nuts for Lu Jin.

371
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,039
He’s been working very hard recently.

372
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,680
A lot to do.

373
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,480
Gotta go. Bye-bye.

374
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,559
For the brain?

375
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:49,759
Boss.

376
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,759
What is it?

377
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,680
You asked me to try the neckerchief for it.

378
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,920
Does it look good?

379
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,119
Yeah.

380
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:00,880
Really?

381
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,920
Go, go, go.

382
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,039
Then I will continue.

383
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,079
Thank you, Boss.

384
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,279
She just scared me.

385
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,680
= Chengdeli No. 10 =

386
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,599
Where are you going?

387
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,920
Taking out the garbage.

388
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,240
I’ll go with you.

389
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,160
No, I can do it myself.

390
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,079
Why isn’t the light working?

391
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,680
It hasn’t worked for days.

392
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,440
I’m out now.

393
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,279
Don’t.

394
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,079
What to do if you fall over?

395
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,000
I’m going with you.

396
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,079
Half for you.

397
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,319
Let’s go.

398
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,359
Look.

399
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,559
What did I say?

400
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,039
It was because of you, Fussy Lu.

401
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,680
You stepped on the heelpiece of my slipper.

402
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,359
Can you change a name?

403
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,920
Would you not call me Fussy Lu?

404
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,039
Brother Jin.

405
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,480
You... Hmm?

406
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,599
What do you mean?

407
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,680
It means hmm.

408
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:17,759
Then you

409
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:20,440
meant the same

410
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:22,200
with hmm and hmm?

411
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:24,680
Hmm.

412
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:30,440
Then will we take out the garbage now?

413
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:52,340
= Li Man =

414
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,039
I’m coming to the door.

415
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,279
I’m coming to the...

416
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,400
Mr. Lu.

417
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,599
It really is a low price.

418
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,880
So we held a board meeting

419
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,960
to discuss about it.

420
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,319
We also analyzed your past acquisition cases.

421
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,079
We found something interesting.

422
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,759
Zhenghong Group has been always decisive

423
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:06,759
and carried out things resolutely.

424
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,400
No due diligence has lasted for over five days.

425
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,680
But Mr. Lu, you’ve made the survey

426
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,960
for so long here.

427
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,640
It’s enough to prove

428
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,519
you are sincere.

429
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,759
So?

430
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,200
So we decide to

431
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,759
sell the hotel with the favorable price.

432
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,319
I didn’t fully understand

433
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,759
what you discussed about

434
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:29,960
in your board of directors.

435
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,680
Anyway, you’ve made a wise decision.

436
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,079
In that case,

437
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,880
that’s settled.

438
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,559
Let’s sign the contract as soon as possible.

439
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,720
One more thing,

440
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,119
about the payment,

441
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,640
how about making it in our way, in US dollars?

442
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,839
Why in US dollars?

443
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,960
We always settle accounts with US dollars.

444
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,839
The exchange rate doesn’t matter. It’s up to you.

445
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,759
How about at the rate on tomorrow?

446
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:53,839
Alright.

447
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,359
Then do you have some time later?

448
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,759
Would you mind drinking with me?

449
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,920
No, thanks.

450
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,200
I don’t drink too much.

451
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,119
Let’s replace alcohol with coffee.

452
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,440
Wish a smooth cooperation.

453
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,680
OK.

454
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,680
Well.

455
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,519
Please allow me to leave.

456
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,279
Glad to cooperate with you.

457
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,160
OK.

458
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,400
See you.

459
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,839
Goodbye.

460
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,240
When did we settle accounts in US dollars?

461
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,160
Tomorrow’s exchange rate is good for us.

462
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,559
Cool.

463
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,200
By the way,

464
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,559
Miss Li wanted me to ask you

465
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,920
when you will return to Switzerland.

466
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,200
We will see.

467
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,759
I have no intention of that recently.

468
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Well, I’m answering her in that way.

469
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,720
OK.

470
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,680
OK.

471
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:48,759
Uh...

472
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,759
How are you doing with Miss Gu?

473
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,240
Who gets the run upon?

474
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,079
She, of course.

475
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,359
Me. Me.

476
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,440
Well. Enough.

477
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,640
No, it’s me.

478
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,839
OK. Tell me some details.

479
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,759
Meng Xinjie, do you think

480
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,880
you really have too much time?

481
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,519
I didn’t arrange enough work?

482
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,480
I have a lot to do.

483
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,599
What have you done?

484
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,079
I have so much work to do.

485
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,000
How about doing some for me?

486
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,119
No, I am...

487
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,519
The hotels...

488
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:30,680
How many hotels?

489
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,599
How about ten more?

490
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,200
No, thanks. That’s enough for me.

491
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,519
I will make some investigations.

492
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:34,920
Come back.

493
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,039
Don’t.

494
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,720
Wish you and Miss Gu

495
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,240
conjugal bliss,

496
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,519
human with a sword.

497
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,599
What?

498
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,359
I’m back soon.

499
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,799
If you are hungry,

500
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,440
there are some fruits for you in the freezer.

501
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,680
You may have some.

502
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:00,839
Hello.

503
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:01,519
Hello.

504
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,279
Is that Miss Gu Shengnan?

505
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,319
Yes. What’s the matter?

506
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,559
I’m the HR manager of Yunhao Hotel.

507
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,079
We got your resume recently.

508
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,680
Our chef is satisfied with you.

509
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,839
Really?

510
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,559
Yes.

511
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,359
Do you have some time to come this afternoon?

512
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,400
This afternoon?

513
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,119
Yes.

514
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,039
I’m afraid not.

515
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,319
I have to cook this afternoon.

516
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,319
Cook?

517
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,200
Miss Gu.

518
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,359
Did you get the offer from others?

519
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,640
No, I just have to...

520
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,759
Anyway, I just can’t do it recently.

521
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,720
Let’s talk about it later. Sorry.

522
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,759
No way.

523
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,039
There should be a soup.

524
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,680
Sir, do you have some matsutake?

525
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:09,880
Package for Zhao Min.

526
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,680
Please sign on it.

527
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,359
Who?

528
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,839
Zhao Min?

529
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:15,279
Yeah. Chengdeli 302. Zhao Min.

530
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:21,640
She’s out for food materials.

531
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,119
It’s OK. Family can sign for her.

532
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:23,720
Please hurry.

533
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,279
I also have packages for others.

534
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,039
OK. Thanks.

535
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,119
Zhao Min.

536
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,079
Hello.

537
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,440
Chengdeli 302. Zhang Wuji.

538
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,200
Sign on it.

00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,519
Yeah.

541
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,519
Sorry. No Zhang Wuji here.

542
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,960
Excuse me. It’s mine.

543
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,400

Can’t I, Zhao Min?

548

Zhao Min?

549
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,519

There isn’t one in my version.

Did you do that?

578
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,880
Are you stupid?

Are you out of mind for being too rich?

Crystal lamp for the corridor?

How many bulbs does it have?

582
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:16,920
One, two, three, four, five.

583
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Ten.

584
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,039

585
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,519

587

Wait. Wait.

588
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:05,199
We are very looking forward to this cooperation.

589
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,320
Can’t your company afford

590
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,239
a Finnish interpreter?

591
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,719
In this case,

592
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,719
we’d better change another partner.

593
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,000
Can’t your company afford

594
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,920
a Finnish interpreter?

595
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,679
In this case,

596
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,039
we’d better change another partner.

597
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,239
No, no, no.

598
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,679
Don’t go.

599
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,360
Wait. Wait.

600
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,639
Let’s call it a day.

601
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,559
Excuse me.

602
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,519
I’m late.

603
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,760
I’m the interpreter.

604
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,239
Luckily, you are coming.

605
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,199
Otherwise,

606
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,239
we will lose a one-million-euro order.

607
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,559
What did he say?

608
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,639
He said you almost lost

609
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,320
a one-million-euro order.

610
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,199
I haven’t spoken Finnish for a long time.

611
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,519
My mouth is uncomfortable now.

612
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:18,719
Finally they left.

613
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:25,159
I can’t believe you really can speak Finnish.

614
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,840
I thought

615
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,440
you just use it to chase after the girls.

616
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,440
That’s what you thought?

617
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,000
I’ve learnt it for four years in college.

618
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,519
You know?

619
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,360
I always think I am a bird.

620
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,519
When I speak too much Finnish,

621
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:40,360
I can’t get my tongue straight.

622
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,920
Making money is not easy for everyone.

623
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,920
As a supervisor in a 4A company,

624
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,320
I can only get the project by making a pledge.

625
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,440
I didn’t expect that the Norsemen

626
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
are so picky and indifferent.

627
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,639
If you didn’t come today,

628
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,000
that will fail.

629
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,800
Perhaps now I am being blamed by the director.

630
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,679
No.

631
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:05,800
I will also study a minor language too.

632
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,239
It’s unnecessary.

633
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,239
In my opinion,

634
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,360
since the foreigners want to come to China

635
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,599
and earn money from China,

636
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,559
they have to learn how to speak Chinese.

637
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,440
Am I right?

638
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,679
Why must we learn English?

639
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,239
It’s improper and unfair.

640
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,239
So my boss never spoils them.

641
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:22,719
He requests

642
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,440
that supervisors of all overseas branches

643
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,880
must speak Chinese.

644
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:30,360
How did you know Mr. Lu?

645
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
We are…

646
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,159
We are childhood friends.

647
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,360
He’s several years elder than me.

648
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,360
He always took me out for fun when we were young.

649
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,239
Later, when we were in high school,

650
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,800
his mother took him abroad.

651
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,280
We haven’t seen each other for years.

652
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,360
He’s always been overseas.

653
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,880
Then after he returned,

654
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,559
he called me in the first place

655
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,519
and asked me

656
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:51,360
if I’m willing to work for him.

657
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,320
I have thought of it.

658
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,800
I was always working for others,

659
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,360
right?

660
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,800
He’s my friend. So I can work for him too.

661
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,039
Also I can give him some advice sometimes.

662
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,000
So I said it’s okay

663
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,800
and I agreed.

664
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,440
Do you have some time tonight?

665
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,639
Sure.

666
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,840
You helped me to get the order,

667
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,079
so I’d have dinner with you to thank you.

668
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,920
Thank you so much for that.

669
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,800
See you tonight.

670
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:17,639
OK. Let’s go.

671
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:18,480
OK.

You may go first.

675
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:25,920
OK.

676
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,239
Hello. Miss Li.

677
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,199
What’s the name of the woman

678
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,360
with Mr. Lu?

679
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,719

680
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,119

00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,679
You are back…

682
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,519
Why is it you?

683
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,800
I got a big project recently.

684
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:00,840
So you are here to show off?

685
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,199
Not show off. I need your help.

686
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,639
I need a model.

687
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,440
Me? A model?

688
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:04,880
Yeah.

689
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,440
It might be a bit depreciative.

690
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Don’t worry.

691
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,519
It’s dress

692
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:09,440
for a prom for junior middle school students.

693
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,679
You are the best choice.

694
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,519

695
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:13,880
I really don’t have any time.

696
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,599
I just need to take your measure.

697
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,639
I am cooking for Lu Jin.

698
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,559

702
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,159
Get up. Come on.

703
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:26,760
What is it?

704
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,880
Get out of here.

705
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,960
Don’t sit on Lu Jin’s blanket.

706
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,719
