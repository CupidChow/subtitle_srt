I want to go to the toilet.

Toilet?

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,120
It’s out there.

00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,000
Out there?

00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,790
Thank you.

27
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,950
Excuse me.

May I meet her?

Female chef?

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,800
Yes.

32
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,000
There’s no female chef.

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,870
Go. Go to the toilet.

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,800
Thanks, anyway.

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,840
This is the cost of support

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,150
I give you on behalf of my father.

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
I don’t give it for no reason.

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,470
Never say you have no children anymore.

39
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,150
My father is your son. I am your granddaughter.

40
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,030
Did you see my...

41
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,750
Don’t touch it!

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,030
All right. All right.

43
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,280
Where’s the S-shaped pumpkin?

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,400
I put it in another box.

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,310
Don’t touch it.

46
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,630
But it’s just a spoon.

47
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,400
Is it a western antique?

48
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,030
You don’t understand. It’s a glass slipper.

49
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,400
From which Cinderella?

50
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,120
None of your business.

51
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,120
Oh, Gu’s Special Sauce.

52
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,560
You know what?

53
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,360
You’ve lost your job.

54
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,310
And you owe a debt.

55
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,560
But it’s okay.

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,190
I’ll make you a new coat

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,840
and a new hat.

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,840
Let’s start over again.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,960
Wait for me.

60
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,120
I... I have something to tell you.

61
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
I don’t want any explanation.

62
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
I’m not coming to explain.

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,000
I don’t accept apologies, either.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
I’m not coming to apologize, either.

65
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,360
Where’s my weapon?

66
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,910
All right. All right.

67
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,000
Even if you don’t help me,

68
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,870
try to help the whole kitchen.

69
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,800
Almost all chefs will be fired.

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,390
What happened?

71
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,750
The guest in Room 1123 ordered something again.

72
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,120
Who do you mean?

73
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,000
He is...

74
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,480
How shall I explain?

75
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,360
Uh...

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,870
He’s a man who accidentally tried

77
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,800
your Finger-licking Fried Rice.

78
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,750
You can be full by playing with your phone?

79
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,750
I just had the buffet downstairs.

80
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,270
If you think

81
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,360
you can accept such coarse food,

82
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,510
I’ll go pack some for you.

83
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,680
How arrogant you sound!

84
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,270
You described the breakfast in a five-star-hotel

85
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,240
as coarse food.

86
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,160
Maybe I’ve improved my taste

87
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,800
when working for you in recent years.

88
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,720
Why haven’t my dishes come yet?

89
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,480
I’m starving.

90
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,360
I’ll go hurry them up.

91
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,310
Sit down!

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,120
Be patient.

93
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,510
You can’t let them realize

94
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,120
I love their dishes.

95
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,040
Yes. Yes.

96
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,360
But let me remind you.

97
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,120
Yesterday,

98
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,360
you ate up all the fried rice.

99
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,360
Remember to be

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,240
a bit more elegant.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,160
That was an accident.

102
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,040
Okay.

103
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,630
This is the baked salmon with cheese
made by the chef

104
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,190
who made Finger-licking Fried Rice yesterday.

105
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,270
Don’t forget to be elegant.

106
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,680
Manager Shen.

107
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,390
There’s a building over there.

108
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,310
Doesn’t its color affect the guests

109
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,870
when they rest or sleep?

110
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,800
Why don’t you make some changes?

111
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,040
Have a new color.

112
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,920
Mr. Lu.

113
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,120
That’s a government building.

114
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,040
No wonder it looks so dignified.

115
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,160
Take the dish away.

= F&B Manager =

117
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,510
Have some more.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,390
The more you eat,

119
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,000
the happier I’ll feel.

120
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,040
Who is it?

121
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,390
Manager Shen, I’ve got something to talk to you.

122
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,870
Shengnan.

123
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,000
We have

124
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,240
hired you again, right?

125
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,240
What else do you want?

126
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,360
I want a negotiation.

127
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,360
Shengnan.

128
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,070
Look at you.

129
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,510
You’re a mere employee.

130
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,120
Why do you think

131
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,750
you can have a negotiation with me?

132
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,560
I was a mere employee.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But now,

134
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,000
I’m a mere employee

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,870
who can satisfy the guest in Room 1123

136
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,390
while no one else can.

137
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,630
Do you think I can negotiate with you?

138
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,800
Young guy.

139
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,240
You can’t show off

140
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
just because you’ve made

141
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,240
some small contributions.

142
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
I see.

143
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,120
I understand that.

144
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,510
But young guys like me

145
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,360
enjoy showing off as long as we can.

146
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,480
You’re showing off already.

147
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,360
What the hell do you want?

148
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,390
A promotion and a pay rise.

149
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,150
No way.

150
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,120
Fine.

151
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,910
Where are you going?

152
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,000
Go back home and sleep.

153
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,910
Don’t... don’t you even work?

154
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,240
The hotel will be acquired, anyway.

155
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,550
I’ll go back home earlier

156
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,150
and move less.

157
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,750
Then I’ll live longer.

158
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,390
I wondered why you were so arrogant.

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,270
So, you knew everything.

160
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,030
I hear that

161
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,790
chances are as few

162
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,150
as good men.

163
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,870
When I meet one, I must seize it.

164
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,320
I’m asking you for the last time.

165
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,630
I want a promotion and a pay rise.

166
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Can I have them?

167
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,790
Yes.

168
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,840
Well, I know how far I can go.

169
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,790
I don’t want too much.

170
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,390
I don’t dream to be a head chef.

171
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,150
Just give me a title as the official chef.

172
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,120
I don’t want a higher salary.

173
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,910
Just pay me the same as other chefs.

174
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,240
If you have a partiality for me,

175
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,550
just give me some more bonuses.

176
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,630
What are you thinking about? Partiality?

177
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,480
I...

178
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,870
Since you know everything,

179
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,270
let me be frank.

180
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,150
Now we are

181
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,870
making use of each other.

182
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,670
No personal feelings are involved.

183
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,720
That’s the best!

184
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,240
I like such a pure working relationship.

185
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,480
Wish us a happy cooperation.

186
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,510
Why must I shake hands with you?

187
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,270
Satisfied?

188
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,240
If you are, leave.

189
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,670
Or people will gossip about us.

190
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,550
Fine.

191
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,790
Shall I close the door?

192
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,550
Leave!

193
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,480
Okay.

194
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,840
Shengnan?

195
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,910
No one else is in. Come in.

196
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,600
Oh, dear.

197
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,550
You look so cool.

198
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,670
Shall I call you

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,790
Miss Gu?

200
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,000
Don’t ask.

201
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,270
Call me right now.

202
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,360
Come on. Do it.

203
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,240
When we started to work, we had a pinky swear.

204
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,550
Whoever is rich will take care of the other one.

205
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,200
Yes.

206
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,960
But it depends on how you behave.

207
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,510
Miss Gu!

208
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Eggs Benedict. Australian four-rib lamb chop.

209
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,600
Boston lobster.

210
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,360
French onion soup with cheese bread.

211
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,000
Trumpet, lobster with...

212
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,440
Mr. Yu.

213
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,000
Please make these dishes.

214
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,960
Okay.

215
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,910
Come on. Prepare the side dishes.

216
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,270
Shengnan.

217
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,550
From now on,

218
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,360
you’ll just make dishes

219
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,670
for the guest in Room 1123.

220
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,150
But the guest doesn’t

221
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,720
order too many dishes a day.

222
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,200
When he doesn’t order dishes,

223
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,150
wait and have some rest.

224
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,910
If you feel tired, lie down.

225
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
But remember.

226
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,630
Once he orders anything,

227
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,720
cook for him at any time.

228
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,000
Even if you’re sleeping at home

229
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,360
in the evening,

230
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,270
you must come back.

231
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,750
No problem.

232
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,480
I can always be ready

233
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,360
for the guest in Room 1123.

234
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,910
Manager Shen, don’t forget

235
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,480
to get my salary ready.

236
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,750
We’ll talk about it later.

237
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,600
I’m so jealous of you.

238
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,480
You can stand there and get paid.

239
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,550
= Don’t Call Me Bestie =

240
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,630
I hear you got promoted.

241
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Come hurriedly after work.

242
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,480
Party with us!

243
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,030
Let’s get high.

244
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,120
You two refused to lend me any money!

245
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,840
Now you check in a suite to celebrate for me.

246
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,320
Who gets rich?

247
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,360
We celebrate for you

248
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,840
and you’ll pay for the party.

249
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,600
Sure.

250
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,840
Me?

251
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,550
The wine...

252
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
The wine...

253
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,080
I brought it.

254
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,870
Wait.

255
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
First, I haven’t collected enough money

256
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,670
to pay for the Ferrari.

257
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,600
So, I can’t pay for the suite.

258
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,120
Second, if you really want to

259
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,600
celebrate for me,

260
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,550
I can take you to have a barbecue.

261
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,870
Enjoy yourselves there. Go.

262
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,960
- Gu Shengnan! - Gu Shengnan!

263
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,080
Stand right there.

264
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,840
Yeah.

265
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,030
Shengnan.

266
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,320
You’re now an official chef.

267
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Chef.

268
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,080
Barbecue and beer

269
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,750
will be beneath your dignity.

270
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,750
I don’t think so.

271
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,120
Don’t be stubborn.

272
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,030
How stingy you are!

273
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,550
This is an executive suite.

274
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,750
Do you think it’s an hourly rate room

275
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,790
and we can check out as we wish?

276
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,790
No matter if you sleep here or not,

277
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,550
you must pay for the whole night.

278
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,630
But I don’t have enough money

279
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,000
for even one night.

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,870
How much do you have then?

281
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,270
One third?

282
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,600
Good.

283
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,120
Let’s go Dutch.

284
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,240
The wine is almost finished.

285
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,200
Would you like to have a bath, too?

286
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,120
This suite costs so much.

287
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,870
We should make full use of it.

288
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,840
What... what are you doing?

289
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,600
Enjoying the wine. Come on.

290
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,150
Come on.

291
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,510
Where did you get so many bottles of wine?

292
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,320
From the bar counter.

293
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,550
Silly girl.

294
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,790
What’s wrong with you?

295
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,120
Don’t you know how expensive they are?

296
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,030
Put them down!

297
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,030
- It’s open. - It’s open.

298
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,080
Well...

299
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,440
Let’s open another bottle.

300
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,790
Come on. Let’s celebrate.

301
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,840
Let’s propose a toast

302
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,840
to Shengnan.

303
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,870
Cheers.

304
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,030
It tastes so hot.

305
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,120
Let’s get high.

306
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,580
= Are you or are you not satisfied
with the sound insulation effect? =

307
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,840
Bad guys.

308
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,080
You’re bad guys.

309
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,120
Bad guys. Bad guys.

310
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,750
You used to order me around.

311
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,270
When you need me, you bring me back.

312
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,320
When you don’t, you kick me away.

313
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,030
Who do you think I am?

314
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,870
A yo-yo?

315
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,120
Yes. I’m a yo-yo.

316
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,320
Yes, you are.

317
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,750
Or why did you come back

318
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,750
immediately after the F&B Department asked you?

319
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,550
You’re willing to be a busgirl.

320
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,600
Yeah.

321
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,440
But luckily, you’re finally smart this time.

322
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,440
At least,

323
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,320
you know how to get profits for yourself.

324
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,360
If so,

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,910
we should be grateful to

326
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,600
the fire accident.

327
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,390
Yes. Yes.

328
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,360
Otherwise, servile as you are, Shengnan,

329
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
you’ll still suffer.

330
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:12,840
Yes.

331
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,270
You should be grateful to the alarm

332
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,080
which helps you to realize the reality.

333
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,360
Oh, I got it.

334
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,790
We should be most grateful to

335
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,550
Room 1123.

336
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,550
Room 1123.

337
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,000
It gives us a new life.

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,670
A new life.

339
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,840
Shengnan?

340
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,120
Enjoy the wine, Shengnan.

341
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,960
She’s asleep.

342
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,550
Asleep?

343
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,240
Let’s drink ourselves.

344
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,240
I won’t.

345
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,150
I’ve got a date in the disco.

346
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,910
I gotta go.

347
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,320
I’ll leave Shengnan to you.

348
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,320
Don’t.

349
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,750
I want to leave her to you.

350
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,870
I must get home before twelve o’clock.

351
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,910
Are you Cinderella?

352
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,360
Get home before twelve?

353
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,080
What if you don’t? Your car will be a pumpkin?

354
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,670
No.

355
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,790
If I’m late,

356
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,750
Zenan will lock me out.

357
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,510
Zenan. Zenan?

358
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,510
A roommate like him is so strict with you.

359
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,840
Are you...

360
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,030
Shut up!

361
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
What are you talking about?

362
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,320
Keep quiet.

363
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,310
Okay. I’ll be right there.

364
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,440
Yes. Yes.

365
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,680
One crossing away. I’ll be right there. Okay.

366
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,750
If you leave, what will she do?

367
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,200
What will she do?

368
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,200
Shengnan?

369
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:14,880
Shengnan?

370
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,590
She’s so drunk.

371
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,350
I don’t think she’ll make trouble.

372
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,110
Yes.

373
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,110
But...

374
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,550
If we leave like this,

375
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,310
aren’t we too immoral?

376
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,270
Get my bag for me.

377
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,160
Get my bag for me.

378
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes.

379
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,350
I’m going to Room 1123 to say thank you.

380
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,830
Room 1123!

381
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,240
Thank you for...

382
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,750
Who are you?

383
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,070
Thank you for giving me a new life.

384
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,750
Who are you?

385
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
It’s you?

386
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,510
I remember you.

387
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,030
Get up.

388
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,960
Get up.

389
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,590
Don’t pretend to be drunk.

390
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,980
= Hotel Reception =

391
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,240
Get up.

392
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,200
Get up.

393
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,200
Waiter.

394
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,270
Hello, sir.

395
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,400
Get me a glass of wine.

396
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,270
Okay. Wait.

397
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,790
Sir, you lost your car key.

398
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,750
Thank you.

399
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,350
I’m Richard Meng.

400
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,590
May I have your name?

401
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,030
Celine Xu.

402
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,590
Celine?

403
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,790
That’s a nice name.

404
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,440
May I...

405
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,350
May I buy you a drink?

406
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,350
Sure.

407
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,880
Waiter. Get us some XO.

408
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,790
Two glasses?

409
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,350
One bottle.

410
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,680
Okay.

411
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:49,920
Sir.

412
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,440
This is your room card of Bauhinia Hotel.

413
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,960
Sir.

414
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,920
WeChat or Alipay?

415
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,400
Or Ant Credit Pay?

416
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,780
= Boss =

417
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,830
Sorry, Miss.

418
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,240
I’ve got a call.

419
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,030
Excuse me.

420
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,830
Celine.

421
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,920
Shall we open it?

422
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,750
Put it away.

423
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,590
I’ve seen so many guys like him.

424
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,480
When he comes back, he’ll say

425
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,830
“I’ve got something urgent to do.

426
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,000
Shall we leave each other a contact?”

427
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,070
Then he’ll spend no money

428
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,510
and get my phone number.

429
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,270
Celine, sorry.

430
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,750
I’ve got something urgent to do.

431
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,960
What’s so urgent?

432
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,310
For a morning market?

433
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,270
Not really.

434
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,830
An emergency.

435
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,680
How about this?

436
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,070
Shall we leave each other a contact?

437
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,240
How about having breakfast together

438
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,920
tomorrow morning?

439
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,880
Forget it.

440
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,400
Ladies like us don’t have breakfast.

441
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,240
I gotta go.

442
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,830
Fine.

443
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,200
How did she do that?

444
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,960
Boss, here I am.

445
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,070
Come on.

446
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,920
You’re good, huh?

447
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,160
Awesome.

448
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,200
You get me wrong.

449
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,400
Let’s get out.

450
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,880
You’re good.

451
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,350
This is... this is really unexpected.

452
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,790
Who is this girl?

453
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,720
Do I know her?

454
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,960
The girl who messed up with me.

455
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,440
Oh, I see.

456
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,030
The girl who messed up with my Ferrari.

457
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,960
It’s her?

458
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,680
Yes.

459
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,240
Do I still need to urge her to pay?

460
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,160
What do you mean?

461
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,640
Let me make it clear.

462
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,480
She came to me.

463
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,030
I haven’t done anything.

464
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,310
Yeah, I can see that.

465
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,030
She was drunk and came to me.

466
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,350
She splashed the wine on me.

467
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,200
Then I took my shirt off.

468
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,110
But it’s not what you think it is.

469
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,070
But I just wonder...

470
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,960
I just wonder

471
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,680
how did she get in without the room card.

472
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
That’s what I want to ask you.

473
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,030
Why did she suddenly turn up in my balcony?

474
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,000
She... you...

475
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,640
Why was she in my balcony?

476
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,030
She climbed from the balcony next door?

477
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,830
She certainly did.

478
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
But no way.

479
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,070
She just told me she didn’t have money in the day.

480
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,880
How could she live in a suite?

481
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,960
It’s a suite next door, isn’t it?

482
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,160
How do I know?

483
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,030
I don’t care.

484
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,160
Check carefully

485
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,480
who she really is,

486
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,160
what she does and why she sticks to me.

487
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,720
All right.

488
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,960
I know. I’ll go check it.

489
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,400
Do it tomorrow.

490
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,480
It’s so kind of you. Tomorrow?

491
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,160
I’ll ask her right now.

492
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,880
You’re right.

493
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,960
Uh, what happened?

494
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,960
She’s gone.

495
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,350
The balcony door is open.

496
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,310
Did she...

497
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,960
I think she left

498
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,270
in the way she came.

499
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,480
Did she?

500
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,030
I haven’t done anything.

501
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,480
You saw that.

502
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,590
I...

503
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,200
What?

504
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,350
The guest in Room 1123 is the owner of the Ferrari?

505
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,110
You sneaked into his room

506
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,550
and splashed the wine on him?

507
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,160
Hair-raising can be the right word.

508
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,880
Room 1123!

509
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:29,200
Thanks for giving me a new life.

510
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,880
Who are you?

511
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,000
It’s you?

512
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,030
It’s you?

513
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,400
I remember you.

514
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,920
Get up.

515
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,440
Don’t pretend to be drunk.

516
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,510
Get up.

517
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,880
Gu Shengnan, calm down. Don’t give yourself away.

518
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,510
Get up. Get up.

519
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,790
Wake up.

520
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,750
Where is he taking me?

521
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,160
Damn it. So close.

522
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,160
He’s seen my whole body.

523
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,790
Where are you going?

524
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,920
Why is he taking off his shirt?

525
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,880
Come to me soon.

526
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,030
I don’t care where you are.

527
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,030
Come to my room

528
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,400
within five minutes.

529
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,240
Another man is coming?

530
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,750
What a freak!

531
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,000
Fine, then.

532
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,240
I’ll fight it out with you.

533
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,240
What am I thinking?

534
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,680
It’s my best chance to leave.

535
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,960
Could it be a romance trap?

536
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,310
He’s even having a bath.

537
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,880
Where is my slipper?

538
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,440
Boss, here I am.

539
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,550
Stop looking.

540
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
You’re good, huh?

541
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,790
This is... this is really unexpected.

542
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,030
Who is this girl?

543
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,200
Do I know her?

544
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,440
Let me make it clear.

545
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,880
She came to me.

546
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,310
I haven’t done anything.

547
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,750
Yeah, I can see that.

548
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,270
She was drunk and came to me.

549
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,920
She splashed the wine on me.

550
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,510
Then I took my coat off.

551
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,400
But it’s not what you think it is.

552
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,440
But I just wonder...

553
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,400
I just wonder

554
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,070
how did she get in without the room card.

555
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,070
That’s why I want to ask you.

556
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,750
Why did she suddenly turn up in my room?

557
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,880
Why was she in my balcony?

558
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,510
Screwed, Gu Shengnan.

559
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,240
You’re going to a chef

560
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,350
who works for the shortest time in this hotel.

561
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,310
I’m right, huh?

562
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,960
Chances are as few as good men.

563
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,070
When you don’t pay attention,

564
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,400
they slip away.

565
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,880
I don’t think so!

566
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,440
The guest in Room 1123 knows

567
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,000
I live next door

568
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,720
and he knows

569
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,440
I put noodles into his Ferrari.

570
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,350
But he doesn’t know I’m a chef here.

571
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,310
So, from now on,

572
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,440
as long as I restrain myself

573
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,110
and behave humbly,

574
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,400
he won’t recognize me

575
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,030
and I’ll still be the youngest chef

576
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,030
in this hotel.

577
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,160
Yes, you’ll be.

578
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,440
Good luck, then.

579
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,640
Good luck.

580
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,680
Shengnan.

581
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,480
The guest in Room 1123 ordered something.

582
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,070
Red wine?

583
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,880
Give it to the beverage department.

584
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,640
Why are you giving this to me?

585
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,640
The guest in Room 1123 said

586
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,200
this was an assigned subject.

587
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,240
Red wine is the topic.

588
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,920
You’ll decide what else to do.

589
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,270
Assigned subject.

590
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,220
= No. 1123 Red Wine =

591
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,240
Steak with red wine and nuts.

592
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,680
The top sirloin

593
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,350
Filet steak.

594
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,030
It’s the leanest part

595
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
and tastes the tenderest.

596
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,240
Black pepper goes well with the steak.

597
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,960
It removes the fishy taste.

598
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,750
Plant oil is applied to the surface of steak

599
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,960
to lock the moisture.

600
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,960
Rub it gently

601
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,790
so that the steak is tender.

602
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,350
Shallots have a special scent.

603
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,240
Its scent comes out with the hot oil.

604
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,310
Add red wine and boil it

605
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,790
until it thickens up.

606
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,960
After the filtering, melted butter

607
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,750
gives a unique milk flavor.

608
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,640
But it has an obvious drawback.

609
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,720
The red wine sauce tastes mellow.

610
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
It’ll easily cover the taste of following dishes.

611
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,680
Pine nuts and pecans are put

612
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,880
to balance the flavor

613
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,240
so that the dish will taste smoother.

614
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,790
Mutton chop with red wine and black pepper.

615
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,590
Baked pear with red wine.

616
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,070
Grilled pigeon with truffle and red wine.

617
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,440
Strawberry red wine cocktail.

618
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,320
Rose pudding with red wine.

619
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,360
May I see this female chef?

620
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,400
No. No. No.

621
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,960
I’m not going to see him.

622
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,800
Come on.

623
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,510
You’re meeting a guest

624
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,670
instead of having a blind date.

625
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,230
What makes you so shy?

626
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,880
I’m not shy.

627
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,710
I’m afraid he’ll be shy.

628
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,800
Wh... What?

629
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,150
Nothing.

630
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,670
Why does he want to see me?

631
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,070
I think

632
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,360
he finds your dishes good

633
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,670
and wants to reward you.

634
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,360
Reward me?

635
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,360
Reward?

636
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,070
Does he want to beat me?

637
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,150
Here is the thing, Manager Shen.

638
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,280
I don’t always care

639
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,400
about the money thing.

640
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,280
I won’t go.

641
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,320
I won’t.

642
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,550
You don’t care about the money thing?

643
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,630
I don’t.

644
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,320
Look.

645
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,760
I’ve prepared a bonus for you.

646
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,320
I had meant to reward you.

647
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,110
Forget it, then.

648
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,550
I don’t care about the money thing.

649
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,550
But bonus is different.

650
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,320
Bonus isn’t

651
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,590
a cold number.

652
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,840
It represents how you appreciate my work.

653
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,320
I appreciate you?

654
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,190
You do.

655
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,320
Go meet him.

656
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
What are you looking at?

657
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,320
Boss.

658
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,190
Why must you see the female chef?

659
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Didn’t you tell me

660
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,190
not to waste time on any woman?

661
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,920
I mean stupid guys, not women.

662
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,030
How do you know

663
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,920
she isn’t a stupid woman?

664
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
She completed all my tests

665
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,880
in such a short time

666
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,110
and gave me more dishes than I expected.

667
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,480
Isn’t she smarter than you?

668
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,440
You make sense.

669
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,400
You...

670
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,440
Are you sure you’re a female chef?

671
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,110
You get me wrong.

672
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,630
I come to meet you on behalf of her.

673
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,760
Come in.

674
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,000
Mr. Lu.

675
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,400
Why doesn’t she come?

676
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,110
The female chef you want to see

677
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,320
fears that her appearance

678
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,920
will make you uncomfortable.

679
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,030
Who do you think Mr. Lu is?

680
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,920
He’s met so many people.

681
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,590
Even the ugliest ones. Why will he be scared?

682
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,590
Please trust me.

683
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,920
I’ve been working with her for years.

684
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,000
I don’t even dare to look at her.

685
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,550
You make me become more interested to see her.

686
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,400
Please get her to me.

687
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,840
Don’t.

688
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,280
If you see her,

689
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,630
you may lose your appetite.

690
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,230
I’ll eat the dishes, instead of her.

691
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,510
What’s this? Put it down.

692
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,880
This is a dish from her.

693
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,320
She said you would understand

694
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,760
after you saw it.

695
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,840
A chicken?

696
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,880
Boss, is she cursing you?

697
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,960
Does she mean

698
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,360
if we find this egg delicious,

699
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,960
we don’t need to find the chicken

700
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,840
that laid the egg?

701
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,590
Yes. Yes.

702
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,150
Then the water means

703
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,960
one must be grateful?

704
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,510
What a deep girl!

705
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,150
Have some water in case I choke on the egg.

706
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,630
Does she mean that?

707
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,440
Mr. Lu, you and she

708
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,630
really think alike.

709
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,590
I’m then more curious.

710
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,880
I must meet her.

711
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,880
Do you know

712
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,190
what happened to the man

713
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,440
who stopped Mr. Lu last time?

714
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,070
What happened to him?

715
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,710
Nothing.

716
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,760
Shengnan.

717
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,760
He’s coming to you.

718
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
