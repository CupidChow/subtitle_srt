Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

Judging from your clothes and manners,

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,080
you must be Mr. Lu.

66

Good eye.

Who are you?

68
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,680
I’m the designer of an renowned garment brand,

69
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,560

70
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,719

Mr. Lu.

73
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,439
You look younger than I imagined.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,199
Though you’re older than me,

75
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,680
you look younger than I imagined too,

76
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,439
Uncle.

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,960

78
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,680

Oh, water card.

99

OK.

100
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,199
Wait a second.

101
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,000
Excuse me.

102
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,240

Shengnan almost

110

fed Lu Jin with the food.

111

How did Lu Jin react to it?

112
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,199
Don’t mention that Lu Jin.

113
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,959
He talked about Shengnan all the time.

114
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,720
I’m telling you.

115
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,480
They totally

116
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,199
ignored my presence.

117
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,560
Didn’t Lu Jin

118
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,240
find it awkward with you being there?

119
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,319
Awkward?

120
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,720
It’s not about how he felt.

121
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,079
It’s about me, about how I felt.

122
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
You know what, Zhaodi?

123
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,319
I was so irritated

124
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,199
that I lost my appetite.

All right. I got it.

128

I’ve got work to do.

129
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,480
Gotta go. Bye-bye.

00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,320
Miss Li,

193
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,559
knowing that you’re back,

194
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,600
the hotel prepared a fancy dinner for you.

195
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,759
Shall we go to the restaurant now?

196
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,080
I’ll wait for Lu Jin.

197
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,679
Go back to your work.

198
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,799
If I need anything,

199
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,919
I will go to you.

200
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,600
What is it that you need me now?

201
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I got news

202
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,279
that the Indonesian police

203
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,840
blocked Tianlan Project site

204
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,840
and froze all the money on its account.

205
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,679
They demand

206
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,080
all personnel related to this project

207
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,240
to stay in the country.

208
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,799
Sorry. What’s the current situation?

209
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,159
I just hung up

210
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,600
with our government correspondent,

211
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Senator Huang.

212
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:53,600
Go on.

213
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,360
He didn’t elaborate.

214
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,919
But he requested a meeting with you.

215
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,600
Senator Huang wanted to meet me?

216
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,320
I’m sorry, Miss Lin.

217
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,600
- You can’t go in.
- Get out of my way.

218
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,159
Why didn’t you pick up my phone?

219
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,159
Excuse me, Mr. Lu.

220
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,080
Miss Lin insists to come in.

221
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,799
I can’t stop her.

222
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,919
I’m sorry, Lan.

223
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,080
We’re dealing with a critical issue.

224
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,320
We’ll talk later.

225
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,240
OK? Go back.

226
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,360
I’m not going out.

227
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,320
Why do you let her stay

228
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
and kick me out?

229
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,240
If she’s staying, so am I.

230
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,559
Mr. Lu, I’d better...

231
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
She’s my secretary.

232
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,600
We’re working.

233
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,039
Let’s talk later, OK?

234
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:26,840
Lu Jin,

235
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,759
I’d like to talk about her.

236
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,679
Your secretary.

237
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,440
Li Man, right?

238
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,039
Each year on my birthday

239
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,919
and our anniversary,

240
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,559
she helps to choose the gifts.

241
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,240
Last month,

242
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
I called you because my car hit the one in front

243
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,240
and it was she who went to the scene.

244
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,399
You leave me for work on each Christmas,

245
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,799
New Year’s Day

246
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,679
and the Valentine’s.

247
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,240
It’s always your secretary

248
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,879
who stays with you.

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,840
Lu Jin, I’m your girlfriend.

250
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,120
But I spend less time with you than she does.

251
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,080
I’m really sorry about that.

252
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,799
But she’s my partner in work.

253
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,080
We’re dealing with a critical issue.

254
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,519
Can we talk about it later at home?

255
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,080
Partner in work?

256
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,240
OK.

257
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,799
She can be your partner in work.

258
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,879
So can I.

259
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,399
Nothing but a secretary.

260
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,519
Fire her. Make me your secretary.

261
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,840
So I can spend each day with you.

262
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,399
Lan,

263
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,679
don’t be ridiculous.

264
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,240
Go home, OK?

265
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
No.

266
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,639
You have to make a choice between us.

267
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,519
Me or her?

268
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,440
Lan, let me be clear.

269
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,639
I can always get another girlfriend.

270
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,279
But Li Man,

271
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,799
my partner in work,

272
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,399
is irreplaceable.

273
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,080
Am I understood?

274
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:49,320
From now on we’re officially over.

275
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,320
There’s the way out. Good bye.

276
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,200
Lu Jin, remember what you said.

277
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,759
Lu Jin,

278
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,639
will you make

279
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,440
the same choice as you did back then?

280
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,320
Careful.

281
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,799
I won’t eat just one this time.

282
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,159
OK. There it is.

283
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,240
Li Man?

284
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,440
You...

285
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,639
You came back?

286
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,360
Xinjie... He didn’t tell me.

287
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,840
What? I’m not welcomed?

288
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,240
No, it’s just so unexpected.

289
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,440
Try this.

290
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,360
I often ate it when I was little.

291
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,920
Let’s have something else.

292
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,759
The restaurant has prepared dinner for us.

293
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,680
Come, let’s talk over dinner.

294
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,880
Business?

295
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Why don’t we talk now?

296
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,359
How much longer are you going to stay in Suhai?

297
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,279
You’ve spent

298
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,839
too much time on this hotel.

299
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,599
Before I came, Ms. Zheng

300
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,920
urged me to remind you

301
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,519
that you have so much significant work to do

302
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,680
in Switzerland.

303
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,440
It’s mainly because I haven’t found

304
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,039
a capable hotel manager.

305
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:36,799
So,

306
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,279
I’m still selecting.

307
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:40,599
Perhaps...

308
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,279
I’ve got one.

309
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,440
The interview is tomorrow.

310
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,799
In Zhuozhou.

311
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,240
I booked tickets for tonight.

312
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,039
We’ll go together.

313
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,640
The interview is tomorrow

314
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,680
and you didn’t tell me until now?

315
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:54,920
What’s wrong?

316
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,279
I called you a billion times.

317
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,160
You never picked up.

318
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,319
And I texted.

319
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,000
Don’t you know it?

320
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,759
You did?

321
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,559
Lu Jin,

322
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,640
it’s not like you.

323
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,000
In the past, as long as it’s about work,

324
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,559
you always replied at the first time.

325
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,559
What’s going on recently?

326
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,359
Nothing, I’m fine.

327
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,440
In business trips,

328
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,839
sometimes when you’re boring,

329
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,440
you meet new friends.

330
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,519
It’s pretty normal.

331
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,519
But

332
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,079
you don’t belong here.

333
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,000
Your work

334
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,599
doesn’t allow you to stay here for too long.

335
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,240
So is it better

336
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:51,400
for you to go back to your position soon?

337
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,240
Got it.

338
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:57,920
I’ll go to have dinner.

339
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:58,759
You sure you’re not coming?

340
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,119
No, thanks.

341
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,920
When will you come tonight?

342
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,039
I’ll make honeyed walnuts for you

343
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,759
and other new dishes.

344
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,640
And I learned to play cucurbit flute.

345
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,720
I can play a few pieces with Erhu too.

346
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,799
But I won’t charge for the music.

347
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:47,440
I will play while you eat.

348
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,400
If you can listen to the end,

349
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,559
it’ll be thrilling.

350
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,880
Right, it’s... Friday today.

351
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,920
The traffic might be jammed.

352
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,680
So you’d better leave earlier.

353
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,039
Text me when you get in your car.

354
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,400
I’ll start to make dishes.

355
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
If you don’t work tomorrow,

356
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,680
I’ll take you to eat the...

357
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,160
Let’s talk when you come.

358
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Drive safe.

359
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,000
Let me buy you dinner tonight.

360
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,640
Is he

361
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,640
asking me out?

362
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,920
Is it a date?

363
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:13,839
OK.

364
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,160
Well,

365
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
at which restaurant should we meet?

366
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,359
I doubt if there’s

367
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,440
a restaurant in Suhai that meets your standard.

368
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,440
You’re so picky.

369
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,519
I’ll book one.

370
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,240
Mr. Lu, please enjoy.

371
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,759
I made the honeyed walnuts specially for you.

372
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,400
I brought it over in case you don’t like

373
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,240
the food here. Try some.

374
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,799
I won’t charge for it. It’s free.

375
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,519
How do you like it?

376
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,799
In case you don’t like sweet food,

377
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,240
I put only a little sugar in it.

378
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,319
Is it sweet?

379
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,759
You don’t belong here.

380
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,279
Better go back

381
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,759
to your position soon.

382
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,440
Do you want to come back to the hotel?

383
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,119
I can arrange it.

384
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,240
I have to cook for you.

385
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,160
The job can be postponed.

386
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,759
You need to have more walnuts.

387
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,079
It’s said it’s good for brain

388
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:58,720
and health.

389
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,799
Try some more.

390
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,839
If you need any favors

391
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:11,960
from me,

392
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,720
feel free to ask.

393
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,480
I will do it.

394
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Why are you so nice to me all of a sudden?

395
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,160
I don’t want to owe you any favors.

396
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,240
But like all common people,

397
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,359
if you’re nice to me, I’ll be nice to you.

398
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,359
Tell me, what are your terms?

399
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,440
Do you want to come to my home for more meals?

400
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,319
You can just say it.

401
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,319
If you say so,

402
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,160
what would you like to eat?

403
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,319
I’ll buy the materials in the market.

404
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,359
You don’t owe me anything.

405
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,000
And you don’t need to cook for me anymore.

406
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,119
The debt has been paid.

407
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,680
You don’t owe me.

408
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,599
I told you

409
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,559
you can come

410
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,559
to my home for meals if you want to.

411
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,400
For free.

412
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,799
Tiger prawn and dried scallop with passion fruit.

413
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,079
Please enjoy.

414
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,079
Thank you.

415
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,359
This is a king prawn,

416
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,720
not tiger prawn.

417
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,720
A hotel with such grandeur

418
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,480
can’t even tell the prawns.

419
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,359
It should close up.

420
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,279
We need to talk.

421
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,079
Is he going to confess?

422
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,519
Come on then.

423
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,359
From now on,

424
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,160
I won’t go to your place for dinner anymore.

425
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,119
We’re even.

426
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,039
I have a job.

427
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,160
Got it?

428
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:37,559
I don’t understand.

429
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,839
Why can’t you eat at my place?

430
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,640
It’s just a joke

431
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,559
to ask you pay the debt with cooking.

432
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:46,680
Forgive me.

433
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,400
We don’t owe each other anything.

434
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,160
I’ll leave later tonight

435
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,440
by air.

436
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,559
Check, please.

437
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,200
Please, it’s on me.

438
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,079
Since we’re even, let’s go Dutch.

439
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,359
Mr. Lu, do you want to sign it now?

440
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,240
Later, please.

441
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,160
Wait.

442
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,680
We ordered three dishes.

443
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,799
Two plates of bellota cost a thousand at most.

444
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,759
The salmon.

445
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,200
Even the salmon for audition

446
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,079
costs no more than 550 yuan for half a kilo.

447
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,440
And the king...

448
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,920
It’s not a tiger prawn.

449
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,279
It’s king prawn.

450
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,039
Sorry.

451
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,640
Shengnan,

452
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,000
the value of a product

453
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,279
isn’t its original value sometimes.

454
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,839
I understand.

455
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,839
My cooking is cheap.

456
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:07,960
It’s not what I mean.

457
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,599
It’s OK.

458
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
Safe flight.

459
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,039
Bao,

460
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,079
why don’t you come home?

461
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,799
Grandpa, look.

462
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,079
The aliens are sending signals.

463
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,319
There are no aliens at all.

464
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,079
Oh.

465
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,880
The sound control light in the hallway

466
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,440
was just fixed a few days ago.

467
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,200
It’s down again.

468
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,599
It’s real, Grandpa.

469
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,000
That’s Morse Code.

470
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:30,319
Some people are trapped.

471
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,000
Grandpa, let’s save them.

472
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,240
Mousse?

473
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,519
There are codes in mousse?

474
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,079
Come on.

475
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,039
Let’s take a look.

476
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,799
Shengnan,

477
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,440
what are you doing at late night?

478
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,000
I fell asleep.

479
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,279
It proves I haven’t fallen for him.

480
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,400
Gu Shengnan,

481
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,340
it’s just a deal.

482
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,300
= Yanqiao Farmers’ Market =

483
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,079
See you. Thank you.

484
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,960
Gu Shengnan is here.

485
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,000
Don’t look. Don’t look.

486
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,880
Why are you afraid of her?

487
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,960
You’re new and ill-informed.

488
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,960
When this young lady

489
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,359
is in bad mood,

490
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,680
she comes to bargain in the market.

491
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,960
Once she sat next to me

492
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,440
and bargained for half an hour

493
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,799
on just a fish.

494
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,680
Don’t laugh.

495
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,519
Did you see her face?

496
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:37,960
It says bad omen.

497
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,559
Ms. Zhang,

498
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,559
half a kilo of shrimps.

499
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,400
Big shrimps.

500
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,279
Shengnan,

501
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,359
did anyone wrong you?

502
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,960
How did you know?

503
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,400
How could I not tell?

504
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,640
Whenever you’re upset, you spend lavishly.

505
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,279
Ninety-six yuan.

506
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:07,680
Fifty.

507
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,839
Hey, that’s fifty percent off.

508
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,119
I sell others at ninety-six.

509
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,559
For you it’s ninety, OK?

510
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,640
Don’t. Eighty-five.

511
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,279
Eighty-five.

512
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:26,319
Don’t sit. Eighty.

513
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,079
You should have said that.

514
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,799
Thanks, Ms. Zhang.

515
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
You’re welcome.

516
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,960
Gladly it’s half a kilo.

517
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,359
I’d suffer a great loss if she bought more.

518
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,279
Is she dumped?

519
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,519
Probably.

520
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,480
