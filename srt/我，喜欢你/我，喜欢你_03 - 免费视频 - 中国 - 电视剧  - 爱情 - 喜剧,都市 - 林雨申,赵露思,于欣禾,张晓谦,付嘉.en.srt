No matter how good your F&B Department is,

190
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,720
will you sell the hotel to me

191
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,440
at the price of a restaurant?

192
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:42,919
Will you?

193
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,120
Celine.

194
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,759
Trumpet.

195
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,879
Why are you here?

196
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,440
Where is Shengnan?

197
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,200
She...

198
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,840
She was here a while ago.

199
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,279
I don’t know where she is now.

200
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,120
You’ll have to find her yourself.

201
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,879
OK, thanks.

202
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,759
No problem.

203
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,639
Hi.

204
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,120
Oh, hi. Sorry, carry on, you’re busy.

205
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,200
Sure.

206
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,639
Gu Shengnan.

207
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,879
1123 is ordering?

208
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,919
It’s me.

209
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,639
My bestie, I’m here to see you.

210
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,679
My bestie.

211
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,200
Back up a bit.

212
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,120
Back up. Stop.

213
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,159
I’m your bestie, huh?

214
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,399
What’s the matter?

215
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,440
Shengnan,

216
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,600
I need you to do me a big favor.

217
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,399
Typical you.

218
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,159
Xu Zhaodi,

219
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,519
You haven’t returned the last favor yet.

220
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,960
If you do me this favor, let’s 50-50.

221
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,879
No way.

222
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,879
It can’t be a good thing.

223
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,600
I have my own problems these days.

224
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,759
Please find someone else.

225
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,039
Let go, let go.

226
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:39,519
Shengnan,

227
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,480
this small favor

228
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,519
is within your capability.

229
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,879
Even if

230
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,679
it is within my capability,

231
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,159
you

232
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,639
are not on my can-help list.

233
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,919
Goodbye.

234
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,600
Gu Shengnan,

235
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,519
if you do me this favor,

236
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,440
I’ll pay for the car compensation.

237
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,960
My bestie.

238
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,840
Good sister.

239
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,879
I will help.

240
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,360
You should say so earlier.

241
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,840
Come on.

242
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,000
= Women’s dressing room =

243
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,639
If the owner of the uniform ever finds out,

244
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,720
we are doomed.

245
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,360
Shut up, quickly.

246
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,039
Listen, you got 5 minutes.

247
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,519
I’ll murder you if you’re a second late.

248
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,519
Don’t worry. I’m always quick.

249
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,360
Get out and keep watch.

250
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,200
OK, OK.

251
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,120
Surprise.

252
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,519
I just got hired.

253
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,240
We’re colleagues now.

254
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,600
Congratulations.

255
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,759
Who?

256
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,519
Who took my uniform?

257
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,519
Someone saw a person wearing a kitchen uniform

258
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,000
went into women’s changing room.

259
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,080
And now my uniform has gone missing.

260
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,759
Speak. Who took it?

261
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,240
What are you making a noise?

262
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,320
See?

263
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,559
We’re all blokes.

264
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,519
Why would we need your uniform?

265
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,000
Why?

266
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,480
A pervert, maybe.

267
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,559
I noticed

268
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,519
some of you have been checking me out.

269
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,559
If you like me,

270
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,240
just say it.

271
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,519
Don’t play dirty.

272
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,759
Tell me,

273
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,279
since when did you have a crush on me?

274
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,000
I...

275
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,480
I didn’t.

276
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,320
You!

277
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,240
I noticed that

278
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,039
you looked at me with guilty eyes.

279
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,279
Did you take my uniform?

280
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,039
No.

281
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,320
Have crush on me?

282
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,759
In fact, I...

283
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,759
You don’t have the balls.

284
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,399
I’m so pretty.

285
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:00,679
Each and every one of you is a suspect.

286
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,159
Admit now

287
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,960
and I’ll say no,

288
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,039
but I do appreciate your bravery.

289
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,400
Maybe I’ll fall in love with one of you,

290
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,559
but if...

291
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,160
What are you shouting about?

292
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,559
Now I see.

293
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,000
If I’m not in the kitchen for ten minutes,

294
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,559
this place will be a playground.

295
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,480
You. Come here.

296
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,759
You’re a waitress.

297
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,559
Why do you keep coming to the kitchen?

298
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,039
No. They took my uniform.

299
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,920
Why would these blokes take your uniform?

300
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,799
They have a crush on you?

301
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,759
Can’t believe you nod.
Go back to your position.

302
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,960
Where is Gu Shengnan?

303
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,000
There.

304
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,319
Keep working.

305
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,519
Wake up.

306
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,400
Wake up.

307
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,519
Seriously, Gu Shengnan?

308
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,279
Taking a nap during work hours?

309
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,319
You have a good dream, do you?

310
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,079
Sorry, Manager Shen,

311
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,759
I’m just too tired.

312
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,799
Let me take a quick nap. Just a quick one.

313
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,599
It’s easy.

314
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:27,759
Go.

315
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,839
Stand outside and feel the wind.

316
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:29,759
Let the wind wake you up.

317
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,799
I’ll be back

318
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,079
in ten minutes.

319
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,759
I expect to see you

320
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,759
work fully spirited

321
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,519
in your position,

322
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,039
or you won’t get your bonuses this month.

323
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,279
I must go out and let the wind wake me then.

324
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:47,279
Wait.

325
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,519
Put down the chair. You stand in the wind.

326
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Stand in the wind?

327
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:00,866
Hello,

328
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,200
how’s your inspection going?

329
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,759
I’m here personally.

330
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,759
What do you think?

331
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,039
You got the lowest price, huh?

332
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,200
Lower than that you could imagine.

333
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,359
The hotel is so terrible?

334
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,279
How about the food?

335
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Everything else is awful,

336
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,200
the food, however, surprised me.

337
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,480
If you say so,

338
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,920
it must be good.

339
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,759
I’m relieved then.

340
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,680
Yes.

341
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,000
While I’m away,

342
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,000
spend more time with my mom.

343
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,200
I will.

344
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Take care of yourself

345
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,079
and come home sooner.

346
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,720
Wake up, buddy.

347
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,200
Let’s party.

348
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,200
Don’t worry, everything’s under my control.

349
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,599
Something happened to my boss?

350
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,440
Hey, you-you...

351
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,759
I’m on my way. Where is he?

352
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,599
Boss?

353
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,680
We’ve figured out what happened.

354
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,480
It was her fault.

355
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,240
She hit the button by mistake

356
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,279
and pushed Mr. Lu

357
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,440
into the water.

358
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,759
Luckily, Mr. Lu hit the calm water

359
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,200
so he wasn’t injured.

360
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,079
But we must come here to say sorry.

361
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,599
Say sorry.

362
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,440
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

363
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,960
What? He’s not Mr. Lu.

364
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,279
Raise your head. Is he?

365
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,279
Sorry.

366
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,000
Please tell Mr. Lu that

367
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,240
from the bottom of my heart...

368
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,119
All right, all right.

369
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,240
Forget it.

370
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,359
I remember you.

371
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,279
I lost you in the hotel last time.

372
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,519
And here you show up again.

373
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,359
Enough said.

374
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,000
Get the money for the car in 2 days.

375
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:02,920
As for the rest,

376
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,680
let’s talk when my boss feels better.

377
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:05,960
That’s it.

378
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,680
Um...

379
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,359
So the flowers...

380
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,240
Just put them at the door.

381
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Quickly, at the door.

382
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,680
Sorry, uh...

383
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
It seems inauspicious.

384
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,480
Is that so?

385
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
It does seem inauspicious. Put them inside.

386
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,240
Boss.

387
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,200
I’ve worked for you for two years,

388
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,000
these are the unluckiest two days
you have ever had.

389
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,480
The unluckiest two days in my entire life.

390
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,599
What does this woman want?

391
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,359
Just...

392
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,960
Not one good thing happened after we know her.

393
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,920
She either put noodles in your car,

394
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,720
or puked on you in your room,

395
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,960
or threw you into the water.

396
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,720
What else isn’t she capable of?

397
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:08,680
It’s horrible.

398
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,359
You got a point.

399
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,960
What does she want?

400
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,200
Stop me from buying Bauhinia?

401
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,720
Based on my years of experience,

402
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,359
I think it’s not that easy.

403
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
She’s after something bigger than that.

404
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,119
Speak.

405
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,799
She’s trying to hit on you.

406
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:52,880
No.

407
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,079
She’s different.

408
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,039
She’s my nemesis.

409
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,400
Your nemesis.

410
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,839
The nemesis after your money.

411
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,960
She loves you so much and she wants you dead.

412
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,720
She loves you so much and she wants you dead.

413
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,200
She loves me so much and she wants me dead?

414
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,559
She wants me dead?

415
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,279
My nemesis?

416
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,559
She loves me so much and she wants me dead?

417
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:04,839
Seduce me?

418
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,000
Hello.

419
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,079
I’d like some Witch’s Brew.

420
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,079
1123.

421
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,720
All right, all cleaned up?

422
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,480
Let’s call it a day.

423
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,559
Done.

424
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,880
You guys start early tomorrow morning.

425
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,839
We need replenishment.

426
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,200
Order from 1123.

427
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,200
You won’t be able to leave again.

428
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,240
Fussy Lu wants my Witch’s Brew?

429
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,039
Does he even know what that is?

430
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,119
Mushroom soup will make do.

431
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,359
Miss Gu,

432
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,400
why don’t you cook Witch’s Brew for him?

433
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,559
The recipe of Witch’s Brew

434
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,319
is passed down by word of mouth
among Gipsy girls.

435
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,200
Every winter,

436
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,039
they set a pot

437
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,960
in which they put the ingredients
that their lovers like

438
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,000
and simmer with red wine.

439
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,079
So there’s no fixed recipe

440
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,359
for Witch’s Brew.

441
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,880
You put your love in the pot.

442
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,759
It’s called the Flavor Cipher between lovers.

443
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,359
The Flavor Cipher?

444
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,799
Are you saying

445
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,079
1123 likes you?

446
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,240
Aren’t you off duty now?

447
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,599
Well then,

448
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:46,119
get the pot for me.

449
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:46,559
Quickly.

450
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,359
No, no, no. I got stuff to do. I’m off.

451
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,480
I don’t want anything to do with your love soup.

452
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,359
Watch it!

453
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:53,880

Why haven’t

480
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,039
I got my soup yet?

481
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,279
Anyone here?

482
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,079
Good.

483
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,279
Tastes wonderful.

484
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,880
What’s happening?

485
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,039
What are you doing?

486
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,119
Are you crazy?

487
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,799
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

488
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,000
What are you doing? What...

489
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,160
Fussy Lu, what are you doing?

490
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Listen, I’ll pay you back

491
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,720
the money that I owe you.

492
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,720
I’ll pay you.

493
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,000
Not with my body. It’s impossible.

494
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,920
Tell you what,

495
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,920
you’re...

496
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,079
Don’t try to blackmail me.

497
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,079
I did nothing. I didn’t do anything.

498
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,440
You drank the mushroom soup?

499
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,160
It’s uncooked. You drank the soup?

500
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,119
The mushroom soup.

501
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,400
Hang in there, Fussy Lu.

502
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:25,319
Come on, drink this.

503
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,680
Drink this until you throw up.

504
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,759
Get a stomach lavage.

505
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,799
Drink it.

506
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,319
Stop moaning, drink it. Gulp down.

507
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,480
You...

508
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,680
You... Yes, yes, yes.

509
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:38,759
Just drink it all up.

510
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,920
Throw up. A vomit will do.

511
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,480
Get ready for this.

512
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,759
Throw up. Throw up.

513
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
Throw up.

514
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:54,799
Fussy Lu.

515
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,839
Are you OK?

516
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,160
Sober now?

517
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,680
Get off of you, right?

518
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,519
Better?

519
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,799
Feeling better?

520
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,000
Throw up.

521
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,359
Boss,

522
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,640
the doctor said you’re OK.

523
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,559
Just eat light food these days.

524
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,200
Delete it.

525
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,640
Miss Gu went too far this time.

526
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,079
It’s the security guards’ fault.

527
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,680
They just got nothing else to do.

528
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,000
They had to post it in the group.

529
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,079
Don’t worry.

530
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,920
I’ll handle it well.

531
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,119
Boss,

532
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,920
based on my years of experience,

533
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:18,000
you don’t need to worry about it.

534
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:20,079
As long as you don’t feel embarrassed,

535
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
no one else can notice the embarrassment.

536
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,759
Really?

537
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:24,640
Yes.

538
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,000
Listen,

539
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,400
I’ll take you out for something delicious.

540
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,559
Food can make you happy

541
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,119
and you’ll forget all about it.

542
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,079
After you forget all about it,

543
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,079
it’ll be over.

544
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,920
I’ll try.

545
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,119
Mr. Lu,

546
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,279
sorry.

547
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,680
The card.

548
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,759
It’s inside the room.

549
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,079
Mr. Lu, sorry.

550
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,400
Don’t say sorry to me.

551
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,079
What do you want me to do after saying sorry?

552
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,759
To put myself in your position?

553
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:04,720
I can’t.

554
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,200
I’m not embarrassed at all.

555
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,920
If I’m not embarrassed, you aren’t either.

556
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,760
Is that true?

557
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,280
I’m asking you.

558
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,199
I’m asking you.

559
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,119
No.

560
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:12,920
You shut up.

561
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,400
You, you’re my nemesis.

562
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,719
I won’t eat anything that you cook, OK?

563
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,079
You win. I don’t want to see you again.

564
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:17,840
Farewell.

565
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:19,960
Card.

566
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:21,800
Card.

567
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,599
Go.

568
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,599
Go.

569
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:26,639
Give him the card.

570
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,599
Give him the card.

571
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,239
Please, Mr. Lu.

572
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,599
You get out.

573
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,039
I get out.

574
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:44,519
Gu Shengnan,

575
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,519
from today on,

576
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:47,199
our back-scratching

577
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,039
officially ends.

578
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,039
You’re fired.

579
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:50,320
No, manager,

580
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,599
about what Mr. Lu just said,

581
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,320
what if

582
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,920
he just got carried away?

583
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,039
He’s a big boss.

584
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,320
How come he could get carried away?

585
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,440
You’re lucky that he doesn’t sue you of poisoning.

586
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,639
I didn’t poison him.

587
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,159
The mushroom soup was uncooked.

588
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,599
He sneaked in and drank it.

589
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:06,199
It had nothing to do with me.

590
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,039
Chef Gu,

591
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,599
you claimed the credit

592
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,599
and now you pass the buck?

593
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,239
You want a pay raise,

594
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:16,320
so how about a resignation?

595
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,719
You’re being ungrateful.

596
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,920
My customer doesn’t need you,

597
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,320
so why would I keep you around?

598
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,239
Go home.

599
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,440
OK.

600
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,320
Are you firing me?

601
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:33,679
Bauhinia isn’t the only hotel in Suhai.

602
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,960

603
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,320
