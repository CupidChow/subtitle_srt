You’d better not drink with him.

21

He’s just a wine bibber.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,359
You are the wine bibber!

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,319
Uncle, just step aside.

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,560
I have business to talk to Mr. Lu.

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,760
I don’t care.

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
Come on, let’s drink.

27
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:55,920
Mr. Lu.

28
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,280
Try this.

29
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,840
Have a try.

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,599
Have a try

31
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,599
to see if it’s suitable for your hotel.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,120
If it’s all right with you,

33
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,200
I can deliver it to your hotel

34
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,359
from tomorrow,

35
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,719
as many as you want.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,159
- What’s in the zoo?
- And...

37
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,280
- There are orangutans.
- The price is favorable.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,719
- Monkey.
- Try this.

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,560
Okay.

40
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,560
Mr. Lu.

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,159
Happy to work with you!

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
I... I...

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,800
Brother Wang, listen.

44
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,319
Drink.

45
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,159
Why aren’t there any keepers in the zoo?

46
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,960
Of course there are keepers in the zoo.

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,520
Drink, come on!

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,879
Let’s have some dishes first.

49
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,000
No need, I have eaten before.

50
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,960
What?

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,319
If you don’t go there,

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
your boss will eat you
like a chicken claw.

53
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,120
Excuse me for a while.

54
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,680
Liu, drink it for me.

55
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,599
You’re a little older than I am.

56
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,319
Drink it for me, okay?

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Check the backgrounds

58
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,840
of those two people

59
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,919
playing with Gu Shengnan.

60
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,599
Those two?

61
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,120
When you were giving your speech,

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,680
they were

63
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,400
making all that noise over there.

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,639
Mili and Liu.

65
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,240
Come on.

66
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,960
Are you jealous of them?

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,719
Not necessary, Boss.

68
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,759
Listen,

69
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,599
they have no core competence at all.

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,159
Let me make an analogy for you.

71
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,120
If you were an atomic bomb,

72
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,479
those two are at best cherry bombs.

73
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,159
Just some cracks and it’s over.

74
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,159
You have a point.

75
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,680
You go there

76
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,120
to replace Miss Gu

77
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,599
and drink with those two guys.

78
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,000
Can I do it?

79
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,240
One, two.

80
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,159
Left, left.

81
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,400
Right, right.

82
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,479
Fly!

83
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,680
Miss Gu.

84
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,319
Come on, let me introduce them to you.

85
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,439
This is Mili.

86
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,120
Hello.

87
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,080
This is Liu.

88
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,520
Mili.

89
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,759
And this is

90
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,599
Liu.

91
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,960
Why are you staring at me?

92
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,360
You are pretty active
with that driver today.

93
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,639
None of your business!

94
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,399
What are you doing?

95
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,879
Zhaodi, you’re here.

96
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,680
Come on.

97
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,600
That’s not what I mean.

98
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:23,920
Come on.

99
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,839
Miss Gu, don’t you want to sit there?

100
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,079
You’ve had enough.

101
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,480
Not at all.

102
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,160
Come on.

103
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,879
Miss Gu, don’t leave.

104
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,959
Don’t make troubles here.

105
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,800
I’m not making troubles. What did I do?

106
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,519
Let’s play together.

107
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,759
Left, left, right, right, fly!

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,360
Fly, fly, fly!

109
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,000
Mr. Lu.

110
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,120
Thank you.

111
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,680
How are you doing?

112
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,959
It’s the first time for you

113
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,720
to eat with so many people
in such kind of place.

114
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Not used to this, right?

115
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,480
Shengnan grows up

116
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,759
in this place.

117
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,160
These people

118
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,160
watched Shengnan grow up.

119
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,319
Even though we’re not related,

120
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,279
as days pass by,

121
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,120
we just treat each other
like our relatives.

122
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,800
When I was a child,

123
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,839
my uncle was really busy.

124
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,959
He had no time to take care of Shengnan.

125
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,480
So Shengnan ran in the alley alone.

126
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,600
When it’s time for meal,

127
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,199
Shengnan would go to the closest booth

128
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,879
and eat there.

129
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,959
My uncle can’t get her back at all.

130
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,480
After she walked all around the alley
and had enough,

131
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,560
she strolled back by herself.

132
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,120
Shengnan grew up with her grandfather.

133
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,000
To be honest,

134
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,920
she needs love.

135
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,160
Otherwise,

136
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,000
she won’t like a senior like you.

137
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
Since her childhood,

138
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,800
her parents were not around.

139
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,439
But if someone bullies her,

140
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,000
there are a lot of people behind her.

141
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,800
You know my uncle.

142
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,240
He grew up with a kitchen knife.

143
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,319
Though with a benign face,

144
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,959
he can slice a person

145
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,680
like slicing a duck.

146
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,000
And Aunt Wang.

147
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,319
Aunt Wang runs a small shop now.

148
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,959
But she used to sell roast meat.

149
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,879
Barbecue stick, do you know that?

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,079
When she pierces the meat,

151
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,079
it hurts much more

152
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,399
than witches’

153
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,680
needle.

154
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,800
Besides,

155
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,160
all though there are all girls

156
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,600
in Quan’an Couture,

157
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,920
it would be a piece of cake for them

158
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,600
to ruin one’s reputation.

159
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,639
Don’t hurt her.

160
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,079
If you haven’t thought about it clearly,

161
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,879
just stop.

162
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,519
Actually, you shouldn’t dress her
that way last time.

163
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,480
She is beautiful being herself.

164
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,839
Let’s use kelp. Kelp is more interesting.

165
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,079
You two play with kelp.

166
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,000
Deal.

167
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,399
Kelp, kelp!

168
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,879
Miss Gu, drink.

169
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,560
Don’t pick on our Gu Shengnan.

170
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
Drink with me if you can.

171
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,360
All right, no more playing.

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,319
Let’s enliven the atmosphere.

173
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,279
Let’s sing a song!

174
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,000
What song?

175
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,120
Calabash Brothers.

176
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,360
Seven flowers on one vine.

177
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,600
Not afraid of rain or wind.

178
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,920
La la la la!

179
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,759
Lu Jin and Shengnan left.

180
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,759
Do you need me to give you a ride?

181
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,120
No need.

182
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,519
Just send Zhaodi back.

183
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,159
I don’t need your instruction.

184
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,720
I have something to tell you.

185
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,039
What?

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,519
Do you make men’s clothing?

187
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,360
I can ask my company

188
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,799
to order clothes for our annual meeting

189
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,600
from your company.

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Besides,

191
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,840
I can tell you my boss’s size.

192

00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,519
Okay. On what term?

196
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,759

No, I don’t feel noisy at all.

I drank that much

282
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,679
and you didn’t take me home,

283
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,080
but here.

284

= Meng Xinjie =

285
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,679
Have you ever sold out your bestie?

286
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,039
Which one?

= Gao Quan’an =

288
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,360
Xu.

289
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,000
I think you were a little suspicious

290
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,519
when you were drinking today.

291
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,120
You’re the one who drank
nothing but juice.

292
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,039
You are not the one
who can say I’m suspicious.

293
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,759
What, do you want more?

294
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,639
Of course!

295
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,039
I drank juice in the evening

296
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,879
because I have Porsche in my mind.

297
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,320
I said you are suspicious

298
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,519
because you have Meng Xinjie on your mind.

299
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,080
What are you talking about?

300
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:03,679
Xu.

301
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,359
You drank and chatted

302
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,519
with that driver tonight.

303
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:08,960
Why?

304
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,480
You’re in love, aren’t you?

305
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,279
If you don’t talk,

306
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,759
I’ll take it as a yes.

307
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,640
Do you remember

308
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,559
my previous pursuit?

309
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,279
Isn’t it tacky?

310
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,839
Is it wrong?

311
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,480
Until I met Meng Xinjie.

312
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,000
I suddenly realized

313
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,960
what I have been pursuing

314
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,519
is all correct.

315
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,680
So,

316
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,319
today’s drinking is a farewell.

317
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,079
It is my farewell to Meng Xinjie.

318
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,319
And a farewell to my

319
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,160
muddleheaded first half of my life.

320
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,720
I’m starting over!

321
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,000
Cheers.

Why are you here?

326
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,960
I’ll give you a ride to work on my way.

327
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:33,599
On your way?

328
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,440
When a man says he is on his way,
he is usually not.

329
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,799
Tell me how long you took to get here.

330
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,359
All right, I’m here to pick you up.

331
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,759
Do you need to prepare a new menu today?

332
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,880
I almost forget it.

333
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,680
Anyway, I’m a dinner chef now.

334
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,559
We are on an equal footing now.

335
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,039
Let’s go.

336

337
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,599

We’ll have meal in the hotel
in tomorrow’s schedule.

342
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,480
It’s a young female cook

343
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,519
called Gu Shengnan.

344
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,640
This is the menu specially
prepared for you.

345
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,960
It’s her again.

346
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,319
What about Lu Jin?

347
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,519
Mr. Lu is having a meeting.

348
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,119
A real estate company in Indonesia

349
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,680
wants to cooperate with us.

350
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,319
After our assessment,

351
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,240
I think this project

352
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,680
has great potential for development.

353
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,960
This is our

355
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,200
Please take a look.

356
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,039
Okay, I’ll read it.

357
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,559
Anything else, guys?

358
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,359
Nothing.

359
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,880
That’s it for today.

360
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:12,680
Meng Xinjie.

361
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,839
Yes, Boss?

362
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,640
Sit.

363
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,599
Here?

364
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:22,799
As you like.

365
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,960
Do you know
who caught my attention the most

366
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,920
at today’s meeting?

367
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,240
Director Wang?

368
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,000
No.

369
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,400
Then it’s Mr. Wei.

370
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,680
It’s you.

371
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,359
You’ve changed your lazy style.

372
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,200
You didn’t doze off or play your phone.

373
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,680
You even had a small notebook

374
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
and took notes there.

375
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,279
Of course we have our own

376
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,000
secretary taking minutes of the meeting.

377
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,839
It doesn’t matter.

378
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,960
I’m curious

379
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,599
what you wrote in that booklet.

380
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,880
Nothing important.

381
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,000
I ended the meeting

382
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
to take a look at your notebook.

383
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,180
= Minutes of Meeting =

384
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,400
Just these few words?

385
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,160
Does it take that long to write these?

386
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,559
You talked too much at the meeting.

387
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,960
My notebook is too small.

388
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:45,880
Tell me

389
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,839
what happened.

390
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,359
After what I’ve been through yesterday,

391
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,960
I have an epiphany.

392
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,519
I have a new understanding

393
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,880
about my life.

394
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,680
What happened yesterday?

395
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,880
It doesn’t matter what happened yesterday.

396
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,319
What matters is what I want tomorrow!

397
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,559
What do you want?

398
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,319
I want

399
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,839
your big villa.

400
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,319
Do you have feelings for my villa?

401
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
I’m used to living there.

402
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,680
But that’s not what I meant.

403
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,640
I mean

404
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,480
I want to make money
through my own efforts!

405
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,640
I will buy a big villa

406
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,359
like Matsuhashi No.1.

407
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,960
It’s difficult.

408
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,359
What about

409
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,599
I get Mr. Wei’s position

410
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,400
one day

411
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,000
on my own efforts?

412
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,640
Is it possible?

413
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,119
It’s more difficult.

414
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,720
Meng Xinjie, these are not important.

415
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,680
We’ve been friends since I was 8.

416
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,160
You’ve been with me
for another two years after I came back.

417
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,599
No matter how hard
I tried to make you work,

418
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,640
you just never listened to me

419
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,680
But last night

420
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,759
you were singing
Calabash Brothers with them.

421
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:00,880
And all of a sudden you grew up overnight.

422
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,359
Can you tell me what happened?

423
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,359
You may not understand it anyway.

424
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,000
It’s love.

425
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,880
Of course I get it.

426
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,480
Why are you peeking at me?

427
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,519
Ziqian.

428
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,359
Let me ask you something.

429
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,960
I hope you can be honest with me.

430
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,160
Was I chosen this time

431
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,400
because of my own strength?

432
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,920
Otherwise?

433
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,920
Do you think I pulled the strings for you?

434
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,160
Not only I approve of you,

435
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,519
Miss Li also approves of you very much.

436
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,240
Miss Li?

437
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:07,799
Li Man?

438
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,279
Do you know each other well?

439
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,839
We used to be classmates.

440
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,039
She is a nice person.

441
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,960
Besides, she treats her people well.

442
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,480
It’s just

443
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,160
we don’t contact much later.

444
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,759
Is she that nice?

445
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,359
You’ll know it when you get to know her.

446
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,039
And

447
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,200
she is the popular kid in our school.

448
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,240
Goddess-like.

449
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:33,200
Many seniors and juniors had crush on her.

450
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,759
Goddess-like.

451
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,400
All right. Just pull over.

452
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,319
Just pull over!

453
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,119
We haven’t arrived.

454
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,160
It’s all right. I’ll get off here!

455
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Fine.

456
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,720
Did I say anything wrong?

457
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,480
Be careful!

458
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,079
Everybody, take a break.

459
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,559
Let me tell you something.

460
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,599
Do you know what I just saw

461
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,599
at the door?

462
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,519
What did you see?

463
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
I’ll give you a hint.

464
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,200
Do you know from whose car

465
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,839
Gu Shengnan got off?

466
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,680
Miss Gu’s own bicycle.

467
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,000
Gu Shengnan got off

468
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,599
from Manager Cheng’s Benz!

469
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,599
My dear!

470
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,759
Manager Cheng has a Benz!

471
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,039
Is that the point?

472
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,279
Then what is the point?

473
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,319
The point is

474
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,119
we were all wrong

475
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
about Gu Shengnan.

476
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,880
She is not the woman of our big boss.

477
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,039
She is the woman of our underboss.

478
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,400
Underboss...

479
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,920
More suspiciously,

480
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
Manager Cheng’s Benz

481
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,759
took a pause at the east corner

482
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:22,880
of our hotel.

483
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,279
That intersection is
200 meters away from us.

484
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,039
Right?

485
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:26,400
Yeah.

486
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,279
Gu Shengnan got off the car

487
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:30,240
and deliberately rode a shared bike

488
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,640
to our hotel.

489
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,039
She rode a bike here?

490
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,240
What does that mean?

491
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,799
The more she tries to hide
the more it’s exposed.

492
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,599
She is avoiding suspicion.

493
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,000
I didn’t expect Gu Shengnan

494
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,720
to have so many tricks to play.

495
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,400
No wonder we are no match for her.

496
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,839
I thought the situation would be different

497
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,960
since we have a new boss now.

498
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,480
I didn’t expect
the atmosphere to be fouler.

499
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,759
Looks like it’s getting harder for us

500
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,400
to stay at Bauhinia Hotel.

501
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,440
Well,

502
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,920
figure it out by yourselves.

503
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,480
Come on, let’s get to work!

504
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,640
Miss Gu.

505
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:14,640
What’s the matter?

506
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,119
What?

507
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,240
I mean,

508
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,680
am I your friend anyway?

509
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,079
You even hide your office romance

510
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,400
from me.

511
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,759
What are you talking about

512
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,519
in the morning?

513
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,559
The news Manager Cheng driving you to work

514
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,559
has been spread among the kitchen.

515
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,559
I guess housekeeping department

516
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,880
should know it now at this speed.

517
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:44,680
That fast?

518
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,599
Did you say it?

519
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:50,759
I did it for your good.

520
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,720
Think about it.

521
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,440
If the whole hotel knows

522
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,680
you are such an important person,

523
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,839
even Manager Cheng has to
drive you to work in person,

524
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,240
who dares to bully you anymore?

525
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,039
Trumpet.

526
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,359
There is nothing between
me and Cheng Ziqian.

527
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,359
After what you did,

528
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,599
the whole hotel will
be gossiping about me.

529
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,640
You are so troublesome.

530
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,359
Get away!

531
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,440
She that would wear a crown
must bear its weight.

532
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,160
Simple as that!

533
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,480
Ms. Zheng is coming over
for dinner tomorrow.

534
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,519
You all know that, right?

535
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,640
Each of you should prepare one dish.

536
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:24,880
Let’s practice it today

537
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,839
to make sure no accident tomorrow.

538
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,720
Where is Mr. Wang?

539
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,319
He was just there.

540
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,000
I guess he went to the bathroom.

541
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,799
Okay.

542
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,039
Now let me assign the dishes.

543
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,839
Mr. Yu, you make Wellington steak.

544
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,640
This...

545
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,160
Mr. Zhang.

546
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,640
You make abalone with oyster broth.

547
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,000
You’re better at this dish...

548
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,200
Mr. Liu, Mont-Blanc...

549
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,799
I’ll show you my skills this noon.

550
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,839
Noodles with tomato gravy.

551
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,480
I love it.

552
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,359
What’s going on here?

553
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,200
Is there any problem?

554
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Just bring it out.

555
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,319
These dishes are all modified by you.

556
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,440
We don’t know how to cook them.

557
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,880
Mr. Yu.

558
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,200
I have sent the menu

559
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,079
and ingredients to you.

560
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,920
We’re not the head chef.

561
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,880
It takes at least ten days or half a month

562
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,839
for us to learn that.

563
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,519
Chef!

564
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,079
I memorized them all!

565
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,400
You’re young and you have a good memory.

566
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:41,960
Chef Gu.

567
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,039
How about you teach us?

568
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:44,839
Yeah.

569
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,559
Teach us.

570
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,440
Okay.

571
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,279
Trumpet.

572
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,640
You memorized them all, right?

573
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,279
Prepare the dishes!

574
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,279
Yes!

575
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:02,920
Gu Shengnan!

576
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:03,960
It’s just preparing dishes.

577
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,880
What’s the table pounding, staring

578
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,720
and yelling about?

579
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,200
I heard you yelling all the way from here!

580
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,720
What’s the matter?

581
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,839
Why do you cook like fighting a war?

582
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:12,640
Well.

583
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,119
We are waiting for the dishes.
What are you doing now?

584
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,839
Learning how to cook.

585
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,359
Leaning?

586
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,640
I mean,

587
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,559
are you learning how to cook right now?

588
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,480
I have no idea.

589
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,799
They’ve been cooking for many years.

590
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,200
Suddenly they lost the ability
to cook overnight.

591
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,759
Isn’t that strange?

592
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,440
It’s not losing the ability.

593
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,799
We just can’t learn

594
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:34,960
what Chef Gu taught us.

595
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,799
Mr. Zhang.

596
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,200
If I remember correctly,

597
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,319
you just made
the abalone with oyster broth

598
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,839
several days ago.

599
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,920
I mean,

600
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
do you suddenly lose your memory
and not know how to cook?

601
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,799
I didn’t sleep well yesterday.
I did lose some memory.

602
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,000
Manager Shen.

603
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,359
How about this?

604
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,359
Since they all have bad memories,

605
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,000
then don’t make it difficult for them.

606
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,519
The kitchen needs some changes, too.

607
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,079
Let’s bring in some new people.

608
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,759
We’ve been working
in Bauhinia Hotel for years.

609
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:09,240
You little girl just came here

610
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,599
for a few days.

611
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,319
Now you want to fire us?

612
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,920
Do you really think
you are that important?

613
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,720
I do think...

614
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,440
Mr. Yu.

615
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,920
Look.

616
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,400
You’re our old cook in Bauhinia Hotel.

617
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:37,640
Right?

618
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,119
You’ve been working here

619
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,599
before I came.

620
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,079
Well,

621
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,160
now you can’t even get
the priorities straight?

622
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,960
What is the situation now?

623
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,640
Do you have to start troubles
at this critical moment?

624
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,759
I know

625
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,279
you feel angry.

626
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,160
Can we deal with it later

627
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,759
after we solve this problem?

628
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:02,839
And you guys.

629
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,279
You know who will be our guest tomorrow?

630
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,880
I don’t need to introduce

631
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,799
Ms. Zheng to you, right?

632
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:13,640
If the work gets affected
by your infighting,

633
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,200
no one can protect you!

634
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,160
Listen to me.

635
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,759
Let’s leave it there for today.

636
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,839
You’d better act your part.

637
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,359
Sorry, I’m not feeling well today.

638
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,720
I want to ask for leave.

639
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,440
Come on, Mr. Yu...

640
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,799
Mr. Yu...

641
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,359
Well...

642
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,759
What?

643
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,319
Get to work now!

644
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,119
They’re waiting for the food.

645
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,519
Take care. I’ll do it now.

646
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,720
Let’s work.

647
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:54,839
Okay.

648
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,980
= BLACK TRUFFLE =

649
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,119
Lucas?

650
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:58,079
I’m the director of FA Company

651
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,240
to cooperate with you.

652
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,279
Celine Xu?

653
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,039
Yes.

654
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:07,799
Yes.

655
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,960
You can call me Lu Junyi.

656
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,599
So you can speak Chinese, right?

657
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,639
Yes.

658
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,400
I’m also half Chinese.

659
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,079
Yeah.

660
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,320
I’m really not good at German.

661
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,280
I just learned those sentences.

662
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,039
I can hear that.

663
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,480
What a gentle man of you

664
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,159
for not exposing me.

665
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,719
Please have a seat.

666
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,360
Let’s speak Mandarin.

667
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,440
All right.

668
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,280
Well,

669
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:43,760
Boss.

670
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:45,480
If there is nothing else, I’ll leave now.

671
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,719
You wait for Miss Gu to get off work.

672
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,480
What’s the rush?

673
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,400
I... I took an Indonesian class.

674
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,960
I’ll be late if I don’t go now.

675
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Why do you love
minority languages so much?

676
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,079
I’m not a big fan of minority languages.

677
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,519
It’s because you were having business

678
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,800
with an Indonesian developer.

679
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
I thought it might help you

680
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
if I learn the language first.

681
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,960
Change the reason.

682
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,199
I’d like to tell you
about my recent love life.

683
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,519
I feel like my state right now...

684
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,599
All right, just go ahead.

685
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:15,796
What?

686
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,199
Miss Gu.

687
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,079
Go now.

688
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,239
I bought celery and beef today.

689
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,199
And...

690
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,480
cucumber.

691
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,480
Why is that?

692
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,079
A.

693
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,039
B.

694
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,960
C.

695
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:55,679
E.

696
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,400
The pronunciation is

697
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,119
A.

698
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,079
A.

699
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,920
Rising tone of Pinyin.

700
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,119
A.

701
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,280
The pronunciation is longer.

702
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,199
A.

703
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,039
Right?

704
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,199
A.

705
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:10,599
O is equivalent to O in Chinese pinyin.

706
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,559
Is it also longer?

707
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,559
Longer.

708
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,719
O.

709
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,239
O.

710
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,679
Okay, I got the third one.

711
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,639
That should be rising tone of Pinyin.

712
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,079
E.

713
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,599
Right?

714
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,880
Don’t try to be clever, Meng Xinjie.

715
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,719
E has two pronunciations in Indonesian.

716
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,760
One is E.

717
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,519
E.

718
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,880
The other is E.

719
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,360
E.

720
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,719
Repeat it.

721
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,079
A.

722
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:40,800
O.

723
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,760
E.

724
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,119
Pick it up.

725
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,000
There are only the two of us.

726
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,559
Although I am the only student,

727
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:50,639
I still have to obey the class discipline.

728
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,079
Go on.

729
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,159
Why is Gu Shengnan unhappy?

730
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,159
A.

731
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,480
B.

732
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:22,880
C.

733
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,239
D.

734
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,559
E.

735
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:26,679
F.

736
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,480
How would I know that? Ask yourself.

737
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,199
H.

738
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:30,400
I.

739
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,719
J.

740
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,079
I’m in a bad mood today.

741
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,719
Will you leave me alone?

742
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,400
What can I do to make you happy?

743
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
Well,

744
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,960
go somewhere with me.

745
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,320
I’d love to.

746
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,840
Nice talking to you, Mr. Lu.

747
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:24,639
Happy time is always short.

748
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,440
We’ll talk about my trip to Europe.

749
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,559
Next time.

750
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,960
See you next time.

751
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:34,880
I’ll see you off.

752
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,320
All right.

753
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,760
Let’s go.

754
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:48,639
Thank you.

755
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,320
Here you are.

756
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,519
How much is the duck egg?

757
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Shengnan.

758
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,760
How do you have time to come and see me?

759
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:25,800
