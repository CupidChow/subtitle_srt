to have acquired 44%

22
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,359
of Mingting’s share.

23
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:05,959
Brother,

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,520
did you attend the board meeting

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,719
because you want to take over Mingting?

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,159
Are you still angry?

27
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,800
It’s just a woman.

28
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,319
Why do you care so much?

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,479
The other day
when I sent her to your place,

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,960
it’d be very convenient

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,560
if I really wanted something to happen.

32
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:00,960
Brother,

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,599
I’m going upstairs first.

34
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,520
Ladies and gentlemen,

35
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,879
according to our latest constitution
of stakeholders,

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Zhenghong Group

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,800
owns 44% of the company’s shares.

38
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,360
Besides,

39
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,919
other shareholders that hold

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
7% of the company’s shares

41
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,159
have also delegated their voting rights
to Zhenghong.

42
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,319
As a result,

43
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,039
Zhenghong Group now enjoys over 50%

44
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,400
of the shareholders’ rights

45
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,000
and thus has become the controlling
shareholder of Mingting.

46
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,639
As requested by Zhenghong,

47
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,319
we are holding the meeting today.

48
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,000
The purpose of the meeting

49
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,159
is to re-elect the board of directors,

50
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,879
nominating Mr. Lu Jin
to be the new chairman.

51
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
You can find all the materials needed

52
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,120
in front of you.

53
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,279
Please have a look.

54
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,600
Wait.

55
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,000
Before that,

56
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,199
I have something here

57
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
that might interest Mr. Lu.

58
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,720
As required by you,

59
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,720
we have sold the rights and interests

60
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,319
of project Taiyue Lingshan
to the designated company.

61
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,120
The money will be transferred
to our account in a week.

62
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,160
Tell Chenxing

63
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
to send out the lawyer’s letter

64
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,319
they prepared.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,160
Yes, Sir.

66
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,680
It has cost you a lot to conspicuously

67
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,720
= Lawyer’s Letter =
claim Mingting’s shares.

68
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,000
Though our previous hidden troubles

69
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,680
have been alleviated thanks to you,

70
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,439
the whole group is still a sinking boat,

71
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,000
as you put it before.

72
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
There are fatal dangers and risk hidden

73
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,319
in every single link,

74
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,920
which will cost you a great deal to solve.

75
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,160
Let alone that you now need
to pay a huge amount of compensation.

76
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,480
My brother,

77
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,879
how much money are you left with?

78
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,439
You can go out first.

79
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,319
I want some privacy with him.

80
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,319
When did you start?

81
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
If you are referring to

82
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,319
Gu Shengnan and me,

83
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,120
we’ve never started.

84
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,800
From the very beginning,

85
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,439
we’ve been innocent,

86
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,800
and there’s been nothing between us.

87
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,439
If you’re asking about

88
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,000
when did I start to do this,

89
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,360
it was when I, as your brother,

90
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,720
first begged you to spare Mingting

91
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,920
but you rejected.

92
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,680
Brother,

93
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,680
you told me not

94
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,240
to be emotional when doing business.

95
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,480
I just want to see

96
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
whether you can

97
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,040
live up to your words.

98
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,800
I failed.

99
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,160
I’ve been emotional

100
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,000
when I worked.

101
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,920
Maybe it’s because I’m getting older.

102
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,240
I just can’t help feeling emotional.

103
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,360
You know what?

104
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Since I was a kid,

105
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,800
I’ve always seen you as a superhero

106
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,720
because you never lose.

107
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,240
Brother,

108
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,680
should I feel

109
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,360
sorry for you now

110
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,240
because you’ve discarded your principle,

111
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,360
or should I feel happy for you

112
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,720
because you are

113
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,439
no longer cold-blooded

114
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,439
and start to act as a human being?

115
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,480
I won’t blame you

116
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,079
for anything you’ve done
for your business.

117
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,720
Just one thing,

118
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,040
you shouldn’t have used Gu Shengnan.

119
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Don’t you dare mention her.

120
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,759
I use her

121
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,560
because she’s the woman you love.

122
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
It’s because she’s the woman I love

123
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,800
that you need to pay the price

124
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,439
for using her.

125
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,879
What do you mean?

126
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,439
Have a seat.

127
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,320
When Zhenghong acquired Mingting,

128
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,120
you secretly used Minting as the guarantee

129
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,759
for the project
between Taiyue and Chenxing.

130
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,759
Then you deliberately broke the contract

131
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,440
and transferred all the equities

132
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,320
to the firm you started,

133
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,519
leaving Mingting alone to face

134
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,759
the huge sum of compensation.

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,440
You are waiting to cash the project,

136
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:03,080
so that when Mingting is in danger again

137
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,440
you can claim the control of Mingting back

138
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,080
the way Zhenghong acquired Mingting.

139
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
You acted to be

140
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,519
at my disposal,

141
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,559
but you were simply trying to set me up,

142
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,960
weren’t you?

143
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,960
You are not patient enough.

144
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,320
You should have waited

145
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,519
until you get the money

146
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,559
and everything settled

147
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,759
before you show your hands.

148
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,279
Don’t forget that

149
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,320
Mingting is also Taiyue’s shareholder.

150
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,120
When you sold the project at a low price,

151
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,080
you also damaged
other shareholders’ interests.

152
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,639
Therefore, the first thing I’ll do

153
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,440
when I take over Mingting

154
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,039
is to call other shareholders

155
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,679
to freeze all the projects
by Taiyue Property,

156
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,399
including external guarantees
and businesses.

157
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,720
You won’t get the money.

158
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,879
Besides,

159
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,200
you’re way too naive.

160
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,679
I’ve told you before

161
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,240
that business is far more treacherous
than you imagine.

162
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,519
Don’t you ever trust people easily.

163
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:10,919
Come in.

164
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:32,919
Mr. Lu.

165
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,000
Your schoolmate,

166
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,000
Zhang Yimin,

167
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,240
GM of Chenxing Holdings.

168
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,360
You know him well, don’t you?

169
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,279
He’s but a professional broker.

170
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,399
Doesn’t necessarily mean what he says.

171
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,240
I now possess

172
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,120
the parent company of Chenxing

173
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,240
and I just signed a new

174
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,639
cooperation agreement with them.

175
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,919
The moment I signed,

176
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,279
this lawyer’s letter

177
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,320
is no longer valid.

178
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,159
Chenxing will turn its creditor’s rights
into shares

179
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,799
and thus become
Mingting’s new shareholder.

180
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,960
We will work together

181
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,000
to decrease your share

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,519
in Mingting.

183
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,399
My boy,

184
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,240
how are you going to win this game?

185
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,200
When did you start this?

186
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,840
Shengnan,

187
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,519
Please help me make up
with my brother.

188
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,799
Don’t worry. I got it.

189
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,039
There’ve been misunderstandings
between us.

190
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,159
Don’t tell him yet.

191
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,080
OK.

192
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,320
Shengnan, I’m in a competition
at the car dealer’s.

193
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,759
Come and cheer for me.

194
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,759
Come to the shop and I’ll teach you
how to drive.

195
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,799
Don’t think too much
about the picture thing.

196
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,639
My brother may have misunderstood

197
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,720
our relationship.

198
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,960
Don’t worry.
I’ll explain it to my brother.

199
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,159
Shengnan, why don’t you reply me?

200
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,200
I feel so bad after my dad passed away.

201
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,279
I want to chat with someone.

202
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,679
Shengnan, can I go to your place?

203
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,559
Don’t leave me

204
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,840
whatever I’m going to do next.

205
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,080
Doesn’t matter when I started.

206
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:31,919
Doesn’t matter.

207
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,159
Try this.

208
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,600
Fussy Lu,

209
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,759
you still ignore me despite
all the coaxing I’ve done.

210
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:57,759
Fine.

211
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,799
Then let’s not talk to each other anymore.

212
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:05,720
What?

213
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:09,879
Who’s that?

214
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,720
Sit here.

215
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,559
Didn’t you say you’d not talk to me?

216
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,600
Then why are you here?

217
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,080
Lu Zheng and I…

218
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,799
Don’t you…

219
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,679
Don’t you even mention Lu Zheng to me.

220
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,080
You had a fight with your brother and

221
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,720
you vented your anger on me?

222
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,360
Meng Xinjie told me everything.

223
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,799
You should’ve told me
that you were acting.

224
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,360
I can do well in acting, too.

225
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,360
Put it down.

226
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,960
I’ll use it as a hammer.

227
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,639
But it’s innocent.

228
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,360
I wasn’t gonna throw it anyway.

229
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,200
I’m hungry.

230
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,879
Stop being mad at me, will you?

231
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,080
I’m really hungry.

232
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,799
Then cook some noodles yourself.

233
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
I want you to cook them for me.

234
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Don’t go too far.

235
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,720
I can go even further.

236
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,480
Son,

237
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,200
come home with me.

238
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,720
Mom,

239
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,960
I’ve done my best.

240
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,519
But I just failed to keep Mingting.

241
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,600
I know.

242
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,720
I know all about it.
And I don’t blame you.

243
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,279
I just want you to be with me,

244
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,480
safe and sound.

245
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,919
I want nothing more.

246
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,919
Nothing more.

247
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,240
You’re pretending to be asleep?

248
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,119
Yeah.

249
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,759
Waken by the obsession in your eyes.

250
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,000
Nonsense.

251
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,880
You’re pulling my hair.

252
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:04,960
Get up.

253
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:05,839
No.

254
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,799
Get up.

255
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,599
Your hair is such a trouble.

256
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,359
Let me do your hair. Turn around.

257
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,079
Can I trust you on this?

258
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:13,839
Well…

259
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,359
I can’t. But I can learn.

260
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,359
How?

261
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:18,839
I don’t think I can trust you.

262
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,799
You can.

263
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,440
I’ve got an idea.

264
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,240
Stay still.

265
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,519
Stay still.

266
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:37,799
Hold it for me.

267
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:42,799
OK.

268
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,960
Stay still.

269
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:51,880
Done.

270
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,279
Perfect.

271
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,319
A spoon?

272
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,039
A spoon.

273
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,119
Yours.

274
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,119
Mine?

275
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,039
Yep.

276
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,039
My spoon.

277
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:08,559
You’ve been asking me

278
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,279
when I fell in love with you, right?

279
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It was the night

280
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,759
when I first had dinner

281
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,200
at your grandfather’s restaurant.

282
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,039
I had rice noodles with tinfoil clams.

283
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,279
It was impressive.

284
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,039
I couldn’t help wondering

285
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,039
whom the cook is.

286
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,440
So I went into the kitchen

287
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,279
and saw the view of your back.

288
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,799
You were like…

289
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,039
How did you get this spoon?

290
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,839
You grandfather got in suddenly

291
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,599
and you ran away,

292
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,519
leaving the spoon on the floor.

293
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,440
I picked it up and kept it till now.

294
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,079
It’s been with me all the time.

295
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,200
All the time?

296
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,039
All the time.

297
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,599
Just as the Prince picked up the shoe

298
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,119
that Cinderella had left,

299
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,680
you picked up the spoon

300
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,240
that I had left.

301
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,240
Romantic.

302
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,155
Don’t worry.

303
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:57,795
I’ll leave.

304
00:20:58,235 --> 00:20:59,315
Where will you go?

305
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:00,995
If you leave,

306
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:03,875
what about the jobs and livelihood

307
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,955
of the thousands of workers at Mingting?

308
00:21:05,955 --> 00:21:06,795
Who should they turn to?

309
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,435
I once said you should
be tough and independent.

310
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:16,635
Now you are.

311
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:18,955
Mingting is your responsibility now.

312
00:21:25,755 --> 00:21:26,795
I have not been

313
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:28,195
a good brother.

314
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:31,075
I apologize to you.

315
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:35,515
Please give me another chance.

316
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:42,875
Right, Zheng.

317
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:44,755
I’ve bought two remote control planes.

318
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:46,795
Let’s try them out someday.

319
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:01,395
Brother.

320
00:22:19,115 --> 00:22:19,995
Mrs. Lu,

321
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:22,955
what do you want me for today?

322
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:26,635
I’ve booked a flight

323
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:27,915
to Switzerland tomorrow.

324
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,995
I want Lu Jin to go with me.

325
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:32,715
And we are

326
00:22:32,955 --> 00:22:34,875
not coming back to Suhai anymore.

327
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:41,675
Well…

328
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:45,275
Does Lu Jin agree?

329
00:22:47,195 --> 00:22:48,715
That I don’t know.

330
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:50,675
Miss Gu,

331
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:52,235
who do you think

332
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:55,275
Lu Jin will choose,

333
00:22:55,715 --> 00:22:56,995
you or me?

334
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:02,995
If he chooses you,

335
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:04,115
that means

336
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:05,715
he will have to

337
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:08,115
abandon his biological mother
who brought him up.

338
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:11,115
And he’ll end up in guilt.

339
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:13,915
But if he chooses me,

340
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:16,435
he’ll blame me

341
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:17,915
for ruining his love,

342
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:20,515
and will end up in regret.

343
00:23:23,955 --> 00:23:25,355
I have an early flight tomorrow.

344
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:27,555
I need to go pack things up.

345
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:29,355
So

346
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:31,595
let’s end our conversation.

347
00:23:33,355 --> 00:23:34,195
Mrs. Lu,

348
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:41,115
if you do want to force Lu Jin

349
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:42,675
to make a choice,

350
00:23:46,315 --> 00:23:47,195
then

351
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:56,235
I’ll quit.

352
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:07,475
Miss Gu,

353
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:09,915
you just give up on my son like that?

354
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,115
I thought you were deeply
in love with him.

355
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:15,195
I don’t quit

356
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:18,475
because I don’t love him

357
00:24:19,995 --> 00:24:21,395
or I am frightened.

358
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:23,515
I quit

359
00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:27,475
exactly because I love him very much.

360
00:24:28,195 --> 00:24:29,275
I don’t want him to lose

361
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:31,235
a loving mother because of me.

362
00:24:32,635 --> 00:24:34,435
No one in the world

363
00:24:35,315 --> 00:24:37,515
will feel truly happy

364
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:40,115
if they lose their mother’s
support and blessings.

365
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,435
I just want him to be happy.

366
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:48,795
That’s all I want.

367
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:52,195
Mrs. Lu,

368
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:56,955
Some day in the future,

369
00:24:58,715 --> 00:24:59,595
you will

370
00:25:01,475 --> 00:25:03,435
be with your proud son

371
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:07,515
in the far-off country of Switzerland,

372
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:10,035
staying in a luxurious villa,

373
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:12,875
by the warm fire,

374
00:25:13,435 --> 00:25:15,115
or by the fancy table

375
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:17,875
having premium food.

376
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:21,275
Lu Jin will be sweet enough
to serve you food,

377
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:22,395
talking about

378
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,755
the restaurant he recently acquires

379
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:27,195
or the profit he recently makes.

380
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:29,875
Then, please remember

381
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:33,035
my sacrifice for

382
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:36,195
the happiness you feel at that moment.

383
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,795
Your happiness comes from

384
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:41,675
a humble,

385
00:25:42,355 --> 00:25:44,595
poor and insignificant cook,

386
00:25:44,715 --> 00:25:46,635
who will guard her kitchen

387
00:25:48,635 --> 00:25:49,675
for the rest of her life.

388
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:01,595
Will you keep your promise?

389
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:05,995
I will.

390
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:31,635
Mrs. Lu.

391
00:26:32,755 --> 00:26:33,875
I wish you happy.

392
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:15,155
= Fussy Lu =

393
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:46,875
Mom, where’s Shengnan?

394
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:49,755
Isn’t she with you?

395
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,715
Why doesn’t she pick up my phone?

396
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:01,275
Did you say something bad to her?

397
00:28:08,635 --> 00:28:10,755
Why do you hate her so much?

398
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,875
I’ve never said that I hate her.

399
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:15,515
On the contrary,

400
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,715
I find this girl

401
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:19,515
quite lovely.

402
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:21,635
It’s a test again.

403
00:28:25,195 --> 00:28:26,035
What’s the conclusion?

404
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:27,755
What’s the conclusion?

405
00:28:30,595 --> 00:28:31,995
The conclusion is, I’m satisfied.

406
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:36,915
You have a good taste in woman,

407
00:28:37,755 --> 00:28:38,675
my son.

408
00:28:43,075 --> 00:28:44,595
Mom, you owe me big.

409
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:49,035
Wait.

410
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,195
Tell Gu Shengnan to come by
for dinner tonight.

411
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:54,675
And also tell her

412
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:56,275
that my happiness

413
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,035
doesn’t need her sacrifice.

414
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:08,195
Why are you here?

415
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:19,435
Sometimes I can’t help doubting

416
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,195
whether you love me or not.

417
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:24,955
Of course I love you.

418
00:30:25,755 --> 00:30:27,755
Then why did you give up on me
just like that?

419
00:30:36,315 --> 00:30:37,755
Your mom told you everything?

420
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:38,515
Yes.

421
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:41,115
And she also asked me to tell you

422
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:43,995
that she’s happy.

423
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,435
That she doesn’t need your sacrifice.

424
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:49,675
I don’t want to put you into a dilemma,

425
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:51,435
because I know

426
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:55,675
that your mom is very important to you.

427
00:30:58,235 --> 00:31:00,675
But you are very important to me, too

428
00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:03,955
She wants me to tell you

429
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:05,915
that she thinks highly of you

430
00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:09,595
that her son has a good taste in woman.

431
00:31:11,195 --> 00:31:12,635
That’s why she invites you

432
00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:14,195
to my home for dinner tonight.

433
00:31:26,915 --> 00:31:27,715
She…

434
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:30,475
She finally approves of me?

435
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:40,715
I’m putting away the luggage.

436
00:31:42,795 --> 00:31:43,595
Don’t bother.

437
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:45,155
Bring it along with you to my place.

438
00:32:19,835 --> 00:32:20,475
Mom.

439
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:21,515
Mrs. Lu.

440
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:22,995
You’re back.

441
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:27,795
Bring Shengnan’s luggage up to your room.

442
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:32,515
I’m on it.

443
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:43,635
The house maid

444
00:32:44,315 --> 00:32:45,395
is on leave today.

445
00:32:46,435 --> 00:32:47,635
So the dishes tonight…

446
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,795
I get it.

447
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:50,435
Leave it to me. I can cook everything.

448
00:32:51,075 --> 00:32:52,355
That’s not what I mean.

449
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:55,515
I haven’t cooked for years.

450
00:32:56,555 --> 00:32:58,675
So I’m going to prepare
some dishes for you.

451
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:05,555
There you go.

452
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:06,355

So you don’t need to prepare
a wedding gift for us.

Don’t say sorry.
