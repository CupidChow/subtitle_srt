20
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,200
Ms. Zheng, you asked for me?

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,280
You’ve been back for days.

22
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,599
If I didn’t ask for you,

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,960
you would not come to see me.

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,599
I didn’t do my job well.

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,000
Tell me about it.

26
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,680
My son

27
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,240
went to Suhai from Zhuozhou.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
Now he’s not even going
back to Switzerland.

29
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,759
What’s so special

30
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,520
about the Bauhinia Hotel?

31
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,439
You sounded so upset, too.

32
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,759
I’m sorry.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,919
As far as I know,

34
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,199
Lu Jin admired

35
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,039
a female cook in Suhai.

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,360
He’s staying

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
because of her.

38
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,280
A female cook?

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,680
No wonder.

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,919
I’m not surprised.

41
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,240
How come you don’t

42
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,280
even know what to do?

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,000
I’m not good enough.

44
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,360
You’ve done good enough.

45
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,319
I’m satisfied.

46
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,360
However, Lu Jin should

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,719
take more important responsibility.

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,319
He shouldn’t be obsessed with food.

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,199
The Group requires him to be committed.

50
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,560
Of course,

51
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,960
the Group needs you too.

52
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,919
Understand?

53
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,680
Yes.

54
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Good.

55
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,759
Book me a ticket to Suhai.

56
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,039
I’d like to see

57
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,680
what kind of cuisine

58
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,240
this girl from a second-rate hotel
can cook.

59
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,479
Sure.

60
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,879
Hi, Mr. Lu.

61
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,319
Mom.

62
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,120
Son.

63
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,560
You should have told me in advanced,

64
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,120
so I can go and pick you up.

65
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,959
Have a seat, Mom.

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,079
I’ve heard that you have

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,480
some good news to share.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,879
So I couldn’t wait to come.

69
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,399
Well.

70
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,399
Who gossiped about me again?

71
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,199
Are you dating now?

72
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,879
Yeah,

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,560
but I’m still chasing her.

74
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,680
What kind of girl that’s so hard to get?

75
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,560
Mom, I know that you’ve made

76
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,879
a thorough background check about her.

77
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,079
Don’t set me up.

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,199
I’m glad that there’s someone for you.

79
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:16,959
However,

80
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,439
I don’t think

81
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,439
Miss Gu is perfect for you,

82
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,279
from her look to family background.

83
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,680
Li Man is a more suitable girl.

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,199
After all, you two

85
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,600
have been working together for long,

86
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,120
and you know about each other.

87
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,759
That’s exactly why we

88
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,759
can not

89
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,920
become a couple.

90
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,920
The best relationship is to be partners.

91
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,680
Or you may lose a perfect staff.

92
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,519
So you like someone who’s new.

93
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,000
How come you didn’t fall

94
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,879
for Australian shipping tycoon’s daughter

95
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,480
who liked you?

96
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,680
Mom, she was

97
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,720
so young

98
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,639
and spoiled.

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,519
I couldn’t handle her.

100
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,920
Miss Gu is young, too.

101
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,240
Yeah, so I’m lucky that

102
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,759
it’s nice that she didn’t

103
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,959
turn me down for my age.

104
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,480
Fine.

105
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,279
How about the daughter of Mr. Jiang,

106
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,680
our partner in Australia?

107
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,279
She’s about your age.

108
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,360
She’s a business woman,

109
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,199
and she’s too aggressive.

110
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
We may have

111
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,399
multiple conflicts.

112
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,839
I heard that Miss Gu is tough, too.

113
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,639
Yes.

114
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,399
That’s why she’s good for

115
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,360
a difficult guy like me.

116
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,399
A great match.

117
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,439
If

118
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,560
you’re so interested in

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,240
Miss Gu,

120
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,040
arrange us a meeting

121
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,759
so that I can meet her, too.

122
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,560
No.

123
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,199
I...

124
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:04,959
What?

125
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,920
Your mom wants to meet me?

126
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,079
It’s too soon to meet your parent.

127
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,399
Why would I?

128
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,000
Who am I?

129
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,759
What’s my place to meet your mom?

130
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,040
I’m not going.

131
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,480
It’ll be very casual.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,079
Take it easy.

133
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,480
A random date.

134
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,879
I’m sorry.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,279
I never meet someone randomly.

136
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,560
It’s not random.

137
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,480
It’s serious.

138
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,240
Just go,

139
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,000
please.

140
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
I’ll think about it.

141
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,480
Sure.

142
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,879
That’s great, Gu Shengnan.

143
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,040
This is my secret guide,

144
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,519
100 things you need to know about.

145
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,959
Don’t laugh.

146
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,000
Zhaodi, that’s too much for her.

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,040
Highlight the key points for her.

148
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,759
The key is

149
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,439
“the tailor makes the men”.

150
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,000
You need to be pretty with elegance,

151
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,199
and be elegant with grace.

152
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,519
Graceful with a little bit of dignity.

153
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,279
What are you trying to say?

154
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Lesson starts.

155
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,840
Don’t move.

156
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,440
Firstly,

157
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,519
he’s 36 and you’re 21.

158
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,080
You’re in totally different times.

159
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,960
I need to eliminate the gap between you,

160
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,879
so that you two can match.

161
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,519
Then,

162
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,919
it’s about manner.

163
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,639
Sit and stand in place.

164
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,879
Be prepared for any

165
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,519
possible accidents.

166
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,879
What do you mean?

167
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,639
Don’t look, move and scream.

168
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,879
Remember.

169
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,440
Don’t look around

170
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,799
no matter what happens.

171
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,120
Keep listening peacefully.

172
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
This is manner.

173
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,039
Got it?

174
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:24,720
Yes.

175
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,639
Don’t cross your eyes.

176
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,639
Remember.

177
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,440
Before you answer any questions,

178
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,879
smile politely to whoever raises it.

179
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,120
Make sure your volume

180
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,879
is smaller than his or hers.

181
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,679
How can I make sure of that?

182
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,840
Just talk mildly in a low voice.

183
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,440
Finally,

184
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,360
once his mom

185
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,039
says anything that embarrass you…

186
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,879
Gu Shengnan,

187
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,279
you’re no good for my son.

188
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:46,799
That’s not...

189
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,720
Hold it.

190
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,919
Don’t conflict with her so soon.

191
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,399
What should I do then?

192
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
You can smile to her

193
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,279
and say: “Excuse me. I’m not feeling well.

194
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,440
shall we talk next time?”

195
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,960
Then get out of there gracefully.

196
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,799
Okay.

197
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,679
- We’re done. Class dismissed.
- We’re done. Class dismissed.

198
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,720
I’m at the entrance of Quan’an SS Couture.

199
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,360
Where are you?

200
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,320
I didn’t see you.

201
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,200
I’m here.

202
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,200
Long time no see.

203
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,879
Do I look different?

204
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,200
What…

205
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,639
What you wear is...

206
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,559
Ugly? Does it look too mature?

207
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,360
No.

208
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,720
I picked the wrong outfit.

209
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:19,759
Shall we?

210
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,919
Yeah.

211
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,639
I’m good.

212
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,320
Be careful.

213
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:56,960
Miss Gu.

214
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,320
How old are you?

215
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,440
Ms. Zheng,

216
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,120
I’m 21 years old.

217
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,200
I just had my birthday and I’m a Scorpio.

218
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,120
Lu Jin

219
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,080
is a Scorpio, too.

220
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,320
This year is his year of fate.

221
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,080
He’s 36.

222
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,360
Miss Gu dressed up

223
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
rather maturely at such a young age.

224
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,639
I always look mature.

225
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,879
Why did you choose to

226
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,559
become a cook?

227
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,960
Ms. Zheng,

228
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,159
it’s because of

229
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,159
my family tradition.

230
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,639
Three generations of my family were cooks.

231
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,360
My grandpa said

232
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,120
some family members

233
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,159
used to serve in the imperial kitchen.

234
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,360
Grew up in a family like this,

235
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,840
I was drowned into this atmosphere.

236
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,159
Slowly I became

237
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,919
very interested in cooking.

238
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,879
That’s why I became a cook.

239
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,720
Also,

240
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,679
I read a book

241
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,559
a long time ago,

242
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,799
which said that

243
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,360
“Only three things in this world

244
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,720
can break through the limits of

245
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,440
time, space and language to develop

246
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,799
free communications between people”.

247
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,919
Which three things?

248
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:24,679
Music,

249
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,720
food and

250
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,080
love.

251
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,360
I don’t have gifts in music.

252
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,720
So cooking food is my thing.

253
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,559
I’d like to cook for

254
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,720
my loved ones forever.

255
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,120
Anything wrong with your throat?

256
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,919
It’s falling.

257
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,840
It’s falling.

258
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,320
What’s falling?

259
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,639
Your eyelash.

260
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,159
What, what is falling?

261
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,080
My eyelash is falling?

262
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,120
It almost falls off.

263
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:23,879
The other side.

264
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,600
You should have told me earlier.

265
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,120
Good?

266
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,639
Son,

267
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,399
would you give me a minute

268
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,399
alone with Miss Gu?

269
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,639
We’d like to talk about women stuff.

270
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,720
Women stuff?

271
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,559
It’s still not fixed.

272
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,639
Let me fetch you some desserts.

273
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,279
Miss Gu,

274
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,399
are you in need of money?

275
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,919
Ms. Zheng,

276
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,120
I don’t know if

277
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,919
you’ve asked many girls the same question.

278
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,159
And I don’t know what their answers are.

279
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,320
But mine is,

280
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:37,080
yes, I am.

281
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,559
I need money because

282
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,639
my grandpa is old.

283
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,639
I’d like him to enjoy his life soon.

284
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,360
I need money because

285
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:48,039
my rent is rising again next month.

286
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,679
I need to make more money

287
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,120
to cover it.

288
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,399
But all based on the facts that

289
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,799
I’m earning the money all by my own.

290
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,639
Don’t look, move and scream!

291
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,080
I’m sorry.

292
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,399
Go, you’re not needed here.

293
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,279
What I’m about to offer is an

294
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,120
impossible amount for you this lifetime.

295
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,080
Tell me,

296
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,279
how much do you want to leave my son?

297
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,799
Don’t conflict with her so soon.

298
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,720
You can smile to her

299
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,799
and say: “Excuse me. I’m not feeling well.

300
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,960
Shall we talk next time?”

301
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,480
Then get out of there gracefully.

302
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,519
Excuse me, Ms. Zheng.

303
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,039
I’m a bit tired.

304
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,320
Maybe we can talk next time.

305
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,160
Where’s she?

306
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,119
She’s gone.

307
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,839
Why?

308
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,559
She said she was tired.

309
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
What do you think of her?

310
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,960
Not bad.

311
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,720
Did my mom really ask you that question?

312
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,839
It’s normal for her

313
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,240
to check on me.

314
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,799
She’s your mom.

315
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,599
Many girls go after you

316
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,039
for your money.

317
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,799
But I do feel a little weird

318
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,079
when she offered me

319
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,400
money.

320
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:57,039
So your first impression of my mom

321
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,599
is not perfect.

322
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,559
It’s not true.

323
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,319
I think she’s fine, really.

324
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,279
She’s not hypocritical but frank.

325
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,440
That’s cool.

326
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,279
Cool?

327
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,960
Alright, you should go.

328
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,200
Or your mom would offer me money again.

329
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,880
Actually,

330
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,559
Maybe it’s worth considering to leave you

331
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:19,200
in exchange for a big amount of money.

332
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,839
I dare you to say it again.

333
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,440
It depends on how much you’re worth.

334
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,279
I guess, for you, I can get

335
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,759
10 or 20 thousand.

336
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,519
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

337
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,559
Just kidding. Just kidding.

338
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,839
Don’t say things like that again.

339
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,960
Okay.

340
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,799
Water is ready.

341
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,599
I’ll get it.

342
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,440
Maybe you should come down first.

343
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,359
Let’s go together.

344
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,920
Okay.

345
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,079
I’ll be careful.

346
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
Hold me tighter.

347
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,599
Okay.

348
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,480
Turn it off.

349
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,279
Let me.

350
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,720
The other one.

351
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,079
Got it.

352
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,359
Silly.

353
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,680
Miss Li, we’re ready.

354
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,000
It’s time. It’s time.

355
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,920
Serve the food.

356
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,039
Miss Li.

357
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,200
Mr. Cheng.

358
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,759
We didn’t invite you to vote

359
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,759
during the tasting,

360
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,359
because we’d like you to

361
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,880
vote for the real delicacy

362
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,960
after it’s finished.

363
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,519
We hope that

364
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,440
our food can match Ms. Zheng’s standard.

365
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,039
Mr. Cheng.

366
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,240
Mr. Liu.

367
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:40,319
What do you think?

368
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,960
Do you have confidence?

369
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
It doesn’t matter. We won’t win anyway.

370
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,319
This time, the head chef

371
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,440
would definitely be Mr. Yu.

372
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,079
Right.

373
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
This is a fair chance.

374
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,480
Everyone has a possibility to win.

375
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,720
Yeah.

376
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,920
We won’t win exactly because

377
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,160
it’s a fair competition.

378
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,799
Yeah.

379
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,640
That’s your current thoughts.

380
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,200
Whoever wins

381
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,759
gives the prize to me.

382
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,920
Seems like Miss Gu

383
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,200
is ambitious for more.

384
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,079
You have to show real skills

385
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,640
if you want to win.

386
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,440
Yes.

387
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,119
Mr. Yu is the leader of our kitchen.

388
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:27,039
We all count on him.

389
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,079
Mr. Yu,

390
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,039
don’t forget to treat after you win.

391
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,319
You all work very hard

392
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,759
while cooking.

393
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,759
If you’re not ambitious at all,

394
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,200
why don’t you just quit?

395
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,960
They’ve finished. It’s finished!

396
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,480
It’s your turn now.

397
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:45,759
Let’s go.

398
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,160
Come on!

399
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,200
Come on!

400
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,559
Mr. Wang,

401
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,920
what are you thinking?

402
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,079
I’m thinking that

403
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:01,480
if I win,

404
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,160
I’ll spend the bonus

405
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:06,200
on taking her to

406
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
travel around the world.

407
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,519
We will go and see the stars

408
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,400
and the moon.

409
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:15,920
Who is she?

410
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,480
Why do you care?

411
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,839
Yeah, why do I care?

412
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,079
Miss Li.

413
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,759
Chefs.

414
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,519
From the votes of

415
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,920
Miss Li, Mr. Cheng and me.

416
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,720
Our chef of the reception dinner

417
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,839
is decided.

418
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,519
She is

419
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,359
Gu Shengnan.

420
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,720
The goals of our project

421
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:02,839
cover hotel orientation,

422
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,400
hotel philosophy,

423
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,279
business service and cultural tourism.

424
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,599
Now let me go through the details

425
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,839
of our hotel philosophy.

426
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,400
I’m elected! Let’s have dinner together.

427
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,279
I’ll choose where.

428
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:15,960
Our supporting points are parent-child

429
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,440
entertainment and cultural tourism.

430
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,160
And we are

431
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,240
looking forward to fostering the hotel…

432
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,279
Just the two of us?

433
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,880
= Yeah. =
To become the perfect holiday resort.

434
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,359
Okay.

435
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,839
That’s all with our project plan.

436
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,920
♪ Islands look like little stars ♪

437
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,400
Thank you all for today, bye-bye.

438
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:39,640
Shengnan, wait for me.

439
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,680
Thank you.

440
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,279
The chef has left.

441
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,559
Why are you staying?

442
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,319
Mr. Yu,

443
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,680
I’m not lecturing.

444
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,160
You’re too generous to

445
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,680
let the witless girl win.

446
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,799
Aren’t you

447
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,440
angry at all?

448
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,039
Like being angry could help.

449
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:11,440
She’s got strong backing.

450
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Backing?

451
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,759
Remember the guest from room 1123?

452
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,559
He eventually purchased our hotel

453
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,920
and became the boss of our boss.

454
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,079
That’s why Gu Shengnan could quit
and come back twice.

455
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,039
The hotel gave her an employment offer

456
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,799
for her come back.

457
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,799
They two have

458
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,319
a relationship.

459
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,440
I didn’t say anything.

460
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:42,920
That’s right.

461
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,440
He’s the boss.

462
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,920
It’s a piece of cake

463
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,799
to let her be in charge.

464
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,960
So we

465
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,839
spared so much effort but

466
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,920
all for nothing is because of Gu Shengnan.

467
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,319
I think Mr. Yu is the best.

468
00:27:58,759 --> 00:27:59,839
I don’t care about anyone else.

469
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,920
As for the head chef,

470
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:06,160
it’s not decided yet.

471
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,920
It has to wait until the chairman

472
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,319
to taste it.

473
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,279
The chairman is his mom,

474
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,039
she would listen to his son, right?

475
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,400
Let’s go.

476
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,160
Don’t be mad.

477
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,559
Here, my treat today,

478
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:22,680
let’s have a drink tonight.

479
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:23,920
Let’s go.

480
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,160
Let’s go.

481
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,860
= Yard Fry Diner =

482
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,799
Aunts.

483
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,680
Wang, this is my bestie Xu Zhaodi.

484
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,079
Hello.

485
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,200
Enjoy your meal.

486
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,920
Help me with these and distribute to them.

487
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,960
Shengnan.

488
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,559
Shengnan.

489
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,480
Come, come.

490
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,559
Little Aunt.

491
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,440
Shengnan.

492
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,079
Little Aunt.

493
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,440
I know you’re the best.

494
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,680
Why didn’t you tell me?

495
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,279
Come here and let me introduce someone.

496
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,559
Come here, come here.

497
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,559
Mr. Lu.

498
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,160
Let me introduce,

499
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,799
this is my little aunt.

500
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,559
My little aunt.

501
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,440
Hi, Aunt.

502
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,839
This man is very handsome

503
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,920
and looks successful.

504
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
What’s your name?

505
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,839
I’m Lu Jin.

506
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,559
You can call me Lu.

507
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,920
You don’t have to talk that loud.
I’m not deaf.

508
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,799
Her hearing is fine.

509
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,039
Okay, Little Aunt.

510
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,160
Sit down and enjoy the food.

511
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,079
Go, go.

512
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,039
You too.

513
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,039
What’s the matter?

514
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,279
Shengnan.

515
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,039
Is this the dinner you were talking about?

516
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,519
What’s wrong?

517
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,440
Does the food look bad?

518
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,400
Fussy Lu,

519
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,680
you used to seize every chance

520
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,920
to eat here.

521
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,799
I don’t mean that. I mean...

522
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,079
What do you mean?

523
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,759
I thought it’d be just the two of us.

524
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,279
I didn’t expect this, either.

525
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:34,039
But Grandpa wanted to make this big.

526
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,920
We haven’t had a big feast for long.

527
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,319
He’s old. He enjoys the crowd.

528
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:41,039
Or else why wouldn’t he want to

529
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,200
leave here at such an old age?

530
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,160
Everyone.

531
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,200
Today I’m hosting to celebrate

532
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,640
for my granddaughter Gu Shengnan.

533
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:52,839
Shengnan.

534
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,920
Come here, Shengnan.

535
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,079
This is my granddaughter.

536
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,759
You know her, right?

537
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,559
Yeah.

538
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,519
We watched her grow up.

539
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,119
We still remember her as a little girl.

540
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,119
Uncle,

541
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:09,880
please.

542
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,920
I’m shy.

543
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:11,799
Okay.

544
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,279
Before today,

545
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,960
I didn’t agree her to be a cook.

546
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:21,519
It’s hard for a girl to stay
in the kitchen all day

547
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,759
with all the smoke.

548
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,759
There aren’t many female cooks

549
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,680
in this industry.

550
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Earlier she was just an assistant cook.

551
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,319
I didn’t expect much from her.

552
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,279
But out of my surprise,

553
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,160
she’s not only talented

554
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,039
but also a hard worker.

555
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,960
There’s finally a female head chef working

556
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:43,920
at a five-star hotel in our family.

557
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,640
I’m only the head chef
for this reception dinner.

558
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,920
You’re still a head chef.

559
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:52,960
Everyone.

560
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,680
It’s my treat today.

561
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,759
Enjoy yourself

562
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,440
with all the food and drinks.

563
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,279
Order as many as you want.

564
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,559
Okay.

565
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,759
Enjoy.

566
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,200
Hold the applause.

567
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:09,279
Let me introduce an honored guest to you.

568
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:11,200
He’s the boss of Shengnan,

569
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,160
the chairman of the hotel and

570
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,799
the CEO of the Group, Mr. Lu.

571
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,799
Welcome, Mr. Lu.

572
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:30,680
Mr. Lu.

573
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,519
Will Grandpa Gu embarrass him?

574
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,039
Mr. Lu has experienced
all kinds of occasions.

575
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,440
He can handle it.

576
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,160
Mr. Lu.

577
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,440
First of all.

578
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,319
What’s your relationship with Shengnan?

579
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,559
Yeah.

580
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,559
Are you just superior and subordinate?

581
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,039
Stop kidding. Listen to him.

582
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,799
I think an explanation is needed to make.

583
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,319
Gu Shengnan is

584
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,680
indeed my...

585
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
Girlfriend?

586
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,519
It’s your fault, then.

587
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,759
How come you picked here to host

588
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,279
when you have such a rich grandson-in-law.

589
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,160
He’s so stingy. Am I right?

590
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,440
Yeah.

591
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,319
Stop it, stop it.

592
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,839
Well.

593
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:24,759
Liu, Mili,

594
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:26,160
don’t think you can hide in the last row.

595
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,039
I know it was you.

596
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,200
You too, Uncle.

597
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,559
As an elder,

598
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,039
stop joking like they did.

599
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,079
No wonder why my aunt is strict with you.

600
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:36,680
Let’s stop here.

601
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,920
Everyone here has

602
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,160
either watched me grow up

603
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,759
or grown up with me.

604
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,279
Let’s save the words.

605
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,039
Let’s make a toast.

606
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,799
Everyone joins me. Cheers.

607
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,920
Yeah, cheers.

608
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,680
Cheers.

609
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,759
Cheers, cheers.

610
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:58,160
Cheers.

611
00:33:58,759 --> 00:33:59,799
Enjoy yourself.

612
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,920
Cheers everyone.

613
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,920
He failed.

614
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,800
Didn’t expect Mr. Lu to experience this.

615
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,440
Your boss is definitely new to this.

616
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,440
It’s normal.

617
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,559
Hey, cheers.

618
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,000
Try this. Grandpa made it.

619
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,320
Shengnan.

620
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,440
Sit down, please.

621
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,719
Here, sit down.

622
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,000
What’s the matter?

623
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,920
Shengnan.

624
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,880
Don’t sit here all the time.

625
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,440
Go to your aunts.

626
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,360
Don’t forget to toast

627
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,559
for today is your big day.

628
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,320
Sure, sure.

629
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,159
Don’t worry. I’ll be back soon.

630
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,079
Okay?

631
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,599
Shengnan.

632
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,159
Don’t worry.

633
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,360
I’ll take care of Mr. Lu.

634
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,079
Okay.

635
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,559
You guys talk.

636
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:07,360
Okay, okay.

637
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,760
Hi, Aunts.

638
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,559
Come and sit.

639
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,199
You’re

640
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,239
a decent guy.

641
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,360
You look nice in this suit.

642
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,559
Very good.

643
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,159
I think you look

644
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:32,679
very familiar.

645
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,239
Have you been here before?

646
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,920
Yes.

647
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,119
I am a regular here.

648
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,679
That’s nice

649
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,320
of you.

650
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,639
That’s better.

651
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,599
Lu,

652
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,559
can I call you that?

653
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:51,400
Of course.

654
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:52,960
Okay.

655
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,320
Lu, how old are you?

656
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,639
I’m 36 years old.

657
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,159
36?

658
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,159
You’re not getting any younger.

659
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,599
Have you been divorced?

660
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,760
Any children?

661
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,679
I never got married and had no children.

662
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:10,880
Is your health condition alright?

663
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,760
I’m very healthy.

664
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,440
Great.

665
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:17,199
Health is the essence of everything.

666
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,079
I’ve heard of you

667
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,760
from Zhaodi and Quan’an.

668
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,679
I’m old.

669
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,480
No matter what will happen with you two,

670
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,400
I’ve got to say something.

671
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,880
Yes, please.

672
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,440
I raised Shengnan

673
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,960
after her parents’ divorce.

674
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,320
They didn’t do much for her nor

675
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:45,719
spend much money.

676
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,079
They even borrowed from me

677
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,559
to pay for her school fees.

678
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:55,559
It was my pension.

679
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,320
Not a small amount and it was all I had.

680
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,679
Mr. Gu,

681
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,679
I’ve been looking for you. Here you are.

682
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,400
We’re out of rice noodles.

683
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,199
Cook some please. We’re waiting for you.

684
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,920
Alright.

685
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,480
Quickly.

686
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,559
Sure.

687
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:10,960
Lu,

688
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,920
no matter how things between you go,

689
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,079
remember to tell her

690
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,480
to repay

691
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,960
my money.

692
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,400
It’s my pension.

693
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,159
Mr. Gu,

694
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,320
hurry.

695
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
I’m coming.

696
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,639
Enjoy, I’ll be back.

697
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,880
I’m coming. Be patient.

698
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,360
Zhaodi, let’s play a game.

699
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,400
Do you know “Fifteen and Twenty”?

700
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,719
Of course.

701
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,920
I’ve finished mine.

702
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,440
I’ll go back. Just help yourself.

703
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,239
Have fun.

704
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,159
Aunt,

705
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,679
didn’t expect you to lose.

706
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,800
Here, cheers.

707
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,320
Come on. Fifteen, twenty, fifteen.

708
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,679
Aunt.

709
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,880
Aunt.

710
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:02,920
Lu, don’t call me that.

711
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
I’m Shengnan’s little aunt.

712
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,079
You should call me that, too.

713
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:09,960
Little aunt.

714
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:13,599
I brought this medicinal liquor.

715
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,079
It’s very healthy.

716
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
I assume you’re not young.

717
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,119
Shengnan is young. She can get wild.

718
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,440
You can’t.

719
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,159
You should be careful with health.

720
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,199
Yes.

721
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:26,960
Mr. Lu.

722
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,199
I’m Shengnan’s uncle.

723
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,000
From today,

724
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,760
I’ll see you as my relative, too.

725
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,480
Here, we should have a drink.

726
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,440
Come on.

727
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,079
I, I...

728
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:37,840
Come on.

729
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,320
Well.

730
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,760
I’ll drink this up.

731
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,239
No, no need for that.

732
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,159
Drink it.

733
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,920
Drink it. Drink it.

734
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,679
Finish it.

735
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:53,320
Drink it.

736
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,440
- Nice.
- Mr. Lu. You’re a real man.

737
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,559
- Great, a real man.
- Well, Mr. Lu.

738
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,559
There’s a rule here.

739
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,159
Good things should be in pairs.

740
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,159
Here, let’s toast again.

741
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,159
Come on, Mr. Lu.

742
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,400
Hey, don’t drink with him.

743
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,639
He’s a drunkard.

744
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:16,199
What? You’re a drunkard.

745
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,639
If you start drinking with him,

746
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,920
it won’t finish

747
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,000
until tomorrow morning.

748
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:24,119
Uncle, step aside.

749
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:26,239
I’ve got business to discuss with Mr. Lu.

750
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,760
Mr. Lu.

751
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,920
He’s a nobody who sells chicken claws.

752
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,840
What business can you have?

753
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,920
Stop the nonsense.

754
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,000
Go, go.

755
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,960
I can’t reason with you.

756
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:37,000
It’s a waste of time.

757
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:38,719
Here, let’s drink.

758
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,239
Mr. Lu.

759
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,480
My last name is Ji,

760
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,679
same as Ji Fa’s.

761
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,119
So my work is involved with chicken.
(“Ji” pronounces the same as “chicken”.)

762
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,559
It’s the king of chicken claws.

763
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,559
