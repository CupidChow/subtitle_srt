You had a couple of drinks tonight,

don’t drive me home.

22
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,200
I won’t,

00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,519
I’ll get us a designated driver.

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,000
No.

25
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,920
I have a friend nearby.

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,400
He’ll be here soon.

27
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,120
Zhaodi, here I am.

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,359
Don’t get in now.

29
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,319
I’ll turn the car around.

30
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,400
He’s from the north.

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,800
I could see that.

32
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,039
He’s cool.

33
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,000
I’m leaving, then.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,479
Let’s have fun next time.

35
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,039
Okay.

36
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,000
Tell me when you are home.

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,360
What are you doing?

38
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,080
Why are you still standing there?

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
Get in the car.

40
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,199
I’ll take you to enjoy some ginseng.

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,360
See you.

42
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,520
Hurry up!

43
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Cool man, see you.

45

Zhaodi.

Who is this girl?

47
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,400
Are you blind, Uncle?

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Oh, you recognize me.

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,680
Fine. I’ll stop pretending.

50
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,680
What a tiring day!

51
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
A tiring day?

52
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,000
Look what the hell you’re wearing.

53
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,120
Slicked-back hair and goggles.

54
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,560
And the fringe like instant noodles.

55
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,360
Don’t imitate Michael Jackson.

56
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,560
He looks good to me.

57
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,879
See?

58
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,080
Shengnan knows fashion.

59
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:43,879
You know what?

60
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,039
There’s a common saying for my outfit.

61
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,960
With a donkey on the shoes
and a tiger on the back,

62
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,479
I’ll look fierce.

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,039
Why are you dressing up like this?

64
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,719
Recently,

65
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,879
she has a crush on a mixblood.

66
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,400
He’s handsome.

67
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,560
Xu Zhaodi.

68
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,759
If I guess correctly,

69
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,120
the young mixblood

70
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,400
is now worrying about you,

71
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,439
because I showed up.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,599
Check your phone.

73
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,599
No message at all.

74
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,520
Impossible.

75
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,719
Xu Zhaodi,

76
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,800
a young mixblood?

77
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,680
You don’t pick a wrong guy again?

78
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,720
Can’t you ever find anyone reliable?

79
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,600
What do you mean again?

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,759
Do you know Wikipedia?

81
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,079
He has a page on that.

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,560
Leave him alone.

83
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,959
Let’s talk about you. What happened?

84
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,399
Why are you suddenly buying us dinner?
Made a fortune?

85
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,120
Yeah.

86
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,480
I no longer have bad luck.

87
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,959
And there are two problems

88
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,600
that I want to consult you.

89
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,360
What are they?

90
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,920
It is my duty

91
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,480
to solve your problems.

92
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,439
Tell me.

93
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,600
First,

94
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,879
Ziqian helped

95
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,079
to vindicate me, didn’t he?

96
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,160
I believe

97
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,120
I should express my thanks to him.

98
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,480
Kiss him.

99
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,639
It costs nothing and he’ll never forget.

100
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,879
Shut up.

101
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,000
Mr. Lu will be jealous.

102
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,279
Why don’t you

103
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,879
cook something for him?

104
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,759
Good idea.

105
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,040
That’s economical and feels sincere.

106
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,040
Yes.

107
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,199
Next problem.

108
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,240
Lu Jin’s mother

109
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,240
invited me to dinner.

110
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
I’m still wondering if I should go.

111
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,240
She said she wanted to clarify

112
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,480
what happened before.

113
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,000
Go. You must go.

114
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,680
His mother is dominating,

115
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,199
but Lu Lin loves you.

116
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,279
Shengnan, listen to me.

117
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,199
In the future,

118
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,480
you’ve got chances to meet her.

119
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,480
Go this time

120
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,199
and see how strong she is.

121
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Take it as a warm-up.

122
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,519
Warm-up?

123
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,720
Eat how much you have suffered.

124
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Use up all her money on food.

125
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,360
That’s not gonna happen.

126
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,120
Shengnan.

127
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,879
Come to my studio tomorrow.

128
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,160
I’ll dress you up...

129
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,800
Uncle.

130
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,879
I’m not going to your studio.

131
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,480
All right?

132
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,000
I made a scene of myself last time.

133
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,959
Where are you having dinner tomorrow?

134
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
His mother said
we would have a simple dinner

135
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,160
in Bauhinia Hotel.

136
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,040
Simple dinner?

137
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,439
Then you don’t need to dress up.

138
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,439
Or she’ll think you’re too naive.

139
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,160
Yeah.

140
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,240
You...

141
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,920
Just go in this outfit. You look good.

142
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,160
Fine.

143
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,040
I’ll go, then.

144
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
Since his mother invited me,

145
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,680
I must go.

146
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,120
Luckily, I have two advisors like you.

147
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,519
Problem solved.

148
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,000
Let’s get started.

149
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,480
Enjoy some meat.

150
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,199
Hurry.

151
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,720
I gotta go.

152
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,279
I suddenly remember

153
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,160
I’ve got something to do.

154
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,199
Yes. Yes. Yes.

155
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,839
Right. Right.

156
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,720
Has she paid the bill?

157
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,399
I don’t think so.

158
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,319
Why did she do that?

159
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,399
What are you doing?

160
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,560
Going to get her back.

161
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,199
Get her back?

162
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,879
Shengnan, wait for me!

163
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,319
Wait for me!

164
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,399
Shengnan!

165
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,720
You stingy girls.

166
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,879
What’s this?

167
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,120
Your sashimi.

168
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,480
Bill, please.

169
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
Pack it.

170
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,360
Don’t be nervous.

171
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,319
Only the three of us?

172
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,879
Yeah.

173
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,480
You, my mother, and me.

174
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,480
We’ll just have dinner.

175
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,360
But you bring a gift.

176
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,199
Really?

177
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,079
What’s its flavor?

178
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,720
Matcha.

179
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,920
But it’s not an ordinary matcha cake.

180
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,480
It’s matcha and raw chocolate mousse cake
I’ve made personally.

181
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,160
I made

182
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,199
the bottom sponge cake

183
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:53,879
with the black chocolate

184
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,519
whose cocoa content

185
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,360
goes up to 78%.

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,279
I froze the cream and chocolate

187
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,439
for seven hours

188
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,360
to make the upper layer of raw chocolate.

189
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,199
I screened the matcha powder

190
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,600
with my hands.

191
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,720
So, the whole cake is made

192
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,680
with my skill and talent.

193
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,360
It’s full of sincerity.

194
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,759
May I have a look?

195
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,320
You...

196
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,440
Do it after we get out of the car.

197
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,840
Okay.

198
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,879
Wish this beer tasting a complete success!

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,480
Cheers!

200
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,480
Mr. Lu.

201
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,120
I’d like to propose to you.

202
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,679
We’re having such a smooth cooperation.

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,120
Do think of us

204
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
if you hold another activity in Hangzhou.

205
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,799
Sure.

206
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,240
In this cooperation,

207
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,679
I fully experienced

208
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,600
how professional your company is.

209
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,559
From now on,

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,799
I’ll have you

211
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,440
take care of all activities in China.

212
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,120
Awesome!

213
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,679
Besides,

214
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,320
I want Director Xu to be in charge.

215
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,759
Brilliant.

216
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,480
Mr. Lu appreciates me.
My leader supports me.

217
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,120
And my colleagues greatly help me.

218
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,240
Come on. Cheers, everyone.

219
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Cheers.

220
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,799
Meng Xinjie.

221
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,200
You were a frequent visitor to clubs.

222
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,120
You’ve met a lot of girls.

223
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,360
Why are you sticking to this one?

224
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,559
You’re just like

225
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,240
a freak.

226
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,080
You’ve got a promising future.

227
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,639
Why are you here?

228
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,559
Where have you been these days?

229
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,639
I called you so many times.

230
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,879
Why didn’t you answer?

231
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,000
Get in the car before we talk.

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,840
I won’t.

233
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,759
Get in the car.

234
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,320
Knock it off.

235
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,360
Hurry up. Hurry up.

236
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,519
Where have you been?

237
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,320
You half-caste.

238
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,879
You really are of mixed blood.

239
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,320
You mix with a lot of girls.

240
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,759
Xu Zhaodi, time to suffer.

241
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,440
You deserve to be cheated.

242
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,639
Don’t forget to call me.

243
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,960
Go back and wait for me.

244
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,320
Why does such an expensive car
have oil leakage?

245
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,240
Where is the oil box?

246
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,559
Uh...

247
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,200
Wait a minute.

248
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,559
Let me have a look.

249
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,440
Why are you so curious?

250
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,559
It’s not for you.

251
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,240
I know.

252
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,200
I’m afraid

253
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,000
you bring something outlandish

254
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
that’ll scare my mother.

255
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,200
I...

256
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,799
I forgot to bring your mother a gift.

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Who is this for?

258
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,240
Mr. Cheng.

259
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,919
Mr. Cheng?

260
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,919
Cheng... Cheng Ziqian?

261
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,240
But why?

262
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,200
To thank him.

263
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Why must you thank him?

264
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,000
Because...

265
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,679
Why do you have so many questions?

266
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,320
Oh, I’m giving it to him now.

267
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,200
See you later.

268
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,440
Are you saying Gu Shengnan is

269
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,799
sleeping with me

270
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,759
or with him?

271
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,440
Make yourself clear.

272
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,440
With you!

273
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,000
Come in.

274
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,440
Shengnan?

275
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,240
What brings you here?

276
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,000
I’m just in time.

277
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,639
Coffee with cake.

278
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,759
It brings success to your work.

279
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,440
I’ve made you a cake.

280
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,000
Thank you for vindicating me.

281
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,759
You’re welcome.

282
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,360
You even made me a cake.

283
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,879
You make me shy.

284
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,000
We’re friends and don’t be shy.

285
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,120
Shengnan.

286
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,120
I want to invite you to dinner.

287
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,639
I’ve got something to tell you.

288
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,000
Don’t waste money.

289
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,519
Tell me now.

290
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,120
Oh,

291
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,039
do you see anything different

292
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,840
on my hairstyle?

293
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,879
Do you feel

294
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,279
I look casual but also elegant?

295
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,360
Do I?

296
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,159
You look pretty.

297
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,759
What about me?

298
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,720
I don’t think it’s a right tie
for your suit.

299
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,240
Don’t you think so?

300
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,519
What about my make-up?

301
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,879
Especially my eyebrows.
Are they symmetrical?

302
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,840
Are they?

303
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,600
They look good.

304
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,360
All right.

305
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,639
We’ve known each other for long.

306
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,240
What do you think of me?

307
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,840
I think you’re a good man!

308
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,000
You’re especially loyal to friends.

309
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,000
What about my wear?

310
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,159
How do I look in this suit?

311
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,600
Do I look unnatural?

312
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,879
Do I look casual?

313
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,000
Never mind.

314
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,720
Let it be.

315
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,120
I’ll leave everything to fate.

316
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,879
Are you meeting someone today?

317
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,039
I’ll tell you later.

318
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,960
I gotta go. Bye-bye.

319
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay.

320
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,519
I find you a bit weird today.

321
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,519
Anything different?

322
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,720
You’ve been the boss for long

323
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,960
and you’re getting serious.

324
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,600
Why don’t you just get to the point?

325
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,840
Let’s talk when you’re done.

326
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,480
Fine. See you.

327
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,279
Shall I close the door?

328
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,240
No.

329
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,879
Okay.

330
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,240
I wanted to ask

331
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,759
if you like me.

332
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,639
Why are you still out?

333
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,000
Why are you coming back so soon?

334
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,120
I thought you would stay

335
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,600
and enjoy the cake with him.

336
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,639
Don’t be jealous.

337
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,720
It’s just a cake.

338
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:32,879
I’ll make more for you.

339
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,519
You enjoyed the cake with him?

340
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,519
I didn’t.

341
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:36,879
Let’s go.

342
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:39,120
Go without me. I’m going to the toilet.

343
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Toilet?

344
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,120
Whenever I’m nervous, I want that.

345
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,159
Why are you nervous?

346
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,240
Only you, my mother and I will...

347
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,399
That’s why I...

348
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,240
Forget it. Go ahead.

349
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,480
I’ll be right back.

350
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,279
Are you happy to work here?

351
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,080
Yes.

352
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,000
I’m glad to hear that.

353
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,159
Lu Jin, there you are.

354
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,360
Be seated.

355
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,759
What do you mean?

356
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,759
What do you mean?

357
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,759
We’ll just have a simple dinner.

358
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,399
You can start.

359
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,519
Okay.

360
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:22,679
Sit down.

361
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,960
Chef Gu, you’re late.

362
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,440
Were you cooking in the kitchen?

363
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,320
Sorry.

364
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,320
She is our guest.

365
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,200
We invited her to dinner.

366
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,679
Sit here.

367
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,039
Shengnan.

368
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:41,799
Sit in the seat of the host.

369
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,440
This seat is reserved for you. Come here.

370
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:44,279
Okay.

371
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:44,799
Sit down.

372
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,960
Take this seat.

373
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,799
I’ll sit there so that you can talk.

374
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,440
Shengnan.

375
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,679
Why are you here?

376
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,799
I don’t know.

377
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,559
Lu Jin invited me to a simple dinner.

378
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,279
I didn’t expect to see so many people.

379
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,160
Ziqian.

380
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,440
I reviewed the financial statement.

381
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,920
Seems that the profits of recent months
have been increased,

382
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,400
compared to the same time
in previous years.

383
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:16,680
Yes.

384
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,519
It’s now the tourist season in our city.

385
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,319
The occupancy rate goes up a lot.

386
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,680
On the other hand,

387
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,559
we have a new chef.

388
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,960
Our dishes are appreciated

389
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,920
in many apps.

390
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,559
So, the income of meals has improved, too.

391
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,039
Seems like Chef Gu has helped.

392
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:32,680
No. No.

393
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,200
I just make dishes.

394
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,880
It’s modest of you.

395
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,440
We recognize your contributions.

396
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,160
There were little problems.

397
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,440
But Ms. Zheng keeps strictly the rules
for reward and punishment.

398
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,160
She punishes who makes mistakes

399
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,920
and praises who makes contributions.

400
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,079
That’s why you’re invited today.

401
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,440
Why don’t you propose a toast

402
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,960
to her?

403
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,079
Yes. Yes.

404
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,799
Ms. Zheng.

405
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,880
What’s gone is gone.

406
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,039
Everything goes smoothly now.

407
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,160
I’d like to wish you

408
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,759
a long life

409
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,039
and a happy day.

410
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,759
Enjoy yourself.

411
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,920
Chef Gu.

412
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
You show me

413
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,440
the energy and insistence of young men.

414
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,319
I appreciate that.

415
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:29,960
However,

416
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,960
for an executive chef,

417
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,279
the duty of management matters more.

418
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,440
If you only make wonderful dishes,

419
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,160
you’ll only be an ordinary chef.

420
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,759
So, as the executive chef,

421
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,920
you should speak and act cautiously

422
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,559
and care for your reputation

423
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,440
so that people will respect you more.

424
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:53,640
Shengnan, sit down.

425
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,039
Don’t stand there.

426
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,680
Chef Gu.

427
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,079
Ms. Zheng doesn’t feel very well lately.

428
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,319
I’ll drink it for her.

429
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:03,920
Thank you.

430
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:04,839
You’re welcome.

431
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,640
You can drink a lot, Miss Li.

432
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,160
What a happy time we’re having.

433
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,279
And we’re interested in how Chef Gu cooks.

434
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Shall we ask her

435
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,519
to show us how she cooks?

436
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,319
What do you think?

437
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,039
Yeah, we tried her dishes.

438
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:27,079
But we never saw her cooking.

439
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,799
It’s our luck.

440
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,160
Come on.

441
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,799
Come here and show us.

442
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:36,680
Come on.

443
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,400
Okay.

444
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,160
Fine.

445
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,680
I’d like to show you, then.

446
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,640
But it’s...

447
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,680
It’s my first time to do the teppanyaki.

448
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,839
I’ll just have a try.

449
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,039
Everybody, hope you’ll like it.

450
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,160
Thank you.

451
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,799
Wait. Wait.

452
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,279
You’ll make your clothes dirty.

453
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,839
Untie your apron and give it to her.

454
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,680
Thank you.

455
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:10,839
Our future cooperation

456
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,920
is a win-win cause.

457
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,400
Hope everyone here is

458
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:19,279
mature and reliable.

459
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,839
Also, I want you

460
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:23,160
to use your professional skills

461
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,799
and complete your work well.

462
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,039
Wish us a smooth cooperation.

463
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:26,640
Okay. Okay.

464
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,160
Wish us a smooth cooperation.

465
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,680
Cheers.

466
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,759
Is the beef ready?

467
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,319
Chef Gu.

468
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,200
Could you divide it for us?

469
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,079
Don’t bother.

470
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,400
Li Man.

471
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,440
You studied in Le Cordon Bleu,
didn’t you?

472
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,039
Show us.

473
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,640
Go.

474
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,559
Everyone has his own duty.

475
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,279
Miss Li is too honorable

476
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,319
to cook for us.

477
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,200
What?

478
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,440
Miss Li is too honorable to cook for us.

479
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,160
Oh, I see.

480
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,400
I love cooking, too.

481
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,119
Let me show you.

482
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,319
Leave it to me.

483
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,000
I’ll do it. Give it to me.

484
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,039
Give it to me.

485
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,240
Okay. Let’s do it together.

486
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,000
It’s been long since I last cooked.

487
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,279
How do you like it?

488
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,240
Shengnan.

489
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,839
What else do you want?

490
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,599
How would you like the meat to be divided?

491
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,480
Shengnan!

492
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,440
Mr. Yu, what are you doing here?

493
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,000
It’s you.

494
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,240
It’s you

495
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,440
who fooled me with Lu Jin
and Cheng Ziqian.

496
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,000
Since you hurt me,

497
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,200
I’ll make you suffer, too.

498
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,440
Are you alright?

499
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:45,920
Wait for me.

500
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,599
Lu Jin?

501
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,240
And you!

502
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,000
Let’s go to the hospital. Go.

503
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,599
I’m fine. I’ll take you home.

504
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,440
Why didn’t you dodge?

505
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,680
That was dangerous.

506
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,200
You might have died, don’t you know?

507
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,799
I don’t want you to be hurt.

508
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,519
I’m not good enough to get you hurt.

509
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,440
You are!

510
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,119
I’m not good enough
to make you protect me.

511
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
You are.

512
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,160

The left side or the right?

527
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,359
Don’t talk nonsense.

528
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,640
We haven’t had sex.

529
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,640
What?

530
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,680
You haven’t had sex yet?

531
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,759
Get out of the way.

532
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,400
Xu Zhaodi.

533
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,599
She’s not like you.

534
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,160
You even itch to be in a relationship

535
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,960
on the first day you meet someone.

536
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,440
You’re wrong.

537
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,400
Lucas and I are

538
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,240
in a chaste relationship.

539
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,079
We haven’t even kissed.

540
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,119
Then I think you’d better check

541
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,599
if he has other special hobbies.

542
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,480
Shut up.

543
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,599
He’s a normal man.

544
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,240
I just don’t want that.

545
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:42,920
I want to enjoy a real relationship.

546
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,400
I think

547
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:47,559
you still miss Meng Xinjie.

548
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,559
Have some fruit.

549
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,880
I’m warning you.

550
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
Don’t mention Meng Xinjie again.

551
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,359
Or I’ll fall out with you!

552
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,960
He’s a freak.

553
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,160
You know what?

554
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,680
He ran to my home
in the middle of one night

555
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,599
and asked me not to be with Lucas!

556
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,359
He also said Lucas had another girl!

557
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,359
That’s impossible!

558
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:04,920
When did he see

559
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,400
Lucas had another girl?

560
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,720
He said Lucas was the living hell.

561
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,400
I’m telling you...

562
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,960
Stop, stop, Xu Zhaodi.

563
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,960
Can’t you just stop that?

564
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,559
Shengnan.

565
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,359
Tell me.

566
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,599
You and Mr. Lu are just in a relationship.

567
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,759
And he’ll take you to the villa?

568
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:19,559
Yeah.

569
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,119
Gu Shengnan.

570
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,079
You’re good. That’s so fast.

571
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,160
How is everything prepared?

572
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,440
What must I prepare?

573
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,839
We’re just going for an outing.

574
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,519
Come on!

575
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,160
Be sensible, all right?

576
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,599
I think I’m doing okay.

577
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:36,160
In The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,

578
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,839
one set of night care products

579
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,920
will make you still resplendent

580
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,839
when you wake up in the morning.

581
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,799
I don’t even have many day care products.

582
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,680
I knew that.

583
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,359
I ordered some for you.

584
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,359
They’ll be delivered soon.

585
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,599
Thanks!

586
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,960
I’m stuck in a traffic jam.

587
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,680
I know.

588
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,480
It’s awkward to be waiting alone.

589
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,240
I’ll be right there.

590
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,079
All right? I’ll be...

591
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,319
I don’t think I can go.

592
00:29:16,803 --> 00:29:17,413
Hello?

593
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,640
All right. I’ll be right there.

594
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,720
I will.

595
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,480
I’m just held up.

596
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,000
I’ll be there in twenty minutes.

597
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,720
Then I’m not going anywhere.

598
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,000
We’ll enjoy ourselves in the hotel
for three days and nights.

599
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,920
Text me the hotel address.

600
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,400
Bye.

601
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,519
What took you so long?

602
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:56,960
It was annoying.

603
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,640
I was even bothered in the toilet.

604
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,319
The phone kept ringing.

605
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,480
The activity in Suhai Bank is over.

606
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
But I must go

607
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,640
and take care of another project
in Hangzhou.

608
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,759
When will you come back then?

609
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,480
When you miss me a lot.

610
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,559
Annoying.

611
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,039
Come on.

612
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,519
Enjoy one more.

613
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,799
Be careful. It’s hot.

614
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,680
Be careful.

615
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,000
Tasty, isn’t it?

616
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,599
It is.

617
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,160
Have another bite.

618
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:30,960
I gotta go.

619
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,160
I’ll be back within three days.

620
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,720
Do you still remember

621
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,480
how to speak I miss you in French?

622
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,079
I miss you.

623
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,880
I miss you.

624
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,599
I miss you.

625
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,319
Well done.

626
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:49,680
See you.

627
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,519
Meng Xinjie?

628
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,640
No way. No way.

629
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,000
Why is he haunting me?

630
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,960
Get out of my mind!

631
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,400
Waiter, bill, please.

632
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:14,799
Pack it.

633
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,200
Room 2001 of Grand Kingtown Hotel.

634
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,680
Shame on him.

635
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,880
Wants to go to the hotel with me?

636
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
He thinks he can get me
in a mere five-star hotel?

637
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,720
How mad he is!

638
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,440
Don’t get it wrong. I’m not there.

639
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,880
But the man of mixed blood is.

640
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,440
Are you bringing us the wine?

641
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,519
I’m bringing you the hell.

642
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,480
Honey, who is she?

643
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,400
Celine?

644
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,720
Why are you here?

645
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,759
Seems like I’m early.

646
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,279
The party hasn’t started yet.

647
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,200
Miss Xu.

648
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,720
How did you find me?

649
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:34,920
Mr. Lu.

650
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,920
How is your trip in Hangzhou?

651
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,799
If I hadn’t come,

652
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,440
I wouldn’t know your meeting was

653
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,000
so passionate and interesting.

654
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,400
Since you come,

655
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,960
join us and have fun.

656
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,559
If you don’t feel happy,

657
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,200
I’ll ask them to leave.

658
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,240
Show some respect!

659
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,279
Don’t try to push it!

660
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,559
How dare you slap my girl!

661
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,000
Don’t beat him!

662
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,400
What are you doing?

663
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,519
Lucas, you bastard.

664
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,480
Fool women like us, huh?

665
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,720
Women?

666
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,640
Who do you think you are?

667
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,240
Do you really think you’re my girlfriend?

668
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,519
She’s also my girlfriend.

669
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,400
So is this one.

670
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,680
And this one.

671
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,559
All of them.

672
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,920
You’re doing the badger game?

673
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
You know what?

674
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,960
I’ve got plenty of money.

675
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:55,680
Take this.

676
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,240
Not enough?

677
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,279
You can’t even bear with this?

678
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,279
Try to touch her again!

679
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,119
Don’t beat him!

680
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,280
Lucas.

681
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,000
I’ll call the police
if you hurt him again.

682
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,280
You care for him a lot.

683
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,719
By the way,

684
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,920
few men are willing

685
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,920
to fight for a girl.

686
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,519
He’s a nice man.

687
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,679
Cherish him.

688
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,039
I’ll leave this place

689
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,000
to you.

690
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,039
Enjoy yourselves.

691
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,519
Zhaodi.

692
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,360
Are you alright?

693
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:36,079
May I dance with you?

694
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,840
My waist hurts. It hurts.

695
00:36:50,325 --> 00:36:51,703
= Non-professionals shall not imitate. =

696
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
How does it feel? Fun?

697
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,119
Yes.

698
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,599
Does my car look cool?

699
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:57,760
Yes.

700
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,039
A bit crowded for the two of us.

701
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,119
Yeah.

702
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,239
Why don’t you

703
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,519
sit in the sidecar

704
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,639
and let me ride you around?

705
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:13,039
No, no!

706
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,239
I’m getting out!

707
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:16,199
Let me out!

708
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,480
Mom?

709
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,119
What brings you here?

710
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,320
How many times have I told you

711
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,840
not to horse around
in your father’s construction site?

712
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Look what a useless man you are!

713
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,599
I’m not.

714
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,719
I am a master

715
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:52,719
majoring in automobile
and engine technology

716
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,559
and graduated from

717
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,559
University of Munich.

718
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,679
I’m a real scholar

719
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:57,760
and a returned elite.

720
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,159
But you still repair cars every day.

721
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,960
You’re wrong.

722
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,840
I repair cars.

723
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,039
But they’re not ordinary cars.

724
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:05,000
Look at my car shop.

725
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,440
I’m running it with passion.

726
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,320
I have a soul for that.

727
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,199
Enough. Enough.

728
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,079
This isn’t what I want to hear.

729
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:13,199
I don’t care how you run wild
in normal times.

730
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,880
But this is a serious moment for Mingting.

731
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,559
Your father is in poor health.

732
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:19,320
You need to take charge.

733
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:24,159
Lu Jin stays in Suhai every day.

734
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,320
Who knows

735
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,960
if he still wants
your father’s properties?

736
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,320
We must be very careful. Got it?

737
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,400
My brother is in Suhai?

738
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,440
Why don’t you let him take charge?

739
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,400
