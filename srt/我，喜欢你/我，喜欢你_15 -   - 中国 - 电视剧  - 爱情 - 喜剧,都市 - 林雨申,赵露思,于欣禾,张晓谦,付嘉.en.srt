Lu Jin stays in Suhai every day.

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,719
Who knows

22
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,239
if he still wants
your father’s properties?

23
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,599
We must be very careful. Got it?

24
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,680
My brother is in Suhai?

25
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,920
Why don’t you let him take charge?

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,680
Isn’t that better?

27
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,760
Better? Are you a fool?

28
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,159
He’ll take away everything
that belongs to you.

29
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,000
What will you do?

30
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,480
No way.

31
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,079
My brother is a good earner.

32
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,159
He turns up his nose at this.

33
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,120
Also,

34
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,479
even though my father gives him half,

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,800
it will not matter.

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,039
The other half is enough for me to spend.

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,680
Alright. I see.

38
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,680
I can count on you for nothing.

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,240
Behave yourself on the board in a while.

40
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,280
Don’t make any more trouble for me.

41
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,759
Yes, Mummy.

42
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,680
Loud and clear.

43
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,479
Get in the car and change your clothes.

44
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,159
You look gorgeous today.

45
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:31,840
Stop it.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,080
It feels good.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,639
Think about it.

48
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,599
It was just a few days ago

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,639
that I went to your home last time,

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,439
as if it were a lifetime ago.

51
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,280
What I enjoy now is a world of difference.

52
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,840
What does it have to do with you?

53
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,560
You got beaten for nothing.

54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,319
I could have handled it

55
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,039
even if you didn’t go there.

56
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,560
That’s true. I believe you could.

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,719
You’re my goddess.

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,520
You can handle anything on your own.

59
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,560
I just wanted to be a hero.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It turned out that

61
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,599
I was knocked down
before I could touch them.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,680
Let me tell you.

63
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,240
I shouldn’t have studied Indonesian.

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,400
I should’ve studied Muay Thai

65
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,639
or Taekwondo.

66
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,199
If you get in trouble next time,

67
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,919
I’ll kick right in his face.

68
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,120
You want me to get in another trouble?

69
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,199
No. No. That’s just an analogy.

70
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,039
Don’t do stupid things again.

71
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,879
That’s no stupid thing.

72
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,159
If I get beaten

73
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
so you can see his true color,

74
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,800
that’s worth it.

75
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,240
If I get beaten

76
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,960
so I can stay at your home,

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,520
lying on your couch,

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,080
and having you massage me,

79
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:11,879
that’s worth it.

80
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,879
Alright. Medicine is applied.

81
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
You can leave.

82
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,319
Zhaodi.

83
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,079
Zhaodi.

84
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,160
Accept me.

85
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,439
Let me be your boyfriend.

86
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,439
Let me protect you.

87
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,319
If you dislike your present job,

88
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,680
just quit it.

89
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,079
I’ll support you.

90
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,079
King of Comedy?

91
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,399
You support me?

92
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,240
Just support yourself.

93
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,120
Let go.

94
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,959
No.

95
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,959
Ouch! It hurts.

96
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,240
Let me hold you a little longer.

97
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,399
Five minutes.

98
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,399
That’s too short.

99
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,959
No. No. Five minutes. Five minutes.

100
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,399
Five minutes.

101
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,920
Six minutes?

102
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,040
Is it OK?

103
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,720
Don’t move. Take one more.

104
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,399
Is it done?

105
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,319
Where’s the camera?

106
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,399
There it goes.

107
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,079
I just...

108
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,839
Well. What now?

109
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,279
I’ll buy you ten cameras.

110
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,639
But there are our photos on the camera.

111
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,759
Go get it.

112
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,839
Photos can be taken in the future.

113
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,040
You’re so stupid.

114
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,600
How did you throw it in the water?

115
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,439
You threw the camera in the water.

116
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,959
What shall we do?

117
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,839
Let’s talk something vulgar.

118
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,203
Well,

119
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,079
how?

120
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,519
How many girlfriends have you had?

121
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:16,580
Well,

122
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,399
a couple.

123
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,079
Well.

124
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,959
Is... Is Li Man

125
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,279
one of them?

126
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,399
Certainly not.

127
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,800
Let me say this again.

128
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,959
I had nothing with Li Man at all.

129
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,759
She’s just my fellow,

130
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,159
business partner, a good friend.

131
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,559
That’s all.

132
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,039
I believe you.

133
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,639
Why did you break up?

134
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,159
With my previous girlfriends?

135
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,039
Incompatible...

136
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,240
Incompatible of temperament?

137
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,039
For no reason?

138
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,000
You’re a scumbag.

139
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,159
Because I...

140
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,279
My problem, maybe.

141
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,159
I’m a workaholic.

142
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,039
Sometimes they affected my work.

143
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,919
Also, I flied a lot

144
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,679
and couldn’t be with them.

145
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,960
Naturally, we broke up.

146
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,799
Pretty normal.

147
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,440
Sounds

148
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,919
like something you’d do.

149
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,559
What about me?

150
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,200
Will you do the same to me?

151
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,080
Never.

152
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,559
You know. After we’re together,

153
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,279
all at once I feel

154
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,080
the time being with you
is always too short.

155
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,799
I think about you every moment.

156
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,919
For the first time I think
about you at work.

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,840
Amazing.

158
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,720
Maybe it’s because

159
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,559
I didn’t truly love those girls.

160
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,720
So, you mean

161
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,679
you truly love me?

162
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,919
This question is more vulgar than that.

163
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,519
Alright.

164
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,000
I’ll ask you an even more vulgar

165
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,240
question.

166
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,639
When did you fall for me?

167
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,519
I need to think about it.

168
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,879
Think. Take your time.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,159
When I opened the suitcase

170
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,519
in Zhuozhou

171
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,799
and saw the honeyed walnuts

172
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,240
you gave me.

173
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,279
No,

174
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,639
earlier than that.

175
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,279
When you called me Jin

176
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,480
in my arms in the hallway.

177
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,159
Jin.

178
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,759
No.

179
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,159
Earlier than that.

180
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,360
It’s supposed to be...

181
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,120
Could it be

182
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,519
when I put noodles into your car?

183
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,399
At that time, I thought

184
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,799
you were ridiculous.

185
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:45,919
Pretending to be Korean.

186
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,399
Ridiculous.

187
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,399
Ridiculous.

188
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,039
Can I ask you a vulgar question?

189
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,879
When did you fall for me?

190
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,279
♪ I won’t tell you ♪

191
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,399
♪ I won’t tell you ♪

192
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,440

00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,679
I know.

194
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,279
Who can’t?

195
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:03,919
Dad.

196
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,039
Everybody.

197
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,159
Sorry, I’m late.

198
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,679
Get seated.

199
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,200
Everyone is here.

200
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,320
Let’s cut to the chase.

201
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,399
Some bonds that our company issued

202
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,639
will be all due soon.

203
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,679
I know.

204
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,279
You care about the sequent arrangement
of funds.

205
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,559
Cheng.

206
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,679
How is the new bond issuing going on?

207
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,559
Mr. Lu. Rest assured.

208
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,799
Everything is going well.

209
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,399
I’ve talked with

210
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,200
the major agents.

211
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,679
According to

212
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,279
the latest credit rating of our company,

213
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,279
the cost of our new bonds

214
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,919
should be lower than before.

215
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,799
No “should”.

216
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,200
It must be.

217
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,919
The operation of some previous projects

218
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,639
were unsatisfactory.

219
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,759
Some reasons are subject to the market.

220
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,759
I won’t go to all the details.

221
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,080
But for some projects,

222
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,679
the cost exceeds 30% of the budget.

223
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,759
In the long run,

224
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,159
the company will face

225
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,320
a serious problem in financial
supply chain.

226
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:20,919
So,

227
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,919
the bond issuance cost must be cut down.

228
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,919
OK.

229
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,879
I’ll contact more agents

230
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,000
to minimize the cost.

231
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,919
How is the short-term credit loan
from the bank?

232
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,159
The negotiation is almost done.

233
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,159
The amount of our loan is

234
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,279
in the scope of the previously
negotiated credit.

235
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,879
There should be no problem.

236
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,039
It’s just that the formalities are tricky.

237
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,039
I’ll contact the bank president Mr. Zhao
this afternoon.

238
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,039
Next week, I’ll try to

239
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,399
get the loan agreement approved.

240
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,799
Before issuing new bonds,

241
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,000
we’ll have to rely on a bank loan
to get through.

242
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,320
Nothing must go wrong.

243
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,200
In the event that the bonds
cannot be honored,

244
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,799
it’ll be a huge problem.

245
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,200
Our company is

246
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,679
in a difficult time.

247
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,519
I’m sure you all know it.

248
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,200
I hope we can work together

249
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,639
to get it through.

00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,919

We got news from the bank.

297
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,559
The loan agreement with Mingting Group

298
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,000
will be approved next week.

299
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,039
As for the bond issuing,

300
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,279
Mingting is still bargaining
with major agents

301
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,279
to cut down earnings by another 50 points.

302
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,640
It’s almost time.

303
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,119
Serve the dishes.

304
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,720

- Mr. Lu.
- Mr. Lu.

312
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,279
What’s wrong? Tell me.

313
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,720
We got the news that

314
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,759
the subsidiary Lanyu Construction was

315
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,720
exposed of accounting fraud.

316
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,440
Financial media are

317
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,480
all making a big deal about it.

318
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,519
The public relations department

319
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,480
has been

320
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,960
trying to suppress it,

321
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,920
but the negative impact on public opinion

322
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,240
is still worsening.

323
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
At this critical moment,

324
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,880
how could this come to light?

325
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,200
Whatever it takes,

326
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,759
you must put a lid on this.

327
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,680
Mr. Lu.

328
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,440
If no timely actions are taken,

329
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,519
domestic business department may face
financial difficulties.

330
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,640
Bad news, Mr. Lu.

331
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,839
The bank just called that

332
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:45,160
the loan was suspended
by the head office of the bank.

333
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,680
Call the bank president Mr. Zhao now

334
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,960
and ask about it.

335
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,519
We’ve called.

336
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,759
Mr. Zhao said

337
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,400
Lanyu’s annual profit contribution
to the Group

338
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,599
is over 30%.

339
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,200
Considering Lanyu’s negative
public opinion,

340
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
the risk control department
of head office

341
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,039
halted the approval of loan agreements.

342
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,039
Get me files about Lanyu now.

343
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,000
Call Director Liu

344
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,880
of Credit Department of Head Office.

345
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,920
Tell him I’ll visit him right now.

346
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,480
Mr. Lu.

347
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,240
Rating Agency Zhengyuan announced that

348
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,480
the rating outlook of Mingting

349
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
will be adjusted from stable to negative.

350
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,000
I think the company’s credit rating

351
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,359
will be downgraded soon.

352
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,200
How come?

353
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,480
If the credit rating is downgraded,

354
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,359
the bond issuing will be impaired.

355
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:34,200
Not to mention the cost cutting.

356
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
Even the bonds are hard to issue.

357
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,119
I assume the brokerage firms,

358
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,839
trusts and asset management companies

359
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,480
will come to collect debts

360
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,359
when they get the news.

361
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,519
It’ll be doomed.

362
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,240
We can’t get loans from banks.

363
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,440
New bonds can’t be issued.

364
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,400
If the creditors hear the news,

365
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,200
they’ll surely come

366
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,720
and make troubles.

367
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,279
The company’s cash flow

368
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,400
has such a big problem.

369
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,880
Even the normal operation

370
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,640
will be difficult.

371
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,359
Mr. Lu.

372
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,240
I have a suggestion.

373
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
Should we

374
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
consider the merge and acquisition

375
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,720
by Zhenghong Group?

376
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,240
The meeting is really interesting.

377
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,440
I don’t quite get it.

378
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,920
What’s your purpose

379
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,599
for the suggestion?

380
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,440
It’s your well-thought-out countermeasure,

381
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,200
or you’ve reached a secret understanding?

382
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,759
I, Lu Mingting,

383
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,200
have been in the business
for over 30 years.

384
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,599
Even if I fall,

385
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,960
I’ll never bow down to Zhenghong Group.

386
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,519
I’m wondering

387
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,960
this is Mingting’s board

388
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
or Zhenghong’s board?

389
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,160
Dad.

390
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,119
Dad!

391
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,240
- Mr. Lu.
- Mr. Lu.

392
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,950
Mr. Lu.

393
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,039
You called so many friends here?

394
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,880
Didn’t you say

395
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,799
I could call friends here?

396
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,880
Yes. Yes. But

397
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,599
you have such a big social circle.

398
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,680
Is it big?

399
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,079
They’re all cooks.

400
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:40,079
You’ll get used to it.

401
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,559
But

402
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,920
I thought there would be

403
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,039
just the two of us.

404
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,200
You said I could call them here.

405
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,039
Mr. Lu.

406
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,119
Can I

407
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,039
have a talk with my friend?

408
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,559
Sure.

409
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,400
Thank you.

410
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,680
How is it?

411
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,160
Did my idea work?

412
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,519
How far have you gone with Lu Jin?

413
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,359
Tell me honestly.

414
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,759
We... We did nothing.

415
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,519
Impossible.

416
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:10,359
How could you do nothing?

417
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,960
All my work will be in vain.

418
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,119
You’re so...

419
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:14,880
Look at them.

420
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,160
Are you here just to drink,

421
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,519
eat and play?

422
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,440
Or what?

423
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,200
Take the chance to know each other.

424
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,200
Sure. Sure.

425
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,920
Come back.

426
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,680
This way.

427
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,279
Get her back to me.

428
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,680
That’s exactly what I’m thinking.

429
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,640
Miss Gu.

430
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,599
We finally get some private time.

431
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,920
Give us a chance, alright?

432
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:39,759
It’s smart of you.

433
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,119
You’re gorgeous.

434
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,839
I’ll go see Ziqian.

435
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:50,559
OK.

436
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,200
Ziqian.

437
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,119
Aren’t you bored reading alone?

438
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,279
I’m fine. I wanna be alone.

439
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,960
The day at the party...

440
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,200
Are you alright?

441
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,160
I’m fine.

442
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,640
I’ve let it go.

443
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,440
Don’t worry.

444
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,160
Really?

445
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,599
Yes.

446
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,079
You must tell me

447
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:14,880
if anything.

448
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:15,960
Alright?

449
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,240
What is the book?

450
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,359
I’m just reading casually.

451
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,440
I usually read cooking books.

452
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,119
Ziqian. Come here.

453
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,400
What’s up?

454
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,400
I...

455
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,920
I am...

456
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,400
What?

457
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,759
I am missing you.

458
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,920
You’ve been back so long,

459
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,160
yet we haven’t had a talk.

460
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,400
Share your funny stories abroad

461
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:41,519
with me.

462
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,960
Go. Go share with him.

463
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,359
Come on.

464
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,359
He’s curious.

465
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,359
I’m so curious.

466
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,039
Uncle.

467
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,359
Come. Let’s talk.

468
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,200
Mr. Lu.

469
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Did you like the food

470
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,160
when you studied abroad?

471
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,920
I was fine there.

472
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,960
Try the food I made.

473
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,119
Sure.

474
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,799
Who said he wouldn’t eat it?

475
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,559
Come on. Shengnan.

476
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,920
Try the food I made.

477
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,079
It...

478
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,160
Isn’t it just a few leaves?

479
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:19,960
Balls.

480
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,200
Come.

481
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:24,960
Try it.

482
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,319
Did you get along well with classmates?

483
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,039
I was fine there.

484
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,319
They were all kind.

485
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,500
= Matsuhashi No.1 =

486
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,119
What?

487
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,680
Lu Jin’s still not answering the phone?

488
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,559
He must be busy.

489
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,119
He’s busy indeed.

490
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,160
It’s just that if he’s busy

491
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,039
with proper business.

492
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,799
Come and sit.

493
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,319
This is from Mr. Sun of Wayne.

494
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,680
I haven’t got a chance to drink it.

495
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,160
Since you’re here today,

496
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,319
have a drink with me.

497
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,680
Yes, Ms. Zheng.

498
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,599
We’ve eaten and drunk.
Let’s get down to business.

499
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,640
It’s game time.

500
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,200
Truth or Dare.

501
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,359
You all know how to play, right?

502
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,559
It’s just Truth or Dare.

503
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,519
We can play that.

504
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,119
- Yes. Bring it on.
- OK.

505
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,359
Mr. Lu. Shall we?

506
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,319
Of course.

507
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,440
Good.

508
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,839
Awesome!

509
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,759
Mr. Lu is awesome!

510
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,599
Let’s go big.

511
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,440
No truth. Let’s go straight to dare.

512
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,160
Dare! Dare!

513
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,880
OK.

514
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,599
I’ll turn the bottle.

515
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,960
Whoever the bottle turns to
will throw the dice.

516
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,680
The dice

517
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,599
will determine the dare question.

518
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,319
OK?

519
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,160
OK. OK.

520
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,200
Let’s rock and roll.

521
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,759
Meng Xinjie is cheating.

522
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,359
Are you standing up for him?

523
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,039
Yeah.

524
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:11,759
Mr. Lu.

525
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,599
Mr. Lu.

526
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,440
Let me help you throw it.

527
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,640
I’ll get a good one for you.

528
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,960
Good wine and good cups.

529
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,839
The wine should

530
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,680
match the cup.

531
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,759
Do you agree?

532
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,119
Yes, Ms. Zheng.

533
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,839
Don’t call me Ms. Zheng

534
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,119
unless in the workplace.

535
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,440
Just call me Aunt Zheng.

536
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:37,960
Li Man.

537
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,359
You’ve helped Lu Jin a lot

538
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,720
over these years.

539
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,920
And I really like you.

540
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,680
So,

541
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:52,359
I hope you can be with us all the time.

542
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,319
Do you get it?

543
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,160
Here.

544
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,000
Let’s drink.

545
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,240
Are you waiting for me?

546
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,680
Yes.

547
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,519
We need a talk.

548
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:20,920
Shoot.

549
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,039
What’s your relationship

550
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,279
with Gu Shengnan?

551
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,559
She is my girlfriend.

552
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,920
Are you serious?

553
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,880
Do I have to tell you?

554
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,880
You do business all over the world.

555
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,240
You can’t keep her company all the time.

556
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,359
Don’t you know there’s a vehicle

557
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,599
called airplane in the world?

558
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,240
It just takes a couple of hours by air

559
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,839
no matter how far it is.

560
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:56,160
Wherever my business is,

561
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,240
as long as Shengnan needs me,

562
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,680
I can be at her side anytime.

563
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,119
Do you know

564
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,519
her dream?

565
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:11,160
I’ll know it.

566
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,920
We have tons of time to know each other.

567
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,440
Not just knowing it,

568
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,359
I’ll help her achieve it.

569
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,720
Help her achieve it?

570
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,799
How?

571
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,279
Forsake your huge family business

572
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,640
and cook with her?

573
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,000
Can you be with her every day,

574
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
take care of her

575
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,160
and her family?

576
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,079
Can you?

577
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:30,920
Is that difficult?

578
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,160
I mean every day.

579
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,359
If we have each other in our hearts,

580
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,519
is it important to be together every day?

581
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,279
That’s how you think.

582
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,440
Do you know how she thinks?

583
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,559
You said so much

584
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,359
just to tell me

585
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:46,519
you can give her more happiness than me.

586
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,440
Right?

587
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,079
Yes.

588
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:48,799
You can’t.

589
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,440
I can.

590
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,240
You can’t.

591
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,279
Because Gu Shengnan loves me.

592
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,160
She’s mine.

593
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,079
I hope

594
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,359
you’ll remember what you’ve said.

595
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,240
Of course.

596
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,039
I won’t leave you a chance.

597
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,660
= Inpatient Building =

598
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,240
You’ve been here a whole day.

599
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,759
Go back and get some rest.

600
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,400
Let me stay with you for a while longer.

601
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,119
I’m useless.

602
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,119
You’re unwell,

603
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,960
yet I can do nothing to help.

604
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,079
I didn’t educate the kid well.

605
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:49,240
Lu Zheng can’t still

606
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,319
take on Mingting Group for you.

607
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,799
Lu Zheng is like that.

608
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,319
You shouldn’t

609
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,599
take the blame alone if any.

610
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,240
It’s my responsibility.

611
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,200
The burden of Mingting Group

612
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,680
will fall on his shoulder
sooner or later.

613
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,599
It’s time to get him

614
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,240
a decent girl

615
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,680
and form a family.

616
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,079
Let him know what responsibility is

617
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,079
so that he can take over
Mingting Group someday.

618
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,799
He has me now.

619
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,359
If someday...

620
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,599
Those guys in the board

621
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,079
won’t go easy on him.

622
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,599
I think so.

623
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,960
It’s good that now he’s not

624
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,039
that reluctant to go to meetings.

625
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,119
I think he’ll change over time.

626
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,839
Rest assured.

627
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:45,599
By the way,

628
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,119
I heard that our competitor

629
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,640
is Zhenghong Group now.

630
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,640
Zhenghong Group

631
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,359
has been against me for long.

632
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,839
It’s said Lu Jin is really something.

633
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,359
In the global acquisition program
that he heads up,

634
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,079
some of Mingting’s companies overseas

635
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,640
are involved.

636
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:10,799
You’re right.

637
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:13,839
In terms of business,

638
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,279
he’s more intelligent than his mother,

639
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,400
and also bolder.

640
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,160
For that, he’s like me

641
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,960
somewhat.

642
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,960
When I founded Mingting...

643
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,279
We hadn’t contacted for decades.

644
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,400
There’s no need to be jealous. Right?

645
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,960
You are in touch.

646
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,960
You don’t contact much in life.

647
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,480
But at work,

648
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,039
you meet quite a lot.

649
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,039
Zheng Hong is ridiculous.

650
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,519
She still messes with you on business.

651
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,400
Don’t bring her up.

652
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,240
That’s annoying.

653
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:06,640
Where is Zheng?

654
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Did he come to see me?

655
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,480
He attended a company meeting today.

656
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:15,039
He is supposed to do homework at home.

657
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,400
He better works hard.

658
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
This is the manor where we’ll stay.

659
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
The rooms are the same. On two sides.

660
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,839
At one side are lake-view rooms.

661
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,519
The other side is by the road.

662
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,799
I suggest men should

663
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,720
take the roadside rooms.

664
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,720
It’s noisy with people coming and going.

665
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,319
Girls will take lake-view rooms.

666
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,079
Of course, Boss.

667
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,720
You can take a lake-view room as well.

668
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,599
It’s very quiet

669
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,079
and soundproof.

670
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,039
No.

671
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,279
Think about it.

672
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,400
We’ve got so many men.

673
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,720
Not enough rooms.

674
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,480
Are you dividing rooms or am I?

675
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,960
I’ve got it. OK?

676
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,280
You’ll live with Mr. Wang.

677
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,719
And, take it.

678
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,599
Wait.

679
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:19,920
You’re welcome.

680
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,599
I’ll make do

681
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,480
living with Xu Zhaodi.

682
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,159
In your dreams. I’m afraid of noise.

683
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,360
Consider it. Zhaodi!

684
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,400
Ziqian. Live with me.

685
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:32,920
Are you shy?

686
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,280
I bathed you when you were little.
Come on.

687
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,239
You’re welcome.

688
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,159
Miss Gu...

689
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,400
I’ll live with Gu Shengnan.

690
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,480
Go.

691
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,280
I...

692
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,079
Sis...

693
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,360
That’s not the way I divided.

694
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,039
That’s not my plan.

695
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,719
I meant to let you and Shengnan...

696
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,480
Plans never catch up with changes.

697
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,159
Sorry.

698
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,119
Have you slept?

699
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:18,840
Not yet.

700
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,000
Would you come?

701
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,559
83611.

702
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,960
Shengnan. Take it.

703
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,400
Let’s talk heart to heart.

704
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,960
Come on. Sit.

705
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,480
Our relationship isn’t that good

706
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,920
to talk heart to heart, is it?

707
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,400
What is our relationship now?

708
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,719
We are

709
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:47,800
living in the same room.

710
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,280
And you’re the only one

711
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,159
I can share this thing with.

712
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,400
After all,

713
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,960
we’re recognized

714
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:58,079
by the same person.

715
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,079
What are you talking about?

716
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:09,599
I’m gonna

717
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,159
break someone’s heart.

718
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,599
Who?

719
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:20,960
Mr. Lu.

720
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,719
Mr. Lu?

721
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,519
In the daytime,

722
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,880
I had some affair

723
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:36,079
