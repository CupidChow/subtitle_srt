= Episode 7 =

20
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,740
I told you

21
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,620
not to put so many light bulbs.

22
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,020
You wouldn’t listen.

23
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,620
Now they are not working.

24
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,220
I used to say

25
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,260
that love hurts.

26
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,980
Thought it was a figure of speech.

27
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,260
I didn’t expect that for you,

28
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,380
it’s an objective description.

29
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,100
Shengnan.

30
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,500
Lu Jin is not here.

31
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,380
Who are you showing your injury to?

32
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,100
What are you doing?

33
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,980
I’m miserable enough already.

34
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,140
And you two are being sarcastic.

35
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,500
Do you have a heart?

36
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,140
How can I be so unlucky?

37
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,100
Yeah, it is hard to imagine.

38
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,260
Gu Shengnan,

39
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,140
did you take something

40
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,900
you shouldn’t have?

41
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,900
And this is the universe punishing you.

42
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,900
I didn’t.

43
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,380
Ever since Fussy Lu came to Bauhinia,

44
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,140
I haven’t even stolen a cherry tomato.

45
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,020
I’ve been good.

46
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,980
That’s not what Zhaodi means.

47
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,140
She is talking about

48
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,860
that kiss. Kiss.

49
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,500
That... It’s an accident.

50
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,660
I shouldn’t have told you two.

51
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,500
You two are annoying.

52
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,740
Who care if it’s an accident or not?

53
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,140
The point is, did that kiss belong to you?

54
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,660
If it didn’t and you took it,

55
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,260
of course you would be punished.

56
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,900
Think about it.

57
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,740
Before that kiss,

58
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,260
the unlucky one

59
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,540
is Lu Jin, right?

60
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,540
But what happened after it?

61
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,300
Has Lu Jin ever

62
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,500
got hurt again?

63
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,780
It changed.

64
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,780
You are right.

65
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,900
How is it? About the interview today.

66
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,140
No problem.

67
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,220
Good.

68
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,900
Cheng Ziqian and you went to the same college?

69
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,780
Classmate.

70
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,860
After graduation, he went abroad to study.

71
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,780
Never saw him again.

72
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,020
A friend recommended him

73
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,140
to me this time.

74
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,980
OK.

75
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,740
Says he has a lot of experience

76
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,300
in hotel management.

77
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,580
So you think...

78
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,060
I think you should make the call.

79
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,980
You don’t have to tell me.

80
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,580
Then I’ll let him know to sign up.

81
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,460
In the next two days,

82
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,820
let’s meet with our clients in Zhuozhou.

83
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,220
That’s settled.

84
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,140
Boss.

85
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,780
Hungry?

86
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,820
The work is finally over.

87
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,860
We can eat now.

88
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,820
What would you like to eat?

89
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,620
Rosemary rack of lamb. How’s that?

90
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,420
Are you trying to feed yourself with pictures,

91
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,180
or are you missing someone?

92
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,860
No. I’m just hungry.

93
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,860
It’s OK.

94
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,820
How about this?

95
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,540
If you don’t want dishes of the hotel,

96
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,460
I can take you to try something local.

97
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,260
But I talked too much today.

98
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,700
Tired.

99
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,420
Then how about

100
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,540
I bring you a take-out?

101
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,620
OK.

102
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,140
Go.

103
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,140
Well.

104
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,900
Get yourself whatever you want.

105
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:14,780
Go.

106
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,580
OK, OK. I’m leaving.

107
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,140
I made the honeyed walnuts specially for you.

108
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,900
In case you don’t like sweet food,

109
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,380
I put only a little sugar in it.

110
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,580
You need to have more walnuts.

111
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,540
It’s said it’s good for brain and health.

112
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,380
Try some more.

113
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,180
= Yard =

114
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,820
You should stop running around lately

115
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,420
and stay at home

116
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,260
so you won’t worsen your injury.

117
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,140
I am

118
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,140
home alone all day and it’s so boring.

119
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,940
That’s why you need to spend more time with me.

120
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,180
I can’t.

121
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,020
I’m really tied up with business this week.

122
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,420
I don’t have time.

123
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,140
Then leave.

124
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,900
That’s what I’m about to do. I’m leaving.

125
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,940
Xu Zhaodi!

126
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,140
Are you sure you don’t want to stay for dinner?

127
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,260
I can’t.

128
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,900
I have an appointment later.

129
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,580
I can’t be able to keep you company.

130
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,380
Oh, my sweet pie.

131
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,380
I’m leaving.

132
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,140
Call me if you need anything.

133
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,380
Thank you for the coke. Mwah.

134
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,140
Give me back that bottle.

135
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,300
Cheers.

136
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,380
Bean Curd!

137
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,180
Don’t make the dish! She’s gone!

138
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,140
Shengnan. Look who is here.

139
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,700
Long time no see.

140
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,300
Out!

141
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,700
Here! Come!

142
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,140
I told you not to play with fire.

143
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,940
And you got yourself on the top of the stove.

144
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,620
Look at you.

145
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,380
Almost burn my kitchen.

146
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,660
I’m calling your dad.

147
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,380
He is gonna take you home.

148
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,180
I don’t want my dad.

149
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,860
If you want to abandon me, fine.

150
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,260
Shengnan.

151
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,700
Where are you going?

152
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,900
Why are you crying?

153
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,900
Grandpa scolded me. I’m leaving this home.

154
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,860
Leaving home?

155
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,540
Where can you go?

156
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,380
Wander around. Go anywhere I want.

157
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,620
None of your business!

158
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,780
Wait.

159
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,100
Go anywhere you want?

160
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,620
How about my home?

161
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Let’s not tell your grandfather.

162
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,660
Make him worry about you.

163
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,380
Let’s go.

164
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,580
Enjoy.

165
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,260
Easy. No rush.

166
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,460
I’ve made my decision.

167
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,740
I’ll stay at your place.

168
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,300
Never talk to Grandpa again.

169
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,260
Eat more.

170
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,860
Are you going to be tired of me?

171
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,660
No.

172
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,260
Never?

173
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,460
Never.

174
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,100
What’s in your mind?

175
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,100
Ziqian.

176
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,100
So unlucky, don’t you think?

177
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,260
This is unprecedented.

178
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,380
Makes me weep.

179
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,940
Don’t play with me.

180
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,100
We are just friends.

181
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,940
It’s too early for you to check on me.

182
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,100
You call me a lot.

183
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,500
Well.

184
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,060
I’m ordering food now.

185
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,460
And you suddenly came to my mind.

186
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,100
What food made you think of me?

187
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,260
Hotpot. I want to eat some fish.

188
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,620
So in your heart,

189
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,380
I’m a mermaid?

190
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,660
So smart.

191
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,660
And I’m gonna eat it.

192
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,620
One bite at a time.

193
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,180
Well then, you need to be careful.

194
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,780
Mermaid bites.

195
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,660
Will she break my heart?

196
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,380
No, only make you want more.

197
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,860
Are you going to order or not?

198
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,700
If you don’t, leave the seat for others.

199
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,380
Yes, yes. I want a mermaid.

200
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,100
Honey! He is taking advantage of me!

201
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,260
The weather is good here.

202
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,820
Very.

203
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,940
There’s a typhoon coming.

204
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,540
Yeah.

205
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,620
Did you

206
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,700
call Gu Shengnan’s friend today?

207
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,100
I did.

208
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,820
Otherwise,

209
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,060
I wouldn’t get this punch for nothing.

210
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,420
Does it still hurt?

211
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,580
Much better.

212
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,940
Did that friend

213
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,860
ever

214
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,860
mention the other friend?

215
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,700
You mean your side friend,

216
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,340
or my side?

217
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,260
You want one for the other eye?

218
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,100
No, please don’t hit me.

219
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
I have something to tell you.

220
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,060
It’s about Miss Gu.

221
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,860
Put it down.

222
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,460
Some unlucky bastard kissed

223
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,420
Miss Gu and ever since, she

224
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,580
began to have bad luck.

225
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,260
Her stories are unprecedented.

226
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,640
Make me weep.

227
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,640
I don’t know if Miss Gu got out of the hospital.

228
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,610
What did you say?

229
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,410
Her stories are unprecedented.

230
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,320
The last one.

231
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,530
Make me weep.

232
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,750
I don’t know if Miss Gu got out of the hospital.

233
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,660
She’s in the hospital?

234
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,660
Why?

235
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,470
It’s a long story. Sit down...

236
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,150
Then make it short.

237
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,900
I heard Miss Gu went to some mountain

238
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,840
and she fell off the stairs.

239
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,950
Then 120 came and sent her to the hospital.

240
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,990
When did that happen?

241
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,390
The other day.

242
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,310
I just heard it from Xu Zhaodi.

243
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,460
If you’re lying to me, you’re dead.

244
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,620
I swear to God, if I’m lying,

245
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,260
let God punish me.

246
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,940
Sit down.

247
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,420
Boss.

248
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,740
Li.

249
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,940
Book me a ticket to Suhai now.

250
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,980
Mr. Lu.

251
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,940
All flights have been canceled

252
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,420
because of the weather.

253
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,180
High-speed railway then.

254
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:53,820
= Ticket Office =

255
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,100
Buddy.

256
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,180
Want a ride?

257
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,940
There’s a typhoon coming.

258
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,500
I’m the last taxi here.

259
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,180
The car is here. Want to get in?

260
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,940
Where will you go?

261
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,620
Suhai.

262
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,820
Suhai?

263
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,980
Mo. What are you doing?

264
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,180
Where are the cars?

265
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,460
This gentleman wants to Suhai by taxi.

266
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,660
Buddy.

267
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,020
Are you joking?

268
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,180
You’ll have to take a train to Suhai.

269
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,620
If I can get the ticket,

270
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,460
you think I will take a taxi?

271
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,300
But Suhai is too far.

272
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,220
It’s gonna keep me from other works.

273
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,540
Come back.

274
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,620
Where is your car?

275
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,100
Over there.

276
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,780
Rest assured. All legit.

277
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,020
OK.

278
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,660
Buddy. You’re cool.

279
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,100
Let’s be friend on WeChat and settle the bill.

280
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,220
That’s the rule.

281
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,940
You want to scan my code?

282
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,540
You can scan my code.

283
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,860
OK.

284
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,860
= Lu Jin =

285
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,940
I’m going back to Suhai tonight.

286
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,020
What?

287
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,540
Boss.

288
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,020
The typhoon is coming.

289
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,580
All the planes and trains are out of service.

290
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,860
I rent a car.

291
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,020
Wait. It’s a ten-hour drive

292
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,660
from here to Suhai.

293
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,820
You stay here.

294
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,700
Take care of everything.

295
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,300
And,

296
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,260
hold Li Man off.

297
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,020
That’s it.

298
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,940
Sir.

299
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,700
Can we get to the exact place

300
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,100
according to the time on the GPS?

301
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,100
Don’t worry. No problem.

302
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,260
Thank you.

303
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,700
Passenger confirmed.

304
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,500
Please arrive at the boarding place
in nine minutes.

305
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,500
Did you just take an order?

306
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,380
Don’t we advocate low-carbon

307
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,140
and energy-saving travel with others?

Sorry, buddy.

314
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,220
I was so into it.

315
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,500
Buddy.

316
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,580
You got quite an temperament.

317
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,820
You must be a big boss.

318
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,740
What do you do for a living?

319
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,340
Hotel.

320
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,140
What a coincidence!

321
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,500
I do hotel, too.

322
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,500
Bro.

323
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,540
Where is your hotel?

324
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,460
How is the business?

325
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,300
Listen.

326
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,220
Our hotel has a good price.

327
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,380
Business suite.

328
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,660
Usually it’s fifty-nine a night.

329
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,140
It’s only seventy-nine at the weekend.

330
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,740
The hour room is even cheaper.

331
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,660
Let’s be friend on WeChat.

332
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,140
If we have business ideas, or philosophy

333
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,420
about hotel management,

334
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,140
we can communicate with each other,

335
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,740
right?

336
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,420
Bro. Let me scan your code.

337
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,940
It’s all right.

338
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,580
Maybe someday,

339
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,980
you will sleep in my hotel.

340
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,500
Just mention my name.

341
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,500
Come and look for me.

342
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,660
I’ll buy your dinner. Give you discounts.

343
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,420
Are you sleepy?

344
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,180
OK. Have some rest.

345
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,500
I’m gonna go back to my songs.

346
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,020
Headphones.

347
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,940
All right.

348
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,460
No headphones.

349
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,380
Well, no music then.

350
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,100
I’ve been back for two years.

351
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,700
But I was working at the hotel in Zhuozhou.

352
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,780
I wanted to come back,

353
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,500
but I was too busy and didn’t have a chance.

354
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,980
It just so happens

355
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,420
that the contract is up.

356
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,380
I finally got a chance to come back.

357
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,420
How are you doing?

358
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,700
You’ve

359
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,980
really changed a lot.

360
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,980
You’ve really grown up.

361
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,180
If it’s not Grandpa Gu brought me to you,

362
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,420
I wouldn’t recognize you.

363
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,260
What?

364
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,260
I’m too pretty for you to recognize?

365
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,660
I remember when you left,

366
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,860
I was like 12, 13.

367
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,940
Yeah, right out of grade school.

368
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,460
Time flies.

369
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,460
I’m twenty-one now.

370
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,460
I heard you work at a hotel.

371
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,380
I work at a hotel, too.

372
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,020
I’m a chef in a five-star hotel.

373
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,780
I’m the only girl in the kitchen.

374
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,500
Seriously.

375
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,020
I got in on my own merit.

376
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,220
Am I awesome?

377
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,420
Which hotel?

378
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,340
Forget it. There was a little incident.

379
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,220
So,

380
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,460
I got suspended without pay.

381
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,940
By the way,

382
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,060
what’s wrong with your leg?

383
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,860
Let me take a look.

384
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,460
Much better.

385
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
I forgot

386
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,460
our Shengnan is a big girl now.

387
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,060
You’re no longer the little girl

388
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,220
who cried and laughed

389
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,620
and ran away from home.

390
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,100
How about this?

391
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,620
I’m taking this coffee as wine today.

392
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,460
To our long-lost reunion.

393
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,500
OK. Cheers.

394
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,660
Cheers.

395
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,500
Mind your steps.

396
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,860
It’s alright. Much better now.

397
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,660
Ziqian. Go back and rest.

398
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,660
I live right up here.

399
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,580
You don’t need to go up with me.

400
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,100
Let me take you upstairs.

401
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,300
Your leg has not fully recovered yet.

402
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,980
Alright.

403
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,260
Let’s have a drink.

404
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,140
And introduce you to my place.

405
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,580
If you have something delicious,

406
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,540
just bring them here.

407
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,380
Come on.

408
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,140
Come.

409
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,860
Be careful.

410
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,980
Maybe tomorrow morning,

411
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,260
I can go to the hospital with you.

412
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:54,900
OK.

413
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,300
That wasn’t easy.

414
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,100
Get a car so late.

415
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,140
Mr. driver,

416
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,540
you work so hard.

417
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,340
You should thank that man.

418
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,980
Coming from Zhuozhou and going to Suhai.

419
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,740
Unbelievable, right?

420
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,020
Young man.

421
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,540
You’re good. Impressive.

422
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,460
I bet you’re all hungry.

423
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,660
Here, you want some?

424
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,620
I need to drive.

425
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,340
And you?

426
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,380
I’m not hungry, thank you.

427
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,100
Young man.

428
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,220
You’ve gone so far and you’re in such a hurry.

429
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,420
Is it for love?

430
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,460
I take your silence as a yes.

431
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,780
What is it?

432
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,140
Did you two

433
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,900
have a fight?

434
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,860
Judging from your age,

435
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,500
you must have children.

436
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,100
Hold on to it for your kids.

437
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,660
Young man,

438
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,500
what were you doing in Zhuozhou?

439
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,580
Business trip.

440
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,460
Business trip?

441
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,500
Me, too.

442
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,820
I came to Zhuozhou for

443
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,220
an animal feed contract.

444
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,180
I run a chicken farm back home.

445
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,820
The business can’t be better.

446
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,420
I’m kind of

447
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,820
an entrepreneur back home.

448
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,460
When my husband was chasing me,

449
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,540
he was poor.

450
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,740
He’s afraid I wouldn’t like him.

451
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,540
And he couldn’t afford a gift.

452
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,900
So he went to learn how to knit.

453
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,420
See? This one

454
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,460
was made by him. Isn’t it pretty?

455
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,580
Young man, is it pretty?

456
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,780
I know.

457
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,060
It means nothing to you rich people.

458
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,060
But I think it’s pretty.

459
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,820
I’ve worn it for years.

460
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,100
I couldn’t throw it away.

461
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,900
I still think

462
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,700
this sweater my husband knitted is the warmest.

463
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,740
So warm.

464
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,940
Young man,

465
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,940
for a couple,

466
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,780
if you’re nice to me, I’ll be nice to you.

467
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,260
If you like me, then I like you.

468
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,300
See each other as much as you can.

469
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,260
Why are you so nice to me all of a sudden?

470
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,060
But like all common people,

471
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,100
if you’re nice to me, I’ll be nice to you.

472
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,940
You can come

473
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,940
to my home for meals if you want to.

474
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,740

This is my stop. I’m leaving

492
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,700
Mrs.

493
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,380
Your sweater

494
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,180
is pretty.

495
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,060
Right?

496
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,540
I also think so.

497
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,980
Good Luck. Wish you find your love soon.

498
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,940
Bye-bye.

499
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,060
Bye-bye.

500
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,100
Bro.

501
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,940
Wake up. Bro.

502
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,660
This is it.

503
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,460
This is it?

504
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,660
Where are we?

505
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,380
Suhai.

506
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,660
What?

507
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,860
But I can’t get this car

508
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,740
into the city. The plate doesn’t work here.

509
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,540
That’s as far as I can take you.

510
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,660
Wait a minute.

511
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,660
This isn’t the right address.

512
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,140
You need to drop me off at my address.

513
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,540
That’s why I say people need compassion.

514
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,060
I’ve arranged everything for you.

515
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,460
I sent my brother to drive you.

516
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,660
He’s waiting for you in the back.

517
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,980
He’ll take you straight home.

518
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,460
Absolutely one-stop service.

519
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,700
You can’t do business like this.

520
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
I don’t have other options.

521
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,500
This car can’t go downtown.

522
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,660
Get off.

523
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,500
OK.

524
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,580
Buddy.

525
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,780
Buddy.

526
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,860
Buddy.

527
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,460
Are you the one?

528
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,340
You’re his brother.

529
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,860
You know the address?

530
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,700
I do.

531
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,420
He is in charge of the trip into the suburbs.

532
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,860
I’ll take the downtown route.

533
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,300
Are we going or not?

534
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,780
Don’t be so grinding.

535
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,420
Where is the car?

536
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,900
There. Can’t you see?

537
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,420
= Chengdeli =

538
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,100
Be careful.

539
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,540
OK.

540
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,900
Be careful. Be careful.

541
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,900
It’s OK.

542
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Shengnan, I’m leaving then.

543
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,300
We can go visit Grandpa Gu someday.

544
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:31,700
OK.

545
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,060
I’ll make you a big meal next time.

546
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,260
So you can enjoy my cooking.

547
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,940
Good. I’ll be waiting.

548
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,700
See you then.

549
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,900
Take care.

550
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,460
Gu Shengnan.

551
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,380
That, Cheng...

552
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,300
Cheng Ziqian.

553
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,540
I don’t need you to remind me.

554
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,380
Why did he send you home?

555
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,820
Isn’t this famous Mr. Lu?

556
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,900
What happened to you?

557
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,580
Didn’t have time to blow your hair?

558
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,460
I had a little situation last night.

559
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,540
Don’t you mess with me.

560
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,540
I asked you why Cheng Ziqian sent you home.

561
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,580
It’s none of your business.

562
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Your leg...

563
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,820
I told you. It’s none of your business.

564
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,540
I thought you said we’ve done.

565
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,140
Why are you standing here?

566
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,660
Pretending to care about me?

567
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,820
Can we talk inside?

568
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,500
No.

569
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,620
Mr. Lu.

570
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,260
You’re the one who said never to eat here again.

571
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,260
Yeah, right.

572
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,380
You’re a sucker for breaking your words.

573
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,700
You said you wouldn’t eat my food.

574
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,220
But you went to the food stall.

575
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,820
And then told me to call it even,

576
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,940
and you were going back to work.

577
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,980
And now you’re here.

578
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,940
What do you want?

579
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,740
I had no idea

580
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,100
why I am standing here.

581
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,660
I just heard that you fell off.

582
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,820
I wanted to come here to check on you.

583
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,660
Yeah.

584
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,980
I shouldn’t have fallen off.

585
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,100
I was wrong.

586
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,540
I won’t do it again.

587
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,540
Even if I fall to my death,

588
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,060
