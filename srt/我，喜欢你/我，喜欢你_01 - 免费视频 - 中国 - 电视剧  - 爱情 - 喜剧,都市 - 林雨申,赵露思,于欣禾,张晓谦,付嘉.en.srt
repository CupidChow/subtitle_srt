00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,030

00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,360
and sees you working carelessly,

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,030

Shengnan.

I’m too busy to cook for you.

79
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,920
Just cook the Finger-licking Fried Rice.

80
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
It takes only a few minutes.

81
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,070
I can peel five potatoes in one minute.

82
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,430
I’ll peel a pot of them in a few minutes.

83
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,630
Besides, why don’t you cook it yourself?

84
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,360
I don’t cook as well as you.

85
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,240

It’s as perfect as a Michelin dish.

88
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,070
And...

89
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,920
I don’t want it alone.

90
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,920
Mr. Wang also wants it, right?

91
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,920

92
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,800
You really make wonderful fried rice.

93
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,070
I also...

94
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,190
See?

95
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,920
Since you both want it,

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,190
I’ll go get prepared.

97
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,630
All right.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,360
Let’s cook it in the storeroom

99
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,720
in case Mr. Yu finds us

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
and complains to the manager.

101
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,630
Yes. Yes.

102
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,000
It’s so considerate of you.

103
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,920
- Yes. - Take it.

104
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,750
Peel the potatoes for me.

105
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,190
Okay.

106
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,000
The whole basket of them.

107
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,630

108
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,800
Why am I peeling it?

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,360
Finger-licking Fried Rice.

110
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,680
Smells so great.

111
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,120
It’s finally done...

112
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,800
Wait.

113
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,360
I need one more seasoning.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,870
Don’t be so fastidious.

115
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,870
I’ll go get it.

116
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,920
Don’t touch the rice in the pan.

117
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,800
Just wait for me.

118
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
I don’t care.

119
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
If I can’t touch the rice in the pan,

120
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,360
I’ll eat this on the plate.

Was he the one who set the fire?

137
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,960
Did you set the fire

138
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,550

Good, Gu Shengnan.

152
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,390
That was great.

153
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,030
You burned a pan

154
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,270
into an antique.

155
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,910
Tell me who else did that.

156
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,030
Sorry, sorry, Shengnan.

157
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,670
Don’t tell on me. I’m begging you.

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,550
I’m begging you.

No one.

161

I did that alone.

162
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,270

Six months?

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,270
But Manager Shen,

169
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,030
isn’t that too much?

170
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,360
Besides...

171
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
we haven’t lost too much.

172
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,630
Only a few tablecloths were burned.

173
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,360
I’ll pay for them.

174
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,630
I will. I’ll buy new ones.

175
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,000
Hello?

176
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,600
Do you know the acquirer was in the hotel

177
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,510
when the fire was on?

178
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,030
The purchasing price decreased sharply!

179
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,630
You must give an explanation.

180
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,150
Punish the troublemaker severely!

181
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,150
If you can’t, you’ll be fired, too.

182

183
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,030
You’re fired!

Mr. Lu.

185
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,080
I’m the F&B manager.

186

On behalf of our hotel,

187
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,720
I’d like to welcome you to Room 1123.

Go get ready.

191
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,670
Mr. Lu hasn’t decided

192
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,080
to stay in your hotel.

193
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,440
He wants you to send your best dishes

194
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
to this room.

195
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,440
Okay. Okay.

196
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,200
It’s all your fault, understand?

197
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,670
The acquirer.

198
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,510
Why did you come

199
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,550
right when I cooked secretly?

200
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,320
I was fired because of that.

201
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,440
Well, I must give you my best wishes.

202
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,670
Wish you no seasoning

203
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,600
when eating instant noodles.

204
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,550
Wish you no ring-pull

205
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,910
when opening a can.

206
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,080
Wish you no ringing

207
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,080
when you set an alarm clock.

208
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,440
Wish you no appetite

209
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,910
when eating anything.

210
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,960
Manager Shen.

211
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,080
If I eat it,

212
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,670
I’ll lose my teeth.

213
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,080
I won’t have it.

214
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,440
I’ll ask them to do it again.

215
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,790
No. Get me another dish.

216
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,320
Pesto pasta.

217
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,320
California super beef hamburger.

218
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,670
Crispy vegetables.

219
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,790
Mexican twister combo.

220
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,670
Too salty.

221
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,670
Or are the noodles made of garlic?

222
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,720
Change it.

223
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,960
Change it.

224
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,670
S... Spanish pancake.

225
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,840
Is the sauce expired?

226
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,200
Change it.

227
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,790
Uh...

228
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,790
The guest in Room 1123 is

229
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,200
so fastidious about food.

230
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,510
Is he asking for trouble?

231
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,440
He isn’t.

232
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
He’s asking for a fight!

233
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,080
Doesn’t he know where he is?

234
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,080
Go. Let’s go argue with him!

235
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
- Let’s go! - Go.

236
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,080
Argue with him? Who?

237
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,200
Why are you making noises?

238
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,790
The guest in Room 1123

239
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,960
needs a lesson!

240
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
He isn’t simply returning the dishes.

241
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,080
He’s insulting everyone in the kitchen!

242
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
- Yes! - Yes!

243
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,080
Kick him out.

244
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,840
Kick him out.

245
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,510
Stop, all of you.

246
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
You know what?

247
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,910
None of you can mess up with

248
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,790
the guest in Room 1123!

249
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,670
None of us?

250
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,080
I’ll go and see

251
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,440
who he really is.

252
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Who can’t we mess up with?

253
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,510
You?

254
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,440
He comes to acquire you.

255
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,550
Acquire?

256
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Acquire...

257
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,720
But Manager Shen...

258
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,440
Look.

259
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,790
All chef’s recommendations

260
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,200
have been returned.

261
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,790
We have no more dishes.

262
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,960
Yeah.

263
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,440
Chefs.

264
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,510
I’ve got one dish.

265
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,670
Mr. Lu.

266
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,840
I don’t want it.

267
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,200
I’ve got no appetite.

268
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,790
Take it away.

269
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,720
Mr. Lu has tried

270
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,080
what your chefs can do.

271
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,550
Stop hurting him, all right?

272
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,200
Don’t, Mr. Lu.

273
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,720
This is the last dish.

274
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,080
I’ve brought it.

275
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
Just have a try.

276
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,960
Take it back in the way you brought it.

277
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,670
Pretend it didn’t happen.

278
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,440
All right?

279
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,440
Wait.

280
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
See?

281
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,910
He must have dumped it.

282
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,200
He did.

283
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
But dumped into his stomach.

284
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,270
Wait.

285
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,360
Oil refined from shrimp heads

286
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,790
makes the shrimps as fresh as possible.

287
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,240
The overnight rice

288
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,150
manages to absorb the fresh taste quickly.

289
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,120
Egg wash is put in the rice

290
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
so that

291
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,910
all the rice was wrapped.

292
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,750
Salted egg yolk is the key to mixing them.

293
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,000
Baked luncheon meat

294
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,360
and coddled egg stewed at 68°

295
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,000
make a perfect match.

296
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,630
Each kind of ingredients has its own feature.

297
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,910
Knowing them

298
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,390
and cook them in the right way

299
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,480
will make ordinary ingredients special.

300
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,480
Uh, Mr. Lu.

301
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,120
Does this dish satisfy you?

302
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,680
Your hotel should have been shut down,

303
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,240
considering how poorly you run it.

304
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,680
But I didn’t expect

305
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,480
you had such a brilliant chef.

306
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,510
What’s the name of this dish?

307
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,510
Fried rice.

308
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,110
Finger-licking Fried Rice.

309
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,240
What a special name!

310
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,920
May I meet the chef

311
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,830
who made this?

312
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,720
No.

313
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,440
Uh, I mean, Mr. Lu.

314
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,510
Here is the thing.

315
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,590
That’s a coincidence.

316
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,110
The chef was just away

317
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,110
for the annual leave.

318
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,480
Had the annual leave just after making the dish?

319
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,750
What a coincidence!

320
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,440
Yes. It is.

321
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,110
What a pity!

322
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,000
What a pity!

323
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,350
What do you mean?

324
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,480
It’s a pity that

325
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,200
the acquiring price goes down again.

326
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,920
No.

327
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,720
No, Mr. Lu!

328
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,680
I’ll let her cancel her annual leave right away.

329
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,020
= Chengdeli =

330
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,780
Hello?

331
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,000
What?

332
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,000
Seriously?

333
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,350
Fine. Wait. I’ll be right there.

334
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,030
Xu Zhaodi, I’ve arrived. Where are you?

335
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,240
We agreed to meet at ten.

336
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,830
I’m at the police station.

337
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,510
Police station?

338
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,510
= Police Station =
You’re caught again as the bar girl?

339
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,830
Gu Shengnan.

340
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,030
When I’m in trouble,

341
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,110
don’t add insult to injury.

342
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,030
I come to reissue my ID card.

343
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,310
The jerk I dated in the disco yesterday

344
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,480
must be a recidivist.

345
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,680
He even stole my purse.

346
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,030
I’ve known him for one month,

347
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,400
but I didn’t know he was a fraud!

348
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:04,920
All right.

349
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,240
I come alone to avenge you, don’t I?

350
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,640
Hurry and come.

351
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,000
I’m already in Section D.

352
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,440
D 236.

353
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,640
D 237.

354
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,000
D 238.

355
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,640
Did you smash the glass?

356
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Do you realize that’s illegal?

357
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,550
Well, since you know,

358
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,400
go with us.

359
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,310
Sheng...

360
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,680
Shengnan.

361
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,720
I’ve arrived.

362
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,350
Yes.

363
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,270
I’m in Section D.

364
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,740
= Xu Zhaodi =

365
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,110
Gu Shengnan, I’ve arrived.

366
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,590
Why can’t I see you?

367
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,000
The car isn’t here, either.

368
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Where are you?

369
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,510
I’m in Section D.

370
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,110
Shout and I’ll hear you.

371
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,070
It should be Section B.

372
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,310
B for boy. Not D for dog.

373
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,310
B 238.

374
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,550
Did you get it wrong?

375
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,510
ABC.

376
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,840
- B. - A.

377
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,110
Hurry up.

378
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,720
Run away.

379
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,550
Run when nobody notices you.

380
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,070
All right?

381
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,160
Excuse me, but who are you?

382
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,270
Why are you in my car?

383
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,510
Have we met?

384
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,510
I don’t think he recognized me.

385
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,310
There’s some misunderstanding.

386
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,680
There is.

387
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,270
You get the wrong person.

388
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,590
How could we meet?

389
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,110
It’s your car?

390
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,030
So cool. So cool.

391
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,790
I’ll leave you alone, then.

392
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,920
See you.

393
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,310
Stop, madam.

394
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,000
Have you checked this car carefully?

395
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,240
Tell me the truth.

396
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,790
Are you...

397
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,510
Are you Korean?

398
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,000
Korean?

399
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,240
Well, I can speak a little Chinese.

400
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,720
You speak Chinese very well.

401
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,510
I heard you when you were making a call.

402
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
You must be Chinese.

403
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,960
Please speak Chinese.

404
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,720
I’m sorry, senior.

405
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,440
Senior?

406
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,510
I won’t do it again.

407
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,160
It hurts.

408
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,310
Let go of me.

409
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,720
It hurts.

410
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,070
I can let go of you.

411
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,510
Get back to my car.

412
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,790
Uh...

413
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,880
Must we?

414
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,160
Fine. I’ll let go of you.

415
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,750
Then I’ll call the police.

416
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,030
Come on.

417
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,270
Start your show.

418
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,790
Senior.

419
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,750
Come on.

420
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,070
I’m terribly sorry, senior.

421
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,510
Shall I call the police and take you there?

422
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,640
How did you do that? Do it again.

423
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,030
Mind your expression.

424
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,960
You were humming, weren’t you?

425
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,240
Do it again.

426
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,750
Long and wide noodles.

427
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,480
Just like the bowl.

428
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,480
Big and round.

429
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,640
Only this much?

430
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Fine. Almost enough.

431
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,640
Get off my car.

432
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,640
Sorry, senior.

433
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,270
I’m terribly sorry.

434
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,270
I have the evidence already.

435
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,240
Go turn yourself in.

436
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,030
Senior, cool down.

437
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,510
Stop calling me senior.

438
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,480
We don’t even know each other.

439
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,200
I promise.

440
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
I promise to return your car to normal.

441
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,680
When I came,

442
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,270
I thought about the problem.

443
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,310
- Don’t. Don’t touch it.
- It can be swept away.

444
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,790
I said, don’t touch it.

445
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,240
Don’t.

446
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,110
Sorry. Let me clean it for you.

447
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,350
- It’s good flour. - Stay away.

448
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,400
I’ll pay for that.

449
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,920
Name a price as you wish.

450
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,200
I’ll pay for that.

451
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,830
Fine.

452
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,920
What are you looking for?

453
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,830
Paper.

454
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,160
Why don’t you write it here?

455
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,790
You...

456
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,790
Turn around.

457
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,240
Call this number for the follow-up.

458
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,960
If you don’t call me

459
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,240
within half an hour,

460
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,160
I’ll call the police.

461
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,350
Drive safe.

462
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,400
I’ve got the evidence.

463
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,590
He caught you in the act?

464
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,960
He even made a video.

465
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,680
Did he beat you?

466
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,920
No.

467
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,240
But I feel guilty.

468
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,070
And I feel bad.

469
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,590
I’m glad you’re not hurt.

470
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,960
As for the compensation,

471
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,830
handle it yourself.

472
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,640
Wait.

473
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,030
What do you mean?

474
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,400
Xu Zhaodi.

475
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,480
I went there to avenge you!

476
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
So, I...

477
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,790
I know. I know.

478
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,310
But think about it.

479
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,160
It’s just like this.

480
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,400
Someone fell into the water.

481
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,270
You helped and gave him artificial respiration.

482
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,960
Turns out you gave it to the wrong guy.

483
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,590
Then you’re accused of indecent assault.

484
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,720
But think about it carefully.

485
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,070
What does it

486
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,240
have anything to do with me?

487
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,400
It’s because you meddled with that

488
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,510
and you had bad luck.

489
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,590
I’ve got a big case to handle.

490
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,920
I’m so busy. I gotta go.

491
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,240
Fine, see you.

492
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,790
Xu Zhaodi, how could you say that?

493
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,440
I didn’t give anyone artificial respiration.

494
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,440
What’s wrong with you?

495
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Two more centimeters on the coat.

496
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,480
On the coat.

497
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Two more centimeters on the sleeve.

498
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,110
On the sleeve.

499
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,920
Oh, two centimeters off the bust.

500
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,720
But, boss...

501
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,350
It’s already A cup.

502
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,350
How can I make it smaller?

503
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,920
It’s my own coat!

504
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,590
Tutu.

505
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,480
You can’t even distinguish
men’s and women’s clothes.

506
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,550
How can you find a boyfriend?

507
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,920
Don’t act like a green hand.

508
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,960
Uncle!

509
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,030
Get to your work.

510
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,240
How mean Xu Zhaodi is!

511
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,110
You are mean, I suppose.

512
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,270
You helped a woman without having breakfast.

513
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,680
A woman like Xu Zhaodi.

514
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,350
But, Uncle...

515
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,720
It was different this time.

516
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,960
How different?

517
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,790
Don’t you remember?

518
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,920
You and she were caught by the police

519
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,270
because they thought you were bar girls.

520
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,400
I got you out.

521
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,720
Different?

522
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,030
It’s always about men.

523
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,400
I’ve learnt my lesson.

524
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,550
When she’s in trouble next time,

525
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,720
I’ll never help her again.

526
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,350
Help me, I’m begging you.

527
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,400
Help me, please.

528
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,350
Your mother is my cousin. I’m her cousin.

529
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,110
I’m her relative. But you...

530
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,960
You’re my bestie, at most.

531
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,680
Fine.

532
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,830
Lend your bestie some money,

533
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,830
all right?

534
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,160
Do you know what makes besties

535
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,510
no longer besties?

536
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,720
I know!

537
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,550
Everything, except borrowing money.

538
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,030
Sure.

539
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,790
Tell me.

540
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,200
How much do you want? What happened?

541
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,270
I put some noodles in a Ferrari.

542
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,030
Ferrari?

543
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,160
How much do you need?

544
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,310
We must go to the Automobile Sales Service Shop...

545
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,270
I’ll go get it with you.

546
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,510
Fine. Come with me. Hurry.

547
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,550
Mom.

548
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,510
How is

549
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,310
the hotel case going?

550
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,640
I’m still doing the investigation.

551
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,750
The hotel facilities are outmoded.

552
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,720
Staff aren’t well trained.

553
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,720
There are also serious fire hazards.

554
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,550
Enough.

555
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,680
Employees from the branch

556
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,830
have told me about that.

557
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,750
If it doesn’t profit, stop as early as possible.

558
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,070
Fine.

559
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,240
I know. Time cost.

560
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,310
Solve it as soon as possible.

561
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,160
Don’t you...

562
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,160
Don’t you have anything else to say to me?

563
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,400
I’ve got a meeting with a client.

564
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,240
Go to bed early.

565
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,790
That’s all. Gotta go.

566
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,480
Mom.

567
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,030
= Dear Mr. Lu, wish you a happy birthday,
from Suhai Bank. =

568
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:44,750

Happy birthday to me.

578

Surprise!

579
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,750
Happy birthday, Boss.

580
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,720
Happy?

581
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,960
Surprised, aren’t you?

582
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
Am I the first one

583
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,000
to wish you a happy birthday?

584
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,350
Suhai Bank was the first.

585
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,750
But it’s okay.

586
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,030
It’s okay. It’s okay.

587
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,350
I’m the first to bring you a gift.

588
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,030
Yes.

589
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,110
I paid a big price

590
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,480
to get you a custom-made gift.

591
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,240
It looks like an S-shaped jade.

592
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,000
But it’s a pumpkin.

593
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,680
Fine.

594
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,510
So, is it a pumpkin or an S-shaped jade?

595
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,790
S... S-shaped pumpkin.

596
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,000
Maybe it’s not a pumpkin.

597
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Whatever.

598
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,200
Thank you.

599
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,310
You’re welcome.

600
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,920
Well, don’t eat the noodles.

601
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,160
Let’s go and get high.

602
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,000
Let’s have a birthday party

603
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,590
and have fun with girls.

604
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,590
You’ll have the budget.

605
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,880
Go without me.

606
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,920
Thank you, Boss. I mean it.

607
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,480
Wish you a happy birthday.

608
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Wish you great wealth.

609
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,590
Wish you the best of health.

610
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,160
Come on, Yaru.

611
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,350
Fried rice noodles for you.

612
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,640
I’ll get the money for you.

613
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,070
Don’t bother.

614
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,720
Just give me some good wine.

615
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,880
Look. How stingy you are!

616
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,240
Oh, I just remember.

617
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,550
Shengnan’s uncle hasn’t paid for
two bowls of fried rice noodles.

618
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,400
Shengnan’s uncle.

619
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,240
Shengnan’s uncle.

620
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,110
Mrs. Wang.

621
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
Shengnan, there you are.

622
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,920
Did you see my grandpa?

623
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,630
He went to your uncle’s home.

624
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,590
Having fried rice noodles again?

625
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,000
You’ve never got fed up over so many years?

626
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,400
You like my grandpa, don’t you?

627
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,230
Even you know that.

628
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,150
Why can’t your grandpa understand?

629
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,110
Don’t worry.

630
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,550
I’ll definitely

631
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,840
help you

632
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,000
with your love.

633
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,840
All right?

634
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,110
Look at you.

635
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,590
What are you talking about?

636
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,400
Shengnan.

637
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,280
It’s so late, but you haven’t slept yet.

638
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,320
What are you coming for?

639
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,360
Nothing.

640
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,110
I just missed you.

641
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,710
Let’s go.

642
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,150
Come on.

643
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:56,920
Be seated.

644
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,590
Okay.

645
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,630
Be careful.

646
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,840
Shengnan.

647
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,710
You lost your job again?

648
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,150
How did you know?

649
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,150
As soon as you left the hotel,

650
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,550
Trumpet told me.

651
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,320
Trumpet is worthy of the name.

652
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,880
He always gossips.

653
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,400
Why did he tell you?

654
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,880
Don’t worry about me.

655
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,920
I’ll find another job, anyway.

656
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,920
I’m a talented chef.

657
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,920
I can make both Chinese and western dishes.

658
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,590
I’ll easily find a job.

659
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,800
That’ll be easy.

660
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,550
I told you not to be a chef.

661
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,630
But you didn’t listen.

662
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,400
You just insisted.

663
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,110
What does it concern my profession?

664
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,590
I just had bad luck.

665
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,710
And that was a special occasion.

666
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,230
I was then fired.

667
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,360
Don’t disrespect my profession.

668
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,320
Or you’ll be disrespecting yourself.

669
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,000
Aren’t you a chef, too?

670
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,800
But I’m different.

671
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,110
I own a diner.

672
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,400
You’re only an employee.

673
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,630
Take it.

674
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,000
I don’t come for money.

675
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,630
I know.

676
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,230
I remember today is your birthday.

677
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,070
I won’t give it to you for no reason.

678
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,110
I have a heart condition.

679
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,150
If I die someday,

680
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,590
I have no children.

681
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,800
By then,

682
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,400
I want you to handle my funeral affairs.

683
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,360
Take it.

684
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,320
Don’t talk nonsense.

685
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,880
You’re healthy.

686
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,360
What do you mean having no children?

687
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,800
If you don’t have my father, how do you have me?

688
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,110
Don’t mention your father who is in Africa.

689
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,880
Speaking of him

690
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,070
always makes me furious.

691
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,440
When I’m furious,

692
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,550
I want to go to the toilet.

693
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,000
Oh,

694
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,800
stay and don’t run about.

695
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,840
Don’t touch my spatula.

696
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,280
Got it?

697
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,110
I don’t want to touch it. I’m exhausted.

698
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,800
Fine. Take it. Take it.

699
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:07,920
Sir.

700
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,400
A bowl of fried rice noodles and tinfoil clams.
