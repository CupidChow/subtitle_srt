20

You claimed the credit

21

and now you’re passing the buck?

22
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,400
You wanted a pay raise.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
How about a resignation now?

24
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,640
OK.

25
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,599
Are you firing me?

26
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,959
Bauhinia isn’t the only hotel in Suhai.

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,200
I don’t believe a pretty young chef like me

28

can’t find a job.

Chef Gu, Chef Gu.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
The kitchen is over there.

31
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,319
The dressing room is over here.

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,800
Annoying.

33
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,199
What?

34
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,479
Isn’t this the dish you approved last time?

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,360
Thousand-island Lake caviar with scallop meat.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,719
Such a show-off.

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,039
You like it?

38
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,719
No.

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,039
No, no, no.

40
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,479
Don’t like it? Just change it.

41
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,400
You said this one

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,840
melted in your mouth or something.

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,840
Wait.

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,479
How many seconds

45
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,879
did I use to cut it?

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,199
I didn’t count.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,520
Did I really praise this hotel?

48
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,439
Did I?

49
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,639
Maybe my taste didn’t work

50
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,520
or has upgraded.

51
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,960
Yes, upgraded.

52
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,000
Just enjoy.

53
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,800
You’ve become pickier.

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,039
It’s impossible.

55
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,680
I submitted so many resumes

56
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,080
and have received zero phone calls.

57
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,080
Do the HR of all these 5-star hotels

58
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,000
not have computers?

59
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,199
One has a computer.

60
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,079
Hello, my name is Gu Shengnan.

61
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,199
You got my resume?

62
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,079
Miss Gu.

63
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,519
Meng Xinjie.

64
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,519
What do you want? Make it quick.

65
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,319
I’m waiting for phone calls.

66
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,199
Nothing. Give us the money as soon as possible.

67
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,319
This is the final day.

68
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,199
Why... Why are you so mean?

69
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,439
The borrower has the final say.

70
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:52,759
You wait.

71
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,000
Was I mean?

72
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,079
My boss is right.

73
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,360
OK then. I’ll see you in court.

74
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,040
Cour...

75
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,319
Cour...

76
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Court?

77
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,040
No, no, no.

78
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,800
Is he going to sue me?

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,120
I’m done.

80
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,680
My life is done.

81
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,040
I’m doomed. What can I do?

82
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
I still got a silver lining.

83
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,040
OK.

84
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,360
I got it.

85
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,600
Hey, beauty. Waiting for a car?

86
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Hey, driver.

87
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,160
You’re a Didi Driver, huh?

88
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,480
Have you seen any Didi driver drives a Ferrari?

89
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,800
Why are you so cocky?

90
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,920
Your boss got a new car.

91
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,399
All right, all right.

92
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,399
Don’t be so mean.

93
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,600
How about I give you a ride?

94
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,839
OK, I’ll give you this chance.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,839
Where to?

96
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,639
Xu Zhaodi,

97
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,279
I’m going to see my grandpa.

98
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,560
If I can’t get any money,

99
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,720
I’ll be sued.

100
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,600
You wait and

101
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,959
get locked in jail with me.

102
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,639
Gu Shengnan,

103
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,279
have some faith in your grandpa.

104
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,839
He can afford the compensation.

105
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,800
He’s a boss.

106
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,319
Hey, hey, wait.

107
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,439
The woman who invites you in jail

108
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,800
is a cook, right?

109
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,199
How do you know?

110
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,319
Is Gu Shengnan your bestie?

111
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,079
Richard Meng,

112
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,199
in order to get me,

113
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,240
you’ve become a private detective.

114
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,000
You offended my boss.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,560
Who is your boss?

116
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,439
Lu Jin.

117
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,560
1123?

118
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,680
Grandpa,

119
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,680
am I your granddaughter or not?

120
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,279
Stop peeling the peanuts.

121
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,079
Just stop! Stop!

122
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,800
Listen to me, please.
I’ve been talking for so long.

123
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,560
You are my granddaughter,

124
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,079
but let’s keep the accounts clear.

125
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,079
What do you want to say?

126
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,279
Just say it.

127
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,920
Since you’re so cold-hearted,

128
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,720
I’ll be straightforward.

129
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,319
Can you give me back

130
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,519
the red packet that I gave you?

131
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,199
I knew it.

132
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,079
Small problem.

133
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,560
You’ve missed your chance.

134
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,319
Next year,

135
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,079
I’ll give it to you,

136
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,519
plus the interest.

137
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,920
If you don’t give me,

138
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,079
I’ll have to go ask for my dad’s help.

139
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,399
OK.

140
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,079
You’ll go to see your dad?

141
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,680
After your parents got divorced,

142
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,399
I haven’t seen him for a long time.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,399
You two

144
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:23,800
haven’t seen each other for a decade, huh?

145
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
If you could find him,

146
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,279
I’d reward you.

147
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,799
So

148
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,759
we’ve only

149
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,080
got each other.

150
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,440
Can’t you lend

151
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,440
me some money?

152
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,799
How much?

153
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,200
500?

154
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,519
No, no, no.

155
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
5,000?

156
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,039
No, no, no.

157
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,919
50,000?

158
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,039
70,000.

159
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,919
So why do you stick 5 fingers out?

160
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,799
5-digit number.

161
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,080
What?

162
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,399
You stir-fried

163
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,320
a person or what?

164
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,399
No,

165
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,679
someone fired me.

166
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,799
Tomorrow, an official of Tourism Australia
will dine with us.

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,679
Don’t be late.

168
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,399
I got it.

169
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,799
Mom, but here’s the thing,

170
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,799
I can’t go home because of the acquisition here.

171
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,799
So...

172
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,440
What happened?

173
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Li Man told me

174
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,919
that you’ve managed to

175
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,679
force down the price very low.

176
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,799
Nothing,

177
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,799
I can make it lower.

178
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,080
That hotel isn’t worth

179
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,679
your time.

180
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,080
Make it quick.

181
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,080
OK, OK, I got it.

182
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,679
Bye.

183
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,519
Jie.

184
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,159
What’s the order, boss?

185
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:56,919
I’m hungry.

186
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,919
My God, you’re hungry at last.

187
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,320
Why are you standing still?

188
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,519
Because I don’t have a solution.

189
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,799
I went out to look for food

190
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,279
but nothing satisfies you.

191
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,159
The food you like

192
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,320
is near us. Just downstairs.

193
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,039
But you won’t eat.

194
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,039
Why wouldn’t I eat?

195
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,919
You swore that...

196
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,559
What?

197
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,159
I’m ordering it right away.

198
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,039
Oh, I just remembered. You don’t get to eat.

199
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,159
Miss Gu got fired.

200
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,360
Who did it?

201
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,440
Manager Shen.

202
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,399
Manager Shen?

203
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,320
Manager Shen said

204
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,919
he wouldn’t keep the person

205
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,200
that upsets Mr. Lu.

206
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,799
She used to be a waitress.

207
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,440
You like her cooking

208
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,320
so she got promoted to a chef.

209
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,440
Now you don’t like her cooking,

210
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,559
why would he keep her around?

211
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,799
That’s what he said.

212
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,159
Manager...

213
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,320
Manager Shen

214
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,440
is right.

215
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,399
She deserves it.

216
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,440
That’s why you can’t piss me off.

217
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,919
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

218
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,200
Give me the water.

219
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,320
Love makes water palatable.

220
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,519
Sorry.

222
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,799
Mr. Gu,

223
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,200
please,

224
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,320
spare me some money.

225
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,679
When I find a job,

226
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,799
I’ll... I’ll...

227
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,679
pay you back in installments.

228
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,799
Installments?

229
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,320
OK, OK.

230
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,200
Your culinary skill

231
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,159
is only good enough

232
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,519
to be an errand-girl here.

233
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,679
If you are in trouble,

234
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,559
you can work in this place.

235
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,279
You’ll be in charge of the chores

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,399
like dish-washing and dish-serving.

237
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,200
OK.

238
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,679
OK.

239
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,559
Daily wage.

240
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,440
Daily wage?

241
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,919
Peanuts. My peanuts.

242
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,440
You keep peeling.

243
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,559
I’ll peel them with you.

244
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
I won’t pay for this.

245
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,320
Then you do it on your own.

246
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,919
Boss,

247
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
there’s a restaurant called Purple Door

248
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,679
500 meters ahead of us.

249
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,919
The rating seems to be high.

250
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,440
One star and a half. Pass.

251
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,200
Uh,

252
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,879
200 meters after the left turn,

253
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,799
there’s one where I dined before called Sky Loft.

254
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,200
They got a...

255
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,960
Next.

256
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,200
Pass.

257
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,200
Pass.

258
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,799
Pass.

259
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,200
Pass.

260
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,200
Pass.

261
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,799
Worse than the previous two.

262
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,679
Keep looking.

263
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,840
Boss, how about we

264
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,080
lower the standard a little bit?

265
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,919
Keep looking.

266
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,799
I don’t want you to starve.

267
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,960
It’s bad for your health.

268
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,000

Why are you here?

304
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,879
You are out of our league.

305

And

306
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,759
I thought you didn’t want to see me again.

307
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,759
I don’t know why

308
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,759
you’re here too.

00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,679
Are you blind?

Not necessarily.

how can you argue with a customer
on your first day?

315
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,879
Sir,

316
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,559
can I ask you a question?

317
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,639
Please ask.

318
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,360
Do you own this diner?

319
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:06,840
Yes.

320
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,279
She’s my granddaughter.

321
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,080
This is terrible. I’ll change it for another one.

322
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,960
No, sir.

323
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,360
I’ll take this.

324
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,559
I just want this.

325
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,759

Miss Gu.

333
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,320
It’s yours.

334
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,879
I don’t want to eat it anyway.

335
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,519
You have eaten the dishes.

336
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,720
Cut the bullshit.

337
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,960
You have eaten the dishes

338
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,000
and drunk your wine.

339
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,039
I’ll pay.

340
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,399
You can’t dine and dash, young man.

341
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,279
Mr. Lu.

342
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,960
You’re addicted to embarrassing yourself, huh?

343
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:07,780
How can you refuse to pay?

344
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,359
I’ll slap you.

345
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,160
Come on.

346
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,960
You’re unreasonable.

347
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,640
- Yeah, I slapped your face. So?
- Mrs. Wang.

348
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,630
Are you OK?

349
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,173
- Boss, a little diner like this
- You had it coming.

350
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
- is too noisy. - Shengnan,

351
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,359
he’s drunk and refuses to pay.

352
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,240
Who says I refuse to pay?

353
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,119
What?

354
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,039
I’ll cop the police. Stay the hell away.

355
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:22,519
Who the hell are you?

356
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,640
You can’t do this.

357
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,240
This is uncivil.

358
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,759
Zhaodi, Zhaodi,

359
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,319
I’ll need to stay at yours for a while.

360
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,319
I pissed Fussy Lu off again.

361
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,519
No wonder Meng Xinjie

362
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,160
asked me for your address.

363
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,559
I thought

364
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,359
they wanted you back in the hotel.

365
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,960
Are... Are you trying to get me killed?

366
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,119
Alright, I’m out.

367
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,400
Don’t run away. Don’t run away.

368
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,440
Come back. Let’s talk.

369
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,799
I’ll call the police.

370
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,759
Mr. Meng, I’m exercising.

371
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,640
What happened

372
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,759
wasn’t my fault.

373
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,880
It was those two hooligans’ fault.

374
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,440
Please cut me some slacks today,

375
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,079
and I’ll ask Xu Zhaodi

376
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,079
to buy you a meal tomorrow.

377
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,519
Who is Xu Zhaodi?

378
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,799
Celine Xu.

379
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,680
Celine Xu, huh?

380
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,920
That surely is an attractive offer.

381
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,839
But no.

382
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,200
If I let you go today,

383
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,759
I’ll lose my assistant job.

384
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:26,680
You can’t even be slightly generous?

385
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,079
You deserve

386
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,759
to be a fake rich man for your whole life.

387
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,039
I am a fake rich man.

388
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,039
But if you got to run away,

389
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,400
you’d be a real fugitive.

390
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,400
Right.

391
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,319
Mr. Lu, don’t worry.

392
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,759
Just a scratch.

393
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,759
Nothing serious.

394
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:50,839
You fainted

395
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,440
because your belly was empty for too long.

396
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,319
It was hypoglycemia.

397
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,359
So

398
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,599
please follow a regular diet.

399
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,200
Please get some rest.

400
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,279
I’ll leave you be.

401
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,200
Thanks.

402
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,920
Boss,

403
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,759
you’re starving, right?

404
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,279
I got a take-out for you. Have some.

405
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,039
No.

406
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,039
A full bag of glucose.

407
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,279
I’m full.

408
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,279
You should get your glucose earlier,

409
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,960
so you didn’t have to suffer.

410
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,920
I’m joking.

411
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,400
Um, I took her here.

412
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,759
Would you like to see her now?

413
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,440
Come in.

414
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,920
Be quick.

415
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,079
Hi, Mr. Lu.

416
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:56,920
Jie,

417
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,920
take your phone out.

418
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,799
Please don’t call the police.

419
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,279
Open the calculator.

420
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,160
Car cleaning fee,

421
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,519
mental damage compensation,

422
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,759
cost of lost labor,

423
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,640
hospitalization cost,

424
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,279
medical bill,

425
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,279
and nutrition cost.

426
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,519
Never mind the small expenses.

427
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,640
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 digits.

428
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,920
130,000!

429
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,759
You’re blackmailing me.

430
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,279
Mr. Lu,

431
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,960
I heard the doctor said

432
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,519
nothing serious.

433
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:39,880
This is unacceptable.

434
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,759
I don’t have the energy to argue with you.

435
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,519
Here’s what’s gonna happen.

436
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,319
Jie will call our lawyer, Mr. Li.

437
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,200
They’ll discuss it.

438
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,119
Mr. Li must be asleep.

439
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Don’t disturb him.

440
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,119
Mr. Lu, look.

441
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,640
Don’t come over.

442
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,920
Stand here.

443
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,039
Don’t get so close to him.

444
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,960
Mr. Lu, you see,

445
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,880
your head

446
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,319
took a hit in Fry Diner, right?

447
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,759
This was because

448
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,799
the drunk guy refused to pay Mrs. Wang

449
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,920
so I fought the fellow.

450
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,640
You should ask Mrs. Wang

451
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,519
for the money.

452
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,160
But if she doesn’t have so much money,

453
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,200
I have another solution,

454
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,359
which is my grandpa.

455
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,759
They are

456
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,440
dating at an old age.

457
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,559
Old people like them

458
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,039
have some savings,

459
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,799
am I right?

460
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,119
I have never seen

461
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,119
such a wicked granddaughter like you.

462
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,799
Call the lawyer.

463
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,759
No, no. I’ll compensate you, OK?

464
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,640
You annoying big bosses

465
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,839
never lose because you got your lawyers.

466
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,359
So where is the money?

467
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,359
You haven’t given us

468
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,359
the car reparation money.

469
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,960
You saw what happened to me.

470
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,640
I got promoted and then fired.

471
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:04,920
But I will pay you back as I promised.

472
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,160
In installments.

473
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,759
Can I make installment payments?

474
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,519
There’s a better way

475
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,319
than installment payment.

476
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,640
Not my kidney. Not my kidney.

477
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,920
I don’t need your kidney.

This is

551
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,160
a shady meal anyway.

552
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,400
I buy you this meal

553
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:25,960
to thank you for

554
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,200
selling your bestie out.

555
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,359
I didn’t sell her out,

556
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,400
you just got her address from me
through a dirty trick.

557
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,839
You didn’t sell your bestie out?

558

It doesn’t matter.

559

your bestie sold you out.

561

In order to escape from us,

562
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,359
she asked you to buy me a meal.

563
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:42,440
I...

564
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,319
I can’t believe she’s so nasty.

565
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,559
Not really.

566
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:49,519
Although I have to admit that

567
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,920
I was intrigued
when she offered the chance to see you,

568
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,160
I resisted the temptation.

569
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,279
Save it,

570
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,319
you just want to keep your job.

571
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,400
Waiter, where’s the menu?

572
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,359
Waiter?

573
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:09,079
Wai...

574
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:09,799
All right, all right.

575
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,319
Be graceful.

576
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,839
If you call waiter,

577
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,599
no one will respond to you.

578
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:16,759
Tarjoilija,

579
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,440
menu.

580
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,319
Please.

581
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,559
What do you want?

582
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,640
Salmon soup.

583
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,000
Two pieces of reindeer steak.

584
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,559
Two glasses of white wine,

585
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,359
and chocolate blueberry pie for dessert.

586
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:52,559
Thanks.

587
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,000
Thank you for your order.

588
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,799
This restaurant

589
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,960
serves perfect reindeer steak and salmon soup.

590
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:05,359
I’m not sure you can get used to them.

591
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:07,119
So I just made a random order.

592
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,759
You know quite a lot.

593
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,720
Just a gimmick.

594
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,359
Mr. Lu, welcome.

595
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
It was quite an adventure to your home.

596
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,119
Please.

597
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,319
I can do it myself.

598
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,160
Just a casual meal.

599
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,359
Why are you so serious?

600
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,559
Mr. Lu,

601
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,759
you aren’t an average guest.

602
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,720
You’re the richest person that ever dines
in my house.

603
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,000
I have prepared

604
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,279
red wine, for which I paid 58, and water.

605
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,319
Which one do you prefer?

606
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,480
No.

607
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,440
Someone will drop the wine for me later.

608
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,920
My wine, thanks.

609
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,039
Wine for Mr. Lu.

610
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:28,840
Thanks.

611
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,639
OK.

612
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,480
I like classy customers like you.

613
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:38,880
Decant the wine.

614
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,079
OK.

615
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,400
First up,

616
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,199
Crab meat, sea urchin and caviar.

617
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,440
Can you stop holding a bath towel

618
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,480
next to me?

619
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,599
You make me feel I’m here to take a bath.

620
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,960
Sorry, Mr. Lu,

621
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,960
for making you feel that way.

622
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,679
But your arrival really

623
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,960
shines my humble shed.

624
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:34,320
Please

625
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,119
enjoy your meal.

626
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,360
How much?

627
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,119
It’s 1,320.

628
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,400
I’ll scan you.

629
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,400
Wait, go Dutch.

630
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,320
Your Chinese is good when we check out.

631
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,039
Here.

632
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,760
Oh, you two share a table.

633
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
I wanted to pay for the meal.

634
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,800
We ate

635
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,119
and we met.

636
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,559
This is the end of us.

637
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,199
Please do not

638
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,559
use any excuses to

639
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,599
ask me out in the future.

640
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,760
As a driver,

641
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,960
your money is hard-earned.

642
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
Save some money.

643
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,400
How about Finnish Sauna? My treat.

644
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,000
Please pay the bill.

645
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,360
It’s 2,600 in total.

646
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,119
2,600?

647
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,440
So expensive.

648
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,320
Mr. Lu, I’ll show you the details.

649
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,039
The meal alone

650
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,280
is 500.

651
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,039
But I have to add 20% as the service tip,

652
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,039
which is 600.

653
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,360
It’s expensive

654
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,199
because your wine is expensive.

655
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,360
I brought my own wine.

656
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,519
20% for corkage fee. Standard charge.

657
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,639
So the meal is

658
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,000
2,600.

659
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,400
And considering it went well

660
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,280
between us,

661
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,400
I’ll erase the 600.

662
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,480
2,000, OK?

663
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,400
2,600 it is then.

664
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,320
Thank you and hope to see you again.

665
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,199
Thank you.

666
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,119
Travel safe.

667
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,039
Be safe.

668
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:12,840
Bye-bye.

669
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,840
Anticlockwise.

670
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,840
Close the door, please.

671
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
= Countdown for Debt Payment =

672
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,000
Cheers.

673
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:45,960
Uncle.

674
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,280
Tell you what,

675
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,559
your idea is nasty.

676
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,360
Yes.

677
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,519
2,600 for one meal?

678
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,440
You’ll pay off your debts in several meals.

679
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,079
And this is a long-term business.

680
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,559
It’s perfect, Shengnan.

681
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,880
Quit being a cook,

682
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,840
just open a restaurant.

683
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ll work for you.

684
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,480
You cook, I’ll be the waitress.

685
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,239
Right.

686
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,519
Bottoms up.

687
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,679
Yes, I know.

688
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,039
Yeah, don’t worry.

689
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,679
I have very good decision-making ability.

690
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,320
Yeah.

691
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,440
So.

692
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,239
OK, I’ll be there.

693
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,519
Yeah, next week.

694
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,159
OK, see you.

695
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,440
Sorry, too much stuff.

696
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,679
It’s OK.

697
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,000
Here.

698
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,239
Will you start?

699
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,320
Mr. Lu, here’s the thing.

700
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,519
Many companies have the intention to

701
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,280
buy my hotel

702
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,239
and they will

703
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,320
pay more than you do.

704
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,599
So why are you here?

705
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,400
You should be talking to them,

706
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,800
right?

707
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,159
I think

708
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,599
there’s a special connection between you and us.

709
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,880
Zhenghong Group

710
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,159
is the first one to reach out to us.

711
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,800
So to be fair,

712
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,000
I should at least come to talk with you first.

713
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,000
Hadn’t your offer been too low,

714
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,960
we would have been drinking wine
at the contract-signing party.

715
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:27,000
Mr. Fang, I’ll be forthright.

716
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,239
If you ask

717
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,239
whether my offer would change or not,

718
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,119
I can answer you very seriously right now. Yes.

719
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,159
The longer you own the hotel,

720
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,000
the lower my offer will become.

721
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,079
I’m busy.

722
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,840
Mull it over

723
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,960
and get back to me.

724
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:50,320
I’m not in a hurry.

725
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,740
= Chengdeli =

726
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,280
Please enjoy.

727
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,119
Thanks.

728
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,119
Sous Vide Australian Sirloin Steak.

729
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:23,880
Mr. Lu,

730
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,000
what will you be drinking today?

731
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,320
I assume you’ve brought your own wine?

732
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,119
Yes.

733
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,599
Balbianki Dry Red Wine.

734
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,559
This must be expensive.

735
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:36,559
I’ll help you...

736
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:38,880
No need.

737
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:39,880
You do it.

738
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,519
Mr. Lu,

739
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,440
you must know that

740
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,280
corkage fee doesn’t mean uncorking the bottle,

741
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,559
it means the service fee for bringing
your own wine.

742
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,440
We know that, Miss Gu.

743
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,119
But too bad,

744
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:57,000
this bottle of wine isn’t sold in mass market.

745
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,719
It is valuable

746
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,719
but it’s one of the collections
from a private wine cellar.

747
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,000
Hence, the price is 0.

748
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:10,760
You need a decanter, right?

749
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,280
Sorry for disappointing you

750
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:15,400
but no.

751
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:23,000
Not in the mass market?

752
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,400
Perhaps it didn’t get the hygiene license.

753
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:27,840
You might be poisoned

754
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,639
and foam at your mouth.

755
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,440
Music.

756
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,559
The DJ is off work.

757
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:41,000
You finish your beef off.

758
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:46,639
No decanter?

759
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:51,440
Are you a cow,

760
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,880
listening to music when eating?

761
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:02,119
How come you have time to come to me today?

762
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:03,719
Have you paid off your debts?

763
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:07,000
Did he fall for that trick again?

764
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,960
My life is so hard.

765
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:10,840
What?

766
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,119
He’s so slick now.

767
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,559
He brought his own wine

768
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,400
but without a brand.

769
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:20,079
He told me it was a priceless home-made wine.

770
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,400
The wine wasn’t even decanted. He just drank it.

771
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:25,719
Rich people can be stingy too.

772
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:28,079
I’m here to ask you

773
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,559
for more nasty tricks.

774
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:32,719
Hey, watch it.

775
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,760
No,

776
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,440
your constructive ideas.

777
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:40,880
Come here.

778
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,079
Stand still.

779
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,239
What are you doing?

780
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:57,119
Tell you what,

781
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,559
I’m not a hooker.

782
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,440
What are you talking about?

783
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,719
Stand still.

784
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,519
Put your hands down.

785
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,079
I’m measuring your size.

786
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:23,960
