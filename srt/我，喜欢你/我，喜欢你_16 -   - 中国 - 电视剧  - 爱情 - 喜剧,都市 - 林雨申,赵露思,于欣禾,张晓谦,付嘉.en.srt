break someone’s heart.

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,560
Who?

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,920
Mr. Lu.

24
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,680
Mr. Lu?

25
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,479
In the daytime,

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
I had some affair

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,039
with Mr. Lu.

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,639
When? How come I didn’t know?

29
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,439
Mr. Lu hardly

30
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,159
eats food cooked by others.

31
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,159
You know it?

32
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,159
But today

33
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,199
he ate the food I cooked.

34
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,800
That’s cooked by Mr. Wang.

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,080
You just brought it to him.

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,919
No.

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,159
I squeezed

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,840
a drop of lemon juice on it.

39
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,520
That’s no simple drop of lemon juice.

40
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,080
That will be

41
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,080
a drop of my tear

42
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,439
in his heart.

43
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,080
But that’s not the point.

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
What’s the point?

45
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,159
The point is that Mr. Lu’s attitude to me

46
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,319
is so obvious.

47
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,840
I know

48
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,000
he was implying something to me.

49
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,159
However,

50
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,919
I cannot respond to this relationship.

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,039
Because I haven’t got ready

52
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,319
to accept him.

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,439
Don’t you have two admirers?

54
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,800
Mr. Wang.

55
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,319
Trumpet.

56
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,800
Who?

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,039
Did they come here today?

58
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,199
Yes, they did.

59
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,439
They nearly got to fight for you.

60
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,280
It’s so hard for me.

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,319
The three of them,

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,800
Mr. Wang,

63
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,680
too ugly.

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,039
Trumpet,

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,639
too young.

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,560
Yeah.

67
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,960
Mr. Lu,

68
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,520
a little old.

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,840
Who said he’s old?

70
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,039
He is just

71
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,520
a little bit old.

72
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,040
But he... He’s quite handsome.

73
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,199
The mustache, you know.

74
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,800
I don’t deny it.

75
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,639
He is indeed handsome.

76
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,199
That said,

77
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,319
he and I

78
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,160
are bound

79
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,399
not to be together.

80
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,360
Why haven’t you come?

81
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,560
Who is it? It’s so late.

82
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,959
Are you going out?

83
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,800
Of course not.

84
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,560
I’ll certainly stay with you.

85
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,720
You’re so poor.

86
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,040
Shouldn’t we have a good drink?

87
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Have a good drink.

88
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,519
To friendship.

89
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,399
To friendship.

90
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,439
Drink until drunk.

91
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,199
Yeah.

92
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,439
Drink until drunk.

93
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,800
Drown the sorrows.

94
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,800
Good sister.

95
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,839
We’re sisters. We’re good friends.

96
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,639
Drink it up.

97
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,319
Slowly. Slowly.

98
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,319
OK. Good. Good.

99
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,839
Which room is it?

100
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:07,800
What the hell?

101
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Tell me tomorrow if anything.

102
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,720
It’s my beauty sleep time.

103
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,480
What’s up?

104
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
You’ve got the wrong room.

105
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,199
Good night, uncle.

106
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Take care.

107
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,279
You...

108
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,279
I have some work to report to my boss.

109
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,519
It just occurred to me.

110
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
I’ve got something personal
to talk with Zhaodi.

111
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,319
It just occurred to me.

112
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,560
Go ahead then.

113
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,040

So I didn’t wake you up.

157
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,000
You just left her.

Did you eat it secretly?

173
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,159
If so, it would stick on my tongue.

174
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,240
Alright.

175
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,679
How is it?

176
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,480
Ingredients are right,

177
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,200
but the taste isn’t.

178
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,120
This dessert is about

179
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,840
the mood when lovers are separated.

180
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,240
There is no feeling of

181
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,639
“taking me along”,

182
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,480
but a little bit

183
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,759
“letting me go”.

184
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,960
Why?

185
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,720
Because it’s bitter. It...

186
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,000
But...

187
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:28,840
Think about it.

188
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,759
Coffee and cocoa are bitter in nature.

189
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,440
Tiramisu is also bitter.

190
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,399
The pastry chef’s mood

191
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,720
can directly affect

192
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,240
the taste of his pastry.

193
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,919
That’s it.

194
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,159
Lovers feel bitter when they’re parted.

195
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,919
No.

196
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,720
When passionate lovers

197
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,480
have to be parted,

198
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,279
they don’t just feel bitter,

199
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,519
but also

200
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,440
reluctant,

201
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,679
bittersweet,

202
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,360
and sour,

203
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,440
hard to sleep.

204
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,679
Toss and turn, in the dream...

205
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,360
Stop.

206
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,360
Remake it, right?

207
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,679
Talking so much

208
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,360
and showing off.

209
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,600
Stop fixing it. You...

210
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,919
In the dream.

211
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,679
Just do it. Stop talking.

212
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,600
What are you doing?

213
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,159
Have you had lunch?

214
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,440
Yes, I have.

215
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,879
I’m teaching Trumpet to make cakes.

216
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,279
What cake?

217
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,000
Tiramisu.

218
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,879
I regret it now.

219
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,200
I shouldn’t have called

220
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,159
so many friends there the other night.

221
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,399
I shouldn’t have allowed

222
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,399
Trumpet and others

223
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,919
to play mahjong in my room.

224
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,080
There should’ve been only you and me.

225
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,440
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

226
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,360
Alright. I’m going to the meeting.

227
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,720
Mr. Lu.

228
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,679
Mr. Lu.

229
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,759
Sorry.

230
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,120
Please review these two documents.

231
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,960
You may sign

232
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,919
if there’s no problem.

233
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Have you reviewed them?

234
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,720
Yes.

235
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,399
OK.

236
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,360
How is it?

237
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,799
The taste of nutmeg isn’t enough.

238
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,919
I suggest you remake it with beef stock.

239
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,639
OK.

240
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,600
Remember.

241
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,960
Stir clockwise.

242
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,550
Hello.

243
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,840
= Operating Room Anesthesiology =
Shengnan, where are you?

244
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,840
Your grandpa suddenly fainted.

245
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,679
He’s in the hospital.

246
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,600
Come here now.

247
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,360
OK. On my way.

248
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,360
Trumpet. My grandpa fainted
and he’s in the hospital.

249
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,440
I’m going there.

250
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,639
Call me if anything.

251
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,960
OK. Don’t worry.

252
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,200
Take care.

253

= Inpatient =

254
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:38,720
Mrs. Wang.

255
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,679
How is my grandpa?

256
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,240
I don’t know.

257
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,879
It’s been one hour since he got in.

258
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:43,960
He hasn’t come out.

259
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,000
I’m so worried.

260
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,120
Sir.

261
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,360
Gu Baoguo’s family?

262
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,200
Yes, I am.

263
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,919
The patient is out of critical condition.

264
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,639
How is he now?

265
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,320
His coronary artery is severely blocked.

266
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,679
We’ve fixed it for now,

267
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,919
but he should stay in the hospital
for observation.

268
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,440
Listen.

269
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,159
Go to check in now.

270
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
The attending physician will

271
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,159
take charge of this.

272
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,000
OK.

273
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,320
I’m going, Mrs. Wang.

274
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,120
- Go ahead.
- You stay here.

275
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,759
Go ahead.

276
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,360
Thank you, President Chen.

277
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,480
You come here on your day off.

278
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
You’re welcome, Mr. Lu

279
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,639
How do you feel recently?

280
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,639
Not bad.

281
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,879
I’ve arranged

282
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,919
a team led by the director

283
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,840
to do the examination and rounds for you.

284
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,159
It’s kind of you.

285
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:33,720
Thanks.

286
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,159
It’s our job.

287
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,400
We should thank you.

288
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,693
You donated those advanced equipment

289
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:40,566
to our hospital.

290
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,000
That’s greatly helpful

291
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,639
to our department.

292
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,679
You’re welcome.

293
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,320
Anyway,

294
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,960
I count on you for my heart.

295
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,919
Rest assured. You’ll be fine.

296
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,919
Please.

297
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,320
Please help me think about...

298
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,559
Shengnan.

299
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,400
What’s going on?

300
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,240
That old man also has a heart problem.

301
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,160
He’s waiting for a sickbed.

Gu Baoguo’s family?

306
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,960
Come with me. There’s a ward empty.

307
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,039
Is there a ward?

308
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,440
Great.

309
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,160
You’re lucky.

310
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,200
Someone got you a VIP ward.

311
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,880
Come with me to check in.

312
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,119
Shengnan. Go ahead. Go.

313
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:08,799
OK.

314
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,200
I’ve told you.

315
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,480
Cleaners and nurses can do that.

316
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,000
You don’t have to do it yourself.

317
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,119
They won’t be so meticulous.

318
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,200
I’d rather do the cleaning myself.

319
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,279
By the way,

320
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,640
I made the soup for you.

321
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,720
It’s light. Remember to drink it.

322
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,480
Dad.

323
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,799
I came to see you.

324
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,799
What are you reading?

325
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,400
This book is distressing.

326
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,519
The doctor said

327
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,720
you should keep a good mood

328
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,039
during the recuperation.

329
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,960
I’ll be in a good mood

330
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,559
if you don’t make me angry.

331
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,640
Your dad is right.

332
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,480
Go to the company when you have time

333
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,240
and help your father with the work.

334
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,359
That way he’ll have less burden.

335
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Again.

336
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,960
I’ll be a nuisance there.

337
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,799
Without me, the directors

338
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,720
can

339
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,240
do the work better.

340
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,359
Good-for-nothing.

341
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,799
Don’t be angry.

342
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,920
He didn’t mean that.

343
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,240
He’s afraid that the directors

344
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,799
will think too much if he

345
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,039
shows his teeth in the company.

346
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,799
Think too much? For what?

347
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,440
Who doesn’t know my son

348
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,279
is a good-for-nothing?

349
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,920
Will they worry he drives an excavator

350
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,279
and works as a mechanic?

351
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,640
You are

352
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,720
just a clown in Mingting.

353
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,720
Come in.

354
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,759
Excuse me.

355
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,480
Hello, madam.

356
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:09,960
Hello, sir.

357
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,359
Hello.

358
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:12,920
Hello.

359
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,400
Hello.

360
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,880
I’m the family of the patient next door.

361
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,880
I come to thank you, sir.

362
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,400
The nurse said

363
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,920
if you hadn’t helped us,

364
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,480
my grandpa wouldn’t have had the ward.

365
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,039
So I’m here to thank you.

366
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,279
You’re his...

367
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,200
Granddaughter.

368
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:32,640
Yeah.

369
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,160
I cooked some dishes.

370
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,920
I’m a chef.

371
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,359
So my cooking is not bad.

372
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,359
You may try some.

373
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,559
Thank you.

374
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,680
Thank you.

375
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,519
You’re so kind

376
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,200
to bring the dishes.

377
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,720
It’s just that he’s a patient.

378
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,279
He should eat food

379
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,880
that is light and simple.

380
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,160
These are...

381
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,440
Thank you, though.

382
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,759
I’ll eat them if he doesn’t.

383
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,720
OK. It doesn’t matter.

384
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,440
I... I’m going back.

385
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,440
Thank you, sir.

386
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,880
Excuse me.

387
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,480
Remember to have the soup.

388
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,680
I’m going to the bathroom.

389
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,680
Shengnan.

390
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,200
Are you missing me?

391
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,880
Good news.

392
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,759
I’ll be back tomorrow.

393
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,000
What gift do you want?

394
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,440
Oh. Ask your grandpa

395
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:19,960
for what he wants.

396
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,759
Mr. Lu.

397
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,279
There’s a problem with
cash collection in London.

398
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,200
Risk Control Department thinks

399
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,000
it may affect

400
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,160
the acquisition of Mingting.

401
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,559
Shall we still

402
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,480
stick to the plan on Mingting?

403
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,240
Of course.

404
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,720
We have to persist.

405
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,359
We must do everything for this project.

406
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,680
I’ll solve the problem in London.

407
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,720
Got it.

408
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,980
= Inpatient =

409
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,880
Zhaodi said she went to her hometown

410
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,000
for some business.

411
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,000
I know. She called me.

412
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,559
This room is so big.

413
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,079
It’s a VIP.

414
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,119
VIP?

415
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,599
How much is it per day?

416
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,680
I don’t know.

417
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,720
Are you too tired? Why didn’t you ask?

418
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,240
The gentleman next door said he’d help.

419
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,079
Or we wouldn’t have the sickbed.

420
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,440
The gentleman next door.

421
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,279
It’s OK. He must have paid the bill.

422
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,880
It’s my first time in such a good ward.

423
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,440
Hello.

424
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,759
Hello.

425
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,839
The patient is fine.

426
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,400
When he wakes up,

427
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,759
tell him to take this medicine.

428
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,559
Remember to pay the hospital bill.

429
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,759
Isn’t it paid?

430
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,119
Well.

431
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,839
How much for this ward per day?

432
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,200
1,000.

433
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,519
1,000.

434
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,799
That gentleman next door

435
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,680
just registered but didn’t pay.

436
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,519
You’re so careless.

437
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,039
What now?

438
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,279
How could I know?

439
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,799
Don’t worry.

440
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,759
Shengnan.

441
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,119
Move.

442
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,599
Move. Move.

443
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,279
Be careful.

444
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:09,519
Grandpa.

445
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,319
Uncle.

446
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,480
You wake up.

447
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:12,880
How are you feeling?

448
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,519
Where... Where am I?

449
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,240
Uncle.

450
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,599
You fainted. You’re in the hospital.

451
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,119
Hospital?

452
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,519
Such a big room?

453
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,799
Yes, it’s big.

454
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,279
It’s a VIP room Shengnan specially

455
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,519
got for you.

456
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,440
VIP?

457
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,799
Good girl.

458
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,279
You got me a VIP room.

459
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,480
My love to you is paid back.

460
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,720
You’re looking after me now.

461
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:50,359
Where are you moving me to?

462
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,559
We’re moving you...

463
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,440
We’re...

464
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,720
- Moving you in.
- Moving you in.

465
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,480
Be careful. Be careful.

466
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:01,359
Grandpa.

467
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,799
Doctor told me

468
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,279
to go to him when you woke up.

469
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,119
I’ll go to the doctor now.

470
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:10,599
Go ahead.

471
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,039
I’ll go with Shengnan.

472
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,240
Uncle.

473
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,720
What?

474
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,799
The examination has cost a lot of money.

475
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,039
The hospitalization will also cost a lot.

476
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,240
And grandpa isn’t a local.

477
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,720
All the money has to be paid by ourselves.

478
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,440
How should I get so much money?

479
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:45,839
And...

480
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,720
And

481
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,359
I don’t want to ask Lu Jin for help.

482
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:56,720
You have a point.

483
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,559
Shengnan, you’re right.

484
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,640
You have the backbone.

485
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,079
Don’t always ask him for money.

486
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,720
You have us.

487
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,279
Isn’t it just a VIP room?

488
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,200
Let my uncle stay at ease.

489
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,359
Shengnan.

490
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
Here’s some money. Pay it for now.

491
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,680
Take it.

492
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,160
No, no, no.

493
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,799
I lend it to you.

494
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,839
Pay me back when you have money.

495
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:30,319
Take it.

496
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,279
The password is 777888.

497
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,599
By the way,

498
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,279
don’t tell...

499
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,200
Zenan.

500
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,079
You got it.

501
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,319
Alright. My uncle woke up.

502
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,079
Go to accompany him.

503
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,720
Call me if anything. I’m leaving.

504
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,920
My name is Lu Zheng.

505
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,480
Gu Shengnan.

506
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,000
Are you accompanying the patient
for the night?

507
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,400
Yeah.

508
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,359
So am I.

509
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,680
My mom asks me to stay here
to show filial piety.

510
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,799
Will you deliver dishes here tomorrow?

511
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,240
The dishes in the hospital are awful.

512
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,240
Did your dad like my dishes?

513
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,000
He didn’t eat. I ate them all.

514
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,359
Very delicious.

515
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:52,720
Much better than that my mom made.

516
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,880
If you like it,

517
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,640
I’ll take some to you and your father

518
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,440
when I deliver food to grandpa tomorrow.

519
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,000

522
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,319
you can go to my stall.

523
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:08,839

OK.

525
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,119
OK.

I’m here to replenish the stock.

Don’t you go to work today?

551
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,400
Yes. I’ll go when I finish this.

552

Hey. Down here.

Hello, Shengnan.

558
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:38,400
Morning.

559
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,240
Hello.

560
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,759
I heard that

561
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
your grandpa is hospitalized.

562
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,960
How is he?

563
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,799
Much better. He’ll be discharged soon.

564
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,759
That’s good.

565
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:47,759
You do this every day.

566
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:48,680
It’s hard for you.

567
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,240
OK. Keep yourself busy.

568
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,039
Slowly. Go.

569
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,039
My goods, sir.

570
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,319
Coming. Here.

571
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,759
Why don’t you ride it?

572
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,960
I don’t know how to ride.

573
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,319
I’m afraid it’s dangerous.

574
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,310
Wait a moment.

575
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,010
Sir. Watch over my goods.

576
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:02,743
OK.

577
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,400
Sit on it. I’ll take you back.

578
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,680
Sit. Let me take you back.

579
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,240
Sit. Sit.

580
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,480
- Thank you, Mr. Cao.
- Sit.

581
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,839
Are you ready?

582
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,599
Yeah.

583
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,359
Let’s go.

584
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,200
Are you cold?

585
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,039
I’m not.

586
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,039
But I am.

587
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:21,559
Let’s go.

588
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:29,599
Mrs. Wang.

589
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,440
Please go to see my grandpa

590
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,880
in the hospital in a while.

591
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,480
OK. Rest assured.

592
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,359
You’ve been busy since last night.

593
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,480
Take a rest.

594
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,039
I have no time. I gotta go to the hotel.

595
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,880
Oh, right.

596
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,000
At noon,

597
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,440
I’ll take dishes straight to Grandpa
from Bauhinia.

598
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,759
I’m leaving now.

599
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:44,079
Be careful.

600
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:44,799
I know.

601
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,039
It’s so hard for her.

602
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,880
Shengnan.

603
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,200
Give it to me.

604
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,319
Let me.

605
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,279
Mr. Cheng has asked for your leave.

606
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,160
My salary will be deducted.

607
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:03,839
Here.

608
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,319
What are you doing?

609
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,000
How is your grandpa?

610
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,599
He’s fine.

611
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,599
He’ll get a stent.

612
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:27,599
Take it.

613
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,839
I can’t.

614
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,359
I can’t.

615
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,559
Take it.

616
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,319
I can’t do much to help.

617
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,200
This is what I can do.

618
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,160
Trumpet.

619
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:40,359

Sorry.

Wait! Wait!

660
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,280
There’s hair in the dish.

661
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,480
Will it do just by making another portion?

662
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,719
Well, you mean...

00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,159

I’m not looking for trouble.

OK?

669
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,719
Bullying a little girl. Shame on you.

670
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,159
Who are you?

671
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,639
Forget it.

672
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,599

673
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
You really think the hair is hers?

674
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,840
If not hers,

675
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,039
is it mine?

Sorry. It’s a misunderstanding.

680
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,599
It’s a misunderstanding. Sorry.

681
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,280
What’s this?

682
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,639
Nothing. A misunderstanding.

683
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:04,840
Misunderstanding.

684
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:06,840
Misunderstanding. Sorry. Sorry.

685
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:08,719
Police station?

686
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,199
No! Don’t call the police!

687
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,159
I’ll pay.

688
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,079
Sorry.

689
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:12,880
Sorry. I’m leaving.

690
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,079
Sorry. Don’t call the police.

691
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,159
Did you really call the police?

692
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,599
Of course not.

693
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,719
I can handle it myself.

694
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,199
Thanks.

695
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,719
Why are you here
in the middle of the night?

696
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,519
Didn’t you tell me to come to your stall?

697
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,880
But your stall is really hard

698
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,199
to find.

699
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,760
What are you waiting for?

700
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,199
What? Am I not welcomed here?

701
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,320
Of course not. Welcome.

702
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,400
Just sit here and wait.

703
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,880
I’m sure you’ll be well served.

704
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,880
Sit.

705
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,599
Sit.

00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,559
Gu Baoguo’s family, right?

709
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:57,920
The surgery

710
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,480
will be scheduled at 1 p.m. next Monday.

711
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,960
Fasting eight hours before surgery.

712
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,920
Four-hour water fast.

713
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,199

714
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,960
Remember to pay the bill
at the toll booth.

715
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:07,480
Now?

716
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,719
OK.

717
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,800
Who is it? Come in.

718
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,119
Excuse me.

719
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,840
I’m Lu Jin’s mother.

720
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,679
Are you busy?

721
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,039
Madam. Why are you here?

722
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,440
There’s a big problem.

723
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,920
Where is Mr. Lu?

724
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,719
How long do we have to wait?

725
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,000
We’re at a meeting.

726
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,960
We can’t make a meeting like this. Yeah.

727
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,079
I don’t care how you do it.

728

730
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,039
Business is a war without bullets.

731
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,119
There are no affections.

732
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,320
Any mistake he makes

733
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,039
or any sentiment

734
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:54,480
will be a knife in competitors’ hand,

735
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:56,920
