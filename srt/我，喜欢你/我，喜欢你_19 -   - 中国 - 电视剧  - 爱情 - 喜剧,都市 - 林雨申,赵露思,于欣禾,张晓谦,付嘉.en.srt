20
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,200
Tired?

21
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:57,959
Yeah.

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,359
Put it down.

23
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:00,959
Come and sit.

24
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,360
That’s how I live

25
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,360
in the past 50 years.

26
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,719
But for Shengnan,

27
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,879
I’m not tired at all.

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,199
You must

29
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,879
feel tired sometimes too.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,960
How many employees in your company?

31
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,719
Roughly 10,000.

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,719
Then you must be exhausted.

33
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:37,960
It’s okay.

34
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,759
So many people

35
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,120
are waiting

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,360
for you to feed them.

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,000
This is your responsibility

38
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,080
and your pressure too.

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,960
You have a career,

40
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,719
and a family.

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,840
Your mother loves you.

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,080
She has high expectations of you.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You can’t stop

44
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,840
moving forward

45
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,360
for these people.

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
But a love relationship is not like this.

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,199
You have to stop

48
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,080
from time to time,

49
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,080
so the one who loves you could

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,560
take a look at the surrounding scenery.

51
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,639
And then you look back

52
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,080
at the road you have walked,

53
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,080
no one can fall behind.

54
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,719
You and your lover

55
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,080
should support each other

56
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,479
and keep moving forward.

57
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,680
Lu,

58
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
it is hard for Shengnan during these days

59
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,759
when I’m in hospital.

60
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,840
She has to go to work during the day

61
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,960
and run the food stall at night.

62
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,000
After closing the stall,

63
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,479
she comes here to look after me.

64
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,560
She has no time to rest.

65
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,000
Now you show up, and she is happy again.

66
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,879
I knew she is yours.

67
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,080
She’s bad-tempered

68
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,840
and stubborn.

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,840
But once she falls for you,

70
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,879
she will never give it up.

71
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,360
Do you

72
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,000
understand why I’m saying this?

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,439
Don’t worry, sir.

74
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,360
I will make Shengnan happy.

75
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,600
Don’t fail her.

76
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,759
Never.

77
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,360
You made this soup?

78
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,600
Yeah.

79
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,079
I’d like some.

80
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,720
Pour me a bowl of it.

81
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,680
Okay.

82
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,319
Okay.

83
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,120
It tastes good.

84
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,079
Thanks.

85
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,120
Okay.

86
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,360
Vegetable soup.

87
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,240
Miss me?

88
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,199
Why?

89
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,240
I’m having a great time alone.

90
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,319
I know I left quite suddenly,

91
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,839
but it was all for work. I got no option.

92
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,360
So to make it up for you,

93
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,959
I decide to treat you for hot pot today.

94
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,319
How is it? I bought a lot of shrimps.

95
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,199
Don’t.

96
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,079
Let me do it.

97
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,600
I’m good at this.

98
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,759
The shrimps I peel are tasty.

99
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,759
The freshness will be completely sealed.

100
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,959
This is too hot.

101
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,839
Here.

102
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,480
Here we go. I’m hungry too.

103
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,120
Actually I hated hot pot when I was a kid.

104
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,959
Why?

105
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,199
I watched TV when I was young.

106
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,879
It looked delicious

107
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,120
when people ate hot pot on TV.

108
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,199
I pestered my mother

109
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,000
to take me to the hot pot.

110
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,360
Actually,

111
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
our family was too poor

112
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,720
to eat in a restaurant.

113
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,279
My mother had no choice

114
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,639
but to find a cooking pot,

115
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,199
then added some boiled water,

116
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,800
and some salt,

117
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,800
then put some

118
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,000
cabbage,

119
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,000
frozen tofu,

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,800
and a piece of pig skin.

121
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,720
Oh terrible!

122
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,319
So I said,

123
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
it’s all lies on TV,

124
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,399
I will never eat hot pot again.

125
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,480
But when I grew up,

126
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,279
I found that all hot pots
have base ingredients,

127
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,560
some with butter
and some with mushroom.

128
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,519
The real hot pot is so delicious.

129
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,480
I will cook hot pot for you every day.

130
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,920
No need, thanks.

131
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,120
Only two shrimps left.

132
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,519
You bought too less shrimps, miser.

133
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,439
I’ll buy some more now, OK?

134
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,959
Be fast.

135
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,959
Why can’t I get connected to your Wi-Fi?

136
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,920
Seems my router is broken.

137
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,720
No internet.

138
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,319
No, this is a big deal.

139
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,600
I’ll fix it for you.

140
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
Let me check.

141
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,000
You know, it’s very easy.

142
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,480
All you need is a pen.

143
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,639
And there is a small hole behind,

144
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,720
you take this pen

145
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,240
and stick it for three seconds.

146
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,360
It should work now.

147
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,879
Let me check.

148
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,720
See?

149
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,720
I’m telling you,

150
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,920
every time I come to your house,

151
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,399
my phone will automatically
connect to your Wi-Fi.

152
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,079
I have a feeling that

153
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,160
this home knows me

154
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,000
and I feel like the host of this family.

155
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,240
But it just couldn’t get
connected this time,

156
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,040
I panicked.

157
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,279
The toilet is broken too.

158
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,560
Can you fix it?

159
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,160
Okay, sure.

160
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,040
Do you think

161
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,560
I’m irreplaceable now?

162
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,639
Fixing a router and a toilet

163
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,200
makes you irreplaceable now?

164
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,240
As for the other aspects,

165
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,720
it depends on whether you
give me the chance or not.

166
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,240
Rhetoric.

167
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,399
Do you

168
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,639
like me being rhetoric?

169
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,399
No.

170
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,240
Good boy.

171
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,799
I eat your hot pot.

172
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,799
I fix your toilet.

173
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,799
Are you gonna abandon me

174
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,720
in this deserted place?

175
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,559
You’ve watched too many movies.

176
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,759
You’re too imaginary.

177
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,679
How is this place deserted?

178
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,799
This is the CBD.

179
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,399
Are you kidding? CBD?

180
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,559
It looks like a wasteyard.

181
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,200
Maybe it does now,

182
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,120
but in fact,

183
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,200
it will be rebuilt into

184
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,120
a commercial center soon.

185
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,559
Come.

186
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,200
You drew this?

187
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:23,879
For you.

188
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,720
You will get caught

189
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,720
scribbling here.

190
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,799
Don’t worry.

191
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,879
This land is all mine.

192
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,279
But you said it’s to be built
into a commercial area.

193
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,039
Why are you scribing here?

194
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,240
Yeah.

195
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,200
Everything here will be
demolished and rebuilt,

196
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,480
but not this wall.

197
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:58,759
This is for you.

198
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,000
It won’t be removed.

199
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,440
I painted this picture.

200
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,399
I learned painting when I was young,

201
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,720
maybe not very well.

202
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,879
I brought you out today

203
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,440
just to make you relax.

204
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,759
Paint whatever you want.

205
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,039
I like everything you paint.

206
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,480
Have a try.

207
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,039
I don’t know how to paint.

208
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,480

Shengnan, I need to answer this call.

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,000
Okay.

255
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,559
Listen,

256
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,200
when things go too smoothly,

257
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,039
there is often a hidden crisis.

258
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,000
Understand?

259
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,320
I have said it many times.

260
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,519
Talk later.

261
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,519
How am I looking?

262
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,480
Great.

263
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,679
And then what?

264
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,759
Nothing.

265
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,200
Did he say anything?

266
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,360
Yes, he did.

267
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,120
I got

268
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,120
an emergency

269
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,480
to deal with, so,

270
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,039
don’t hesitate to buy,

271
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,759
whatever you like.

272
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,919
The driver is waiting for you downstairs.

273
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,360
I’ll go handle it first.

274
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,759
All right?

275
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,240
That’s all he said?

276
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,960
I’m confused.

277
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,759
What does he mean?

278
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,519
What do you mean?

279
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,519
Why did you wear a wedding dress
in front of him?

280
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,960
I just think that wedding dress
is very beautiful.

281
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,440
I was bored, so I tried it.

282
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,919
I didn’t expect he would react like that.

283
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,279
Help me figure it out,

284
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,360
what does he mean?

285
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,799
Figure what out?

286
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:04,960
He must think

287
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,759
you are forcing him to marry you.

288
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,559
No!

289
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,279
Yes.

290
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
Will he dislike me?

291
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,680
Yes.

292
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,079
Will he break up with me?

293
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,240
Definitely.

294
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,680
Don’t scare me.

295
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,559
We finally got together.

296
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,160
Now we’re breaking up again?

297
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,079
Because you were Thanos in your last life.

298
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,039
Damn you.

299
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,200
My clothes are sponsored.

300
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,000
Don’t ruin it.

301
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Shengnan, let me help you.

302
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,440
Let me think.

303
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,240
Think it good.

304
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,720
- Lu Jin is…
- Don’t worry.

305
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,279
- It’s over.
- You…

306
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,960
You look…

307
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,160
It’s over.

308
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,559
It’s over.

309
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,960
It’s over.

310
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,799
What is over?

311
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,200
Can you stop cursing me?

312
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,920
You look like a repeater.

313
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,920
I…

314
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,240
- Say it.
- Say it.

315
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:07,880
I…

316
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,559
Actually, I’m resistant

317
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,319
to this relationship deep in my heart.

318
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,240
Xu Zhaodi, what are you talking about?

319
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,119
Be honest with us.

320
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,559
What kind of friend are you!

321
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,400
What do you say?

322
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,680
I don’t know.

323
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:22,880
Yes.

324
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,680
I’m so messed up.

325
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,039
I gotta go to the bathroom.

326
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,240
To calm down.

327
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,279
Go out.

328
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,799
Go straight and turn right.

329
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:48,960
Uncle.

330
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,319
I feel like a mess too.

331
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,240
I need go back home and cool down.

332
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,000
Love you.

333
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,680
What do they

334
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,480
take my place for?

335
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,319
Quan’an Emotion Counseling Office?

336
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,720
Quan’an Emotion Counseling Station?

337
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,319
Quan’an. Quan’an.

338
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,880
Quan’an Emotion Counseling Office?

339
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,400
Next time they need to pay me.

340
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,720
Zhaodi!

341
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,480
The toilet is broken!

342
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,960
It can’t flush!

343
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,519
No.1 or No.2?

344
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,480
Mr. Chen.

345
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,720
The car I asked you to sell,

346
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,680
how is it?

347
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:31,039
The car you have listed on our website

348
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,119
has been sold.

349
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,400
You will get the money in these two days.

350
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,960
That’s great.

351
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,480
Can you speed it up?

352
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,799
I need the money urgently.

353
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,200
OK, let me check.

354
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,519
I’ll help you.

355
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,240
Okay, thanks.

356
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,480
Mr. Lu.

357
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,960
Uncle.

358
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,720
Do me a favor.

359
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,759
What is it?

360
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,039
Hello, sir,

361
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,240
how can I help you?

362
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,119
I want to buy a diamond ring.

363
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,559
Do you want to buy a wedding ring

364
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,920
or a diamond ring for proposal?

365
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,519
For proposal of course.
I’m here alone.

366
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,559
Okay.

367
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:50,559
What style do you prefer?

368
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,799
Let me check first.

369
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,119
Have a look.

370
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,680
Have a look…

371
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,680
How about this one?

372
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,319
Take a look, sir.

373
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,240
This is an Eiffel Tower diamond ring

374
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,640
with 18K gold and one carat.

375
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,799
Classic style,

376
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,880
worth about 80,000.

377
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,119
That is

378
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,799
too much.

379
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
I’m a low-key person.

380
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,759
This is not suitable for me.

381
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,720
Then take a look at this one.

382
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,160
This one is a True Love Coronation series,

383
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,319
worth about 30,000.

384
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,039
It’s more modest.

385
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,640
30,000?

386
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,200
If you are still not satisfied,

387
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,359
we can provide

388
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,319
customized service.

389
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,839
Here is the thing, Miss.

390
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,720
I only get married once in my life.

391
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,680
Right?

392
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,039
I’ve entrusted such a big deal
to your store,

393
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,839
can you offer a discount?

394
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,359
Now that I buy the proposal ring from you,

395
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,599
and I will definitely buy
the wedding ring from you too.

396
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,920
Give me a discount.

397
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,519
Are you gonna buy them one time?

398
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,559
No.

399
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,440
Then there is no discount.

400
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,559
I got the mall’s membership card.

401
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,680
I can give you a free parking ticket.

402
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,240
I can help you with your KPI.

403
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
This is…

404
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,240
I can give away a beautiful packaging.

405
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,640
That’s it.

406
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,319
Okay.

407
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:12,599
I’ll wrap it up for you, sir.

408
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,359
Thanks.

409
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,480
I got a business dinner,

410
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,799
and I need you to go with me.

411
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,440
Why didn’t you ask Xu Zhaodi?

412
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,680
She and

413
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,039
Meng Xinjie are sticking
together recently.

414
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,799
So I

415
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,599
decide to give this chance

416
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,440
to you.

417
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,240
I’m not going.

418
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,039
Besides, I don’t have any decent clothes.

419
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,559
If I wear it,

420
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,759
I will definitely be treated
as a waitress.

421
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,240
No, no, no.

422
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,000
I have prepared the dress for you.

423
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,720
No, Uncle. Don’t…

424
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,700
= General Election of Chinese
Chamber of Commerce =

425
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,920
Congratulations, President Lu.

426
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,079
Thank you.

427
00:22:59,519 --> 00:22:59,880
Congratulations.

428
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,960
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

429
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,160
OK, everyone.

430
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,000
Next,

431
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,440
let’s welcome

432
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,880
our new president Mr. Lu Jin

433
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,240
to give a speech.

434
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,079
Thank you very much
for your support and trust.

435
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:39,920
Over there?

436
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,079
Yeah.

437
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,759
What?

438
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,359
I’ll stop here.

439
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:52,880
Why?

440
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,079
My mission

441
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,640
is done here.

442
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,119
You’ll be

443
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,720
on your own now.

444
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,200
What do you mean?

445
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,759
You asked me to come here with you.

446
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,599
If you don’t go in, I…

447
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,400
Little idiot.

448
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,640
It’s your party, not mine.

449
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,000
My little princess.

450
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,680
Your prince

451
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,000
is waiting for you inside.

452
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,519
Go.

453
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,200
Shengnan.

454
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,039
Go for it.

455
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,519
Recently I read

456
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,759
The Notes and Comments on
Ci Poetry by Mr. Wang Guowei

457
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,559
and I am deeply impressed.

458
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,599
I’d like to share with you

459
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,240
the three states,

460
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,160
written in the book

461
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,359
that one has to pass through

462
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,799
to achieve great success.

463
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,240
Westerly winds withered
trees up last night.

464
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,279
Climbing up the stairs
and being lonely on the loft,

465
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,880
I overlooked the endless distance.

466
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,319
This is the first state.

467
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,000
The dress takes to loosen gradually
and I am more and more emaciated.

468
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,000
No regretful plying at all, I am rather
for her only distressed as I did.

469
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,240
This is the second state.

470
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,200
For the third state,

471
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,599
hundreds and thousands of times,
for her I searched in chaos,

472
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,200
suddenly, I turned by chance,

473
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,359
to where the lights were waning,

474
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,279
and there she stood.

475
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,759
I would like to introduce to you

476
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,119
my fiancée,

477
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,759
Miss Gu Shengnan.

478
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,839
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

479
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,720
Thank you.

480
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:35,640
Ma’am.

481
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,400
Mom.

482
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,720
Come with me.

483
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,519
Are you okay to be alone here?

484
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:47,359
Sure.

485
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,240
I’ll just find something to eat.

486
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,680
Wait me here.

487
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,720
I’ll be back soon.

488
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:12,680
It’s you.

489
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:13,839
Why her?

490
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,680
Because I will be happy with her.

491
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,279
I believe you also hope your son

492
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,359
live a happy life,

493
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,839
don’t you?

494
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,839
Are you willing to take
all the consequences for this?

495
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,680
Of course.

496
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,799
I am.

497
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,680
I hope you can support me.

498
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,960
Why are you here dressed like this?

499
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,640
Don’t mention it.

500
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,559
I was caught by my mother
to make up the count.

501
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,559
But you surprised me.

502
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
You turned out to be
my brother’s fiancée?

503
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,440
Your brother?

504
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,240
Lu Jin is your brother?

505
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,920
Half-parent.

506
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,519
My father married my mother
after separating from Ms. Zheng.

507
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,960
But you two are totally different.

508
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
Lu Jin is very picky,

509
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,880
but you, very easy-going.

510
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,880
I can’t compare with my brother.

511
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,640
My brother has received

512
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,440
very strict training since he was young.

513
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:11,519
How time flies.

514
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,000
In a flash,

515
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,839
Zhenghong Group has its tenth anniversary.

516
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,200
Zhenghong people have been

517
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,839
pioneering and enterprising
with continuous innovation…

518
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,680
Come again.

519
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,079
Don’t be afraid. Say it again.

520
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,359
Zhenghong people…

521
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,559
Zhenghong people have been
pioneering and enterprising…

522
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,559
Louder! Louder!

523
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,680
Zhenghong people have been
pioneering and enterprising…

524
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:36,319
Never though he got such a history.

525
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,119
Anyway,

526
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,680
I don’t want to live like my brother.

527
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,960
Too tired.

528
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,759
You see these people at the venue here?

529
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,839
They are all hypocrites.

530
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,319
It doesn’t look good on me.

531
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,720
Yes, it does.

532
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,759
Look at your eleven o’clock.

533
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,920
Eleven o’clock.

534
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,319
They are talking

535
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,559
like blood sisters now.

536
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,400
But as soon as they finish,

537
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,400
they will definitely turn hostile.

538
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,759
How is this possible?

539
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,640
I envy you so much.

540
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,759
Long time.

541
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,640
Come, have a drink.

542
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,599
Bye.

543
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,279
Hello there.

544
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,240
You got it.

545
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,759
That’s why

546
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,640
I decided to focus on my major

547
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,240
and stay away from these vanity fairs.

548
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,960
Your major?

549
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,519
Car repair.

550
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,119
I am not repairing ordinary cars.

551
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,119
What do you think?

552
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,400
Do you want to play?

553
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,839
You come to this place with toys?

554
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,640
I lifted this when I was caught

555
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,880
by my mother from the depot.

556
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,200
Wanna play? I can teach you.

557
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,680
All right.

558
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,119
Jin.

559
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,559
Zheng Hong.

560
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,000
How are you doing?

561
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,240
I’m here to congratulate you

562
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,839
on finding your true love.

563
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,400
Shengnan is a good girl.

564
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,519
Thank you.

565
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,240
And about

566
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,839
me and your mother,

567
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,880
it’s between us elders.

568
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,839
But in the market,

569
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,839
Mingting and Zhenghong
are highly cross-cutting,

570
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,440
but less complementary.

571
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,759
Even if you take Mingting one day,

572
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:47,559
it’s nothing but a waste.

573
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,559
So I suggest you, don’t do this.

574
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,400
Is it?

575
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,319
But I don’t think so.

576
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,200
These domestic resources of Mingting Group

577
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,319
are still useful for us

578
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,960
to develop the domestic market.

579
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,000
As for those overlapping departments,

580
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,119
this is easy.

581
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,640
I’ll just divide and sell them.

582
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,519
I got nothing to lose.

583
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,680
The foundation laid by Mingting Group
for so many years

584
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,440
is not something you can move.

585
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,559
Let’s wait and see.

586
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,440
I could sell some of Mingting’s

587
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,240
projects with discount.

588
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:22,000
When I get back the funds
and go through

589
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,640
the debt service period,

590
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,359
all your efforts

591
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,319
will be in vain.

592
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,759
The project you mentioned,

593
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,880
is it Futian or Guanshan?

594
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,759
Could it be

595
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,599
the Qin Yun Landscape
with Changjiang Hi-Tech?

596
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,559
But to my knowledge,

597
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,960
Changjiang Hi-Tech intended to get rid of

598
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,680
that project a year ago.

599
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,640
No one dares to take it over.

600
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,680
What I did was not in vain.

601
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,519
It’s just a start.

602
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
Where are you going?

603
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,720
Are you going to her?

604
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,960
This is not something you should worry.

605
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,880
I go where I should go.

606
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,320
Don’t come back if you leave.

607
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Do not worry.

608
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,000
I didn’t plan to come back.

609
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,679
Lu Mingting.

610
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,320
Mom, don’t cry.

611
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,519
Cyclone warrior, charge!

612
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,159
Sorry.

613
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:54,920
Wait.

614
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,360
Lift your feet.

615
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,280
Don’t step on my car.

616
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:58,559
Move.

617
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,559
Be careful.

618
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,440
Sorry.

619
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,079
Thank God.

620
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:03,800
Jin.

621
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,039
Sorry I lost control of my car.

622
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,480
Shengnan was helping me chase the car.

623
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,440
Stop calling her Shengnan.

624
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,840
She is your sister-in-law now.

625
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,960
Let’s go home.

626
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,320
Mom, it hurts.

627
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,440
When why are you
embarrassing yourself here?

628
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,559
It’s okay to play with this stuff,

629
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,960
but watch the occasion.

630
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,280
I shouldn’t have brought you here.

631
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:32,599
Come with me to your dad.

632
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,199
I never thought Lu Zheng is your brother.

633
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,599
This is fate.

634
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,199
Grandpa was sick before,

635
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,559
there was no ward in the hospital.

636
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,840
It was Lu Zheng’s father

637
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,320
who arranged the ward for Grandpa.

638
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,320
So,

639
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,079
Lu Zheng’s father

640
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,320
is your father too.

641
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,599
Yes.

642
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,559
Your brother is so nice.

643
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,480
His 4WD

644
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,159
is really fun.

645
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,079
I haven’t had enough fun tonight.

646
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,360
He is your brother,

647
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,840
you must have his WeChat.

648
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,079
Can you share it to me?

649
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,679
He invited me to go to
his car shop before.

650
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:32,679
He got a lot of 4WD vehicles there.

651
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,360
So many…

652
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,280
Shengnan,

653
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,719
you are my fiancée now,

654
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,800
pay attention to your behavior.

655
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:44,199
Okay.

656
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:45,559
Thank you.

657
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:49,039
I’m tired. Can I have a rest?

658
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,480
Aren’t you gonna rest?

659
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,199
Give me his WeChat then.

660
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,960
I made you a cup of wolfberry tea,

661
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:07,960
try it.

662
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,159
No, thanks.

663
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,039
It’s good to your health.

664
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,840
Put it there. I don’t need it.

665
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,199
= My knees hurt a lot recently. =

666
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,639
= I’m losing my breath
after taking a few steps. =

667
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,079
= And your back hurts too? =

668
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,840
= Take care of your body
when you get old. =

669
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,880
= Come on, try this. =

670
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,199
Senior, look.

671
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,079
One cup, refreshing,

672
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,280
two cups, getting rid of fatigue,

673
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,480
three cups, living long,

674
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,360
four cups…

675
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,960
You will feel great.

676
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:10,840
Shut up.

677
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:25,920
Boss Lu,

678
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:29,159
do you wanna go to the toilet now?

679
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:29,960
No.

680
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,119
I’m done with you.

681
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,679
Senior, one cup, refreshing,

682
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,400
two cups, getting rid of fatigue…

683
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,280
I will take a bath first.

684
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,519
Do you want to take a bath later?

685
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,760
Are you asking me
if I want to take a bath here?

686
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:58,760
Yeah, what?

687
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:14,880
Shengnan.

688
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,079
What do you want?

689
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,079
Take a bath.

690
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,599
Didn’t you ask me to take a bath?

691
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,760
If you don’t want to take a bath,

692
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,320
I’ll turn off the heater.

693
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,239
To save power.

694
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,320
My bad.

695
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,079
My bad.

696
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,199
I will…

697
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,679
Please forgive me for whatever I do.

698
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,920
My fault. I need to use the toilet.

699
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
What have you done wrong?

700
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,719
I’ll stop joking with you.

701
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,719
Anything else?

702
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,639
I’ll not add Lu Zheng’s WeChat.

703
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,679
Keep a distance with him.

704
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:19,960
All right?

705
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,280
If you do it next time…

706
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:53,199
