Excuse me.

No, thanks.

Here are some nourishments for you.

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,759
It’s so kind of you.

27
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,879
Shengnan said you’re very busy.

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,639
You’re welcome. You’re an elder.

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,159
I’m here to tell you

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,039
if you

31
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,639
need any help in the future,

32

please talk to me.

Lu Jin

is very busy.

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,759
All the group’s business is
on his shoulders.

36
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,159
Please don’t bother him

37
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,000
if not necessary.

38
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,680
This is my assistant’s card.

39
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,000
You can call this number

40
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,879
if anything.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,360
I’ll take my leave.

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,000
Shengnan.

43
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,360
I don’t care how you do it.

44
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,120
Take Lu Zheng to me

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,360
in half an hour.

46
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,000
Looks like

47
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,639
you’ve lost a lot of weight lately.

48
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,240
You look after Grandpa by yourself.

49
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,800
It’s hard for you.

50
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,280
Thanks for your care, madam.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,280
It’s what I’m supposed to do.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
Do you know

53
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,039
why I don’t agree

54
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,120
Lu Jin and you to be together?

55
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,000
Because I’m ordinary.

56
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,639
I’m poor.

57
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,759
I have no money.

58
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,879
Do you mean pedigree?

59
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,120
You’re wrong.

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,360
Family background

61
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,520
is never a concern to me.

62
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,400
To tell you the truth,

63
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,280
back then,

64
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,120
I also had nothing.

65
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,280
I took Lu Jin abroad when he’s little

66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,759
and started the business all alone.

67
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,000
From scratch, I worked hard for 30 years

68
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,639
to get where we are today.

69
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
I don’t agree you’re with him

70
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,759
because you will be

71
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,879
his weakness.

72
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,519
Because

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,319
you’ll distract him

74
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,519
and make him lose

75
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,519
the sense of judgment on his work.

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,560
Zhenghong is a huge group.

77
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,519
It won’t suffer any loss because of me.

78
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,839
I, Zheng Hong,

79
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,079
never overestimate any opponent.

80
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,160
Neither will I underestimate

81
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,199
any potential risk.

82
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,079
Miss Gu.

83
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
There’s no doubt

84
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,439
you’re

85
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,920
very charming.

86
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,319
Lu Jin likes you,

87
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,160
cares about your feelings,

88
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,800
and also gets affected by you.

89
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,399
I truly love Lu Jin.

90
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,199
I do this for him as well.

91
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,199
Don’t you want him to be happy?

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,800
Happy?

93
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,319
Miss Gu.

94
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,160
Do you think

95
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,600
he’ll be happy

96
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,800
by giving up his huge business

97
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,800
to be with you?

98
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,959
The story of the Warfare of Chu and Han,

99
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,920
I think

100
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,439
you must know it.

101
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,800
When I was young

102
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,319
and first heard the story,

103
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,560
I couldn’t understand

104
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,279
why Xiang Yu, an unrivaled hero,

105
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,720
lost to

106
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,439
Liu Bang, a nobody.

107
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,319
As I grew up and got experienced,

108
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,319
I get to understand.

109
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,279
Because the woman behind Liu Bang

110
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,879
was Lyu Zhi,

111
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,439
while behind Xiang Yu

112
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,199
was Yu Ji.

113
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,040
Being captivated by a beauty,

114
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,079
a man is doomed to fail.

115
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,399
Even the King of West Chu was like that.

116
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,800
Not to mention

117
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,759
an ordinary businessman.

118
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,040
Miss Gu.

119
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,160
Do you think I’m right?

120
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,680
Lu Jin is dealing with

121
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,759
something urgent in Vancouver.

122
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,240
I believe,

123
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,519
given the way he cares about you,

124
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,279
if you tell him

125
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,160
Grandpa is hospitalized,

126
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,959
he’ll surely stop working

127
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,279
and come back overnight to accompany you.

128
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,759
Now I’m gonna call Lu Jin for something.

129
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,920
If you need to talk with him,

130
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,439
say it now on the phone.

131
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:25,857
Hello.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,839
Lu Jin.

133
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,519
Mom.

134
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,720
How is the work going on?

135
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,199
It’s going well.

136
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,680
I’m with Gu Shengnan.

137
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,480
Let her talk to you.

138
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,439
Shengnan.

139
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,439
Shengnan. Is that you?

140
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,279
Shengnan.

141
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,480
Shengnan.

142
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,720
Sorry. I was too busy to answer
your message.

143
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,959
Shengnan.

144
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,680
Are you there?

145
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,879
Shengnan.

146
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,839
Mom.

147
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,079
Hello, Lu Jin.

148
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,120
Shengnan.

149
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,199
What’s up?

150
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,199
I ran into your mom this afternoon

151
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,399
when I came from the hotel.

152
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,920
We had tea together.

153
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,600
Everything is fine.

154
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,160
Don’t worry about me.

155
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,399
Madam. I’m gonna pay the bill.

156
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,920
Bye.

157
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,120
Mr. Lu.

158
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,960
Mrs. Lu told us to pick you up.

= Inpatient =

160
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,919
Sorry. Sorry.

161
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,559
Shengnan.

162
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,440
Shengnan.

163
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,480
Trumpet has told me.

164
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,879
I’m so tired.

165
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,200
I tried, but I can’t get so much money.

166
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,440
It’s too much.

167
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,840
I can’t get so much money.

168
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,320
It’s fine.

169
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,679
You have me.

170
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,159
Don’t worry about money.

171
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,600
I have money.

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,919
Rest assured.

173
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,679
You lend it to me. When I have money,

174
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,200
I’ll pay you back all of it.

175
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,440
It’s fine.

176
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,840
Let your grandpa have the surgery first.

177
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,679
OK?

178
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,159
Alright.

179
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,440
Don’t cry.

180
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,000
How can you see your grandpa like this?

181
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,159
Don’t cry.

182
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,080
Alright.

183
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,960
Go.

184
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,000
Mr. Lu.

185
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,440
You’re so busy.

186
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,159
Where did you come from?

187
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,320
Looks like

188
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,960
it’s Fast and Furious.

189
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,159
Since Mr. Lu has time for the meeting,

190
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,960
I’m sure he already

191
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,159
has a solution

192
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,159
to the company’s problem.

193
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,120
Right?

194
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,480
Please tell us about it.

195
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,639
It’s more like scolding me.

196
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,840
Gentlemen, you’re the elites

197
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,720
in the industry,

198
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,679
the seniors.

199
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
There’s no place for me to talk.

200
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,840
Go on. I’m listening.

201
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,679
OK.

202
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,000
The clock is ticking.
We’ll get to the business.

203
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,600
The company...

204
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,159
The company is facing

205
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,360
a serious shortfall in funding.

206
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,639
We thought the overseas tourism project

207
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,879
could recover some funds

208
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,440
and relieve the situation.

209
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,399
It turns out

210
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,360
Zhenghong Group is...

211
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,000
Go on.

212
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,000
Keep talking.

213
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,700
= Inpatient =

214
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,879
Be careful.

215
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,440
Grandpa. Have lunch.

216
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,159
OK.

217
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,120
Be careful, Grandpa.

218
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,720
OK.

219
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:13,639
Watch the table.

220
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,759
I made you buckwheat noodles.

221
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,360
And eggs.

222
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
It’s light.

223
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,919
Try it.

224
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,440
Yours.

225
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,360
This is rice.

226
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,200
Steak.

227
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,679
It’s especially for me?

228
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,440
Yes.

229
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,360
Enjoy it.

230
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,720
The salad is for you.

231
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,000
Why?

232
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,840
Aren’t you on a diet?

233
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,960
Am I?

234
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
I’m fat. I’m fat.

235
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,759
I’m on a diet.

236
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,480
Am I fat?

237
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,720
No. No. No.

238
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,120
What do you mean?

239
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,639
Eat, Grandpa.

240
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,440
Here is the rice.

241
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,840
Eat.

242
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,000
Eat. Grandpa.

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,440
Hurry. Eat when it’s warm.

244
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,240
I’ve been eating ward food these days.

245
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,960
There is no taste in my mouth.

246
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,960
Buy me a bag of

247
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,159
Honey Mito.

248
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,360
No. That’s too sweet.

249
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,200
Just eat this.

250
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,639
You can’t eat that before surgery.

251
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,480
Hurry up.

252
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,639
I just want to eat.

253
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,799
I’ll just eat a bit. It doesn’t matter.

254
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,360
Ziqian. Go with her.

255
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:06,919
No.

256
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,879
Shengnan.

257
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,519
Buy it since Grandpa wants to eat it.

258
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:10,879
Let’s go.

259
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:11,679
Go, go, go.

260
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,159
Ziqian. Be careful on the road.

261
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,679
Eat that first or it’ll get cold.

262
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,600
OK. OK.

263
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,600
Eat.

264
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,360
OK.

265
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,440
Quan’an.

266
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,000
Call a car for me.

267
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,679
I’ll go to your office.

268
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,159
Uncle.

269
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,200
You’re sick. Don’t go out.

270
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,919
I’ll go to you if you need anything.

271
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,440
Cut it out.

272
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,480
I finally got Shengnan away.

273
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,480
Call me a car.

274
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,320
By the way,

275
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,360
ask Zhaodi to come along.

276
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,170
OK. Hello.

277
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,399
Is it over?

278
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:06,759
It’s over.

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,360
Mr. Ma. Mr. Peng.

280
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:18,679
Mom.

281
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,960
How was it? What have you talked about?

282
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,639
Did they make it hard on you?

283
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,600
Rest assured.

284
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,440
Did they propose to reelect the chairman?

285
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:31,679
No.

286
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,919
Everything in the group goes well.

287
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,879
These directors

288
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,399
didn’t make it hard on me.

289
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,440
They recognized me.

290
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,519
They didn’t dare to start the meeting
without my approval.

291
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,840
Did they recognize you?

292
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,600
A car mechanic?

293
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,120
Look at you.

294
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,320
Why do you look down on car mechanics?

295
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,879
Mom. Sit.

296
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,080
Let me give you an example.

297
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:55,919
Look.

298
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,679
The whole Mingting Group

299
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,320
is like this four-wheel drive car,

300
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,200
dazzling

301
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
and fruitful in achievements.

302
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,440
It gets to where it is today

303
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,879
relying on the tires,

304
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,120
namely the employees,

305
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,399
and also parts and components, gears,

306
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,840
namely the board members.

307
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,639
What’s the most important part?

308
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,679
My dad.

309
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,159
Motor,

310
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,600
the heart of the car.

311
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,720
That’s it?

312
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,480
Well.

313
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,120
You are not part of it,

314
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,480
are you?

315
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,320
I am.

316
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,639
I’m the hand that puts the car

317
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,919
to the track.

318
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,639
What is it?

319
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,080
Market?

320
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,879
Exactly. The market.

321
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,720
Mom. You’re so smart. I’m proud of you.

322
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
Uh... Well.

323
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Mom.

324
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,080
I had the meeting all day.

325
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,960
My mind is messy.

326
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,000
I’ll go take a nap.

327
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,440
And I’ll go to see my dad later.

328
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,200
Seems you’ve behaved well lately,

329
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,320
going to the hospital so often.

330
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,399
You finally know to please your father?

331
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,519
No. There are good dishes there.

332
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,320
What do you mean?

333
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,240
Make it clear.

334
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,480
Where are the dishes from?

335
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,919
Dishes?

336
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,679
Today,

337
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,519
I get you two here

338
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,480
for your advice.

339
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,639
Of these two lads,

340
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,759
which one is more suitable for Shengnan?

341
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,080
Grandpa. I’ll choose first.

342
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,159
In terms of their age,

343
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,159
Cheng Ziqian is younger.

344
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,759
Cheng Ziqian

345
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,200
wins on age.

346
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,759
Height...

347
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,120
Cheng Ziqian is higher as well.

348
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,200
Cheng Ziqian wins.

349
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,440
Uncle. In terms of appearance,

350
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,080
they’re both good.

351
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,240
But,

352
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,200
I prefer men like Lu Jin,

353
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,920
gentle, noble, wealthy,

354
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,119
and also a little ascetic.

355
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,960
More importantly,

356
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,680
he’s manly.

357
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,440
So, in terms of appearance,

358
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,400
Lu Jin wins.

359
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,359
Grandpa. I think Cheng Ziqian is
more handsome.

360
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,000
Look. He’s kind and pretty.

361
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,640
I vote for Cheng Ziqian.

362
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,640
No need to compare their wealth.

363
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Lu Jin overwhelms him.

364
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,000
Do you know how much money Lu Jin has?

365
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,640
Let me give you an analogy.

366
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,400
If

367
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
Cheng Ziqian’s wealth is a grain of rice,

368
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,640
then Lu Jin’s wealth is...

369
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,000
A bowl of rice?

370
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,359
No. No. A bag of rice.

371
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,720
Five kilograms?

372
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,519
Fifty kilograms.

373
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,240
So,

374
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,960
Lu Jin overwhelms him in wealth.

375
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,599
Funny.

376
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,960
Grandpa.

377
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,680
What good is money alone?

378
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,079
You were badly ill

379
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,680
yet he didn’t show up,

380
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,400
neither did he contribute
money nor effort.

381
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,359
Right?

382
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,640
I used to want to

383
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,680
get a rich boyfriend.

384
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
Now think about it.

385
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,839
They can’t help at all
when they’re needed.

386
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,640
It’s Shengnan

387
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,680
who bears it alone.

388
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,119
But Cheng Ziqian

389
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
is really good,

390
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,640
offering so much help.

391
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,119
He pays so much attention to Shengnan.

392
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,680
So, in terms of Shengnan’s feeling,

393
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,480
I vote for Cheng Ziqian.

394
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,119
Zhaodi is right.

395
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,599
I’ve been fond of Ziqian

396
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,400
since he’s little.

397
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,960
Their parents also

398
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,680
know each other.

399
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,720
In terms of family relationship,

400
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,880
I vote for Ziqian.

401
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,519
OK.

402
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,319
Ziqian wins.

403
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,119
Besides,

404
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,000
Shengnan and Lu Jin

405
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,720
have a big difference

406
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,799
in family background.

407
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,119
Plus, his mother is mean.

408
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,519
Their life would surely be hard.

409
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,519
Absolutely right, Grandpa.

410
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,960
Picking Cheng Ziqian
is controllable and secure.

411
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,039
Picking Lu Jin

412
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,359
is uncontrollable in many ways.

413
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,880
Too risky.

414
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,599
So, in terms of risk,

415
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,039
Cheng Ziqian overwhelms.

416
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,759
Uncle.

417
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,359
It’s not like the old days.

418
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,240
Family background is no longer a problem.

419
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
The difference

420
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:34,039
in age and family background
won’t be a problem.

421
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,279
The point is that

422
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,640
they love each other.

423
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,799
Shengnan loves Lu Jin.

424
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,839
From this only point,
Lu Jin overwhelms him.

425
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,960
What are you doing?

426
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,400
What’s the use of love?

427
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,880
Leading a peaceful and happy life

428
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,000
is the most important.

429
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,640
Gu Shengnan loses her sense of love.

430
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,400
We should help her make a right decision.

431
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:54,960
Uncle.

432
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,400
A marriage without love won’t last long.

433
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,039
Shengnan should choose someone she loves.

434
00:19:59,079 --> 00:19:59,519
I’ll pick Lu Jin.

435
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,400
No! No!

436
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,960
Let go!

437
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,720
Women should choose a man
who loves her more.

438
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,519
Xu Zhaodi! Give it to me!

439
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,119
Let go!

440
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,880
Cheng Ziqian has so many wins.
Lu Jin doesn’t have much.

441
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,480
No.

443
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:08,640
Let me go. Give me one.

444
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,559
I won’t.

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
Go to hell!

447
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,319
You always treat me like this!

448
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,759
I’ll just put one up.

449
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,319
Give it to me.

It’s you! It’s you!

Doctor. How is it?

470
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,880
The operation went well.

471

He just needs to

472
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,400
rest and recuperate.

these days and nights.

but wonderful battle.

Mr. Lu.

We plan to expand the Asian Street.

490
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,160
You’re needed to inspect the site.

of the project.

for you.

If you have something else,

494

it can be postponed.

Don’t always let Ziqian accompany you.

576
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,839
He needs to work as well.

577
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,279
It’s fine. Shengnan.

578
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,200
I’m taking a leave of absence.

579
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,519
I can stay here with Grandpa.

580
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,680
Go to work. Let Ziqian keep me company.

581
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,359
Thank you, Ziqian.

582
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,160
It’s fine.

583
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,079
Take care.

584
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,680
Come. Let’s eat.

585
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,599
No hurry.

586
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,480
Let’s have a talk.

587
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,240
Do you remember this street?

588
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,519
In 2011.

589
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:38,160
I was a secretary on the board
at the time.

590
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,119
The group

591
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,839
wanted to expand the business
from Europe to Canada.

592
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,319
Ms. Zheng was worried

593
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,240
you couldn’t get used
to a new environment.

594
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,680
I was sent to assist you.

595
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,319
Time flies.

596
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,839
It’s been ten years.

597
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,039
Now the division in Canada

598
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
is reconstructing

599
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,359
and expanding this street.

600
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
You had

601
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,160
the same hairstyle on that day.

602
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,119
Mr. Lu.

603
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,599
This building’s structure looks good.

604
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,599
Why will it be built into an Asian Street?

605
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,680
Bringing Chinese culture,

606
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,119
Asian culture to the world

607
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,680
is Zhenghong Group’s goal.

608
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,839
I’ve repeated it many times.

609
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:21,720
Don’t ask me again.

610
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,200
Yes. Mr. Lu. Wait for me.

611
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,519
Wait.

612
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,960
You’re not walking the red carpet.

613
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,440
Why do you wear high-heeled shoes?

614
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
I won’t do this again.

615
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,680
I don’t need a spoiled lady here.

616
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:39,680
Go home if you feel aggrieved.

617
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,440
No. No. Not at all.

618
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,440
Will it do?

619
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,119
You must hate me at that time.

620
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,519
No.

621
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,640
The fact is that

622
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,960
you had the driver send me

623
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,640
a pair of sneakers at night.

624
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Since then,

625
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,359
whenever I go out,

626
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,799
I’ll take a pair of sneakers with me.

627
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,000
Do you remember this store?

628
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,079
We dined here.

629
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,839
I remember

630
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,200
we sit at the center table.

631
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,559
It was a waitress who served us.

632
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:34,119
Why did you remember so clearly?

633
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,240
Because it was the first day

634
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,519
of your 26th birthday that night.

635
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,400
We worked

636
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,279
and didn’t eat until midnight.

637
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
We even

638
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,279
had a quarrel with
the waitress that night.

639
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,519
We ordered prime snowflake beef.

640
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,519
Are you sure this is prime snowflake beef?

641
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:01,240
Please ask your chef to come here.

642
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,839
Excuse me. The chef is off duty.

643
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,200
We really can’t make what you say.

644
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,119
It’s OK.

645
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,000
If there’s nothing to do,

646
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,920
I’ll leave.

647
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,680
Thank you.

648
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:15,960
It’s OK.

649
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,240
I’ll go abroad

650
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,240
on my next annual leave.

651
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,440
Seems you haven’t had a leave for long.

652
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,880
I’ll give you a long annual leave.

653
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,640
Then you went to Korea.

654
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,119
Not only Korea,

655
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
I also went to Japan,

656
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,240
France, and got into Le Cordon Bleu.

657
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,319
Chefs like me studied there

658
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,839
from zero.

659
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,599
And I

660
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,759
have no talent in cooking.

661
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
It took me a long time to graduate.

662
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,000
You try to do everything

663
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,400
to the best.

664
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,079
But my purpose was

665
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,240
simple actually.

666
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,319
I just hoped

667
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,440
you could eat well

668
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,079
after you work overtime every day.

669
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:14,640
It occurred to me that

670
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,759
I haven’t thanked you for so many years.

671
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,559
But I think I should

672
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:21,640
say thanks.

673
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,240
Whether it’s your attitude at work,

674
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,119
or the way you care for me in life,

675
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,440
I should thank you.

676
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,119
Sincerely

677
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,000
thank you.

678
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,640
I have a request.

679
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,640
Say it.

680
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Buy me a drink.

681
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,759
= Inpatient =

682
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,640
Ziqian.

683
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,079
You’ve helped us a lot lately.

684
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I know you’re busy.

685
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,880
And you have to run from hotel
to hospital.

686
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:01,000
Shengnan told me that

687
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,559
the doctor who did surgery for me

688
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,200
was invited by you.

689
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,319
The fee

690
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,960
was paid by you.

691
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,519
Rest assured.

692
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,640
After I check out,

693
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:16,000
I’ll ask Shengnan to pay you back.

694
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,200
Grandpa. You’re welcome.

695
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,079
My parents were busy when I was young.

696
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,319
I always had meals at your home.

697
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,319
You watched me grow up.

698
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,759
Now you’re sick.

699
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,839
I’m supposed to look after you.

700
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,119
Time flies.

701
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,400
You’re in your thirties.

702
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,200
Do you have a girlfriend?

703
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,559
I just returned home.

704
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Not yet.

705
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
This time

706
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,559
I got the heartbreak suddenly

707
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,519
and got hospitalized.

708
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,440
It made me realize that,

709
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,759
given my health,

710
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,200
maybe I can’t see that day.

711
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,200
Grandpa.

712
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,880
I don’t desire much.

713
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,079
I just hope Shengnan can

714
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,880
have a man to rely on.

715
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,000
Grandpa.

716
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,119
Even if you don’t say that...

717
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:09,960
You know

718
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,000
what I mean.

719
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,559
Actually,

720
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,760
I’m already contented

721
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,559
to accompany Shengnan like this.

722
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,519
After all, love cannot be forced.

723
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,079
She already has someone in her heart.

724
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,440
Not like that.

725
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,199
Shengnan’s parents fell in love
at the first sight.

726
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,440
People all think

727
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,440
they’re a perfect match.

728
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,519
Unexpectedly,

729
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,199
their relationship got bad

730
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,639
before long.

731
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,559
In terms of a relationship,

732
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,880
falling in love at first sight is
the most unreliable.

733
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,559
What matters most

734
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,199
is a long-lasting relationship.

735
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,639
Ziqian.

736
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,760
Do you

737
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,519
understand me?

738
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,559
Gu Shengnan is quite adorable.

739
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,960
Being with her,

740
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,559
you must be very happy.

741
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:04,039
There are surprises indeed.

742
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,199
It’s good to be young,

743
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,199
with all kinds of possibilities.

744
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,599
If I could take a time machine

745
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,559
back when I was 21,

746
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,840
I’d be with you in another way.

747
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,559
You’re good now.

748
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,920
No change is needed.

749
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,199
Right.

750
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:33,599
I’m the vice president of Zhenghong,

751
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:36,840
also the chairman of
Global Boutique Alliance.

752
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,480
These are all good.

753
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,559
But you don’t like them.

754
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,320
Let’s change the topic.

755
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,320
Let me finish my words.

756
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,039
Being with you for 10 years,

757
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,559
the biggest regret is that

758
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,440
I didn’t say these words earlier.

759
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,679
In these 10 years,

760
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,480
I keep reminding myself to work harder

761
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,960
and make myself better

762
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:17,320
so that I can be with you all the time.

763
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,320
I don’t just want to be your partner.

764
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,679
Lu Jin.

765
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,559
I like you.

766
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
Don’t drink too much.

767
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,320
You’re drunk.

768
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,559
You didn’t say anything.

769
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,840
I’ll go back and rest.

770
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,620
= Li Man =

771
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:56,086
Hello.

772
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:57,320
What’s wrong?

773
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,719
Lu Jin.

774
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,960
I’m bathing in the bathroom, but

775
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,519
the towel runs out.

776
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,320
Can you bring me one?

777
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,719
Li Man.

778
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,960
Even if I bring it to you,

779
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,440
I’ll just leave it at the door.

780
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,079
I won’t open that door.

781
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:21,199
As long as there’s the door between us,

782
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,440
you and I

783
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,440
will still be good friends,

784
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,960
partners at work,

785
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,719
forever.

786
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,199
You don’t hope

787
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,679
the door is opened as well,

788
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,440
do you?

789
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,440
Alright.

790
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,920
You walked all day.

791
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,199
Don’t sit there.

792
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,159
Go to bed.

793
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,440
Lu Jin.

794
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,480
Thanks.

795
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,159
Good night.

796
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,719
Wait.

797
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,320
Gu Shengnan called you

798
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,840
on the celebration day and I answered it.

799
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,239
I didn’t tell you this.

800
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,079
