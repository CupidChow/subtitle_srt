20
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,359
Shengnan.

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,082
You've not yet...

22
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,691
You didn't answer my calls,
or reply my WeChat messages.

23
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:14,296
I was worried about you.
So I decided to come by.

24
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:18,338
-You're not trying to avoid me, are you?
-Of course I'm not.

25
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:19,650
Why should I?

26
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:29,929
Just tell me the truth.

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,222
Has my brother stopped you
from seeing me?

28
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:35,487
No.

29
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,385
That's not possible.

30
00:02:37,705 --> 00:02:39,149
You're over-thinking.

31
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:41,472
Well, it's getting late.

32
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:43,692
It's dangerous for a kid like you
to hang out there now.

33
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,222
You should be going home.

34
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:47,062
-You just showed your care for me.
-I didn't.

35
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:52,861
It's not like that.

36
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:54,060
I was just...

37
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:57,484
Anyway, go back home.

38
00:02:57,564 --> 00:02:58,709
See you then.

39
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:01,351
Remember I once told you...

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,380
...that I didn't want the grudges
of our parents' generation...

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,659
...to be passed on to ours?

42
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,120
Well, seems like I was being naive.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,526
Ever since my father passed away,

44
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,450
my mom...

45
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,080
My mom has been in tears every day.

46
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,280
I don't want to stay at home alone.

47
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:36,450
All I ask is but to chat
with someone of my age.

48
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,879
I didn't know it would
trouble you this much.

49
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:49,046
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:00,696
Don't worry.

51
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:02,285
I won't bother you anymore.

52
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:03,481
Wait.

53
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,901
What's your brother? A control freak?

54
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,229
He...

55
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:30,984
...doesn't allow me to do this,
or play with that,

56
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:32,466
or see people.

57
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:35,622
He just can't trust me, can he?

58
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,603
Easy there.

59
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:46,112
Don't tell me what to do.

60
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,476
Right, he's more than that.

61
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,753
He's paranoid, too.

62
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,168
He guards against his family
as if they are all thieves.

63
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:01,710
Especially you.

64
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,393
He doesn't want me
to get in touch with you.

65
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:05,395
He...

66
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:06,668
He thinks...

67
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:07,847
He...

68
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,305
He thinks...

69
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:11,911
...something will happen between us.

70
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:15,079
But what can happen between us?

71
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,828
What can happen between us?

72
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:24,160
Childish.

73
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,345
Exactly.

74
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,616
What can happen between us?

75
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:39,458
There you go. Cheers.

76
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:46,218
Just a sec.

77
00:05:47,094 --> 00:05:48,069
Excuse me.

78
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,918
More wine, please.

79
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:52,061
-Okay. Please wait a minute.
-Thank you.

80
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,096
No. Enough for you.

81
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:58,164
Excuse me, we're good.

82
00:05:58,244 --> 00:05:59,169
Okay.

83
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:40,362
It is said that the client
is a rich old man.

84
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,700
Isn't it your expertise
to deal with this kind of male client?

85
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:48,909
The Xu Zhaodi in the past
would not have been hesitating like this.

86
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,780
What's wrong with you?

87
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:10,406
Come in.

88
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:25,208
What's wrong?

89
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,118
Something bad happened at work?

90
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:43,995
Zhaodi,

91
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,286
don't be upset.

92
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:49,863
Think about it. You...

93
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:51,606
You are beautiful and brilliant.

94
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:55,047
You're a recognized elite in the Suhai's
circle of public relations.

95
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,262
And look at me.

96
00:07:58,397 --> 00:08:00,454
I grew up with Lu Jin,

97
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,774
but now I'm nothing but his driver.

98
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:09,558
What should I do with myself
if you're so upset.

99
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:16,570
Are you here to console me
or tell me you're more miserable?

100
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:26,221
I know you don't want to see me.

101
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:29,049
I'd made up my mind before I came by,

102
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:32,816
that if you refused to see me,
then I'd be waiting for you at the door...

103
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:34,428
...until you agreed to take me in.

104
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:38,955
I didn't expect
that you let me in immediately.

105
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:41,828
Did you mean it when you said
you'd take care of me?

106
00:08:45,614 --> 00:08:46,641
Never mind.

107
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,142
I mean it.

108
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,600
I'm serious
when I spoke out every single word to you.

109
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,320
Please let me be your boyfriend.

110
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:03,039
Let me protect you.

111
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,600
If you don't like your current job,

112
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:09,591
then you can just quit.

113
00:09:10,238 --> 00:09:11,244
I'll take care of you.

114
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:15,574
Let me protect you.

115
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:20,112
If you don't like your current job,
then you can just quit.

116
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:22,488
I'll take care of you.

117
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:25,706
Let me protect you.

118
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,023
I know we don't have bouquet,

119
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:37,279
or beef rolls,

120
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:39,847
or witness here.

121
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:46,423
But, will you marry me?

122
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,889
Lu Jin once said to me...

123
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:57,543
...that I might not be able
to make major achievements,

124
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:58,877
or show great talents,

125
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:03,261
but I was willing to live my life
step by step.

126
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:06,808
I'll accompany you to guard our love.

127
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:14,659
I pluck up the courage to confess to you
because I want you to know,

128
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,879
that I, Meng Xinjie,
won't be easily defeated.

129
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:22,201
I'll make you my woman whatever it takes!

130
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:32,366
Don't cry.

131
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,625
You are prettier when you smile.

132
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:41,029
But I still want an apartment of my own.

133
00:10:42,162 --> 00:10:43,844
Okay. Buy one.

134
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:45,244
We're definitely gonna buy one.

135
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:47,171
Listen up. Listen.

136
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:48,393
Here's the thing.

137
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:49,761
I've got some savings.

138
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:52,775
I'm gonna withdraw all of them
and borrow some more from my friends.

139
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:54,393
We're gonna make the down payment first.

140
00:10:54,473 --> 00:10:55,621
As for the loans,

141
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,194
I'll work hard.
We'll pay the loans together.

142
00:10:58,274 --> 00:10:59,149
Okay?

143
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,266
We do need an apartment of our own,
right?

144
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:03,864
There, there.

145
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:07,983
Then, the ring...

146
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:10,748
Why don't you sell it?

147
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:15,480
What's the point to keep the ring
if you can't even make the down payment?

148
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:20,620
Well. Fine.

149
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,842
I'll sell it. Definitely.

150
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:25,888
Since I'm yours now,
I'll do whatever you ask me to. Come here.

151
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:27,263
There, there.

152
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:29,160
Good girl. Good girl. There, there.

153
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:31,434
There, there.

154
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:33,487
Get on with your business.

155
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,884
What business?

156
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:38,284
Cook some noodles for me. I'm hungry.

157
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,474
Okay. Easy-peasy.

158
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,889
-You want a poached egg?
-Yes.

159
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:07,291
This is the woman you like.

160
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:11,202
She's yours now.

161
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:19,827
She's yours now.

162
00:13:20,453 --> 00:13:21,479
What are you doing?

163
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,756
Why can't you just talk?
He's your brother.

164
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,154
I like Gu Shengnan.

165
00:13:27,193 --> 00:13:29,584
I won't talk to Lu Zheng
even if he approaches me.

166
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,580
(Matsuhashi No.1)

167
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,013
Mrs Lu,

168
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:49,972
why are you here?

169
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:51,932
This is my home.

170
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:55,399
Your home?

171
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,311
Then why am I here?

172
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,279
You were completely drunk,
sent here in a man's hug...

173
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,360
...late at night.

174
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:11,096
Man?

175
00:15:12,718 --> 00:15:14,409
You mean, Lu Zheng?

176
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,559
You tell me.

177
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,039
What do you think?

178
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,368
Then...

179
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,907
Where's Lu Jin?

180
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:25,122
I was going to ask you.

181
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,605
You are flirting with Lu Zheng
while dating Lu Jin...

182
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:32,538
...at the same time?

183
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:36,565
Miss Gu, you are really something.

184
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,341
That's not true, Mrs Lu.

185
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:40,060
-Lu and I...
-Don't bother.

186
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,601
You'd better talk to Lu Jin.

187
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:45,350
If you're lucky, you'll convince him.

188
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,619
If you're not,

189
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,580
take the cheque and leave.

190
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,525
(Cash Cheque)

191
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,300
(Fussy Lu)

192
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:20,610
Miss Gu, what can I do for you?

193
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,173
Where's Lu Jin?
Why didn't he pick up my phone?

194
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:24,789
I'm on vacation now.

195
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:27,080
Why don't you try Miss Li?

196
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,232
Li Man.

197
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,630
Forget about it.

198
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:33,321
She's the last one I'll turn to.

199
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,646
What kind of apartment
are you looking for, please?

200
00:16:39,726 --> 00:16:41,327
One with two bedrooms and a living room.

201
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:43,499
The master bedroom and the living room
should face south.

202
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:44,669
-Exactly.
-Abundant day-lighting.

203
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:45,889
Yeah. That's important.

204
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:49,260
The bathroom should be spacious enough
for my big bathtub.

205
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,715
Still sticking to your bathtub?

206
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:51,901
Perfect soundproof.

207
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:54,276
Right. With a good community environment.

208
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:56,949
-I mean the green coverage matters.
-Yes.

209
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,871
There should be supermarkets
in the neighborhood,

210
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,578
along with malls, beauty salons,

211
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:01,992
-and dry-cleaning shops.
-Right.

212
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:03,797
Everything should be
within 20 minutes' travel.

213
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:05,422
-Right.
-Excuse me.

214
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:08,082
What's your budget
for your apartment, please?

215
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:14,580
10 million?

216
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,590
1 million.

217
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:27,067
What's the area of this apartment?

218
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,090
-56 square meters.
-No way.

219
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,870
Are you kidding? 56 square meters?
It seems to be 30 square meters at most.

220
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,506
And there's no bedroom.
You gotta put your bed in the living room.

221
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:37,270
You go right to your bed when you come in.

222
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:40,882
Well, no way.
Too small a place. Let's go.

223
00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:42,441
I think it's great.

224
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,971
If the place is too big,
it'll cost us more efforts to clean it.

225
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:47,197
56 square meters, not too small,
not too big. Perfect.

226
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:50,019
But the location is awful.
See where it is located?

227
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:51,690
They've got nothing in the neighborhood.

228
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,808
Didn't he just tell us that
there's a small market downstairs?

229
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:57,981
And there's a dry-cleaning shop
three bus stations away.

230
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:01,001
And a supermarket, he said,
is a dozen of bus stations away.

231
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,462
You don't even need to take the metro.

232
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:04,279
A dozen of bus stations away
and you're in the suburbs.

233
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,602
No way. This is...
You don't even have a parking lot.

234
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:08,799
Why do we need a parking lot?
We won't even buy a car.

235
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,983
I think this place is fine.
How much is it?

236
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:12,451
1.5 million yuan.

237
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:15,155
1.5 million yuan
for this shabby apartment?

238
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:16,318
Let me do some calculations.

239
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,638
1.5 million yuan, right?

240
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:19,301
1.5 million yuan.

241
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,039
Zero, ten, hundred,
ten thousand, million...

242
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,381
Yeah.

243
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:24,644
Divided by 56.

244
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:27,788
About 20,000 yuan per square meters.

245
00:18:27,868 --> 00:18:30,291
20,000 yuan per square meters.
The down payment is...

246
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:32,005
-Divided by...
-You've missed one digit.

247
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:35,109
-20,535 yuan.
-20,535 yuan.

248
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:37,976
How about this?

249
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,345
Give us a discount, will you?
Forget about the 500 yuan,

250
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:43,172
and round it to 20,000 per square meter.

251
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:44,593
We'll buy it now.

252
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,986
Ma'am, that won't be possible.

253
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:50,406
This is one of the few apartments
that meet your budget.

254
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:52,634
If you find it difficult
to buy an apartment,

255
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,921
my suggest is that you rent one.

256
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,753
Rent one?

257
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:03,720
Let's go.
Show me the best apartment you've got.

258
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:06,489
No problem.

259
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:08,456
Oh, my God.

260
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:09,893
Zhaodi, look at that.

261
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:11,509
There's a lake over there.

262
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:14,246
We can put an end table here in summer,
two futons on the floor.

263
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:16,228
Then we can have tea here, enjoying
the breeze and the view of the lake.

264
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:17,531
It's just perfect.

265
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:19,109
I love this lake.

266
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:22,319
When it's winter,
we can change this wall into a fireplace.

267
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,126
We dine here by the fire.

268
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:26,128
When we have kids,

269
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,661
we can turn this wall into a toy wall
covered by Lego.

270
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:32,394
This is completely my childhood dream.

271
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,823
How's that? You like it?

272
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,086
I do,

273
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,840
but...

274
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,799
Sir, Ma'am,

275
00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:44,098
this apartment costs
more than your budget.

276
00:19:44,178 --> 00:19:45,734
How much more?

277
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:49,328
It's 4.8 million yuan.

278
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:51,412
50 percent down payment.

279
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:54,903
Forget about it.

280
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:56,897
We won't buy this. Let's try another one.

281
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:58,957
-We'll try another one.
-Don't.

282
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:05,437
I'll deal with the money.

283
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,213
Revise this article, and the second one.

284
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:17,786
Proofread it and then send it to me.

285
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:19,407
Keep the rest as they were.

286
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:20,720
Okay.

287
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,540
(Gu Shengnan)

288
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,645
Hello, Lu Zheng. Where are you?

289
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:46,821
I'm at the car dealer's. What's wrong?

290
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:49,541
At the car dealer's?
I'm at the front door but I don't see you.

291
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:52,231
I just came out to buy something.

292
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:53,743
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.

293
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:54,914
Hurry up.

294
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,043
What's wrong?
Has something urgent happened?

295
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:07,048
Yesterday we had dinner together, right?

296
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:08,630
And I was drunk.

297
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,735
Did you send me to Lu Jin's place?

298
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,670
I did. Why?

299
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,955
I was so wasted I couldn't remember
anything that happened afterwards.

300
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:18,181
Did I do something that crossed the line?

301
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:22,924
Of course not.
What are you thinking about?

302
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:23,979
Good.

303
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,809
Then Lu Jin must
have misunderstood something.

304
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:27,550
He doesn't even answer my phone now.

305
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,466
Can you come with me to his place
so that we can explain to him?

306
00:21:31,687 --> 00:21:33,119
That's why you come here?

307
00:21:33,913 --> 00:21:35,797
I beg you. Put it down, please.

308
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,356
Let's go talk to him. Go.

309
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:38,756
Let's go. Hurry up.

310
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,786
When we meet your brother,
you just tell him the truth.

311
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:47,274
Tell him what exactly happened,

312
00:21:47,354 --> 00:21:50,158
that we had dinner the other day,
I got drunk accidentally,

313
00:21:50,238 --> 00:21:51,752
and then I fell asleep.

314
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:52,893
Careful.

315
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:54,360
In the first three seasons,

316
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,952
only Wuqing and Zhangguizhuang
were leased to Songjiang Ltd.

317
00:21:58,032 --> 00:21:59,766
No other lands were leased.

318
00:21:59,846 --> 00:22:01,267
This directly decides
whether we can reach...

319
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:02,593
...the revenue goal of 2.6 billion yuan
by land leasing...

320
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:04,702
...we set early this year.

321
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,010
Lu Jin,

322
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:10,865
the truth is definitely not like
what you saw just now.

323
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:14,400
What you believe to be well-reasoned
are all misunderstandings.

324
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,904
You know what I mean?

325
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:17,941
What's your point exactly?

326
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:20,649
My point is,
there's nothing between me and Lu Zheng.

327
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:22,005
So I...

328
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:23,054
Lu Jin.

329
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:26,081
Give me two minutes.
I need to explain things to you.

330
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,729
Thank you for your help just now.

331
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:29,614
No worries.

332
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:40,999
The apartment is settled now.

333
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,750
Let's go and have a nice dinner.

334
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:44,379
Nice dinner?

335
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:46,343
We have 4.8 million yuan to pay.

336
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:48,626
Let's save up for the down payment.

337
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:49,915
Nice dinner.

338
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:52,415
You're right.

339
00:23:52,495 --> 00:23:53,548
I'll take your advice.

340
00:23:53,628 --> 00:23:54,891
I start to worry about you.

341
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,711
Will these really be enough for you two?

342
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,581
I'm on diet.

343
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:10,660
I'm a vegetarian.

344
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,364
Soup base, you want spicy or light?

345
00:24:14,923 --> 00:24:16,123
-Boiled water.
-Boiled water.

346
00:24:17,807 --> 00:24:21,172
Fine. 0.9 yuan per stick,
and it's 7.2 yuan in total.

347
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,699
As for soup base, it's on me.

348
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:24,986
-Thank you.
-Thanks a lot.

349
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:26,598
-How would you like to pay?
-WeChat Pay. Allow me.

350
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:27,559
-Let me pay.
-I got it. Cash, please.

351
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:28,816
-I'll pay. WeChat Pay, please.
-Allow me.

352
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:29,989
Gosh.

353
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,902
It's only 7 yuan. What's the drama about?

354
00:24:31,982 --> 00:24:33,035
It's only 7 yuan?

355
00:24:33,115 --> 00:24:34,626
Then why don't you just buy us the dinner?

356
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:35,879
Exactly.

357
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,230
There you go.

358
00:24:37,596 --> 00:24:38,622
Thanks.

359
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:41,256
Okay. Please wait a minute.

360
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,290
The card.

361
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,564
Do you still remember that?

362
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:56,973
Sir, your car key.

363
00:24:58,011 --> 00:24:59,116
Thanks.

364
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:02,616
Richard Meng.

365
00:25:02,696 --> 00:25:05,002
May I know your name?

366
00:25:05,082 --> 00:25:06,160
Celine Xu.

367
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:07,756
Celine.

368
00:25:07,836 --> 00:25:08,861
Nice name.

369
00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:19,035
Richard Meng.

370
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:22,949
May I know your name?

371
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:25,834
Celine Xu.

372
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:29,335
I also go by Xinjie.

373
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,355
I also go by Zhaodi.

374
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:33,305
Zhaodi. Beautiful name.

375
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:35,124
I agree.

376
00:25:40,983 --> 00:25:42,287
Silly.

377
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:44,331
-Says who?
-You pinch me?

378
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:46,310
-Yeah. So what?
-Hey, it hurts.

379
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,360
I'm sorry.

380
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,195
-Rock Paper Scissors.
-Rock Paper Scissors.

381
00:25:49,275 --> 00:25:50,774
Again, Tutu?

382
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:51,925
Well, Boss.

383
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:55,230
The truth is, I want to give it to
you as a gift to show my sincerity.

384
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,280
Captain America.

385
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,203
Nice choice. Oh, those chest muscles.

386
00:25:58,283 --> 00:25:59,620
Uncle.

387
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,121
Busy now?

388
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:02,304
You're here, Sis.

389
00:26:02,384 --> 00:26:04,059
Come and have a seat. Come.

390
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:05,422
I'll get on with my work, Boss.

391
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:09,034
Cut this fancy stuff.

392
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:10,915
-Just stick to the point.
-Lend me some money.

393
00:26:13,235 --> 00:26:14,336
What happened?

394
00:26:17,263 --> 00:26:19,269
The thing is...

395
00:26:23,388 --> 00:26:25,463
I got back together with Meng Xinjie.

396
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,643
I asked him to sell the diamond ring.

397
00:26:28,723 --> 00:26:31,012
Then we tried to get some money elsewhere,

398
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:32,545
so that we could make a down payment
for our apartment.

399
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,648
This is for our future.

400
00:26:35,518 --> 00:26:36,479
So...

401
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,637
So, you want me
to cover your down payment.

402
00:26:38,717 --> 00:26:40,487
It's not like that.

403
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:44,371
Well, I won't be able to
pay you back in a short time.

404
00:26:44,451 --> 00:26:46,413
So if you like it,

405
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:48,592
lend me some money.

406
00:26:48,672 --> 00:26:50,566
And if you don't like it...

407
00:26:50,646 --> 00:26:51,653
I don't like it.

408
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,759
Listen to yourself!

409
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,519
Even Gu Shengnan lent me 20,000 yuan.

410
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,749
I'm serious.

411
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,277
I won't change this time.

412
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:31,671
(You received 500,000 yuan of transfer)

413
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:34,881
Zhaodi,
it's not easy to see you being serious.

414
00:27:36,134 --> 00:27:37,763
Wish you a happy life with Mr Driver.

415
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:40,905
You play any farce
and I'll double your interest.

416
00:27:50,446 --> 00:27:51,579
Uncle,

417
00:27:54,016 --> 00:27:55,052
you rock!

418
00:28:26,592 --> 00:28:27,508
Come in.

419
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,120
You're taking a break, Sir?

420
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,692
-I'll come back to you later then.
-It's okay.

421
00:28:34,772 --> 00:28:35,852
What happened?

422
00:28:36,221 --> 00:28:39,247
Nothing important.
I'll wait until you're ready.

423
00:28:40,948 --> 00:28:42,016
Fire away.

424
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,565
Well, this might mean little to you,

425
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,325
but it means a lot to me.

426
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:54,235
It's the happiness of the rest of my life.

427
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:56,884
Just get down to business.

428
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:02,198
I want to advance my salary.

429
00:29:14,857 --> 00:29:16,177
(Agreement on Advance of Salary)

430
00:29:16,832 --> 00:29:19,279
(Party A Lu Jin Party B Meng Xinjie)

431
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,390
To buy an apartment for marriage.

432
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,528
Duration 10 years.

433
00:29:24,234 --> 00:29:25,612
2.4 million yuan.

434
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:30,420
I'm serious.

435
00:29:31,423 --> 00:29:32,848
I'll have to marry Zhaodi anyway.

436
00:29:34,258 --> 00:29:36,876
I'll protect her, love her,

437
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:39,352
and will never leave her.

438
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:43,327
I've done my calculations.

439
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,753
Based on my package,

440
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:48,411
I'll advance my 10 years' salary
of 2.4 million yuan.

441
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:51,947
My apartment costs 4.8 million,
and that's enough for the down payment.

442
00:30:01,326 --> 00:30:03,612
What are you talking about? Bullshit.

443
00:30:03,692 --> 00:30:06,738
If 2.4 million is too much,
1.2 million will also do.

444
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,224
How much is your apartment?

445
00:30:11,304 --> 00:30:12,714
4.8 million.

446
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:45,806
2.4 million is for your down payment,
and the rest 2.6 million...

447
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:49,736
...for you to guard your love.

448
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:55,274
I want you to deliver every single word
you just said.

449
00:30:56,143 --> 00:30:58,031
This is a personal lending from me.

450
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:01,168
Why that face?

451
00:31:01,572 --> 00:31:03,436
You're so nice to me.

452
00:31:03,516 --> 00:31:04,701
What are you doing?

453
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,198
Thank you, Boss.

454
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,472
If you do care that much, go ask him.

455
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:55,596
Emotional abuse is just outrageous.

456
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:58,568
You'll either make up with him
or break up with him.

457
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,119
He needs to make a clear choice.

458
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,043
You're right.

459
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,720
I can't let him be when he's cold to me.

460
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,352
I think...

461
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:17,354
...I should go talk to him.

462
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,384
I'll drive you there.

463
00:32:55,114 --> 00:32:56,755
It's late. Why are you here?

464
00:32:58,408 --> 00:32:59,501
Lu Jin,

465
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:03,261
I've been reflecting on myself.

466
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:06,590
I am indeed responsible
for our recent problem.

467
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,200
But I've explained it to you.

468
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:15,516
You can't just keep ignoring me, can you?

469
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:19,578
You've been so cold to me
that I feel really bad.

470
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:24,680
If there's something wrong,

471
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,144
you can just tell me.

472
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:34,519
Can we not talk about this right now?

473
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:36,579
Go back and have a rest early.

474
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,207
No.

475
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:45,060
I want to sort this out today.

476
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:50,200
Or if this doesn't work anymore,
just give me a word.

477
00:33:51,326 --> 00:33:54,244
But you need to announce the sentence.

478
00:34:01,592 --> 00:34:03,118
I think we should calm down first.

479
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:05,839
Go home.

480
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,760
What's that supposed to mean?

481
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:01,809
He asked you to calm down.

482
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,719
That sounds like a break-up.

483
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,427
Well, I'm just making wild guess.

484
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:12,246
Maybe that's not what he meant.

485
00:35:14,817 --> 00:35:17,239
Perhaps you can ask him to make it clear.

486
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,846
I don't want to talk to him anymore.

487
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,205
What about taking some days off
for a trip of distraction?

488
00:35:33,944 --> 00:35:35,800
You can drop the nuisances for a while,

489
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,965
and come back refreshed
before you face the work and relationship.

490
00:35:40,045 --> 00:35:40,981
How about that?

491
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,920
Sounds nice.

492
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,360
But I can't.

493
00:35:49,212 --> 00:35:50,944
I've got a little tortoise to look after.

494
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,423
Don't worry. I can look after it.

495
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,038
Then I'll leave my spare keys to you.

496
00:35:57,118 --> 00:35:58,258
Thanks.

497
00:35:59,982 --> 00:36:00,950
You're welcome.

498
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:34,133
Shengnan.

499
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,193
Brother,

500
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:50,920
you are here.

501
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,158
Where's Gu Shengnan?

502
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,710
Shengnan...

503
00:36:59,238 --> 00:37:01,920
She felt upset and so she went on a trip.

504
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:05,280
What? Didn't she tell you?

505
00:37:06,772 --> 00:37:08,033
Why are you here?

506
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:10,344
She left in a hurry,

507
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:12,883
so she asked me to tidy up her home...

508
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,719
...and to get rid of these...

509
00:37:21,045 --> 00:37:22,296
...useless things by the way.

510
00:37:29,052 --> 00:37:30,196
Nice picture.

511
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:35,361
Pity.

512
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,453
Mr Lu with Zhenghong Group is here.

513
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:25,592
I'd like to present
the new chairman of the board of Mingting.

514
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:29,595
Brother.

515
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:37,047
Since you've known each other,
why don't we just get down to business?

516
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:40,754
The main purpose of the meeting today
is to help Zhenghong Group,

517
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:43,104
our new stakeholder,

518
00:38:43,184 --> 00:38:46,822
to know more about
the status quo of Mingting.

519
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:49,457
We have a steady management system of...

520
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:50,887
..."Three Boards
and One Executive Management".

521
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:53,152
We have renown experts
as our independent directors.

522
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:57,992
Besides, within the group we have
a sound system for risk precaution.

523
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:01,017
Very sound indeed.

524
00:39:01,097 --> 00:39:02,858
So sound that
you can't even pay your debt.

525
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:07,552
We will continue to tap the potential
of third -and-fourth-tier cities,

526
00:39:07,632 --> 00:39:09,917
and have already set the layout
in many places.

527
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:13,271
We have also made breakthroughs
in many projects.

528
00:39:13,943 --> 00:39:15,076
Put it simply,

529
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:18,479
you are just expelled from 1st-tier cities
and are trying to make a living...

530
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:20,159
...in the countryside, aren't you?

531
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,465
Hey, you...

532
00:39:21,545 --> 00:39:24,901
Mr Lu, do you have any suggestions
for today's meeting?

533
00:39:25,978 --> 00:39:27,038
Let's get started.

534
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:32,469
Well, Mr Lu, I mean, what else
do you want to know about Mingting?

535
00:39:33,225 --> 00:39:34,214
Nothing.

536
00:39:36,014 --> 00:39:37,038
Dismiss.

537
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:41,366
What's that supposed to mean?

538
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:48,274
What's wrong with Lu Jin?

539
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:51,228
You tell me.
He's being too arrogant, isn't he?

540
00:39:52,232 --> 00:39:54,266
They are going to be our boss.

541
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:56,818
Do you think he'll care about how we feel?

542
00:39:56,898 --> 00:40:00,068
Who told you that Mingting will be his?

543
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,317
We have better offer, don't we?

544
00:40:02,874 --> 00:40:06,046
You never know who will be
the final winner.

545
00:40:06,126 --> 00:40:09,574
The final winner will always be others.

546
00:40:09,654 --> 00:40:11,938
As for us, we are just the losers.

547
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,487
Besides,

548
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:16,322
how do you know for sure
that if Mingting is taken over,

549
00:40:16,402 --> 00:40:18,612
life will be better for us?

550
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,628
Mr Lu, well, what do you think?

551
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,358
How can I tell?

552
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:27,872
Just let it be.

553
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:30,153
We need money.

554
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,198
Whoever offers the best price
will be our boss.
