20
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,680
I know

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,000
you want to innovate.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,680
Every chef

23
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,319
wants to have his own creative dishes.

24
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,439
But it doesn’t mean you can mess around.

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,879
I know nothing about the rest.

26
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,640
But my teacher taught me that

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,959
freshness is the most important thing.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,879
Local shiitake mushroom is much younger

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,400
than russet mushroom.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,760
Gu Shengnan.

31
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,639
Miss Li, please don’t mind.

32
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,840
She’s just too young.

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,080
Only 21. Too naive.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
I’m gonna teach her a lesson.

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,759
21.

36
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,599
Sort of young and promising.

37
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,840
I need to go to the restroom.

38
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,080
Are you all right?

39
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,360
I need to talk to you.

40
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,520
I have nothing to say to you.

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,639
Li Man was really not specific to you.

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,360
She is also a great lover of cooking.

43
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,639
She went to Le Cordon Bleu for study.

44
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,240
So she just wants to talk to you

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,639
today about how

46
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,159
Wellington steak is made.

47
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,759
I think

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,520
you don’t have to be so hostile to her.

49
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,159
I mean it.

50
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,360
She loves cooking.

51
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,280
She went to Le Cordon Bleu.

52
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,560
She is innocent.

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
I don’t deserve it.

54
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,759
You’re right.

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,120
The value of a product

56
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,319
depends not on its own value,

57
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,000
but on

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,639
where it lies.

59
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,120
So she went to Le Cordon Bleu.

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,639
Then her dishes are supposed
to be expensive.

61
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,680
But you think my place is too expensive.

62
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,120
Gu Shengnan.

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
That’s not what I mean.

64
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,040
You’re just simply

65
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,800
discussing about how to make a dish,

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,959
what ingredients to use.

67
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,519
It has nothing to do

68
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,160
with I go to your place to eat.

69
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,519
Can you think of this

70
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,319
in the logical way of a normal person?

71
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,759
Right, I’m not normal.

72
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,160
I don’t have a logical thinking.

73
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,040
In your world,

74
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,079
I’m nothing but

75
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,680
a small cook.

76
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,759
I can’t reach to you.

77
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,240
I don’t care about your logic.

78
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,519
My logic is

79
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,160
you can’t eat

80
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,759
two women’s dishes.

81
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,519
Why?

82
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,399
Why what?

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,240
No means no.

84
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,120
I’m not here to discuss

85
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,240
whose dishes I’m supposed to eat.

86
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,879
I...

87
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,879
You’re so naive.

88
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah, I used to get used to her cooking.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,759
But now I’m used to your cooking.

90
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,000
I’m only used to yours.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,519
I admit you’re special.

92
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,879
But please don’t be too special.

93
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,360
You’re so special already that

94
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,360
I’m beginning to hesitate.

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,399
I... I... I don’t know.

96
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,920
You have nothing to hesitate about.

97
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,360
I may be special, but to you,

98
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,879
I’m just a cook.

99
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,800
You’re a cook, but you...

100
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,800
you’re not just a cook.

101
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,639
You are...

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,680
You and I...

103
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,480
Can you give me some time
to think about it?

104
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,519
I need to confirm.

105
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,399
Confirm what?

106
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,040
I...

107
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,879
You need to confirm

108
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,160
which mushroom is more expensive?

109
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,399
Or you need to confirm
my dishes are better

110
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,600
or that Li...

111
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,279
- Li...
- Li Man.

112
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,759
I don’t need you to remind me!

113
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,759
Are you done confirming?

114
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,399
If you do, then go out.

115
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,279
Go back to the place you belong.

116
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,279
I don’t even know where I belong.

117
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,759
I can tell you.

118
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,000
Matsuhashi No.1.

122
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,839
Anyway,

123
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,879
you’re not supposed to be in this kitchen.

124
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,639
You’ll know where I’m supposed to be.

of the Bauhinia Hotel is quite good,
so is the location.

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,759
If we can get this project,

129
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,519
it’ll be good for the development.

Didn’t we just eat?

- I’m tired.

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,920
I’m going to rest.

134

164

don’t mention Lu Jin in front of me.

But Shengnan.

171

You can’t be like this.

172
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,399

173

or the bed these days.

174

179

Our Shengnan is not in a good mood.

180
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,639
Save your chicken soup for the soul.

181
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,399
I...

182
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,399
I’m talking about her.

183
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,039
I’m criticizing her.

184
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,240
So can you please stop talking?

185
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,480
Shut up, will you?

186
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,399
Alright. No more talking.

187
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,399
We’re silenced.

188
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,759

00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,639
- Shengnan.
- I’m leaving. Let’s go.

191
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,799
- Yeah, yeah. We’re leaving.
- We’re leaving.

192
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,879
Easy, easy. Put it down.

193
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,000
You take care of yourself.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,240
Be good.

195
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,879
We’re leaving.

196
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,519
Call me if you need.

197
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,399
Yes, that’s right.

198
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,159
Wanna give me a ride?

199
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,600
No, I didn’t drive my car today.

200
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,480
Are we going back on foot?

201
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,879
No. It’s close to the subway.

202
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:14,519
Yeah. The subway. Right.

203
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,000
Listen to me.

204
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,519
There’s no movement in the next room.

205
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,279
Are all rich people so weird these days?

206
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,360
Do I look weird?

207
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,720
I just saw Lu Jin.

208
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,559
Am I losing my mind?

209
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,120
He was at the door.

210
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,799
Switch to video call!

211
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,840
Give us a live feed.

212
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,399
Live? No.

213
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,759
Maybe I just...

214
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,879
OK, alright, alright.

215
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,799
Why are you moving in next door?

216
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,279
I’ve told you

217
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,639
I’ll let you know

218
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,120
where I’m supposed to be.

219
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,120
Then, you mean,

220
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,519
you’re supposed to be my next door?

221
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,519
Yes...

222
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,279
Now, we are...

223
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,600
We’re neighbors now.

224
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,960
Yes...

225
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,080
Neighbors.

226
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,480
What do you want

227
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,360
in the morning, neighbor?

228
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,679
Here you are.

229
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,960
What’s this?

230
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,799
Sweetheart Pastry.

231
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,960
Why did you bring me this?

232
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,720
It’s embarrassing.

233
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,440
As a new neighbor,
I have to show my attitude.

234
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,600
Old Zhang next door has one, too

235
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,000
He does?

236
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,120
Old Zhang has diabetes.

237
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,279
He can’t eat this sweet.

238
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,039
I got him sugar-free.

239
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,519
Go back.

240
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,240
I don’t wanna talk to you.

241
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,279
Go back. Go.

242
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,960
I got him sugar-free.

243
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,360
Who is it?

244
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,360
Can I borrow your kitchen?

245
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,919
My kitchen?

246
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,039
It’s yours.

247
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,919
Housewarming.

248
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,080
And borrow your cooking skill by the way.

249
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,480
No.

250
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,840
I’ll wash vegetables.

251
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,039
I go to the bathroom.

252
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,240
Mr. Lu?

253
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,279
Who is knocking?

254
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,519
Nobody.

255
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,960
What are you doing here?

256
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,320
You are?

257
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,200
I’m Cheng Ziqian.

258
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:53,840
I...

259
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,440
Visit the staff.

260
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,279
I’m going back.

261
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,039
Then I’ll walk you.

262
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,000
Mr. Lu.

263
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,159
What are you doing here?

264
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,799
Shengnan hasn’t shown up
for work these days.

265
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,679
I came to see her.

266
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,480
Let’s go.

267
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,240
No need.

268
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,159
I’m home.

269
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,240
Home?

270
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,879
Why does Mr. Lu live next door to you?

271
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,639
How should I know?

272
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,000
God knows what’s wrong with him.

273
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,320
Don’t you think that’s

274
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,200
a little out of the ordinary?

275
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,279
Well, that makes sense.

276
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:51,279
He just wants to eat my dishes.

277
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,679
If so, he can live in Bauhinia.

278
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,320
Why would he bring food here?

279
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,480
He’s stingy.

280
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,559
Stingy? He rented a room next to yours.

281
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,879
Don’t read rich people’s mind.

282
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,360
When I’m worth billions,

283
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,519
you’ll be the first one to know

284
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,519
if that’s what I think.

285
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,279
You didn’t bring food just for

286
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,279
checking on employee, did you?

287
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,200
Of course not.

288
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,320
A chef training program
at the Sakura Bay Hotel.

289
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,480
It’s run by my Australia alumnus.

290
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,279
Would you be interested in it?

291
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:27,919
I can go?

292
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,320
Of course. I’ll go with you.

293
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,639
Great. When?

294
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,720
This weekend.

295
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,240
OK!

296
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,200
Eat.

297
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,360
Cell phone, keys, and ID card.

298
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,320
All check.

299
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:45,919
Let’s go.

300
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,159
Where are you going?

301
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,559
What does it have to do with you?

302
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,200
Mr. Cheng.

303
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,960
May I speak with Gu Shengnan in private?

304
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,039
Thank you.

305
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,720
I’ll be waiting for you downstairs.

306
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,679
Are you free this weekend?

307
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,679
No, I’m not.

308
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,679
I’m going to a program
at Sakura Bay Hotel.

309
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,000
What program?

310
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,679
With who?

311
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,279
With my brother Ziqian.

312
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,320
Him?

313
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,720
No way. It’s not happening.

314
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,639
Why?

315
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:36,720
Because...

316
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,240
Bauhinia is having a big party
this weekend.

317
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,559
All the cooks have to work overtime.

318
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,039
You don’t have time to go.

319
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,399
A very big party?

320
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:44,919
Yes.

321
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,440
Why didn’t I get the memo?

322
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,320
You’ll be notified shortly.

323
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,720
But it’s OK.

324
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,559
Even with such a notice,

325
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,759
I had already submitted
my annual leave report

326
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,320
to Manager Shen

327
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,000
and got approved.

328
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,080
What?

329
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,279
What “what”?

330
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,680
You know, as a CEO,

331
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,519
why do you care about a cook’s attendance?

332
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,039
That’s weird.

333
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,960
That’s a lot of control.

334
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,799
I’m not...I’m not trying to control you.

335
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,799
You want to go, fine.

336
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,680
I’ll ask Meng Xinjie to go with you.

337
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,519
No!

338
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,920
How can you let your assistant
come with me?

339
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,440
My Ziqian is enough.

340
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,680
You just can’t go with him!

341
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,279
You just can’t go with him!

342
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,000
Why can’t I go with him?

343
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,400
Whoever I go with,

344
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,359
whatever I do,

345
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,200
it’s none of your business.

346
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,160
Who are you to me?

347
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,119
I am...

348
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,519
I am... your leader.

349
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,319
Used to be.

350
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,960
Not now.

351
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,960
Ziqian is my direct supervisor.

352
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,480
Bye-bye.

353
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,000
Brother Ziqian!

354
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,000
Brother Ziqian!

355
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,480
Brother Jin sounds better.

356
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,680
Which one do you like?

357
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,880
I’ll take this one.

358
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
So casual.

359
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,799
I have a hard time choosing.

360
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,680
Shouldn’t that be harder to choose?

361
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,440
No.

362
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
I have a hard time

363
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,240
buying things on my own,

364
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,279
but I pick them up really quickly

365
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,119
when someone else gives them to me.

366
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,480
Because I don’t want them to back out.

367
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,640
Well, I have to settle up soon.

368
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,240
Excuse me.

369
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,720
Hello.

370
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,279
One for the blue one.

371
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,160
The red...

372
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,559
Can I have two?

373
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,039
Anyone else want to join us?

374
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,559
I want Trumpet to go with us.

375
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,640
Trumpet?

376
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,279
That’s my boy in Bauhinia.

377
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,640
My sidekick.

378
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,279
I thought it is a great opportunity,

379
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:54,200
and I want to take him with me.

380
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,079
Our Shengnan is so good to friends.

381
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,440
No problem for me.

382
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,960
Two for this one.

383
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,680
I’ll take one of these.
Wrap them up for me.

384
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,319
OK.

385
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,000
Bought three suitcases?

386
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,200
Yes.

387
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,440
Which means

388
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,240
she got me one, too.

389
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,799
You’re over-thinking about this, Boss.

390
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:26,519
Shut up.

391
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,480
Then why didn’t she tell me?

392
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,519
She could have just told me.

393
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,160
Go check

394
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,759
who got the third suitcase.

395
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,680
I already did.

396
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,319
You did. Why didn’t you say anything?

397
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,240
Trumpet.

398
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,319
Trumpet?

399
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,480
That sidekick.

400
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,279
That’s more like it.

401
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,720
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

402
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,799
Go, go, go.

403
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,000
It’s really beautiful.

404
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,480
Let’s take a picture.

405
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,119
OK.

406
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,000
Hi, how are you?

407
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,319
Could you take a picture for us?

408
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:05,559
All right.

409
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,240
Thank you.

410
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,480
Come on.

411
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,319
Here we go. One, two, three.

412
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,400
All right.

413
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,559
Thanks. Thank you.

414
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,839
It’s beautiful.

415
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,799
Big flowers. Come on,
let’s go see the flowers.

416
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:26,960
Flowers!

417
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,799
Be careful.

418
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,279
Boss, Boss, Boss.

419
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,240
Did you see this picture?

420
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,960
Look at that.

421
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,400
I...

422
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,400
Her hand.

423
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,119
Yes, that’s right.

424
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:47,839
Look. Look at her hand...

425
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,720
I can see it.

426
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:51,759
Look, look.

427
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,640
No need to zoom in.

428
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,799
Where’d you get that picture?

429
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,799
Just posted by Miss Gu in her Moments.

430
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,319
It’s impossible.

431
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,799
You’re blocked.

432
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,000
Why don’t you make another call?

433
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,359
All right.

434
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:20,559
I’ll make a call.

435
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,480
Do it.

436
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,319
Let me say this again.

437
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:31,640
Two words to distinguish clearly

438
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,720
in western food.

439
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,640
Seasoning and flavoring.

440
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,559
Seasoning

441
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:41,359
is adding flavor to a food

442
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,000
without significantly changing the flavor

443
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,319
of the main ingredient.

444
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,319
Thank you.

445
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,279
Flavoring

446
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,599
is adding a new flavor

447
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,880
to an ingredient,

448
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,279
thereby altering or improving

449
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
the original flavor
of the main ingredient.

450
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,799
Let’s move on to the rest.

451
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,800
Thyme.

452
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,060
= Fussy Lu =

453
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,920
Thyme, also known as beach grass,

454
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,839
grows on rocky slopes.

455
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,839
The variety grown in France is different

456
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:12,480
from those grown in other parts of Europe.

457
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,880
The plant is thin, with small leaves...

458
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,580
Manager Shen, I’m having a class.

459
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:17,400
...grayish-green leaves...

460
00:22:18,623 --> 00:22:20,943
- ...a slight spicy sweet taste.
- OK, got it.

461
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:23,426
It is often used in stews,

462
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,420
cooking eggs or soups.

463
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,596
Shengnan.

464
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:27,440
In traditional European cuisine,

465
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,910
Manager Shen said
there will be a banquet tomorrow.

466
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,266
- thyme symbolizes courage.
- I was asked to go back now. I gotta go.

467
00:22:31,746 --> 00:22:32,720
So in the Middle Ages,

468
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,200
Bye-bye.

469
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,880
it was often given
to knights on war trips.

470
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,119
Let’s move on to the next one,

471
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,400
Tarragon.

472
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,519
Tarragon...

473
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,580
= Recipe =

474
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,960
Shengnan.

475
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,920
Take a look. This is

476
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,759
their service skills training courseware.

477
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,480
I got it for you.

478
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,000
It’s pretty comprehensive.

479
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:06,119
It should be the same
as the one in this book.

480
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,279
Check it out.

481
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:13,720
Yes.

482
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,900
= Fussy Lu =

483
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,240
Are you all right?

484
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,359
I’m fine.

485
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,880
Why don’t we just go?

486
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,720
The car’s down there ready.

487
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,039
I’m hungry. I’m not going.

488
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:09,799
Hungry?

489
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:10,119
Fine.

490
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,200
I’ll take you out for some food.

491
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,000
OK?

492
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,720
I lost my appetite.

493
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,799
You said you were hungry just now.

494
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,480
You were sitting there just now.

495
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,519
One more call, one more...

496
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,559
Dust... Dust.

497
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,319
Sorry,

498
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,559
the subscriber you dialed
cannot be connected for the moment,

499
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,279
please try again later.

500
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,200
Where’s your phone?

501
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
My phone?

502
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,240
Open your Moments.

503
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,359
I’ll take another look.

504
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,200
No need.

505
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Let me take a look.

506
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
There is some

507
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,440
space between them.

508
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,519
This is obviously friendship.

509
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,279
Yes, that’s right.

510
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,960
Grew up together, like you and me.

511
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,759
Right, right.

512
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,799
Can’t you see that?

513
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,960
I can!

514
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,920
A lover’s hand should be like this.

515
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,759
Stop!

516
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,440
He made this gesture.

517
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:29,759
Tacky.

518
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:30,799
Lovers don’t do that.

519
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,240
Yes, that’s right.

520
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,759
Right?

521
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,279
Yes.

522
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,279
What’s with Trumpet in the back?

523
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,119
A sidekick.

524
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:41,279
Can’t he just stand in the middle?

525
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,000
I’ll criticize him later?

526
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,960
No, no, no!

527
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:00,720
For appetizer,

528
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,400
baked Pacific scallop slices

529
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,759
with Paris-marinated mushrooms,

530
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,119
black truffle butter sauce.

531
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,000
Main course, Challans steak.

532
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,960
Dessert, lemon tart with ice cream.

533
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,200
The drink is special blend.

534
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,200
Mr. Cheng, you went to a lot of trouble

535
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,839
to improve the dining standards

536
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,720
of the Bauhinia Hotel.

537
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,440
Brought me here
to such a fancy restaurant.

538
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,480
But

539
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,640
are we paying for this?

540
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,039
You don’t have to worry about that.

541
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,920
Just taste it and study it.

542
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,200
Don’t go

543
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,880
asking for the receipt.

544
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,160
I’m dressing so elegantly today.

545
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,240
How can I do something

546
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,559
so stupid?

547
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,720
I’m just reminding you.

548
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,119
Money is not the problem.

549
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,400
Enjoy the food.

550
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,440
I understand.

551
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,119
I will certainly well control emotions

552
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,920
and learn with a modest heart.

553
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,200
Even if the taste is bad,

554
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,039
I will smile and eat.

555
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,279
It’s not that bad.

556
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,279
The restaurant’s chef, Mason,

557
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,759
had worked on Royal Caribbean

558
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,160
for more than a decade,

559
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,240
serving only guests
in the presidential suite.

560
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,519
The restaurant where he cooked

561
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,400
was called the Sea Michelin.

562
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,440
He returned to Suhai the year before last
to open this restaurant.

563
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,759
Less than two years,

564
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,640
he made it to the top in Suhai.

565
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,039
Many old guests flew thousands of miles

566
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,119
to here to taste it.

567
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,240
That good?

568
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,519
Then I’ll be

569
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,799
Boss Gu today, okay, Cheng?

570
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:31,720
At your service.

571
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,279
Sir.

572
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,240
This is our limited edition special
for today.

573
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,480
Thank you.

574
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,880
Thank you.

575
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:03,400
Here, try it.

576
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
Cheng.

577
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,720
This really should be studied

578
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,000
by everyone in the Liquor Department.

579
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,960
Bauhinia can also make some special liquor

580
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,440
for guests.

581
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,720
A five-star hotel is not the same
as a private restaurant.

582
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,680
Five-star hotels are about standards,

583
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,240
while a private restaurant
is about specialty.

584
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,880
Not only the food should be unique,

585
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,440
but also the dish plates
must be particular.

586
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,720
Even

587
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,440
the height of the table,

588
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,279
the softness of the chair,

589
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,920
the lightness of the light,

590
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,759
and the decoration style
of the whole restaurant

591
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,640
must be unified in a specific aesthetic.

592
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,279
It means if I want to open a restaurant,

593
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,240
I have to learn interior decorating first.

594
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,319
You want to open a restaurant?

595
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,480
Of course.

596
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,440
Every chef wants its own restaurant.

597
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,880
That Mason guy, he was at...

598
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:04,759
Cruise Caribbean.

599
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,240
Cruise Caribbean,
and he made a sea Michelin.

600
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,200
Then why did he go back and do this?

601
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,720
Looks like,

602
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,440
I have to call you Boss Gu.

603
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,319
Sooner or later.

604
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,440
If you’re expelled from Bauhinia by then,

605
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,440
you can think about coming to me.

606
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,799
I’ll take you in.

607
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,720
You said it yourself.

608
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,319
I did.

609
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,200

Tomorrow. No.

618
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,759
Right now.

619
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,720
Go with me. That’s it.

620
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,640

Teach me, teach me, teach me. I’ll do it!

624
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,880
Come here.

625
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,960
Hold here.

626
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,079
Yeah, hold here with left hand.

627
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,720
Give me your right hand.

628
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,359
Put it on your middle finger.

629
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,960
Are they supposed to be in a class?

630
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:41,279
I heard from Trumpet
that no class for today.

631
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,640
It’s free today.

632
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,079
Free?

633
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,920
Free means shooting arrows?

634
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,319
Yes.

635
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,160
Let’s load the arrow.

636
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,000
Archery’s good. It keeps one fit.

637
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,759
No, no, no.

638
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,200
Not good at all. Sorry.

639
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,079
Here, right.

640
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:59,079
Put the black side towards yourself.

641
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,119
What... What is he doing?

642
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,799
What kind of coach is that?

643
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,480
Sorry.

644
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,200
Look at his hands.

645
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,440
What’s he doing?

646
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,279
Oh, yeah. Is that how he coaches?

647
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,279
Does a coach have to hold people’s hand?

648
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,559
The man is a self-serving hypocrite.

649
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,510
- What a bad guy, oh my god!
- Three points and one line.

650
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,410
Aim for the bull’s-eye.

651
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,759
Good, good.

652
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,759
Get a new set of all the equipment here

653
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,400
and send them to my apartment.

654
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,200
Put the black side towards yourself.

655
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:28,583
All right.

656
00:31:28,873 --> 00:31:29,670
Aim it.

657
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:37,070
Let’s try it again.

658
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,440
I remember you used to like these.

659
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,880
Like?

660
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,480
I love them.

661
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,960
Very much.

662
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,359
Look, look.

663
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,920
It’s all over your mouth. Wipe it

664
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,039
Look at my tongue.

665
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,799
What’s she eating? She’s so happy.

666
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,440
Cotton candy.

667
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,160
Is it good?

668
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
You want one?

669
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,920
How can I eat that thing?

670
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:26,920
Here.

671
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:32,200
So soon?

672
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,200
Well, theirs look like fun,

673
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,480
so I bought one.

674
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:40,720
It’s like cotton wool.

675
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,039
How am I supposed to eat?

676
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,920
Bury your face in it.

677
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,480
Open your mouth.

678
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,039
It’s made of saccharin. It’s got pigment.

679
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:01,640
Too sweet.

680
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,519
I can’t believe she’s having so much fun

681
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,680
with this bad saccharin.

682
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,799
I don’t know about that.

683
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:06,440
As a cook,

684
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,640
what happened to her taste?

685
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,799
It’s not working now?

686
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,000
In 3 minutes and you can still
pick it up and eat.

687
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,319
Where is she?

688
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,319

Absolutely. Hang on tight.

Smile.

755
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,960
Head up higher.

756
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,480
One more.

757
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
Listen.

758
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,159
It is the first time

759
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,760
that I found Miss Gu so beautiful

760
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,800
and graceful.

761
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,639
She was always mean to me.

762
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,639
Am I usually mean?

763
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,039
No, you’re not.

764
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,400
Affable.

765
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,719
Boss, I think you’re hungry.

766
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:35,559
We’ve been following them all day.

767
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:36,519
I’m not hungry.

768
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,400
Angry makes me full.

769
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,639
Go on.

770
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,239
I’m hungry.

771
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,800
I can’t walk anymore.

772
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,280
Hang in there. Almost there.

773
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,320
Look at the noodle. So long and wide.

774
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,030
- Good. Wide and wide. This way.
- So long and wide.

775
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,519
Hang in there. Almost there.

776
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,679
So long and wide.

777
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:14,286
Come here, come here.

778
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,159
He’s in the room.

779
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,239
She approved his entrance.

780
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,239
Don’t over-think about it.

781
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,039
She’s drunk. It’s normal.

782
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:28,920
Normal?

783
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,400
Yeah.

784
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,239
No, no, no.

785
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,679
Grace. Grace.

786
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,519
Don’t touch me.

787
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:41,800
How about this?

788
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,280
We’ll get a room next door.

789
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,159
I’ll see what I can do.

790
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,039
Grace.

791
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,159
Grace.

792
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,360
Be careful.

793
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,060
Okay, okay.

794
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,280
Strategy, strategy, strategy.

795
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,760
Strategy, strategy.

796
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,079
Strategy, strategy. Think.

797
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:52,880
I’m thinking. I am.

798
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,599
I don’t think we can make it this way.

799
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,559
Can’t make it.

800
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,559
I asked you to come up with a plan

801
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:09,400
and you’re eating bananas?

802
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,119
I...

803
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:13,039
We haven’t eaten all day.

804
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,840
OK. Eat, eat.

805
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,920
OK. A plan.

806
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:16,920
Strategy, strategy.

807
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,280
Yes. I got it.

808
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,320
Let the hotel handle it.

809
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,800
Just one?

810
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,280
Here are your slippers, sir.

811
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,000
I didn’t ask for slippers.

812
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What are you looking at?

813
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,400
Nothing.

814
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,119
Enjoy your stay, sir.

815
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:14,920
Is there

816
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,639
a woman in the room?

817
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,320
Yeah, there’s a woman sleeping in bed.

818
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,280
Bed.

819
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,400
What about the guy?

820
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,280
The guy’s not on the bed.

821
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,039
Did he take his clothes off?

822
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,039
Yes.

823
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,519
Only his jacket.

824
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,599
I have to take a look.

825
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,719
No, no, it’s fine,

826
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,000
just a jacket.

827
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,639
I’ll handle it. Sit.

828
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:40,800
Grace. Grace.

829
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:42,960
Grace.

830
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,880
Here’s the deal.

831
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,639
Go there again.

832
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,020
Take a good look around.

833
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:49,960
All right.

834
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,559
Go ahead.

835
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:58,800
Take a closer look.

836
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,280
Okay, yeah, yeah.

837
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,800
How did it go?

838
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,400
Excuse me, the man left

839
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:27,039
