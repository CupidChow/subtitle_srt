Mr. Lu,

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,159
something goes wrong with Mingting’s case.

28
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,159
The other buyer keeps raising the price.

29
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,560
Now it’s three percent

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,439
higher than we expected.

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,159
Shall we raise the price?

32
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,759
Sure.

33
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,919
I gotta take Mingting this time.

34
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,800
I’ve got someone to check

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,120
the background of that buyer.

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,919
We should have the result
within next week.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,360
Good.

One!

44
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,919
Does it have to be so ceremonious
for a toy car race?

45
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,039
They are so tiny. Can they see it clear?

Shengnan, you are here.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,319
I brought two of my best friends

50
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,400

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,319
This is my uncle, Gao Quan’an.

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,280
Hi, Uncle. I’m Lu Zheng.

56
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,199
He’s always with that damn face.

57
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,680
This is my bestie, Xu Zhaodi.

58
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,159
Gorgeous and graceful.

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,400

60
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,400

Thanks.

62

I’m counting on you guys later.

63
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,000
No problem.

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,039
Help yourself. Beers are on me.

65
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,879
I’ll go prepare.

66
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,919

75
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,120
well raced.

76
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,399
Let’s do it next time.

77
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,360
Sure.

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,560
Go have supper with us.

79
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,720
Okay, wait for me in the car.

80
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,480
I’ll be there soon.

81
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,000
Be quick.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,680
Hurry up.

83
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,720
Is it fun?

84
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,399
Yeah.

85
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,639
I have made up my mind

86
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,800
to learn this.

87
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,079
I’ll teach you.

88
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,920
Thanks.

89
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,639
Let’s go have supper together.

90
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,319
Okay.

91
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,079
I can’t. I got another arrangement.

92
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
I gotta go.

93
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,800
See you.

94
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,399
Bye.

95
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,240
Take care.

96
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,000
Bye.

97
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,920
Bye handsome.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,199
Bye beauty.

99
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,639
I’m not going either.

100
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,439
It’s a party for you young people.

101
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,480
I’m not going either.

102
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,639
Next time.

103
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,319
Don’t.

104
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,879
It’s early.

105
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,240
Shengnan.

106
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,160
Go if you want. Go back home early.

107
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,480
Okay, I’ll go with them.

108
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,160
Go.

109
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,480
Bye.

110
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,720
Bye.

111
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,600
Be safe.

112
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,240
Bye, Uncle.

113
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,560
Wait.

114
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,319
Shengnan, I almost forget.

115
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,439
Grandpa asked us to go home.

116
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,639
He said he got something to talk with you.

117
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
Go home then.

118
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,600
Come to me tomorrow.
I’ll show you how to race a car.

119
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,399
Okay.

120
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,279
Bye.

121
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,199
Bye.

122
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,360
Let’s go to Grandpa.

123
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,879
Why?

124
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,360
Get him out for supper?

125
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,319
You said he is looking for us.

126
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,720
Nothing important.

127
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,680
Let’s go. My treat tonight.

128
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,920
Take it.

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,879
Come on.

130
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,360
This car is yours now.

131
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:00,759
Put it anywhere?

132
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,519
Anywhere you like.

133
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,399
This button is the throttle.

134
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,600
Tap on it.

135
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,560
Okay.

136
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,160
Slow down when you make a turn.

137
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,199
Accelerate when you go straight.

138
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,199
One, two, three!

139
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,800
Come on.

140
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,240
Well done.

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You’ve been playing the whole day.

142
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,120
Come on and eat something.

143
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,800
Wow, puff.

144
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,040
Make do with it.

145
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,040
I only got this.

146
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,639
It’s good.

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,080
You’re overreacting.

148
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,720
You got cream on your lips.

149
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,360
I have other matters. I gotta go.

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,080
You’re overreacting.

151
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,679
You got cream on your lips.

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,480
It’s not what I think.

153
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,879
What is that attitude?

154
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,720
What is that face?

155
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
I’m here to eat.

156
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,720
Can’t you pretend to be happy?

157
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,799
Put pretending aside,

158
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,720
your attitude

159
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,159
says everything.

160
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,200
My mind was wandering.

161
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,879
Why?

162
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,919
You quarreled with Lu Jin?

163
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,000
When?

164
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,919
Who’s fault? Who started?

165
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,799
How can I answer so many questions

166
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,799
at one time?

167
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,879
Answer them one by one.

168
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,759
Why don’t you come home

169
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,200
after work?

170
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,360
What is your attitude?

171
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,879
What’s wrong with an uncle

172
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,919
checking on his niece?

173
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,399
Are you here to get your money back?

174
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,919
Maybe you’re right.

175
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:42,919
I’ve been…

176
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,639
No, no, no.

177
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:45,639
Uncle.

178
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,519
Who is it so late?

179
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,720
Who is it?

180
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,279
You?

181
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,480
You left hurriedly yesterday.

182
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,559
I thought I might have
done something wrong

183
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,519
that might cause some misunderstanding.

184
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,840
So I’m here to apologize.

185
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,039
Nothing is wrong.

186
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,000
I got an emergency at home.

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,480
So I left in a hurry.

188
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,320
Are you really not mad at me?

189
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,799
No.

190
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,440
You think I’m that narrow-minded?

191
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,519
Shengnan.

192
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,519
Who is it?

193
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,519
Uncle, it’s me.

194
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,879
You…

195
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,200
Yesterday I found Shengnan loves puffs,

196
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,639
so I bought some for her.

197
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,600
Would you like some, Uncle?

198
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,919
Don’t uncle me.

199
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,919
Sit. Come on.

200
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,720
You had dinner?

201
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:34,639
No need.

202
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,759
I had.

203
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,399
Sit down.

204
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,080
You two just met days ago.

205
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,960
Why did you meet again yesterday?

206
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,200
Mr. Lu,

207
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,919
why are you seeing
our Shengnan so frequently?

208
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,600
Don’t worry, Uncle.

209
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,159
Shengnan just hanged out
at my place yesterday.

210
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,440
Of course,

211
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,000
I won’t worry.

212
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,240
Shengnan loved dropping around

213
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,559
since she was a child.

214
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,279
She’s been to every neighbor’s house

215
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,600
in that food street.

216
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,039
I never worry about her.

217
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,120
But you…

218
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,519
You don’t have to deride me, Uncle.

219
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,159
Okay, let’s stop talking about you.

220
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,519
Let’s talk about him.

221
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,519
Mr. Lu…

222
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,360
Who is it now?

223
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,240
Your parcel.

224
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,360
It’s mine. I’ll go get it.

225
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,559
Please sign here.

226
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,679
Thank you.

227
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:32,679
For you.

228
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,759
What is it?

229
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,279
Open it.

230
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,759
A car.

231
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,000
Uncle.

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,159
Look at this. This is cool.

233
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,559
Go eat first.

234
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,639
I’ll help you assemble it later.

235
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,919
No need. I can do it myself.

236
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,279
Can you?

237
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,799
Who knocked

238
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,279
my cup down yesterday?

239
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,840
I said I will pay you.

240
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Stop bringing it up.

241
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,559
You…

242
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,559
This model…

243
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,399
Zenan,

244
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,039
I’m at Shengnan’s place.

245
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,679
Hospital? What happened to you?

246
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,320
Okay. Stay cool.

247
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,279
I’ll go there right away.

248
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,559
Shengnan,

249
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,960
Zenan is in the hospital
for acute gastroenteritis.

250
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,879
I gotta go check on him.

251
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,200
Just go.

252
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,200
Mr. Lu,

253
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,799
don’t stay too late.

254
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,240
It’s not good to stay in a girl’s room

255
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,039
in the middle of the night.

256
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,039
Don’t worry, Uncle.

257
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,320
I’ll leave as soon as
we finish assembling it.

258
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,879
Be careful.

259
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,799
Got it.

260
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,039
Motor cover.

261
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,200
Let me help you.

262
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,240
I can do it myself.

263
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,120
You have to dismantle this first.

264
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,000
There is something I gotta remind you.

265
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,000
There is a boy around Shengnan.

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,320
His last name is Lu. Do you know him?

267
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,960
Lu Zheng?

268
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,360
Yes, that’s him.

269
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,039
He is my little brother. What’s wrong?

270
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,440
I just met this boy

271
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,519
at Shengnan’s place.

272
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,840
As far as I know,

273
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,679
Shengnan has

274
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,399
been hanging out with him lately.

275
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,039
Okay, thanks.

276
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,840
Let me help you.

277
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,600
This should be installed here.

278
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,679
Let me know how much it costs,

279
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,519
I’ll transfer the money to you
from WeChat.

280
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,159
All right.

281
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,300
= Fussy Lu =

282
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,643
Hello?

283
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,120
Shengnan.

284
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,120
Are you home?

285
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,080
Yeah.

286
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,200
What?

287
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,600
Are you alone?

288
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,559
Yeah, I’m alone.

289
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,919
What’s up?

290
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,159
Nothing.

291
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,399
It’s just, I miss you.

292
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,240
Wanna hear your voice.

293
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,519
When will you be back?

294
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,120
In a couple of days.

295
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,759
I got some tricky things on hand,

296
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,440
so…

297
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,360
A couple of days?

298
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,600
Okay, then. You take care.

299
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,399
I gotta go.

300
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,279
Bye.

301
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,960
How come you are back?

302
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,880
You said you will be back in a few days.

303
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,599
Yes, I did.

304
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,880
Are you tired from flying?

305
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,559
You flied over ten hours.

306
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,119
I’m fine.

307
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,200
Is your waist all right?

308
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:09,839
Are you hungry?

309
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,160
What would you like to eat?
I’ll cook for you.

310
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,559
A glass of water.

311
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,759
Water?

312
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,880
Okay.

313
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,599
You drank so fast.

314
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,240
Do you miss me?

315
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,759
What is this?

316
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,400
Who forged that?

317
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,319
If it’s not forged, then it must be shot

318
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,319
from a forced perspective.

319
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,319
I did go to

320
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,079
Lu Zheng’s garage days ago

321
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,799
and played cars with him.

322
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,480
But nothing happened between us.

323
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,799
You don’t believe me?

324
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,759
I do.

325
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,880
If you say it’s a misunderstanding,
then it is.

326
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,799
It will stop here.

327
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,559
Shengnan,

328
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,359
you are my girlfriend,

329
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,359
and my fiancée.

330
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,039
Try to keep a distance from them,

331
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:01,920
okay?

332
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,480
Sorry.

333
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,119
I…

334
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:05,920
It’s okay.

335
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,319
It’s okay.

336
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,519
I’ll take care of the photo.

337
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,000
Stop thinking about it.

338
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,839
I’m tired. I gotta go.

339
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,480
Are you leaving now?

340
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,319
I’ve been on the plane
for more than ten hours.

341
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,920
I couldn’t get my eyes shut.

342
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,319
I’m too tired.

343
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,079
I’ll go home and sleep,

344
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:01,559
okay?

345
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,039
Stop here.

346
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,119
Okay, I see.

347
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,799
If he got further moves,
let me know immediately.

348
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,319
You guys used to be good talkers.

349
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,319
Why are you all dumb

350
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,880
after I became the director?

351
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,559
We have worked with this brand before.

352
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,319
They got small budget

353
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:40,319
but are very demanding.

354
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
As the service party,

355
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,880
where is your professionalism?

356
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,680
Who makes you think
you can pick on our client?

357
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
I’ll ask you again,

358
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,720
who is willing to take this project?

359
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,440
Shouldn’t we

360
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,839
give this project to Celine Xu?

361
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,160
Celine Xu

362
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,240
has a way with this kind of
foreign customers.

363
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,519
No matter it’s from Finland or Germany.

364
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,440
If we give this French project

365
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,279
to Celine,

366
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,359
there should be no problem.

367
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,680
Yeah, right.

368
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,599
Celine Xu would surely

369
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,200
do it well.

370
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:13,720
Hey.

371
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,920
Celine, what do you think?

372
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,480
Director,

373
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,319
I really want to help,

374
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,359
but

375
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,839
I’m about to work in the branch office.

376
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,799
I’m afraid I don’t have time for this.

377
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,480
Don’t worry about this.

378
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,279
The personnel transfer

379
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:30,720
might need to be re-planned.

380
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,640
Your transfer won’t be approved so fast.

381
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,039
You just

382
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,599
focus on this project.

383
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,920
It’s okay to leave after finishing it.

384
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,359
Let me worry about
your transfer application.

385
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,720
The person in charge of this project

386
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
is a Chinese.

387
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,519
So there is no communication problem.

388
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,200
Don’t worry and just do it.

389
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,480
All right.

390
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:51,160
Celine will be on this project then.

391
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:52,599
Andrew,

392
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,279
you help Celine to complete it.

393
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,839
You have worked with this brand before,

394
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,160
it should be easy for you to start.

395
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,440
- Okay?
- Okay.

396
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,319
That’s it for today.

397
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,680
Dismiss.

398
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,319
No, Director.

399
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,519
Why me? How can I do it?

400
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,160
These people…

401
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,240
Waiting for you.

402
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
I got some things to deal with,

403
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,160
couldn’t come tonight.

404
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,119
Jin.

405
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,359
What brought you here?

406
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,799
What’s up?

407
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,759
You did this?

408
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,160
Who took this photo?

409
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,799
I don’t care who took this.

410
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,160
I’m here to remind you,

411
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,000
this trick is very silly.

412
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,160
Stop it.

413
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,519
Stay away from Shengnan.

414
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,319
This will end here.

415
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,519
I will leave it be.

416
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:28,759
I like Shengnan.

417
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,319
And she likes me too.

418
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,119
We are in love with each other,

419
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,759
so we get affectionate sometimes.

420
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,400
We can’t help it.

421
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,480
Do you know what are you talking about?

422
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,519
I’ll give you a chance

423
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:54,759
to take it back.

424
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,200
I’ll pretend you never said it.

425
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,200
Brother,

426
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,559
Shengnan and I are made for each other.

427
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,400
We are about the same age
and have similar interests.

428
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,640
I have seen all of Shengnan’s relatives.

429
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,160
They all think
we will make a perfect couple.

430
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,160
So does my mom.

431
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,000
She likes Shengnan very much

432
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,200
and treats her like her own daughter.

433
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:15,640
But you are different, Brother.

434
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,200
I know Aunt Zheng doesn’t like Shengnan.

435
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,640
Shengnan has compromised a lot for you.

436
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,279
Lu Jin, what are you doing?

437
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,240
Are you all right?

438
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
What are you doing?

439
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,799
Why can’t you talk nicely?

440
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,160
He is your brother.

441
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,920
Why are you here?

442
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,359
I want to ask you the same question.

443
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,920
You said you believe me.

444
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,559
Now you come here to start a fight.

445
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,880
You never trust me, do you?

446
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,720
Shengnan, stop.

447
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,920
This is a misunderstanding.

448
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
Go home with me.

449
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,920
Then we will talk.

450
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,160
There is nothing to talk.

451
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,559
I explained it to you.

452
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,640
I told you very clearly.

453
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,279
What else to talk when we got home?

454
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,000
I’m sorry, Shengnan.

455
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,759
I know it must be the photo thing

456
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:35,880
that caused you trouble.

457
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:38,720
I don’t know

458
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,319
why we’ve been taken photos.

459
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,480
Since my father died,

460
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,559
there are many directors in the group

461
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
refused to accept me.

462
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,000
They think I don’t deserve this position.

463
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,319
So

464
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,279
it must be them.

465
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,279
I’m sorry for

466
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,720
getting you involved.

467
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,680
Okay.

468
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,279
Let me take you to the hospital.

469
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,160
Do you think

470
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,440
Lu Jin went too far this time?

471
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,799
You deserve it.

472
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,440
How do I deserve it?

473
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,440
Lu Jin thinks too much every day.

474
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,720
Besides,

475
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,559
no matter what,

476
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,160
you can’t hit people, can you?

477
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,720
He hit you?

478
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,480
No.

479
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,559
He hit his brother.

480
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,359
He hit Lu Zheng?

481
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,119
He did go too far.

482
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,359
Shengnan,

483
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,119
did Lu Jin call you

484
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,720
after I left your home the other day?

485
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,039
Yeah, why?

486
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
What did you tell him?

487
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,319
Did you tell him that
Lu Zheng was at your place?

488
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,599
No.

489
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,000
He’s too busy recently and I thought

490
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,440
if I told him I was with Lu Zheng,

491
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,240
he would think too much.

492
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,880
So I didn’t tell him about this.

493
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,880
Besides,

494
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,359
Lu Zheng and I…

495
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,480
What?

496
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:10,160
What?

497
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,599
Hey!

498
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,480
What is it?

499
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,240
Let go.

500
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,000
You know I left your home

501
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,000
because Zenan was in the hospital.

502
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,839
And on the way to the hospital,

503
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,880
I called Lu Jin and told him

504
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,039
Lu Zheng was at your place.

505
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,480
That’s why

506
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,119
Lu Jin thinks that you are
hiding something from him.

507
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,440
Gao Quan’an!

508
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,359
What?

509
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,920
I wanna kill you!

510
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,039
Andrew.

511
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
We will leave this room to you then.

512
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,359
Okay, thank you.

513
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,359
Andrew,

514
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,880
we are gonna meet the client tomorrow,

515
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,359
let’s hurry up and
make another version of the plan

516
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,240
for the boss.

517
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,599
Relax, Celine.

518
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,599
The plan is not what matters,

519
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,119
what does is the client.

520
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:07,920
How can I explain to the client

521
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,440
if we got no plan?

522
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,440
You know how to do it

523
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,160
better than anyone else, do you?

524
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,720
I heard that our client
is an old rich man.

525
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,480
You are the best at dealing with

526
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,119
this kind of clients, are you?

527
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,599
Can you help me with it?

528
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,160
This is not my own project.

529
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,799
Is this my project?

530
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,119
You can report to the branch office
with this achievement.

531
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,680
I couldn’t get anything from it

532
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,279
after putting all my efforts in it.

533
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,880
All of us work for money.

534
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,920
Don’t you feel guilty

535
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,039
letting me be a volunteer?

536
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,440
I’m sorry.

537
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,039
I was being impulsive.

538
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,119
I shouldn’t have hit him.

539
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,079
Sorry.

540
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,359
I’m sorry too.

541
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,799
I didn’t

542
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,960
keep a distance with Lu Zheng,

543
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,240
that made you misunderstand.

544
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,319
I made a lot of troubles.

545
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,359
I came here to tell you

546
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,799
that I trust you

547
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,240
the whole time.

548
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,599
I do.

549
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,599
I was just…

550
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,759
Jealous.

551
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,119
I was upset seeing you with

552
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,119
other men.

553
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,680
Because I love you.

554
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,239
I love you so much.

555
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,559
I will never do anything

556
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,559
that will make you upset anymore.

557
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,159
I won’t see Lu Zheng anymore.

558
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,559
I swear.

559
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,260
= Lu Zheng =

560
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:43,880
I…

561
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,920
I bought it myself.

562
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,000

Mr. Li,

575
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,360
this is our scheme.

576
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,239
I’ve heard of Miss Xu long time before.

577
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,079
I’m really impressed

578
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,639
seeing you in person.

579
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,360
You heard of me before?

580
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,360
Yes.

581
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,360
Everyone in Suhai’s
public relations circle

582
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,880
knows that you are

583
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,119
the most beautiful and capable woman.

584
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,760
About the scheme…

585
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,119
So be it.

586
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,000
I trust

587
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:32,119
your competence.

588
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,280
Thanks.

589
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,360
But you’re working

590
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,599
unworthy of your talents in this company.
What a pity.

591
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Come work for me.

592
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,360
I’ll offer you better.

593
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,840
Are you trying to hunt me, Mr. Li?

594
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,280
20,000 a month.

595
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,760
How about it?

596
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,480
Kiss my ass.

598

Mr. Lu,

599
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,360
the file Ms. Li sent to you.

600
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:26,880
Thanks.

601
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,559
Anything else?

602
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,559
Yeah.

603
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:35,280
Sit.

604
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,639
What is it?

605
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,119
I want to ask for a leave.

606
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,519
I’m gonna take

607
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,639
an MBA class.

608
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,880
How long can you last this time?

609
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,679
Love makes you grow up again?

610
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:02,639
I’d like to talk with you
about this love thing.

611
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,760
Xinjie,

612
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,400
I really envy you sometimes.

613
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,239
For what?

614
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,519
I’m living a miserable life.

615
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,119
Time.

616
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,639
There are two kinds of men in this world.

617
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,360
The first kind protect love with career.

618
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:32,960
The second kind spend time with love.

619
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,119
It’s not that only a successful man

620
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,480
deserves love.

621
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,599
So you are the second.

622
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,880
What were you gonna say?

623
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,599
Never mind.

624
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,840
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

625
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,639
Director.

626
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,760
What?

627
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,119
I can’t do this project.

628
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Give it to others.

629
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,599
Don’t care what they say.

630
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,000
Being pretty

631
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,599
is your advantage.

632
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,760
You have to make the most of it.

633
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,760
What do you mean?

634
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,440
In the adults’ world,

635
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,440
result values way more than process.

636
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,119
Finish this project

637
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,480
and earn what’s yours,

638
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,239
this is something that matters the most.

639
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,239
The Celine Xu I knew before

640
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,480
was never indecisive like this.

641
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,079
What’s wrong with you now?

642
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,199
Have you changed after falling in love

643
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,760
with the driver?

644
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,880
