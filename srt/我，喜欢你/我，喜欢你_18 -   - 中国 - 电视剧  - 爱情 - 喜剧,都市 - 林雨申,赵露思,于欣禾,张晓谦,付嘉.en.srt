Thank you.

Good night.

Wait.

24
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,239
Gu Shengnan called you

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,760
on the celebration day and I answered it.

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,159
I didn’t tell you this.

27
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
And I deleted the call log.

I know I shouldn’t do this,

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
but I just couldn’t help it.

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,000
Because I knew

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,400
you would leave me

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,599
once you receive that call.

33
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,759
I thought

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,159
I still got a chance.

Sorry.

37
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,759
I asked the doctor.

38
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,400
The surgery went well.

39
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,000
With proper rest,

I really appreciate it.

Don’t mention it.

44

Sorry, Ziqian.

as soon as I can.

No need, I can go back by myself.

I’ll go back by myself.

75
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,399
I said I will go back by myself.

76
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,600
Why are you doing this to me?

77
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,360
Why didn’t you tell me

78
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,120
that your grandpa had such a big surgery?

79
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,160
And the high cost of the surgery,

80

- how can you bear it alone?
- Ziqian helped.

81
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,839

82
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,839

I know what I am to you.

87
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,279
My mother said something to you, did she?

88
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,759
No.

89
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,279
Excuse me. Is this bike still in use?

90
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,079
- No.
- Yes.

Thanks.

93
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,639
I’ll take you home to have a good rest,

94
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,799
and then we talk.

95
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,799
Sorry.

96
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,399
I’m sorry

97
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,000
for not being by your side

98
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,480
when your grandpa was sick.

99
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,360
You must have

100
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,320
suffered a lot.

101
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,559
It’s all my fault.

102
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,639
I’m sorry for this.

103
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,120
But now I’m back.

104
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,159
Back to your side.

105
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,399
We will face and solve

106
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,759
all problems

107
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,799
together.

108
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,600
I will never leave again.

109
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,320
Please stop being mad at me.

110
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,799
Alright?

111
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,120
Okay, tell me,

112
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,759
who do you want to be,
Liu Bang or Xiang Yu?

113
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,799
Why do you ask me this suddenly?

114
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,000
Winner takes all.

115
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,879
I’ll go for Liu Bang.

116
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,159
Does it matter?

117
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,159
Let’s go. I’m tired.

118
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,799
Lu Jin must be

119
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,279
too busy at work.

120
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,320
Otherwise,

121
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,960
he wouldn’t leave in such a hurry

122
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,480
Uncle,

123
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,759
his mother is really

124
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,159
a piece of something.

125
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,559
That old cat

126
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,120
never…

127
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,080
Who is it?

128
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,080
Work. A client.

129
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:13,488
Hello?

130
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,080
Tell me.

131
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,559
It’s just

132
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,279
I found Shengnan

133
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,039
is changed since I’m back.

134
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,399
She’s

135
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,000
keeping a distance with me deliberately,

136
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,080
and doesn’t accept any help from me.

137
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,320
I know a lot of things happened

138
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,639
during the time when I was away.

139
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,080
But I don’t know why

140
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,159
she is doing this to me.

141
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,320
That’s because

142
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,879
she is taking three shifts

143
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,039
to get money for his grandpa.

144
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,720
She hasn’t had a good rest for days.

145
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,559
Why wasn’t I

146
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,960
informed of the high charges

147
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,279
of her grandpa’s surgery?

148
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,320
This is

149
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,159
all my fault.

150
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,120
It’s me.

151
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,519
We can’t just

152
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,519
ask you for money

153
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,080
for anything.

154
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,639
So I paid for the hospital fee.

155
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,840
But for the second surgery,

156
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,360
the heart bridge building,

157
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,879
that surprised me too.

158
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,480
Maybe

159
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,440
it’s just about her pride.

160
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,279
She is my girlfriend.

161
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,879
We are… lovers.

162
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,559
If a woman

163
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,200
falls in love with a man,

164
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,279
she starts thinking.

165
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,279
Do you understand?

166
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,320
No, you don’t.

167
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,600
You were gone for so many days.

168
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,360
She takes care of everything
all by herself.

169
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,600
You think that’s what she wants?

170
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,320
She loves you.

171
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,320
So she doesn’t want to disturb you.

172
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,639
She’s afraid she will bother you,

173
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,480
and you will dislike her.

174
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,279
Bluntly speaking,

175
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,320
you didn’t make her feel secure.

176
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,480
Feel secure?

177
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,879
Feel secure.

178
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,679
This is not something I can help.

179
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,679
You have to figure it out yourself.

180
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,879
But now the top priority

181
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:05,960
is Grandpa’s body.

182
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Taking good care of Grandpa

183
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,159
is what Shengnan cares about most now.

184
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,799
I see.

185
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,440
Thanks.

186
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,039
You’re welcome.

187
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,720
The rich eat and run too?

188
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
What a couple.

189
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
= Shengnan =

190
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,919
Shengnan.

191
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,360
Say it.

192
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,120
Shengnan, how does it look?

193
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,200
Uncle, can you stop?

194
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,480
I’m asking you a question.

195
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,879
Am I really

196
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,159
not good enough for Lu Jin?

197
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,120
No.

198
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,279
I’m not joking with you.

199
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,399
I’m not, either.

200
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,559
I mean it.

201
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,120
You two don’t match.

202
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,399
I asked you to break up with him
a long time ago.

203
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,559
Since it occurs to you now,

204
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,320
you might as well

205
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,360
take this opportunity

206
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,799
to break with him for good.

207
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:23,919
From then on,

208
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,960
he takes the open road,

209
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,559
and you cross the log bridge.

210
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,360
Don’t see each other ever.

211
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,399
Actually, it hasn’t gone so bad.

212
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,960
I just think…

213
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,440
I think…

214
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,879
You still like him, do you?

215
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Of course, I do.

216
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,639
All right.

217
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,879
That makes it much easier.

218
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,279
Tell me.

219
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,600
What’s bothering you now?

220
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,639
I think,

221
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,559
Lu Jin and I are so distant
from each other.

222
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
Kid, you don’t understand.

223
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,159
I’m telling you,

224
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,559
distance makes freshness,

225
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,200
freshness makes curiosity,

226
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,159
and curiosity makes romance.

227
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:25,879
That’s why

228
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,639
he chose you

229
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,159
over the woman

230
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,600
who is on the same level with him,

231
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,960
family or work…

232
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,440
Li Man.

233
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,399
I see.

234
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:48,120
I get it now.

235
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,799
Uncle,

236
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,840
do you think I will hold him back?

237
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,639
No. No. No.

238
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,919
Why?

239
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,559
You will never

240
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,480
reach his back.

241
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,660
= Matsuhashi No. 1 =

242
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,039
Lu Jin,

243
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,319
you are back.

244
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,960
Mom.

245
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,480
I forgot to tell you.

246
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,200
Have you settled things in Vancouver?

247
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,200
Well settled.

248
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,440
Where are you going?

249
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,559
Out for a few days.
Got something to take care of.

250
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,839
Are you going to take care of Miss Gu

251
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,440
or her grandfather?

252
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,400
How do you know about her grandpa?

253
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,359
She’s the woman my son likes.

254
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:14,559
Of course, I would pay more attention.

255
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,079
Besides,

256
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,400
you put down your work and come back,

257
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,440
like you are ready to be the son-in-law.

258
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:21,920
So I think

259
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,839
it’s time for me to meet her family

260
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,480
to check whether they’re worthy or not.

261
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,640
Mom,

262
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,480
what have you done?

263
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,640
Nothing.

264
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,960
Just a small chat.

265
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,559
You told Shengnan about

266
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,799
Liu Bang and Xiang Yu,

267
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,920
who will I choose.

268
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,119
And hinted that

269
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,039
she couldn’t be Queen Lyu Zhi,

270
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,599
but only Concubine Yu Ji,

271
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:06,880
right?

272
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,400
She asked you, did she?

273
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,079
What was your answer?

274
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,799
Is it the answer she wants?

275
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,400
Mom, I never

276
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,279
disappointed you at work.

277
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,880
Please don’t interfere

278
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,839
in my personal relationship.

279
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,400
You won’t make it.

280
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,559
Whatever you’ve done

281
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,440
won’t stop my feelings for Shengnan.

282
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,680
Lu Jin.

283
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,400
Stay sober.

284
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,920
Remember,

285
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,079
no emotion is needed at work.

286
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,119
Being emotional

287
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,359
only makes your career a complete failure.

288
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,079
Maybe you are right.

289
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
But I don’t want to be

290
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
an emotionless working machine.

291
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,400
Sorry, Grandpa,

292
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,680
I may not be able to do

293
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,480
what I promised you before.

294
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,920
But I believe that Shengnan

295
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:17,559
will meet a better man than me

296
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,480
and have a better future.

297
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,519
Grandpa, take care.

298
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,480
Wish you recover soon.

299
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,119
Shengnan,

300
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,240
thank you for these days.

301
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,200
I had a happy time.

302
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,279
I know I’m not good enough,

303
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,240
so I’ve decided to study abroad.

304
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,759
I wish you happiness.

305
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,960
Take care of yourself.

306
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,480
Shengnan.

307
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,039
What are you thinking?

308
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,039
Come in.

309
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,960
Hi, Grandpa.

310
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,559
I came to see you.

311
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,119
Okay.

312
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,920
You brought stuff.

313
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,799
Just some nutritional supplements,

314
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,319
and your favorite tea.

315
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,279
Too many supplements

316
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,720
are not good for old people.

317
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:43,680
Yeah.

318
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,119
I also asked the chef to
stew some soup for you.

319
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,799
You didn’t cook it yourself?

320
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:51,880
No.

321
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,599
Okay, put it there.

322
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,359
Okay.

323
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,720
Lu,

324
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,640
you came right in time,

325
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,559
can you do me a favor?

326
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,319
Sure.

327
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,319
That chair was put

328
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,559
in the wrong position.

329
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,400
Yeah.

330
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:27,680
Do you want me to move it?

331
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,640
Move it here a bit.

332
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,440
That’s right, a little backward.

333
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:31,960
Here.

334
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,680
Right.

335
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,559
A little forward.

336
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,160
This okay?

337
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,319
I’m not talking about this one

338
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,960
but the bigger one.

339
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,400
Okay.

340
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,400
You want…

341
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,559
Direction.

342
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,880
Turn it around.

343
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,279
This way?

344
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:51,759
More.

345
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:53,039
Face the window.

346
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:53,759
Okay.

347
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,200
And the pot flowers.

348
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,039
Do you want…

349
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,440
Not that one.

350
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,200
This one.

351
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,480
Harder.

352
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:03,000
Good.

353
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,279
That okay?

354
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,680
Lu,

355
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,720
my head swirls

356
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,079
seeing you moving it.

357
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,079
Put all of these back where they were.

358
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,799
You can go back now.

359
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,920
Okay.

360
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,960
Don’t forget the soup.

361
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,720
Bye.

362
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,559
For the wine party in two days,

363
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,440
you and Zheng should come too.

364
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,039
Ask him to pay attention
to his appearance.

365
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,000
You’re not recovered yet. Don’t go.

366
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,039
You don’t have to do this for him.

367
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,400
I will talk to him sooner or later.

368
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,880
My body is not that important

369
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
compared to Mingting.

370
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,680
I didn’t expect him

371
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,240
to be so ruthless.

372
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,440
So cold-blooded,

373
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,359
just like his mother.

374
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,279
Don’t say this about Lu Jin.

375
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,079
There’s a reason for everything
that happens.

376
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,920
I was sorry for them first.

377
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,960
You don’t have to

378
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,000
speak for them.

379
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,799
You treat him as a son.

380
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,160
He never takes you as a father.

381
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,340
= South Entrance =

382
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,880
How did you come?

383
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,400
You said

384
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,000
you wanted to rest at home.

385
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,079
Why are you here?

386
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,720
I can do as you say

387
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,839
when I work in Bauhinia

388
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,400
because that’s your place.

389
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,039
But this is my grandpa’s place.

390
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,279
I didn’t mean that.

391
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,240
You misunderstood me.

392
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,680
I just want to make some help.

393
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,000
I can get you

394
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,559
two chefs from Bauhinia.

395
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,920
No need.

396
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,880
I can do it all by myself.

397
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,400
Just mind your own business.

398
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,480
I…

399
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,000
I’m here to help you personally.

400
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,200
You are my girlfriend.

401
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,240
You won’t refuse me, will you?

402
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What can you do?

403
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,759
You are right, I can do nothing.

404
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,240
But I can learn.

405
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,240
I bet

406
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,000
you will give up

407
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,680
in less than half an hour.

408
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,319
Try me.

409
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:17,839
Okay.

410
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,839
Peel potatoes.

411
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,279
One more.

412
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,039
Easy-peasy.

413
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,240
Where are the waiters?

414
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,680
The business isn’t good recently.

415
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,200
So I asked them to go back
to save labor costs.

416
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,160
Are you playing with it?

417
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,160
No.

418
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,000
I’m doing it your way.

419
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,880
Stop.

420
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,160
You hold it reversely.

421
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,160
Yeah, right.

422
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,000
Like that.

423
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,880
What are you doing?

424
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,799
Doing operation on the shrimp?

425
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,079
It’s a kind of living thing.

426
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,279
Gotta be respectful.

427
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,519
Will finish soon.

428
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:26,400
Foil vermicelli. Fried rice noodles.

429
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:30,839
Good job.

430
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:00,559
Enjoy.

431
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,079
Waiter, please help us open the wine.

432
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:06,319
Cheers.

433
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,759
Hurry up, what are you doing?

434
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:08,759
Come.

435
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:09,880
Come.

436
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,480
What’s wrong with you?

437
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,839
Let’s go.

438
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,279
Sorry.

439
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,759
Let’s go.

440
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,359
Go.

441
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,519
Hey, you haven’t…

442
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,200
What’s happening outside?

443
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,960
It’s okay, they…

444
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,640
They paid.

445
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:30,359
Where are they?

446
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:36,920
They are all tired,

447
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,359
and went back home.

448
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
It’s 1 a.m..

449
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,160
We should rest too, right?

450
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,960
Let’s go.

451
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,279
There used to be many guests before.

452
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,240
It’s all you.

453
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,480
Me?

454
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,480
Why?

455
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,720
It’s not just us.

456
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:52,720
Look at them…

457
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,839
They got many guests.

458
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,519
So it’s all you.

459
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,160
It must be your poor service

460
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,720
that drove the guests away.

461
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,720
My service is not good?

462
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,279
Gu Shengnan,

463
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,720
for the first time in my life,

464
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,599
I opened a beer bottle for someone else,

465
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,279
do you know that?

466
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,680
For the first time in my life,

467
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,039
I wiped such an oily table.

468
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,240
Did you see that?

469
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,599
I did.

470
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,279
And I cleaned the stove
for the first time.

471
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,359
Like this.

472
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,920
I saw it. I saw it.

473
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,519
You worked very hard.

474
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,599
No, it’s okay.

475
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,079
Yes, I did.

476
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,359
Go on a date with me

477
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,920
in two days.

478
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,599
I’ll take you to a particularly fun place.

479
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:57,519
I do not have time.

480
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,200
We can relax.

481
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,599
I don’t have time.

482
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,720
I’m busy.

483
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,480
What do you want me to do?

484
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,920
Unless…

485
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,240
Unless…

486
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,039
Unless you make it all booked

487
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,160
within half an hour.

488
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,400
I’ll give it a thought. Okay?

489
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,480
Deal.

490
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:34,839
Xinjie,

491
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,160
you got a task.

492
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,359
Make Full Fry

493
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,799
a full house immediately.

494
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,599
I’ll pay for whatever

495
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:45,920
it costs.

496
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,039
Meng Xinjie.

497
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,359
Mr. Lu.

498
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:02,480
Are you a dumbhead?

499
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,160
We got no female employees?

500
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,359
No clerical staff?

501
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,839
You brought me a group of guards.

502
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,680
Do you think we are making a movie?

503
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,640
Only the security department
is on duty at this time.

504
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,319
There are really no other employees.

505
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,720
Make do with it.

506
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,599
Then ask them to take off the uniform.

507
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,559
They’re telling everyone I’m cheating.

508
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,599
What cheating?

509
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,400
I don’t know they went in uniforms.

510
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,759
I sent a message
in the company’s group chat,

511
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,319
and asked everyone to work overtime there.

512
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,359
I didn’t cheat.

513
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:35,920
I just made

514
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,039
a little publicity.

515
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,839
This is the task from you.

516
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,720
I don’t know which company they are from.

517
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,160
They just finished their work,

518
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,720
so it’s fully booked now.

519
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:48,039
But I think there are too many of them.

520
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,720
You would be tired out
making all their meals.

521
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,400
I’ll let them go.

522
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,400
Lu Jin,

523
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,400
white-collar workers are not easy.

524
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,960
They get off work at this time.

525
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:00,400
No.

526
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,039
It must be some

527
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:02,920
cruel boss.

528
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,240
Don’t worry,

529
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,079
I will make something good for them.

530
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,359
Don’t worry.

531
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,280
Shengnan.

532
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,360
Shengnan.

533
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,400
Start.

534
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,320
Eat.

535
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,440
Why are you so unhappy?

536
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,159
Cheer up.

537
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,679
Is it not good?

538
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,440
Make some chat.

539
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,039
Zhenghong’s slogan is…

540
00:34:59,039 --> 00:34:59,800
Shut up.

541
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,119
Sit.

542
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,679
What happened?

543
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,000
Dishes are here. Come on.

544
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,800
What’s the atmosphere here?

545
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,280
Their company might have strict rules

546
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,920
for group dining.

547
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:15,920
Just serve the food.

548
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,039
Okay.

549
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:17,679
Go ahead.

550
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:18,760
Enjoy it.

551
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,119
Eat slowly.

552
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,280
It’s my problem today.

553
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:43,440
I shouldn’t let you work overtime.

554
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,039
I’m sorry

555
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
I bothered you

556
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,159
for personal affairs.

557
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
That is my girlfriend.

558
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,679
It won’t happen again.

559
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,440
I’ll make a toast to you.

560
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,320
Thank you for today.

561
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,719
Sit down.

562
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,760
Start eating.

563
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,760
Keep eating.

564
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,320
Pour beer.

565
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,679
Make a toast.

566
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,559
Chat.

567
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,039
Coming.

568
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,000
Help yourself.

569
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,039
Come.

570
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,199
Stir-fried seasonal vegetables.

571
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,519
Give it to me.

572
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,039
Is it good?

573
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,159
No?

574
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,760
Good!

575
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,000
You scared me good.

576
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,000
That shrimp…

577
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,800
Let’s

578
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,000
get back to business.

579
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
What business?

580
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,199
Date me the day after tomorrow.

581
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,679
I’ll think about it.

582
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh right.

583
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Don’t let your staff work overtime again.

584
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:21,400
Alright?

585
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,440
You did a great job today.

586
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,519
Let me know

587
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,039
if it’s not enough.

588
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:38,920
Well done.

589
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,679
You all get a raise.

590
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,280
Keep eating.

591
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,000
I’m telling you,

592
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,400
Lu Jin is a great kid.

593
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,920
Very easygoing

594
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,559
in front of Shengnan.

595
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:00,880
He peels potatoes and shrimps.

596
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,039
As long as Shengnan asks,

597
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,400
he obeys.

598
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:06,400
They are a lovely

599
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,559
and sweet couple.

600
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,280
If he keeps working there,

601
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,159
my little restaurant

602
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,559
will close soon.

603
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,159
Oh right.

604
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,159
Go back and

605
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,159
bring my wok and scoop.

606
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,679
Why?

607
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,519
You can’t cook in the hospital.

608
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,440
Just do as I say.

609
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,400
Just go.

610
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,920
Okay, fine.

611
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,920
I’ll go after peeling this apple.

612
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,519
Are you tired?

613
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:53,360
