Shengnan,

23
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,840
I’m surprised to see you here.

24
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,879
Who is this handsome man?

25
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,560
Boyfriend?

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,519
Look,

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,280
he has the disposition of a rich man,

28
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,519
he must be generous.

29
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,560
Buying duck eggs?

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,080
Bring us the most expensive
duck eggs of yours.

31
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,319
Thanks.

32
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,039
OK.

33
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,840
Why are you sitting down, Shengnan?

34
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,080
Which bastard sold you at a high price?

35
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,280
I’ll avenge you.

36
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,280
Sold me at a high price?

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,319
Sorry, sold to you. My mistake.

38
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,039
How much

39
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,360
is this?

40
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,520
5 per egg.

41
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,280
Make it cheaper.

42
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,479
You’re the only buyer.

43
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,520
I’ll offer you my buying price.

44
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,560
4.8.

45
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,039
I only make 20 cents per egg.

46
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,080
Look.

47
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,280
Authentic Gaoyou Salted Duck Egg.

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,240
Very greasy.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
Shengnan,

50
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,280
what’s this?

51
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,039
Honesty Detector.

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,120
This is a bit excessive, isn’t it?

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,000
It’s unnecessary.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,680
Let’s have a test.

55
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,439
See if you’re honest.

56
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,319
I’m very honest.

57
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,039
What’s this?

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,520
Facts speak louder than words.

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,439
How much is your buying price?

60
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,759
4.8.

61
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,000
4.5.

62
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,280
3.

63
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,280
All from Gaoyou?

64
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,039
Sure.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,560
All greasy?

66
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,280
Sure.

67
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,400
Shengnan,

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,439
this is

69
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,280
not Gaoyou Salted Duck Egg.

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,479
I bought it from the suburbs.

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,240
The villagers salted the eggs.

72
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,719
Your lowest price?

73
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,800
3.5.

74
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,479
I’ll take 6.

75
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,199
So much extra effort.

76
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,039
I told you

77
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,080
honesty matters the most.

78
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,280
21.

79
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,000
Thanks.

80
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,199
How much is this piece of tofu?

81
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
3.

82
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,519
Don’t worry, I’ll make up
the price discrepancy.

83
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,839
Be honest from now on.

84
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,959
You’re nice, senior.

85
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,519
Senior?

86
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,600
Senior.

87
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,439
Alright, alright.

88
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,800
You pay however much you like.

89
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,959
2…

90
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,000
20.

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,680
Keep the change.

92
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
Tutu, collar, collar!

93
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,040
Sorry.

94
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,279
Where is the needle?

95
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,959
Sorry, Boss.

96
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,360
I forgot. I’ll pluck it the next time.

97
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,000
The next time? What about this time?

98
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,879
Tutu, do you know why

99
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,600
I haven’t fired you?

100
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,839
Because you’re mercy.

101
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,800
Because labor law is protecting you.

102
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,600
You silly!

103
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,079
Gabriel, Gabriel.

104
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,959
I didn’t expect

105
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,560
you to be a true man.

106
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,560
Richard, Richard,

107
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,519
perfect timing.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,800
So

109
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,160
you can help me teach her

110
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,439
how to act like you.

111
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,480
One look from Mr. Lu

112
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,079
can make you get Pavlovian Conditioning.

113
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,759
Pav…

114
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,600
Go look it up.

115
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,519
P-Pavlovian.

116
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,720
Get down to business.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,720
I’m here today to fulfill my promise.

118
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,040
We had a deal.

119
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,879
You’ll be the supplier of the uniforms

120
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,879
for our New Year Celebration this year.

121
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,680
Meng Xinjie,

122
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,240
you’ve been unlucky in relationships.

123
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
I thought you’d forgotten about it.

124
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,720
I didn’t expect that

125
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,040
you’re actually here
to fulfill your promise.

126
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,360
It looks like

127
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,680
Xu Zhaodi didn’t hurt you that much
after all.

128
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,240
I was worried about you for several days.

129
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,120
OK, OK, let’s talk business.

130
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,360
And keep private stuff private.

131
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,120
Speak.

132
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,240
So, uh, you don’t get the order for free.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,519
There are two things that may trouble you.

134
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,600
How troublesome would they be?

135
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,879
The first thing is,

136
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,000
why is Miss Gu unhappy today?

137
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,519
Shouldn’t your boss worry about it?

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,040
True, but I’m just doing my job.

139
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Well,

140
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,800
this is simple.

141
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,800
Next.

142
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,560
Next thing is,

143
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,079
has Xu Zhaodi hooked up

144
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,480
with another man?

145
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,920
A man? Is he handsome?

146
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,160
A mixblood.

147
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,759
Jeez, a mixblood?

148
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,800
Where did she meet him?

149
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,120
In a nightclub or something.

150
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,399
He drives a Porsche.

151
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,519
No, no.

152
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,279
It doesn’t matter.

153
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,759
Must be the one that we often go to.

154
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,800
Does he drink?

155
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,519
It’s Friday or…

156
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:36,879
Must be Saturday.

157
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,959
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

158
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,480
Are you asking me
or I’m asking you?

159
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,759
Richard, don’t worry.

160
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,519
I’ll handle Zhaodi for you.

161
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,439
You need to help me confirm
which the club it is.

162
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,879
He’s Asian-European
or African-European?

163
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,519
Jeans?

164
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,000
Richard,

165
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,240
come on!

166
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,199
If you see him again,

167
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,519
send me the address.

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,839
I’m here.

169
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,720
Yes.

170
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,319
Oh, your vegetables.

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,039
It’s OK now.

172
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,399
The light is fixed?

173
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
You installed it?

174
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Good. Good boy.

175
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,919

Is Ms. Zheng happy with the dishes

215
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,519
that we prepared for her?

216
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Don’t know.

217
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,759
Until now,

218
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,919
if there’s no bad news

219
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,240
it’s good news, right?

220
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:23,559
Call me if necessary.

221
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,000
Fried codfish with tomato basil sauce.

222
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,320
Lu Jin,

223
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,480
why are you here?

224
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,360
I’m in charge of the Bauhinia project.

225
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,120
I can’t miss this important part.

226
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,759
Right, mom?

227
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,120
Sit.

228
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,919
The fish is good.

229
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,080
It had its own world.

230
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,440
It got a bright future

231
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,360
but was seduced by the cheap bait.

232
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,200
Its greed was sated

233
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,000
at the cost of its life.

234
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,200
Foolish.

235
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
A lowly dish.

236
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:24,840
Carry on.

237
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,559
Why are you in a rush?

238
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,799
I heard Ms. Zheng said that…

239
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,720
Well, she said

240
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,919
the soup was lowly.

241
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,360
And the fish was

242
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,919
greedy and foolish.

243
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,840
Anyway, the dish wasn’t high-end enough.

244
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,279
Forget it, next dish.

245
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Trumpet, serve.

246
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,360
OK.

247
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,840
Where is the cart?

248
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,759
It was right here.

249
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:50,559
I…

250
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,759
There! You two dummies.

251
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:08,759
Ms. Zheng,

252
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,480
Mr. Lu, Miss Li.

253
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,200
The next dish

254
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,879
is today’s final dish.

255
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,080
Also, a dish specially cooked by our chef

256
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,919
Gu Shengnan.

257
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,080
She’ll introduce it.

258
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,279
Ms. Zheng, we got the expensive ingredient

259
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,360
just for you.

260
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,159
Red wine...

261
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,919
What-what’s this?

262
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,200
What?

263
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,240
You didn’t cook this?

264
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,080
No, I didn’t.

265
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,639
I cooked truffled mushroom ragout.

266
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,120
Sorry,

267
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,360
I didn’t cook this.

268
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,240
Since Chef Gu didn’t cook this,

269
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,080
Manager Shen, take it away.

270
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,320
OK.

271
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,080
It is truffle.

272
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,240
One of the three most expensive
ingredients in the world.

273
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,639
But

274
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,200
it seems the truffle

275
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
hasn’t been processed.

276
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,480
Raw truffle

277
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,679
smells bad.

278
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,279
It must be a misunderstanding, right?

279
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,039
Manager Shen.

280
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,879
No.

281
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,600
Li Man, please explain

282
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,879
to us if there’s a deeper meaning.

283
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,240
It simulates truffle’s

284
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,919
growing environment.

285
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,679
The garnish is rotten leaves.

286
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,200
The rest

287
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,360
might sound inappropriate...

288
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,440
Then just stop.

289
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,200
Say it.

290
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,600
Truffle doesn’t carry out

291
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,759
photosynthesis on its own.

292
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,279
So it needs a host with enough nutrition.

293
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,279
For example, oak.

294
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,639
It absorbs the nutrition in an oak’s roots

295
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:04,160
to create an ideal growing environment
for itself.

296
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,359
Truffle

297
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,640
also kills the plants around the oak.

298
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,039
It makes them decay and rot.

299
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,119
Truffle sure is callous.

300
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,640
Mom, it’s a misunderstanding.

301
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,000
Manager Shen, it’s not

302
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,799
a misunderstanding.

303
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,799
I think she did it on purpose.

304
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,200
Are you trying to say that

305
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,880
the acquisition

306
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,119
is like the truffle,

307
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,000
which killed others to benefit itself?

308
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,440
No, Ms. Zheng.

309
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,960
I am unhappy with the acquisition,

310
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,359
but I’m not that stupid to

311
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,119
take it out on the dish.

312
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,000
I didn’t cook the dish, Manager Shen.

313
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,319
All right, enough.

314
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,319
I’ve seen what Bauhinia is capable of.

315
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,319
Let’s go.

316
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:46,799
Uh…

317
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,119
Ms… Ms. Zheng, uh…

318
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,839
What are you doing here?

319
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,960
Go back to the kitchen.

320
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,960
S-Sorry, sorry, Mr. Lu.

321
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,519
Gu Shengnan,

322
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
about what happened,

323
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,519
don’t you think you owe me an explanation?

324
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,759
What explanation?

325
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,000
I didn’t cook the dish.

326
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,000
She didn’t.

327
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,519
I helped her all the way.

328
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,880
She did use truffle,

329
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,960
but not like this.

330
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,680
Who cooked it then?

331
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,880
Manager,

332
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,319
did someone serve the wrong dish?

333
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,079
Someone?

334
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,519
Who?

335
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,000
Are you talking about me?

336
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,599
No, no, no.

337
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,319
I served the dish.

338
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,039
I know it was you.

339
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,200
My meaning is,

340
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,039
who passed the dish to you?

341
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:50,880
Me.

342
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Are you talking about me?

343
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,559
I passed the dish to her.

344
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,079
I didn’t mean that.

345
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:55,880
All right.

346
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,359
It’s not that hard

347
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,759
to figure out

348
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,319
what the hell happened.

349
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,000
The person had a problem
with Zhenghong Group.

350
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,640
No one here

351
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,559
is that important

352
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,960
to have anything to do

353
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,240
with those big bosses, right?

354
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,079
I seem to remember that

355
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,200
Customer 1123 fooled

356
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,440
the kitchen around.

357
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,119
I believe everybody should know

358
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,319
that who had a problem

359
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,160
with him.

360
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,799
Just admit it.

361
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,200
Don’t get us

362
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,880
hardworking employees involved.

363
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,440
We’ve been working here for so long

364
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
and we are treated as suspects.

365
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,640
This is very disappointing.

366
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,839
Very cold-hearted.

367
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,880
What do you mean?

368
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,519
Yes,

369
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
1123 and I did have a history,

370
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,880
but I don’t have a problem with him.

371
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,200
What is it then?

372
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,759
Anyway,

373
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,000
it’s not related to this matter.

374
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,759
See?

375
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,000
She’s hiding something.

376
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,839
How come it isn’t related?

377
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,640
I think it’s definitely

378
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,160
related to this.

379
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,519
And

380
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,599
in an unusual way.

381
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,720
Think about it,

382
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,039
we’ve been working in Bauhinia for so long

383
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,440
and we haven’t got promoted.

384
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,640
A young girl like her

385
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,759
made her way up to chef in a few days.

386
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,200
And here she claims

387
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,599
she got the promotion fair and square?

388
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,400
Mr. Lu, how come…

389
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,880
How come you’re here in the kitchen?

390
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,319
Come with me.

391
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,880
I have something to ask you in private.

392
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,960
Do you trust me?

393
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,200
Of course.

394
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,400
Who else would I trust?

395
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,200
I knew you would.

396
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,839
It’s been a tiring day,

397
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,519
go home and get some rest.

398
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,759
Leave it to me, okay?

399
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,599
Go home.

400
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,960
You’re Gu Shengnan’s sidekick.

401
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,920
Can I call you that?

402
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,119
Mr. Lu,

403
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,519
how polite of you.

404
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,359
Shengnan is my chief.

405
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,119
Mr. Lu, tell you what,

406
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,400
Shengnan mustn’t have done it.

407
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,519
When she cooked,

408
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,400
I had been helping her.

409
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,960
I can vouch for her.

410
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,640
She definitely cooked
truffled mushroom ragout.

411
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,160
Someone must have swapped the dish.

412
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,279
Who would it be?

413
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,160
Well,

414
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,119
that’d be my presumption.

415
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,799
Out with it.

416
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,519
I order you to tell me.

417
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,799
Could be Mr. Yu, could be Mr. Wang.

418
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,519
They think they have worked
for the longest time

419
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:22,519
in Bauhinia Hotel,

420
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,880
so they always take advantage
of their seniority.

421
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
In the chef competition,

422
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
they lost to my chief.

423
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,880
So they must have held a grudge.

424
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,400
They framed my chief up.

425
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,306
I…

426
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,880
Oh,

427
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,400
check the camera.

428
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,680
See who exactly

429
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,559
swapped the dish.

430
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,279
That’ll do, right?

431
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,559
Sorry to disappoint you

432
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,400
but the camera got nothing.

433
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,519
I have no idea then.

434
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,160
We didn’t do it.

435
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,000
Come in.

436
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,359
Mr. Lu, Yu Zhikun is here.

437
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,640
Sit.

438
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,279
You are Yu Zhikun?

439
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,880
Yes.

440
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,160
Back in the kitchen, I...

441
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,279
I’m Lu Jin.

442
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,279
Mr. Lu,

443
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,160
hi.

444
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,759
How long have you worked in Bauhinia?

445
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,240
13 years.

446
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,680
In Bauhinia...

447
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,920
Do you know why I called

448
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,160
you here?

449
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:38,880
No.

450
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,640
Did you swap Gu Shengnan’s dish?

451
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:51,920
No.

452
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,839
How was it possible for me to do it?

453
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,400
We only had a brief talk,

454
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,480
you can’t presume that I did it.

455
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,880
The hotel has a strict rule

456
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,880
that if expensive ingredients
like black truffle are used,

457
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,519
the employees must keep a record.

458
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,880
According to the record
in the prepping room,

459
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,519
you took some black truffle

460
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,000
at around 9:15.

461
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,160
Is that correct?

462
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,559
Correct.

463
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,640
Yes.

464
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,279
I did take some.

465
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,640
I cooked with it.

466
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
What did you cook?

467
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,880
Fried scallop meat with black truffle.

468
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,759
You cooked it last night?

469
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,559
No, this morning.

470
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,400
Where is the dish?

471
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,519
Uh, I did a terrible job.

472
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,119
Then I trashed it.

473
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,000
Where?

474
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,519
Where?

475
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,160
It must be in the trash bin.

476
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,240
Which trash bin?

477
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,640
Which trash bin?

478
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,920
So many bins.

479
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,640
I must have

480
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,759
trashed it in a random bin.

481
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,599
Was it the bin for

482
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,400
kitchen garbage downstairs?

483
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,799
Yes, yes.

484
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,160
That bin.

485
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,519
Well, that’s odd.

486
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,319
The garbage collector

487
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,880
comes to collect the garbage once a day.

488
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,400
Everything from last night until now

489
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,759
is still in the bin.

490
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,359
I sent someone to

491
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,920
rummage through it,

492
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,039
but your fried scallop meat
with black truffle

493
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,839
wasn’t found.

494
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,880
Instead,

495
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:22,640
Gu Shengnan’s dish, which was supposed
to be served,

496
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,160
was in the bin.

497
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,039
What did you do with your black truffle?

498
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,279
Or did you mix the black truffle

499
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,119
with a bunch of rotten leaves

500
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,680
and serve the dish?

501
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,559
No, no, no.

502
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,279
This is slander.

503
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,160
This is but your guess.

504
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,119
You have no evidence.

505
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,000
Right?

506
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,759
Have you heard

507
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,519
Locard’s Exchange Principle?

508
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,440
What?

509
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,880
When someone commits a crime,

510
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,599
it’s a progress

511
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,160
of exchange of items.

512
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,640
The criminal

513
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,519
is an item.

514
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,000
Let’s say you,

515
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,680
during the crime,

516
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,640
you would make contact and

517
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,039
exchange with all kinds of items

518
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:06,400
and it doesn’t subject to man’s will.

519
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,279
No matter how hard you try to hide,

520
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,160
everything that you did would leave

521
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,640
traces.

522
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,559
You’ve been working
in Bauhinia for 13 years,

523
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,480
you know everything about this place.

524
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,039
Since you do,

525
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,039
you know that the security camera
in the kitchen has a blind spot,

526
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,519
so you could avoid it.

527
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,920
The camera wouldn’t catch

528
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,359
any part of you swapping the dish.

529
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,039
But the deed was only half done.

530
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,119
If you were to keep it from everyone,

531
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,799
you must secretly

532
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,880
get rid of Gu Shengnan’s dish.

533
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,240
The trash bin for the kitchen garbage

534
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,559
would be your only option.

535
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,079
And there was only one way

536
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,680
to get to the trash bin.

537
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,599
Because you had to avoid the

538
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,000
cameras in the elevator,

539
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,039
you’d have to walk downstairs.

540
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,240
There was no security camera
in the staircase,

541
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,759
as well as at the exit of it.

542
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:58,519
No camera could have caught that spot.

543
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,440
But what the camera could film

544
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,359
was the wall opposite to the exit
of the staircase.

545
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,319
Did you notice that

546
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,400
there was a painting on the wall?

547
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,279
A painting?

548
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,559
What painting?

549
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,039
An Italian artist Tiziano’s work,

550
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,799
the Repentant Magdalen.

551
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,759
The camera can catch the full painting

552
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:28,519
and the reflection of the person

553
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,279
who walks past it on the glass frame.

554
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,519
All you did was

555
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,559
meant to frame Gu Shengnan up,

556
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,680
but do you know

557
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,079
that during the dish-tasting,

558
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,519
the vice president of Zhenghong Group

559
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,799
had gastrointestinal bleeding

560
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,759
because of the dish you made?

561
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,400
Now, she’s still in the emergency room.

562
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,480
Your action has

563
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,720
endangered a person’s life.

564
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,880
I must call the police.

565
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,960
Whether it’s a crime or not,

566
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,039
you’ll have to explain
to the police later.

567
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,400
No, it’s...

568
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,559
No. How… How could it be?

569
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,279
It shouldn’t be like this...

570
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
I just...

571
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,000
Why did you do it?

572
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,440
Because the young girl Gu Shengnan

573
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,160
gets to be the chef

574
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,880
whereas you got demoted to

575
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,039
a sous chef

576
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,799
after working in Bauhinia for 13 years.

577
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,279
You think it’s unfair,

578
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,000
so you came up with a nasty idea

579
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,920
to fame her.

580
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,759
Yes.

581
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,160
I admit it.

582
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,720
I swapped the dish.

583
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,039
I couldn’t let her become the chef

584
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,279
so easily.

585
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,759
It’s unfair.

586
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,920
I’ve worked in this hotel for so long.

587
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,039
Why does a little girl get to become

588
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,359
the chef so quickly?

589
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,559
Sit down, you. Sit down.

590
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,279
It’s not that complicated. Sit down.

591
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:44,799
I’ll help you sort it out.

592
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,240
You’re fired.

593
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,880
You go to HR and resign.

594
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,279
Simple, right?

595
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,160
What about the police?

596
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,880
I didn’t expect any of this.

597
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,400
No. There’s no cop.

598
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,640
No one would eat that dish.

599
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,400
And there was no painting.

600
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:07,920
But we got this.

601
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,160
What?

602
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,240
Yes.

603
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,559
I admit it.

604
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,160
I swapped the dish.

605
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,400
I couldn’t let her become the chef

606
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,799
so easily.

607
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,240
It’s unfair.

608
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,359
I’ve worked in this hotel for so long.

the chef so quickly?

612
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
I see.

613
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,759
You set me up.

614
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,599
You didn’t get any evidence.

615
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:37,160
You’re with Gu Shengnan.

616
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,519
You’ve

617
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,240
worked together to set me up.

618
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,519
And Gu Shengnan isn’t
sleeping with anyone?

619
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,240
Are you saying Gu Shengnan is

620
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,359
sleeping with me

621
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,359
or with him?

622
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:51,880
Make yourself clear.

623
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,279
With you!

624
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,240
Go out.

625
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,640
How did you know I was coming?

626
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,240
Meng Xinjie told me on the phone.

627
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,319
He-he-he said,

628
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,200
Zhaodi and my uncle went to your house

629
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,559
to settle the score with Li Man.

630
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,079
My house?

631
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,279
Because I just called them...

632
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:49,799
Slow down.

633
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,279
I called them

634
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,319
and said some stuff on the phone.

635
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:52,920
And then they...

636
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,599
They just went.

637
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,000
Quickly, quickly.

640
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,319
come out.

641
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,519
Come out!

642
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:02,839
Li Man!

643
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,720
You are a coward.

644
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,359
Right. Come out!

645
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,720
Such a coward!

646
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,640
Coming, coming.

647
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,240
Who

648
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,359
are you two?

649
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,119
Shouting and yelling

650
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,160
in front of other’s house

651
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:22,519
is inappropriate, isn’t it?

652
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,039
You’re Li Man, right?

653
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,119
You don’t need to know who we are.

654
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,119
You

655
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,160
have a pretty face

656
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,920
but do sneaky stuff.

657
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,039
Speak.

658
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,559
Did you do it?

659
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,440
Miss,

660
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,200
please watch your language.

661
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,359
What are you talking about?

662
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,079
You old vixen,

663
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,839
don’t act innocent.

664
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,039
I read right through you.

665
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,200
Miss Li,

666
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,880
I’d like you to know that

667
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,359
although my nephew Gu Shengnan

668
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,559
is a bit goofy,

669
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,920
but we got her back.

670
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,319
I advise you not to play dirty.

671
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,839
You’re Gu Shengnan’s relatives, huh?

672
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,119
There’s a misunderstanding

673
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,640
between us, I think.

674
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,640
First of all, I don’t know her well.

675
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,559
You go talk to whoever is responsible

676
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,920
for what happened today.

677
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:10,119
You just speak with Lu Jin.

678
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,119
What?

679
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,920
Are you upset

680
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,599
because he’s into someone else?

681
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,599
If Lu Jin liked you,

682
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:19,359
you would have been together.

683
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,160
You can’t blame your own failure

684
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:23,759
on Gu Shengnan.

685
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,519
The more you bully her,

686
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,039
the more Lu Jin cares about her.

687
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:30,440
Don’t try to read other’s mind.

688
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,519
Or you’ll be trapped

689
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,400
in your own thoughts.

690
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,160
Lu Jin is my son.

691
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,880
You don’t get to take a wild guess

692
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,920
of what he likes.

693
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,680
You’re Lu Jin’s mom, right?

694
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
Hi, Lu Jin’s mom,

695
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,839
we’re here to tell you that

696
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,599
Gu Shengnan would never do

697
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,839
shit like that.

698
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,640
Someone must be jealous of her

699
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,759
and tried to frame her up.

700
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,839
You two

701
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:53,000
came here to speak for the girl chef?

702
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,640
I have a few words for her.

703
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:57,920
I hope, in the future,

704
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,039
if she has any problems,

705
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,839
she has to report to her boss,

706
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,599
the manager of F & B.

707
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,880
Please don’t send a bunch of her friends

708
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,119
to speak up for her
in the middle of the night

709
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,359
in front of the chairman’s house.

710
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:11,599
She’s better off spending the time

711
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:12,839
improving her culinary skills

712
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,000
instead of trying to be a smart ass.

713
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,880
Especially truffle recipes.

714
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,119
Ms. Zheng,

715
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,880
you sound quite harsh.

716
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,000
Who are you?

717
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,759
I’m a tailor.

718
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,599
My name doesn’t matter.

719
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,359
We weren’t

720
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,759
very much educated.

721
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,000
Sorry for disturbing you.

722
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,400
It’s our fault.

723
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,200
But

724
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,839
everything happens for a reason.

725
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,839
Our chef friend

726
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,160
was framed up

727
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,359
but she didn’t make a scene,

728
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,839
instead, she asked us not to disturb you.

729
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,279
In comparison,

730
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,440
you’re a woman of high status,

731
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,119
but you’re mean

732
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,359
and just jumped into conclusion
without evidence.

733
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,680
Ms. Zheng, we...

734
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,759
So you’re too petty

735
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,640
with us, whose names aren’t even worthy

736
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,599
remembering.

737
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:02,440
Oh,

738
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,119
you just said,

739
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,200
Mr. Lu is your son

740
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,640
and others can’t read his mind.

741
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,760
I’d like to ask you,

742
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,840
do you know your son?

743
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,360
Do you know what’s the relationship

744
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,639
between Mr. Lu

745
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,000
and our chef friend?

746
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,440
Of course you don’t.

747
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,880
You care more about

748
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,320
the shares of the company.

749
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,119
You don’t care about true feelings

750
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,320
of human beings.

751
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,599
Enough.

752
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,840
Enough.

753
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,360
Mom.

754
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,519
Sorry, Ms. Zheng.

755
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,719
I’m so sorry.

756
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,719
I’ve found out who cooked the dish.

757
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,760
Everything is on me.

758
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,840
They

759
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,440
are her friends.

760
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,159
Go.

761
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,880
Please.

762
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,679
Lu Jin,

763
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,880
she wears a terrible look on her face.

764
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,079
Will she be hard on you?

765
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,599
No, no.

766
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,880
I’ll take care of it.

767
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,960
You head back now, OK?

768
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:26,760
Mom.

769
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,119
Lu Jin,

770
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,199
you’ve become more and more different.

771
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,119
I’m still your son.

772
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,960
Going out to confront them

773
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,880
wasn’t your thing.

774
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,840
People change.

775
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,559
Yes. And quite a lot.

776
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,159
Your name is more important

777
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:50,239
in this thing.

778
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,440
So I must find out who did it.

779
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,000
And it wasn’t Gu Shengnan.

780
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,039
You’re better than this.

781
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,920
Just forgive them.

782
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,800
You care more about

783
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,400
Gu Shengnan’s feelings, right?

784
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,760
You and she are both important to me.

785
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,599
Since you’ve said it,

786
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:17,000
it would be uncool of me

787
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,159
to keep giving a young girl a hard time.

788
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,760
Now that it has been confirmed that

789
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,400
Gu Shengnan didn’t do it,

790
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,239
I’ll buy

791
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,239
her a meal, then.

792
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,159
No, mom.

793
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,400
She hasn’t really

794
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,079
taken it to heart.

795
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:33,920
So

796
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,280
you don’t need to buy her a meal.

797
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,519
But I have.

798
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,760
If I don’t clear the air,

799
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,639
people would think I’m

800
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,280
bullying a girl.

801
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,039
Mom.

802
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,079
Mr. Lu,

803
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,480
just let them dine together.

804
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:49,239
It might be a good chance for them

805
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,920
to clear the air and
get to know each other.

806
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,840
I’m worried that my mom...

807
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,719
Don’t worry about me.

808
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,519
Does

809
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,519
Miss Gu have concerns?

810
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,400
Just you, me, and her?

811
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,760
The three of us have a quick meal,

812
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:08,920
right?

813
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,000
Just a quick one.

814
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,760
Table 6, lime juice marinated scallop,

815
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,559
applewood smoked New Zealand salmon.

816
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:23,679
Table 11, raw steak tartare,

817
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:24,840
slow-cooked Iberian Matsusaka pork.

818
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,960
Table 15, fried sea bass,

819
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,679
foie gras parfait.

820
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,079
Table 18, orange flower bitters
sponge cake,

821
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,719
with saffron mousse, almond, orange on it.

822
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,599
Keep it up, guys.

823
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,760
We got many customers today. Come on!

824
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,480
You hear it?

825
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,519
Yes.

826
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:38,000
Then get to work.

827
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:43,920
I got table 11.

828
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,920
I got table 6.

829
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,159
Prepare the ingredients.

830
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,079
Chef Gu,

831
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,840
I’ll take care of the rest.

832
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,079
Come on, come on, come on.

833
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:00,760
Help me wash two carrots.

834
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,400
Chef Gu, you’ve finally
got everyone’s respect,

835
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,440
my life will be so much easier.

836
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,199
It’s impossible.

837
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:08,119
I plan to train you.

838
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,519
I’ll watch you closely every day.

839
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,239
No problem.

840
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,559
Mr. Cheng helped you find out the truth

841
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:14,320
and fired Mr. Yu.

842
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,760
How will you thank him?

843
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,480
How?

844
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,199
It’s your job.

845
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,760
You’re good at ass-kissing.

846
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,920
I only kiss your ass, Miss Gu.

847
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,400
Young man,

848
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:30,480
you need to focus on your job.

849
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,639
Don’t put your mind on

850
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,800
meaningless stuff,

851
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:33,880
got it?

852
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,440
Got it.

853
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,199
So go prepare the ingredients.

854
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,000
OK.

855
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,159
Miss Gu.

856
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,079
See you around.

857
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,360
Hurry up.

858
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:15,880
How did it go?

859
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,360
Did your mom give you a hard time

860
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,800
after you went home?

861
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:20,519
No, she didn’t.

862
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,360
Why would she?

863
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,599
I have great news for you.

864
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:29,760
My mom wants to make peace with you.

865
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,760
She’d like to buy you a meal.

866
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,079
Just the three of us.

867
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,599
It is good news,

868
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:40,840
but no.

869
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,159
The moment

870
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:45,039
I think of how I cook for her,

871
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,320
I feel, I feel terrible.

872
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,039
No.

873
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:48,400
You won’t be the cook.

874
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,119
We’ll dine in a hotel.

875
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,519
But I respect your decision.

876
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,280
Let me think about it.

877
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,519
I’ll get back to you later.

878
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,559
OK.

879
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,239
Think about it.

880
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,039
How about you think about it now?

881
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,880
I’m busy.

882
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:15,519
I’m the chef.

883
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,280
Yeah.

884
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:17,800
I’ll tell you later.

885
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,320
OK.

886
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,119
I’m off.

887
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,320
Think about it.

888
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,079
OK.

889
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:21,880
See you around.

890
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,559
See you.

891
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,599
You...

892
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,360
I’m tired. I’m tired.

893
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,880
You wanted to come,

894
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,719
I barely hang out in places like this.

895
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:40,760
Celine,

896
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,440
the drink from Mr. Wang.

897
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,280
What a coincidence.

898
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,199
An old client of mine.

899
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,020
= Zhaodi =

900
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,960
You call me at this hour,

901
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,840
do you want to drink or cry?

902
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,519
Help me out,

903
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:16,000
your bestie met a mixblood.

904
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,760
Don’t be fooled by the driver.

905
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,719
I won’t fall into the same trap twice.

906
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:23,719
It’s rush hour.

907
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,119
The price is one and a half times
higher than usual.

908
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,480
I’ll double it.

909
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,280
Dress like a macho.

910
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,320
Don’t be caught.

911
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,159
Like a macho?

912
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,840
More outfit fee, then.

913
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,920
Fine, I’ll cover all.

914
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,440
I’ve sent you the address. Be quick.

915
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:38,519
I’m on my way.

916
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,199
You had a couple of drinks tonight,

917
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,239
don’t drive me home.

918
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,519
I won’t,

919
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:52,679
I’ll get us a designated driver.

920
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,159
No.

921
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,079
I have a friend nearby.

922
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,559
He’ll be here soon.

923
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,280
