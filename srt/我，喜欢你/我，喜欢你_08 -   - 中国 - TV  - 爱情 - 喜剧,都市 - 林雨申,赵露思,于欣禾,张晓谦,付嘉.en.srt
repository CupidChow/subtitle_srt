Come and pick me up right now.

Boss, I’m in Zhuozhou.

22
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:57,147
Hello?

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,680
Why did Mr. Lu return to Suhai so suddenly?

24
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,959
Miss Li, I’m not clear about this, either.

25
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,879
He just called me on his way…

26
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,000
You

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,039
book the latest flight and go back at once.

28
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,319
He can’t be alone.

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,599
OK.

30
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,199
I’ll stay here to deal with the rest.

31
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,639
OK, I got it.

32
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,560
Find out

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
the reason for his return,

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,639
and then call me.

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,599
Is that appropriate?

36
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,879
If the chairman asks for it,

37
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,840
will you report?

38
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,439
I got it.

39
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,960
Boss, you’re back.

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,719
So fast.

41
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,240
What happened?

42
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,759
Sit with me for a while.

43
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,360
Is it beautiful?

44
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,400
Matsuhashi No.1

45
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,240
is beautiful, of course.

46
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,240
But I can’t feel it at all.

47
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,520
Go wrap up

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,800

00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,360
I got it.

51
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:41,960
Get out of here.

I heard you hurt your leg.

59
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
I’m here to see you.

60
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,680
Manager Shen.

61
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,480
I’m no longer working at Bauhinia.

62
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,839
And you’re no longer my boss.

63
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,079
We two are not good enough

64
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,839
to come to my home unannounced, right?

65
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,399
Look, Miss Gu,

66
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,040
perhaps our fate

67
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,600
is not really over?

69
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,920
Letter of Appointment?

70
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,480
Why do you suddenly want me to go back?

71
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,480
You don’t have a job, right?

72
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,959
I thought you said finding a job was easy,

73
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,600
then why are you still at home?

74
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,920
I like to stay at home.

75
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,839
It’s comfortable.

76
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,240
Shengnan.

77
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,519
I came here today

78
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,920
just to give you a heads up.

79
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,199
I advise you

80
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,360
to take it quickly,

81
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,480
otherwise you’ll lose the chance.

82
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,680
Well, since you’re being so straight.

83
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,839
I won’t hold back.

84
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,920
A raise, 20%.

85
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,040
If a cent less,

86
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,879
it’s okay.

87
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,120
Well, I won’t hold back, either.

88
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,639
I told you I had it covered.

89
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,600
And $1,000

90
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,759
more than you expected.

91
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,480
How’s that?

92
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,800
It seems that the Bauhinia

93
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,560
could not find

94
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,399
a better chef than me.

95
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,519
Now that Manager Shen has paid a special visit,

96
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,279
I will

97
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,279
reluctantly accept it.

98
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,000
No.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,040
Don’t do the hard thing.

100
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,800
If it is hard for you, let’s forget it...

101
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,839
Who will have problems with money, right?

102
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,519
Give it to me.

103
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,040
Didn’t I give it to you?

104
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,040
I hope you get well soon.

105
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,279
Thanks.

106
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,040
Then when you get up tomorrow morning...

107
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,000
I’m back.

108
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,720
Miss Gu,

109
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,839
are you back on the job again?

110
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,639
I just took a minor vacation.

111
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,879
But I didn’t realize the hotel needs me so much.

112
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,600
Then,

113
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,360
at the expense of my own small interests,

114
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,519
I returned to work.

115
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,279
I’m glad you are back.

116
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,759
But could you stop bragging.

117
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,000
1123.

118
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,720
Whatever.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,639
Prepare for meals.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,959
Got it.

121
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,120
What kind of connections does Gu Shengnan have?

122
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,879
She’s back again.

123
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,560
The guest in 1123 has already left, right?

124
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,639
Got a new patron so soon?

125
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,519
Mr. Liu.

126
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,160
You don’t know that.

127
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,959
Now the little girl

128
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,279
can get a new one fast.

129
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,839
I tell you.

130
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,839
Gu Shengnan

131
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,639
has a strong relation.

132
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,879
Let’s not talk about

133
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,000
a little girl behind her.

134
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
It’s not easy for a little girl to find a job.

135
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,240
Just behave ourselves.

136
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,240
My dishes?

137
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,600
Wow, I get the dishes

138
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,639
by just writing casual.

139
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,600
Thanks.

140
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,000
What’s the matter with you?

141
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,840
Enjoy.

142
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,960
OK. Thanks.

143
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,039
Miss Li.

144
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,360
I have found out everything this time.

145
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,320
Our boss came back just to

146
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,639
book a plane ticket

147
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,759
to Switzerland for tomorrow.

148
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,000
It’s a hell of an undercover job.

149
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,360
I can’t afford to offend either side.

150
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,000
Miss Li, are you still there?

151
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,000
Miss Li? Miss Li?

152
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,600
Yes.

153
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,759
Trumpet.

154
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,919
What’s going on here?

155
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,000
I’ve just been away for a while.

156
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
I just heard

157
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,279
that a new boss

158
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,720
will definitely come to inspect.

159
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,720
We must

160
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,080
make a good impression, right?

161
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,879
Come on.

162
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,759
You must make a showing.

163
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:04,039
Come on, guys. Be quiet.

164
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,639
Let me make an introduction.

165
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,840
Mr. Cheng, the new general manager of our hotel.

166
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,360
Hello, everyone.

167
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,240
Hello, general manager.

168
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,480
What’s the matter?

169
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,519
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

170
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,240
I was worried for nothing.

171
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,519
Tell me,

172
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,559
did you arrange for me

173
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,759
to come back to work?

174
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,519
As much as I’d like to claim it,

175
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,639
but it’s not me.

176
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,519
I get it.

177
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,879
No showing off.

178
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,240
I get it.

179
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,120
Shengnan,

180
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,519
if you

181
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,799
need any help from me

182
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,639
just tell me.

183
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,159
I will try my best.

184
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,639
I will definitely ask you for help.

185
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,519
Be patient.

186
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,639
Now,

187
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
can I go back to work?

188
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,720
I need you to help me right now.

189
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,279
Just tell me.

190
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:02,840
Well.

191
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,039
Fussy Lu who bought our hotel...

192
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,519
Lu Jin.

193
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,879
Mr. Lu.

194
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,240
Mr. Lu.

195
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,120
Will he go back to the hotel?

196
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,360
I don’t know.

197
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,039
But the deal has been signed.

198
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,039
Also now I’m in office.

199
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,360
I suppose

200
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,159
Mr. Lu must have something else to do.

201
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,399
You two know each other?

202
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,039
No.

203
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,879
Yes.

204
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,159
I’ve offended him before,

205
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,000
so...

206
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,120
It’s okay. I’m going back to work.

207
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,399
By the way,

208
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,240
you can’t keep anything from me.

209
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,240
Yeah, go ahead.

210
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,120
No showing off.

211
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,360
You know what?

212
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,759
The driver and the boss

213
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,360
seem to be going back to Switzerland.

214
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,080
The bad driver

215
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,840
will finally be getting out of my sight.

216
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,360
I’m so relieved.

217
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,240
Is he really leaving?

218
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:23,639
Yes.

219
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,000
I heard that

220
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,840
Lu Jin took a taxi for more than 10 hours

221
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,000
to come back from Zhuozhou.

222
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Meng Xinjie said when he washed the clothes,

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,240
he found something

224
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,879
like corn kernels.

225
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,240
He was covered in dust.

226
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,679
You can see how much he suffered

227
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,600
before he came here.

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,279
But Lu Jin,

229
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,360
I really do not understand.

230
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Kiss and run.

231
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,919
I scolded him.

232
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,879
What should I do?

233
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,399
Let me ask you.

234
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Do you like him?

235
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,639
I just

236
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,879
can’t bear to let him go.

237
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,360
If I think about this,

238
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,399
I just feel sad.

239
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,879
Lu Jin.

240
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,399
He’s old.

241
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,120
Garrulous.

242
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,960
Fussy.

243
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,639
Right.

244
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,000
He’s a bad sign for me.

245
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,120
Nothing good has happened since I met him.

246
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:28,919
But...

247
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,360
But...

248
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,879
What?

249
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,720
Keep him if you like him,
and let him go if you don’t.

250
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,519
I like him.

251
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,240
You like him?

252
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,240
Then pursue him.

253
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,759
What are you going to do?

254
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
The first prerequisite

255
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,639
is to keep him.

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,440
I think he could read your dishes?

257
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,600
Then you can

258
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,080
make a dish

259
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,080
that symbolizes love.

260
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,559
Before he gets on the plane,

261
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,240
you serve it to him.

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,399
It all depends on the dish.

263
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,759
Exciting?

264
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,240
Reliable?

265
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,679

The recipe of Witch’s Brew

290
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,200
is passed down by word of mouth

291
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,759
among Gipsy girls.

292
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,679
Every winter,

293
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,440
they set a pot

294
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,399
in which they put the ingredients
that their lovers like

295
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,559
and simmer with red wine.

296
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,679
So there’s no fixed recipe

297
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,759
for Witch’s Brew.

298
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,240
You put your love in the pot.

299
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,240
It’s called the Flavor Cipher between lovers.

300
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,480
Sorry.

301
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,639
I’ve made it clear.

302
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,480
Their flight will leave at 11 a.m.

303
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,679
So at 8 a.m., they’re leaving

304
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,919
his villa in Suhai.

305
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,480
I have sent the address to you.

306
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,759
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

307
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,240
Sir.

308
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240

309
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,600
Hurry up. Thanks.

310
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,000
Zhaodi.

311
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,440
Is it a right address?

312
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,839
There’s no one here.

313
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,960
I was just about to call you.

314
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,920
Things have changed.

315
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,079
They left early.

316
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,799
They’re probably getting to the airport by now.

317
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,599
Anyway, you still have time.

318
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,240

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,279

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,079
OK.

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,559

323
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,079
Why do you want to do that?

324
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,599
That’s a big deal.

325
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,440
It’s morning rush hour.

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,000

It has changed again.

353
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,839
They missed their flight,

354
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,440
and are heading to the high-speed rail station.

355
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,160
They’ll fly back to Switzerland from Hangzhou.

356
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,039

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,079

358
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:18,799

Lu Jin.

395
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,200
Good morning.

396
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,359
Li Man.

397
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,279
You’ve been

398
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,759
so secretive lately.

399
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,799
I’m not used to it.

400
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,480
I come to Suhai this time,

401
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,559
mainly to see

402
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,799
if Cheng Ziqian is qualified for this job.

403
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,359
I found the guy, and I’m responsible for him.

404
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,920
Then you should go to work.

405
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,599
What are you doing? Cooking?

406
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,799
Cooking

407
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,119
is just by the way.

408
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:02,680
I was wondering

409
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,400
if Mr. Lu would be interested in

410
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,880
tasting it.

411
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,200
Okay, I’m hungry anyway.

412
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,400
Thanks.

413
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,359
You’re welcome.

414
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,079
Witch’s Brew.

415
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,119
Any problems?

416
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,200
Is it proper for her to rush in like this?

417
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,039
It’s because Lu Jin didn’t live in Bauhinia.

418
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,319
She misses him.

419
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,200
She wants to give him a surprise.

420
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,559
Don’t be a shock.

421
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,759
If Boss knows

422
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,920
I secretly put her in,

423
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,880
he will kill me.

424
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,119
It’s a little inappropriate for me, isn’t it?

425
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,599
Surprise.

426
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,839
Your house is too big.

427
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,359
I looked around twice before I found you.

428
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,279
Mr. Lu.

429
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,599
Did you order takeout

430
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,680
to bring you a cake?

431
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,440
Let me make an introduction.

432
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,359
This is

433
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:02,359
a very good chef at Bauhinia.

434
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,200
She’s my deputy, Li Man.

435
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,359
Hello.

436
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:08,920
Hello.

437
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,880
You’re on behalf of the hotel to deliver the cake.

438
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
Wait a minute.

439
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,079
Just give me the cake, thanks.

440
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,559
Here you are.

441
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,759
I want to talk to you.

442
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,039
It’s been so long.

443
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:55,920
They became lovers, right?

444
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,640
I hope so.

445
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,519
Didn’t you two grow up together?

446
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,319
You can blame him before.

447
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,680
Why are you afraid of him?

448
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,759
I’ll do that if he is wrong.

449
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:06,519
But he didn’t do anything wrong.

450
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,400
He just fell in love.

451
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,799
Why should I blame him?

452
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,599
Our Shengnan

453
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,240
relies on effort of 1%

454
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,839
and luck of 99%.

455
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,359
Others can only envy, but cannot copy.

456
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,799
Admire.

457
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
This colleague.

458
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
If you have any problem, just say it.

459
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,640
If Mr. Lu can’t help you,

460
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,920
I can help you.

461
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,599
The sensor light in the corridor went out.

462
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,880
Well.

463
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,079
On behalf of

464
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,599
all the kitchen staff of Bauhinia Hotel,

465
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,559
I’d like to extend my best wishes to Mr. Lu.

466
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,119
We wish Mr. Lu

467
00:26:58,759 --> 00:26:59,880
good luck,

468
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,519
fruitfulness

469
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,480
and happiness.

470
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,880
Wait a minute.

471
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,119
Lu Jin.

472
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,319
I forgot to tell you.

473
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,960
Ms. Zheng asked you to give her a video call.

474
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,160
It’s urgent.

475
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,000
OK.

476
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,920
That’s enough.

477
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,920
You’ve cried all the way.

478
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,920
Almost no tears.

479
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,799
Come on.

480
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,000
Calm down.

481
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,440
You scared me.

482
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,400
Just say something.

483
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,319
Say.

484
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,640
I saw a woman

485
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,400
in Lu Jin’s room.

486
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,319
A woman?

487
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,000
Slept with him?

488
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,079
No, I don’t think so.

489
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,079
That’s okay.

490
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,599
That’s normal.

491
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,680
It was worse than that.

492
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,640
I saw Lu Jin

493
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,960
eat the food that the woman cooked for him.

494
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
Miss Gu, Miss Gu.

495
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,680
Miss Gu, I can’t follow you.

496
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,839
Where’s the woman from? What dishes?

497
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,240
She is...

498
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,000
She is...

499
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,839
Maybe Man Li?

500
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,480
It’s Li Man.

501
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,279
Sister, she’s beyond most people.

502
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,799
She’s our deputy general manager.

503
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,119
No wonder I feel overpowering.

504
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,400
She has temperament.

505
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,200
Shengnan.

506
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,960
What did that Li do to you?

507
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:40,960
She...

508
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,200
She thought I sent blessings to the hotel.

509
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,200
She gave me a red envelope.

510
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,160
Who wants that?

511
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,640
Angry.

512
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,319
So much.

513
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,720
Li Man, right?

514
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,680
Why did she come to Suhai?

515
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,160
You don’t know that?

516
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,119
Why?

517
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,839
You’ve sent so much information.

518
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,119
What do you mean?

519
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,359
What do you mean?

520
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:10,799
Well.

521
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,559
Miss Li had already come to Suhai.

522
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,599
Then she went to Zhuozhou

523
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:15,519
with Mr. Lu.

524
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,799
But she didn’t say anything about

525
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,720
going back to Suhai.

526
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,279
So you’re the snitch.

527
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,160
No.

528
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,640
I can’t help it.

529
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,079
You’re a traitor.

530
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,160
The point is that they have known

531
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,799
each other for more than ten years.

532
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,279
I’ve only been with Mr. Lu for a few years.

533
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,559
But I can assure you.

534
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:31,519
These years,

535
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,160
they’re not too close.

536
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,759
What about the last few years?

537
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,039
I don’t know that.

538
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
But I know

539
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,400
she is our chairman’s handpicked

540
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,759
favorite woman,

541
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,480
The favorite...

542
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,519
I think I’m late.

543
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
- I think I’m late. - Shut up.

544
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,759
I also saw...

545
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,039
I also saw

546
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,759
Lu Jin ate the Witch’s Brew she made.

547
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,519
Soup, soup is okay.

548
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:01,000
You can eat soup anywhere.

549
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,480
You know what?

550
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,400
It’s Witch’s Brew.

551
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,920
How could Lu Jin take

552
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Witch’s Brew made by other women?

553
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,240
All right, Shengnan.

554
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,839
You got your money back.

555
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,880
That’s

556
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
two months’ salary.

557
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:22,920
Jesus.

558
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:26,880
You

559
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,759
don’t quarrel with the money.

560
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,759
You put it there. I’ll pick it up.

561
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,920
It looks delicious.

562
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,119
You’re just in time.

563
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,319
I see you

564
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,200
haven’t eaten much all day.

565
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
I made it for you.

566
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,920
Wellington steak.

567
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,119
That’s right.

568
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,279
Thank you.

569
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,319
Did you change the ingredients?

570
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,400
No.

571
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,240
It’s exactly the same as before.

572
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,119
I’m not hungry today.

573
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,440
Maybe...

574
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,480
Maybe you’re too tired from work.

575
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,400
Well.

576
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,799
Why not having some dessert?

577
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,880
Also the hotel offered

578
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,559
a cake.

579
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,079
Are you interested in it?

580
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,039
OK.

581
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,000
Tortoise.

582
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,160
That’s not appropriate.

583
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,160
No.

584
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,279
The tortoise means

585
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,400
wish me long life.

586
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:43,079
Gu Shengnan is quite unique.

587
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,680
How did you know she was Gu Shengnan?

588
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:47,720
You

589
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,200
said that during the day.

590
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,200
When I lived in Bauhinia a while ago,

591
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,839
she almost became my personal chef,

592
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,440
surprising me from time to time.

593
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,200
She’s a really good cook.

594
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,160
Would you like to try it, too?

595
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,119
I lose weight at night.

596
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,119
I forgot to tell you.

597
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,839
When I came to Suhai this time,

598
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,200
Ms. Zheng specifically told me that

599
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,799
Bauhinia Hotel

600
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,599
had been upgraded for a long time.

601
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,880
She asked me to have a look at its operation.

602
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,240
All Right, I’ll keep you company.

603
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,880
OK.

604
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,759
Let’s do it tomorrow.

605
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:38,759
OK.

606
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,480
Does my mother doubt me?

607
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,599
Of course not.

608
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,599
You should eat less sweet at night.

609
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,680
I’ll go to sleep.

610
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,759
Good night.

611
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,680
Good night.

612
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,119
Is there a trap?

613
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,400
Fussy Lu.

614
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,119
Li Man

615
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,119
makes soup for a man like Lu Jin.

616
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,599
French Cordon Bleu chef.

617
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,679
Who wouldn’t want to marry a woman like that?

618
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,679
Liar.

619
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:33,679
Liar Fussy Lu.

620
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:36,039
You said you would only eat food I make.

621
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,039
Liar.

622
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,980
= Fussy Lu =

623
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,559
I’m not getting into your fairy tales.

624
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,280
= No Admittance =

625
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,800
Mr. Lu and Miss Li of Zhenghong Group

626
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,320
inspect the hotel today

627
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,880
and come to the kitchen especially to see you.

628
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:27,760
Miss Li.

629
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,159
Let me make an introduction for you.

630
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,719
This is the only female chef

631
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,320
in our F&B,

632
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:34,320
Gu Shengnan.

633
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,199
She’s a very good chef.

634
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,079
When Mr. Lu lived in 1123,

635
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,159
it was because of her

636
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,320
that Mr. Lu stayed.

637
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,760
I heard Mr. Lu always talked about her.

638
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,400
We met yesterday.

639
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,360
She delivered cake to Mr. Lu

640
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,679
on behalf of F&B.

641
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,920
I asked her to represent Bauhinia

642
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,320
to wish Mr. Lu a successful acquisition.

643
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:02,920
Thanks.

644
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:04,599
Let’s call it a day.

645
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,719
Thanks for your hard work.

646
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,480
Mr. Lu.

647
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,920
I am a little bit hungry.

648
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,280
How about eating in Bauhinia?

649
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,719
Well, Miss Li

650
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,199
must be hungry. I will arrange the meal.

651
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,039
Don’t prepare specially.

652
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,599
Everyone praises this chef so much.

653
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,199
Could you please do that for us?

654
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:06,239
It’s delicious.

655
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,360
Won’t you eat it?

656
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:12,119
I’m no longer hungry now.

657
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,440
I wasn’t hungry, but now I’m getting hungrier.

658
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:27,760
Gu Shengnan.

659
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,760
Gu Shengnan, hurry up.

660
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Miss Li wants to see you.

661
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,119
Why?

662
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,920
I’m sure it’s meant to be a compliment.

663
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,119
Let’s go, hurry up.

664
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,000
Go.

665
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,000
Are you done?

666
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,679
Miss Li, Mr. Lu.

667
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,599
Our Chef Gu is here.

668
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,800
I invited you here

669
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,239
to talk to you about

670
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,880
Wellington steak.

671
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,440
I’m a little curious as to

672
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:04,760
why you replaced the little russet mushroom

673
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,440
between the pastry and the beef

674
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,199
with the shiitake mushroom?

675
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,199
Because it tastes good.

676
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,440
I took a taste.

677
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:12,559
The taste

678
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:13,880
is special.

679
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,039
But it doesn’t make it right.

680
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,440
You put the local shiitake mushroom

681
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:22,320
and Australian imported Filet together.

682
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,559
they match?

683
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:30,119
I don’t know.

684
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:32,199
I just think it’s good.

685
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,679
That’s just subjective assumption.

686
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,039
There are objective standard for suitability.

687
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:41,480
The objective standard

688
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,559
is not my own words.

689
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,599
It’s through countless attempts,

690
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:47,239
countless adjustments, countless tastings,

691
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,239
and finally received worldwide recognition

692
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,880
and unified implementation.

693
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,440
For example, Almas Caviar

694
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:56,760
and Chardonnay are a perfect match.

695
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,679
If you put caviar

696
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,559
and Erguotou together,

697
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,920
they match?

698
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:05,800
I know

699
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,119
you want to innovate.

700
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:07,800
Every chef

701
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,480
wants to have his own creative dishes.

702
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:12,559
But it doesn’t mean you can mess around.

703
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,920
You can be creative.

704
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,360
But you have to choose

705
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,360
imported ingredients that match the standard.

706
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,880
Such a simple truth.

707
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,000
You didn’t learn it in school?

708
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,800
I forgot to ask.

709
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,039
Which school did you graduate from?

710
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,599
Miss Li.

711
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,920
Our Chef Gu

712
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,239
is well-educated.

713
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,239
She studied in Le Cordon Bleufor.

714
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:35,719
I also studied in

715
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,920
Le Cordon Bleufor a while.

716
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,199
We’re schoolmates.

717
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:39,159
Which year were you in?

718
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,440
Li Man, that’s enough.

719
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,559
We’re not schoolmates.

720
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,920
I have never been to Paris.

721
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,440
I was in the Shanghai campus.

722
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,159
I know nothing about the rest.

723
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,800
But my teacher taught me that

724
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,199
freshness is the most important thing.

725
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,039
Local shiitake mushroom is much younger

726
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,559
than russet mushroom.
