Excuse me, the man left

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,959
and this woman gave me 400 yuan.

What’s happening?

24
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,439
Fussy Lu.

25
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,959
What are you doing here?

26
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,480
What is your trick this time?

27
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,479
Come on, let’s have a chat.

28
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,960
Come on.

29
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,599
Private visit.

30
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:25,960
Business.

31
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,319
Can’t I come for business?

32
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,960
And I’ve told you many times,

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,719
do not call me Fussy Lu.

34
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,039
Private visit.

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,719
Am I that easy to be deceived?

36
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,840
Have you been tailing me for a whole day?

37
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,960
What are you trying to do?

38
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,840
I haven't asked you.

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,240
You said you’d have a training class.

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,159
But why have you got a date with a man?

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,840
Trifler. Shiftless.

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,599
Having a training class or not, with whom,

43
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,000
or dating with people.
These are my own business.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,080
What do they have to do with you?

45
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,360
You are unqualified, you know?

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Of course I am qualified, because I...

47
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,199
Because...

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,560
Because...

49
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,800
Because...

50
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,039
Of what?

51
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,919
There is no cotton in the cotton candy.

52
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,199
The cheap and nasty saccharin
is too sweet.

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,560
It’s disgusting.

54
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:35,960
Never mind.

55
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,199
I’m too tired after a whole day’s playing

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,159
to argue with you.

57
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,919
Don’t leave.

58
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,719
I haven’t finished yet.

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,680
You like archery, then I can practice it.

60
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,080
You like photography, and I can learn it.

61
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,719
Would you please not date other men?

62
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,159
I’ll go with you.

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,480
Lu Jin,

64
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,800
do you like me?

65
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,199
Yes.

66
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,959
That’s him.

67
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,800
It’s really him.

68
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,800
This is Mr. Lu Jin,
president of Zhenghong Group.

69
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,959
Mr. Lu, please give your advice.

70
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,360
We will correct it.

71
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,480
Mr. Lu, would you tell us if you have

72
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,079
any investment plan during your visit?

73
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:03,959
That’s right.

74
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,560
You can tell us
if you have any suggestions.

75
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,160
Mr. Lu.

76
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,600
Mr. Lu, you can give us

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,800
any orders you want.

78
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,240

You are late again.

107
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,519
Look, Mr. Yu.

108
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,759
It’s just nine o’clock now.

109
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,279
See?

110
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,079
Everyone arrives at eight.

111
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
If you all come at nine o’clock,

112
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,560
it’ll be hard for the kitchen to operate.

113
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,439
But the working time...

114
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,319
Miss Gu.

115
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,360
Let’s devein the prawns.

116
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,319
Wait.

117
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,000
Trumpet.

118
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,439
You should be the one to devein.

119
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,079
Last time, she didn’t do that well,

120
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
and I had to let another one rework.

121
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,040
In that case,

122
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,759
we will get complaints from the customers.

123
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,879
Mr. Yu.

124
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,639
You can just tell me

125
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,759
if you are picking on me.

126
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,639
You have someone backing you.

127
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,639
I dare not to be picking on you.

128
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,959
What do you mean?

129
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,120
You've always asked me to peel Chinese yam

130
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,120
or to cut onions.

131
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,079
Do you think I have to put up with you

132
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,959
if I have someone backing me?

133
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,430
- Fine.
- Gu Shengnan.

134
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,279
What are you yelling for
in the early morning?

135
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,600
Who is bothering you this time?

136
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,800
Manager Shen.

137
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,439
Everyone, attention please.

138
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,279
Mr. Cheng has something

139
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,959
to announce.

140
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:31,040
President of Zhenghong Group
that bought our hotel

141
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,879
will come to visit in a few days.

142
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,079
One of his important tests

143
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,879
is the skill of our chefs.

144
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,759
Manager Shen and I made a decision.

145
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,879
And it’s also for satisfying

146
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,480
the higher demand of our customers.

147
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,040
After the visit,

148
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,959
we will pick a new chief.

149
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,560
Mr. Yu has always been the chief.

150
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,279
Do we need to pick a new one?

151
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
You are taking it
as a presidential election.

152
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,560
If we have to select one,

153
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,439
I’d vote for Mr. Yu.

154
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,680
Gu Shengnan.

155
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,120
And Mr. Yu.

156
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,639
Um.

157
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,800
No, it’s not like that.

158
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,759
This time,

159
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,040
the election is different.

160
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,480
You've chosen the one in advance.

161
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,800
Bauhinia

162
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
is different now.

163
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,800
Now Mr. Cheng is the leader.

164
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,319
Let’s talk about something real.

165
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
All of you,

166
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,199
prepare a new menu next Monday.

167
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,559
No qualification, but ability only.

168
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,879
We will have an open election

169
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,720
to decide whose menu will be used

170
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,639
in the banquet of the chairman.

171
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,639
The one made the menu
will be our new chief.

172
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,559
Any problem?

173
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,279
Can I?

174
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,120
Every chef can participate in the contest.

175
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,519
Can I waive?

176
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,840
OK.

177
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,320
Well,

178
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
keep it up.

179
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,039
Good luck!

180
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,163
Hello?

181
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:32,746
Hello.

182
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,039
It’s me.

183
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,120
What’s it?

184
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,919
When will you get off work?

185
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,279
It won’t be early.

186
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,279
What is the matter?

187
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,559
Can you get off work earlier?

188
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,200
I’ll wait for you at home for dinner.

189
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,720
I will try.

190
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,226
OK. Hello?

191
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,283
Hello?

192
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,200
Miss Gu.

193
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,799
You are still here?

194
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,240
You can go first.
I will think of the dishes.

195
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:24,639
All right.

196
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,120
= Hungry? =

197
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,639
= Yes. =

198
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,919
= Come and try my new dish. =

199
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,060
= Oh. =

200
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,840
No.

201
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,639
It’s not easy to make that.

202
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,120
Don’t just waste it.

203
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,000
You got here fast.

204
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:02,000
I’m afraid you’ll waste the food.

205
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,559
You’re afraid it won't taste good
if it gets cold. Am I right?

206
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,000
I’ve respected food all the time.

207
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,639
There will be a chef contest in the hotel.

208
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,080
We need to design our own dishes.

209
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,360
This is my first staple.

210
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,399
Wellington steak.

211
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,080
I am not that mean.

212
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,480
I’m just trying to prove

213
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,120
my decision is right.

214
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,559
Freshness is always
the first standard for food.

215
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,480
Wellington steak

216
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,120
is a dish

217
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,559
that can test the skill

218
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,120
of western chefs.

219
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
It is covered with a layer of crackling,

220
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,639
and you won’t know the degree of cooking.

221
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,679
So it’s hard to control the heat.

222
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,039
If it’s too long,

223
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,919
the meat will become old.

224
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,519
If it’s too short,

225
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,480
the inner part is still raw.

226
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,799
You won’t know if you succeed or not

227
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,759
until you cut it.

228
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,639
The difficulty is

229
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,679
you have the recipe but no rules.

230
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,759
So

231
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,879
it all depends on
the feelings of the chef.

232
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,360
Good.

233
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,080
Gastronome.

234
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,360
Then please have a try

235
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,519
and check if the steak is good or not.

236
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,360
Sounds good.

237
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,159
How is it?

238
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,480
Great!

239
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,360
I’m not asking about your feelings,

240
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,799
but your mom,

241
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,639
Ms. Zheng’s.

242
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,519
My mom?

243
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,960
Abalone with oyster Broth.

244
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,639
I haven’t eaten

245
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,879
and slept well

246
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,360
these few days.

247
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,639
I’m a bit tired.

248
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,480
I’m feeling tired.

249
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
I see, Mr. Lu.

250
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,360
Take a good rest.

251
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,600
Then tell me

252
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,480
what Ms. Zheng likes, okay?

253
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,519
Will we have some desserts later?

254
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,799
You want desserts?

255
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,639
It seems I heard some kind of impatience

256
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,879
from your tone.

257
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,080
Did I?

258
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,440
No, no, no. Not that.

259
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,200
I mean I will make it for you soon.

260
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,440
That’s good.

261
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,320
From my point of view,

262
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,000
all your dishes today

263
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,799
are perfect!

264
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,480
However...

265
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,879
What?

266
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
However,

267
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,320
asking me to try your dishes

268
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,200
means you are cheating.

269
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,559
It’s like you are asking the teacher

270
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:27,240
to make up missed lessons
for you before the exam.

271
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,320
Right?

272
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,240
Among all teachers,

273
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,360
I know my mom the best.

274
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,919
But Mr. Lu,

275
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,799
if you don't teach me,

276
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,000
I will have to fail.

277
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,919
In that case,

278
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
I will be suppressed by Mr. Yu.

279
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:47,240
Maybe I will be forced to quit the job

280
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,879
and then never recover.

281
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,919
A young female chef’s life

282
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,919
will then be ruined.

283
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,679
Can you stand it?

284
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,240
You can’t accept it, right?

285
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,200
Sure, I will help you.

286
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,119
But you have to look like a student

287
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,000
since you are learning now, right?

288
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,240
Sir.

289
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,200
Do I look like a student now?

290
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,240
Could you stay at a distance?

291
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,559
OK, sir.

292
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,880
Is it that serious?

293
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,559
Give me

294
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,799
some wine, please.

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,920
One glass will be OK.

296
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,759
Whatever the wine is.

297
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,920
Enough.

298
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,200
It’s amazing.

299
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:13,440
Um.

300
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,759
Anything else you'll be needing?

301
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,480
I think it’s OK.

302
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,480
I think so.

303
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,079
Let’s get right to the point.

304
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,200
OK.

305
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,839
So do you mean the dishes are not fine

306
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,240
or they don’t taste good

307
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,759
by saying the dishes are not perfect?

308
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,640
I said they’re imperfect

309
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,680
because the dishes you made

310
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,519
are too perfect.

311
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,160
They are both delicious and good-looking.

312
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,039
In other words,

313
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,079
they meet the standard
of a Michelin-starred

314
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,720
hotel restaurant.

315
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,839
Isn’t it good?

316
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,680
Successful people like Ms. Zheng

317
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,480
strives for the perfection
of dishes very much.

318
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,160
But nothing

319
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,880
in the world is perfect.

320
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,200
My

321
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,000
mom divorced my father

322
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,480
when I was little.

323
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,680
Then my father

324
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,519
abandoned us

325
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:16,960
without leaving us a penny.

326
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,519
So my mom

327
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:21,400
started her business

328
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,559
with the only savings left

329
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,480
step by step.

330
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,440
Then she founded Zhenghong Group.

331
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:30,920
And now,

332
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,079
many years later,

333
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,599
she runs Zhenghong Group so successfully.

334
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,279
She’s an able woman
in other people’s eyes.

335
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,200
She’s excellent, but

336
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,799
nobody can understand her sufferings.

337
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,559
From a nobody to a successful person,

338
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,920
it’s really not easy.

339
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,839
In order to succeed,

340
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,279
she used to be low-down

341
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,920
and ruthless, too.

342
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,440
As a human,

343
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:09,759
nobody is perfect.

344
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,880
I can’t believe your mom has such a story.

345
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,839
No matter how perfect the dish is,

346
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,839
if it doesn’t have

347
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,000
a taste that can really

348
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,640
make people touched,

349
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,839
it will become meaningless.

350
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,599
I seem to understand.

351
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,839
OK. That’s all I can teach you.

352
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,240
You should comprehend it yourself
for the rest.

353
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Wish you success.

354
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,359
Wish me success.

355
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,720
I’m finished. Let’s go home.

356
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,359
On the way...

357
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:52,960
Hey.

358
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,920
Boss, listen to me.

359
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,440
The houses here are too old

360
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,480
and the sound insulation effect
is not good.

361
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,720
Will you be able to sleep well here?

362
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,799
Didn’t you find that

363
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,440
this place is amazing?

364
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,000
It can make people feel peaceful and easy.

365
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,240
I can’t feel that.

366
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
I just feel I would certainly
be very anxious

367
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,440
if I live here.

368
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,359
I would think about

369
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,759
what should I do

370
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,039
to leave this place.

371
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:16,799
It’s too old.

372
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,039
You are right.

373
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,640
You are lacking this kind of anxiety.

374
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,039
Maybe I can rent one for you near here

375
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,519
so that the environment
can urge you to work hard.

376
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,440
No, that’s not necessary.

377
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,400
I’m afraid this kind of environment

378
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,039
can’t urge me to work hard.

379
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,000
What can help

380
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,279
is only the villa like yours.

381
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:35,519
Deadwood.

382
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,319
Layman.

383
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Never mind.

384
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,880
Give it to me.

385
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,440
Do you remember the code?

386
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,480
Your birthday.

387
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,000
I’ll never forget it.

388
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,759
I will drop the card to you from upstairs.

389
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,039
I have the card.

390
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,039
Don’t bother.

391
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,400
Just enjoy living here.

392
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,640
Kind reminder.

393
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,240
It won’t be too long.

394
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,880
The chairman will return soon.

395
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,559
Before she’s back,

396
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,880
you may live here

397
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,480
as long as you can.

398
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,000
OK.

399
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,480
See you then.

400
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,000
Call me if you need anything.

401
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,359
Enjoy.

402
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,000
Manager Cheng.

403
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,799
Mr. Lu.

404
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:36,640
You are just back?

405
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,759
What a coincidence.

406
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,680
We meet here again.

407
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,759
You are buying food yourself now?

408
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Looking for Gu Shengnan?

409
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,480
Yes.

410
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,400
She’s not in.

411
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,720
She went out.

412
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,200
In the early morning,

413
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,480
she left with a big bag.

414
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,480
I don't think she will return very soon.

415
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,759
No need to wait.

416
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,200
I will help you give this to her.

417
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:09,519
Mr. Lu.

418
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,440
Ziqian.

419
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,400
Shengnan.

420
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,559
What are you doing here?

421
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,119
You went out, didn't you?

422
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,680
Went out?

423
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,119
No.

424
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,759
I’m taking a day off, so I’m back.

425
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,119
Who said that?

426
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,920
You are an adult.

427
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,880
Don’t you think that’s childish?

428
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,400
I made a mistake.

429
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,920
I saw a person really like you

430
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,359
left this place

431
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,839
with a big bag.

432
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:37,759
And, here.

433
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,680
Nonsense, that’s Old Zhang.

434
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,559
Will Old Zhang wear this?

435
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,680
Is it normal?

436
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,680
And I...

437
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,160
You may go upstairs first.
I’ll buy some vinegar.

438
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:49,960
You may go upstairs first.

439
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
I’m getting in, too.

440
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,400
Look carefully.

441
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,759
Let me divide it for you.

442
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,079
Mr. Lu. You are my boss.

443
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,759
But we are not in Bauhinia Hotel now.

444
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,279
What do you want to say?

445
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,680
Shengnan and I grew up

446
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
together.

447
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,559
That’s in the past.

448
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:52,400
I’m the only one
in Shengnan’s future life.

449
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,279
Will you live in her neighborhood forever?

450
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,680
Since I’m here,

451
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,000
you will never get a chance.

452
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,880
You two are

453
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,759
taking a fancy to each other?

454
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,039
Eat.

455
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,400
It’s fine.

456
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,559
It’s fine.

457
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,759
Don't you eat?

458
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,759
Right now.

459
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:04,640
Eat.

460
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Hey, try this.

461
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,400
What are you doing?

462
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,279
We want the same piece of cake.

463
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,319
But I still like

464
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,799
the one you cut for me.

465
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,480
You use a fork to eat the cake?

466
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,319
I used my hand to eat it
when I was abroad.

467
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,000
Take a big bite.

468
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,759
Big one.

469
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,599
