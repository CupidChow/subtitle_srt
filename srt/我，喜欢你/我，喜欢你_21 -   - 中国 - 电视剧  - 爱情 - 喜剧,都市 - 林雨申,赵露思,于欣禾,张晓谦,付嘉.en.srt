I told you not to go.

You asked for it.

So charming! Lu Jin is so charming!

You didn’t see

how he works.

And how he talks.

Don’t say sorry to me.

00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,159
I hate this word.

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,919
If you say sorry,

32
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,639
I have to pretend to be very forgiving

33
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,680
and think for you.

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,599

Don’t insult me

with my tolerance to you.

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,360
He is so charming!

38
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,879
Be cool, Mrs. Lu.

39
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,879
Mrs. Lu?

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,639
So?

00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,199
So,

42
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,439
I plan to

43
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,639
change my look.

44
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,080
Are you gonna change your head?

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,400
No, no, no.

46
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,280
I want to be the woman behind him,

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
to love him,

48
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,400
tolerate him,

49
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,039
and understand him.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,199
Let’s begin.

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,960
Okay.

53
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,439
Mingting Group has just reached
a cooperation agreement

54
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,159
with Wayne Hotel on the re-planning

55
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,080
and construction of Sinan Villa District.

56
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,560
Lu Mingting is flying to France next week

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,800
to attend the signing ceremony.

58
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,479
If this cooperation is really achieved,

59
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,560
Mingting will get back to life.

60
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,159
They can stabilize the creditors

61
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,039
with this project.

62
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,840
Not to mention Huimin Bank,

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,599
other banks will be happy

64
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,680
to give them financial support.

65
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,560
So,

66
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,879
the risk assessment department suggested

67
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,199
that we can retreat now

68
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,879
to reduce unnecessary risks.

69
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,879
What did you say?

70
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,840
Retreat?

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,719
Do you know

72
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,719
how much we spent

73
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,080
on this project?

74
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,400
We work countless days

75
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,680
and nights for this project

76
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,439
and now you want us to retreat?

77
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,719
Do you want us to give it up

78
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,680
so all of our efforts go in vain?

79
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,919
Yes.

80
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,280
Because previously

81
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,599
the PR department has announced that

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,039
Zhenghong is bound to take Mingting.

83
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,560
Giving it up now

84
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,599
will embarrass us all.

85
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,120
And once this news leaks out,

86
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,080
Zhenghong’s stock price
will drop inevitably.

87
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,560
How can we explain to the shareholders?

88
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,560
But if we continue to acquire,

89
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,960
we would spend

90
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,480
severalfold than expected.

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Even if you are willing to do so,

92
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,639
you won’t be able to take it.

93
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,360
As far as I know,

94
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,879
there is another buyer

95
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,639
who offers higher than us.

96
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,959
But that’s not important.

97
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,000
What’s important is,

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,680
if this project between them and Wayne

99
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,800
gets carried out smoothly,

100
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,920
Mingting is very likely to come alive,

101
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,040
and then it will not need to be acquired.

102
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,360
I’ll take this with a grain of salt.

103
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,800
I do not agree to retreat.

104
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,920
Ms. Li,

105
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,720
better now than late.

106
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Thanks, all of you.

107
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,120
Dismiss.

108
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,360
You stay.

109
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,639
Thanks.

110
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Help me find out where Jenny is now.

111
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,439
The youngest daughter of Wayne’s owner?

112
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,480
Jenny.

113
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,199
Okay, I see.

114
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,920
She’s on vacation in Chiang Mai.

115
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,879
Perfect.

116
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,120
Book me a flight to Thailand now,

117
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,920
and send me her address

118
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,120
and contact info.

119
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,839
I will go with you.

120
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,560
No need.

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,680
I can go by myself.

122
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,319
You got more important things to do.

123
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,399
You need to

124
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,120
check the background of the other buyer.

125
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,720
Check it thoroughly.

126
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:40,920
Don’t worry.

127
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,040
Mingting won’t have its way with Wayne.

128
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,040
The acquisition goes on as planned.

129
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,839
I will take Mingting

130
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,920
at a proper price.

131
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,100
= Inpatient Department =

132
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,839
What’s wrong?

133
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Wayne Group has

134
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,199
terminated the cooperation unilaterally.

135
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,160
How did that happen?

136
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,480
Wayne’s president’s wife

137
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,120
promised to help us.

138
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,920
Besides,

139
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
she has a say in Wayne.

140
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,839
I gambled on the wrong person.

141
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,079
The successor of Wayne is not her.

142
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,600
It’s Jenny, the president’s
youngest daughter.

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,639
I just learned about it.

144
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,720
This Jenny

145
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,399
antagonized her stepmother for everything.

146
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,639
Lu Jin

147
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,079
went to Thailand and talked with Jenny.

148
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,839
He cut off our plan.

149
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,839
Lu Jin, again.

150
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,439
What should we do now?

151
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,720
Lu Jin has burnt all our bridges.

152
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,720
I got nothing to do now.

153
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,120
We can only wait

154
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,399
to be acquired by Zhenghong.

155
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,199
I’m back.

156
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,160
Don’t worry.

157
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,920
Dad.

158
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Do we need to call the doctor?

159
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,560
You are sick.

160
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,879
You should stay calm.

161
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,639
Don’t get angry for petty things.

162
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,800
It’s no good to you.

163
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,480
Petty thing?

164
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,959
Where did you go?

165
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,399
I went to Shengnan’s food stall

166
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,879
and brought you some

167
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,480
boneless chicken feet.

168
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,399
It melts in your mouth. Have a try.

169
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,879
Gu Shengnan?

170
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,439
The girl

171
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,600
Lu Jin announced to be
his fiancée at the party?

172
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,040
I saw Zheng Hong’s face turn green.

173
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,879
I guess

174
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,199
she doesn’t like this daughter-to-be.

175
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,639
Wellington steak.

176
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,720
Miss Gu.

177
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,279
Uncle Lu, why are you here?

178
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,399
Do you have time?

179
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,079
I want to talk to you.

180
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
Sorry, I’m late.

181
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,159
Jin,

182
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,559
I want to have a talk with you.

183
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
Let’s go to another restaurant.

184
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,559
All right.

185
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,639
We talk alone.

186
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,320
I asked you to come over…

187
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,120
Jin,

188
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,679
I beg you to let go of

189
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,480
Mingting Group.

190
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,799
Beg?

191
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,039
How nice it sounds.

192
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,360
I’ve been waiting for this word
for thirty years.

193
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,879
But unfortunately,

194
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,399
I can’t help you.

195
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,120
Business is business.

196
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,159
Don’t refuse me so fast.

197
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,360
You want Mingting

198
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,080
not for business reasons,

199
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,120
I know

200
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,440
you and your mom

201
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,120
still hate me.

202
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,039
Yes, we do.

203
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,639
Where were you

204
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,440
when my mother was helpless?

205
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,600
Where were you

206
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,480
when I grew up

207
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,399
to be a man from a boy?

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,919
From then on,

209
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,039
I swore on one day that
I would surpass you

210
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,360
and become stronger than you.

211
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,600
And today,

212
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,639
I did it.

213
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,279
I’m proud of my mother.

214
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,879
Whether you admit it or not,

215
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,159
I’m still your father.

216
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,960
Mingting is everything of my life

217
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,879
and this is my last wish.

218
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,399
You only taught me one thing in my life,

219
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,159
ruthlessness.

220
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,639
I didn’t plan to come back at all.

221
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,399
Lu Mingting,

222
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,120
you are my father. I can’t change that.

223
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,440
But the only thing I can change is that

224
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,679
you will be looking up at me

225
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,840
for the rest of your life.

226
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,399
You only taught me one thing in my life,

227
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,960
ruthlessness.

228
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,360
But the only thing I can change is that

229
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,600
you will be looking up at me

230
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,799
for the rest of your life.

231
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,340
= Meng Xinjie =

232
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,080
Hello?

233
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,639
Can you talk to him?

234
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,360
He’s been beating the sandbag for an hour.

235
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Stop.

236
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,360
Lu Jin, stop it.

237
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,639
It’s okay.

238
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,720
Stop.

239
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,200
You are bleeding.

240
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,639
Go home.

241
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,279
Let’s go home, all right?

242
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:38,879
Sorry.

243
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,840
I’m sorry.

244
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,639
It’s my fault.

245

I’m sorry.

= Tomb of Lu Mingting =

269
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,759
Zheng,

270
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,359
we are

271
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,480
on each other now.

272
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,079
Remember what I said,

273
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,960
and what your dad told you before he died.

274
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,880
Mingting…

275
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,920
Dad.

276
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,160
What are you saying?

277
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,240
I dedicated…

278
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,480
my life to Mingting.

279
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,200
Don’t

280
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,559
let it

281
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,200
be ruined.

282
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,839
You have to

283
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,200
protect it.

284
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,400
Mr. Lu.

285
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,200
Come in.

286
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,839
Mr. Lu Jr. from Mingting Group

287
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,000
is waiting for you in the meeting room.

288
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,400
Okay.

289
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:34,279
Sit.

290
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,160
Sit down.

291
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
I asked them to make a coffee for you.

292
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,480
My favorite flavor.

293
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,880
Have a taste.

294
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,079
Jin,

295
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,960
I want to beg you for one thing…

296
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,359
About Mingting Group.

297
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,160
Tell me.

298
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,920
Mingting is Father’s life work,

299
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,039
can you leave it alone?

300
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,400
Lu Zheng,

301
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,559
I understand you.

302
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,200
But you need to

303
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,519
learn

304
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,319
not to count on someone else.

305
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,680
You have to act on your own.

306
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,519
Of course, not now.

307
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,680
Now you need to figure out two things.

308
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
First,

309
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:43,440
Mingting Group is facing
irreparable problems.

310
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,720
It’s like a worm-eaten apple

311
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,079
and is decaying

312
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,359
every second.

313
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,519
The only way to deal with it

314
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,759
is to dig out the rotten part.

315
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,519
And you don’t have the ability to do so.

316
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,160
Second,

317
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,279
never be emotional

318
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:04,160
in business.

319
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,880
Business is business.

320
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,640
There is no emotion.

321
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,680
So I can’t do it.

322
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,559
You can’t stop me buying Mingting.

323
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,759
Brother,

324
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
let go of Mingting.

325
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,759
I beg you.

326
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,839
If you are here

327
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,799
on behalf of Mingting Group,

328
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:43,480
I don’t like your attitude.

329
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,359
If you want to stop me,

330
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,079
do it on your own.

331
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,880
Prove it to me.

332
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,240
Show me what you can do.

333
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:20,920
Go back.

334
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,000
I know what you want.

335
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,759
Go back.

336
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,920
Jin.

337
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,359
I hope you can remember
what you said today.

338
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:13,960
I will.

339
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,880
Business is business.

340
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,559
There is no emotion.

341
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,680
You can’t stop me buying Mingting.

= Background Analysis of Mingting Group =

343
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,359
How long will it take this time?

344
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,119
I’ll be back as soon as I finish work.

345
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,119
So wait for me at home,

346
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,119
okay?

347
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,400
Are you not afraid

348
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,759
that I run away with someone else

349
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,640
when you are away?

350
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,440
Dare you do it.

351
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,279
What if I dare?

352
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,160
I beg you.

353
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,799
Don’t make a joke about this, all right?

354
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:17,839
I have arranged

355
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,359
everything during my absence,

356
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,119
including the food stall.
Don’t worry about it.

357
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,400
Just have fun at work.

358
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,200
Oh, right.

359
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,799
I almost forgot the most important thing.

360
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,000
Buy anything you like.

361
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,839
Promise me one thing,

362
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,480
don’t work overtime.

363
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,200
Okay.

364
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,599
Off you go.

365
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,160
Okay.

366
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,480
Forgot anything?

367
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,240
Yeah.

368
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,400
Mr. Lu,

369
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,119
Wayne has completely given us up.

370
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,680
Without Wayne’s intervention,

371
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,759
no bank is willing to

372
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,680
provide us with financial support.

373
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,960
Mingting is facing a huge funding gap.

374
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:47,680
If there is

375
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,680
no capital injection,

376
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,079
it will be difficult
to maintain daily operations.

377
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,319
I think

378
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,160
it’s not necessarily a bad thing
to be acquired,

379
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,039
at least we can count on Zhenghong.

380
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,160
Anyway,

381
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,480
a good tree is a good shelter.

382
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,160
Director Kong,

383
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,880
you don’t know Zhenghong Group.

384
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,160
Companies acquired by them

385
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,880
will be split and sold

386
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:18,079
if not meet their assessment requirements.

387
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,440
At that time, you, me,

388
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,160
and everyone here,

389
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,839
are gonna lose our jobs.

390
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,660
= Entry point Zhang Yimin =
= Taiyue Property =

391
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,839
Zheng, what are you looking at?

392
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,480
Mom,

393
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,480
why are you here?

394
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,480
Why didn’t you call me?

395
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,640
What are these on the wall?

396
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,200
Show me.

397
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,079
Mom,

398
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,319
just leave it.

399
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,440
Why are you here

400
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,759
at this dirty and messy place?

401
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,119
Why not go shopping or do SPA

402
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,559
with your neighbors and friends?

403
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,480
Zheng,

404
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,920
are you hiding something from me?

405
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,440
You haven’t been home for days.

406
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,319
Are you busy with these stuffs?

407
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,319
It’s okay, Mom. Don’t worry about me.

408
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,599
I will go home today, OK?

409
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
Believe me, I will take care of it.

410
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:45,599
Lu Zheng.

411
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,160
Zhang Yimin.

412
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,480
It’s been a long time.

413
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,599
Yeah, long time.

414
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,759
You look much better

415
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,160
and more handsome than you were in school.

416
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:57,839
Please sit.

417
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,519
Lu Zheng,

418
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,720
I’m sorry about your father.

419
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,119
Chenxing and Mingting

420
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,960
have been working closely in recent years.

421
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,160
I happened to be

422
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,720
working on a project in South Africa
on the funeral day,

423
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,079
so I didn’t make it home.

424
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,279
I’m really sorry.

425
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,279
It’s okay.

426
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,599
My father got a heart issue for many years

427
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,640
and we had been prepared for it.

428
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:23,640
Yimin,

429
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,640
I asked you here

430
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:26,960
to do me a favor.

431
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,319
Tell me.

432
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,519
You know

433
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,279
Taiyue Property?

434
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,960
Of course.

435
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:36,400
Taiyue and our company are working

436
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,640
on a Southeast Asian Resort project.

437
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
This is the project.

438
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:44,720
You know,

439
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,759
Taiyue is controlled by me now.

440
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,119
I want to sign a guarantee agreement

441
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,880
with Chenxing in the name of Taiyue,

442
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
with Mingting Group as the guarantor.

443
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,599
Here is the agreement. Take a look.

444
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,759
I don’t understand

445
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,079
why are you doing this?

446
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,599
Mingting

447
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,960
is one of the shareholders
of Taiyue Property,

448
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,160
but it’s not necessary to undertake

449
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,839
such a harsh guarantee for Taiyue.

450
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:17,079
Once this agreement is signed,

451
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,519
any problem happens to Taiyue,

452
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,480
Mingting might have to be sold
to make it up.

453
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,839
Promise me you will help,

454
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,400
I’ll explain to you later.

455
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:28,880
All right?

456
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Sure.

457
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,200
This agreement

458
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,400
does no harm to us.

459
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,319
And

460
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,519
it’s a double assurance.

461
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
I got no reason

462
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,279
to say no to this.

463
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,880
I’ll ask my secretary to send you
the formal agreement later.

464
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,279
Okay.

465
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,060
= Director Xiang =

466
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,200
I’ll leave you to your business then.

467
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,279
See you.

468
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,799
Lu Jin is heading to Vancouver.

469
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,240
He wants to acquire Mingting

470
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,039
through the Vancouver branch.

471
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,880
Zhenghong Group is reaching the company’s

472
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,279
small and medium shareholders

473
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:14,279
and trying to acquire
their shares secretly.

474
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Many of the shareholders are worrying that

475
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,519
the group will not be able
to handle the debt problem,

476
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,160
and have reached an equity
transfer intention with Zhenghong.

477
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,559
The directors want to know

478
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,519
if you have any countermeasures.

479
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,319
No.

480
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:25,839
Let them take it.

481
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,599
It’s pretty good.

482
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,839
Keep it going.

483
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,839
In Mingting Group,

484
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:51,839
Lu Zheng owns 33% of the shares,

485
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:54,079
his mother Lin Lijun owns 8%,

486
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,160
and other shareholders own 59%.

487
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,599
Zhenghong has acquired

488
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,519
42% of the shares.

489
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,599
We will keep trying,

490
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,839
or reach an agreement

491
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,880
with other small and medium shareholders

492
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,400
to get their voting rights.

493
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,519
Next, we only need to convene

494
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,640
a general meeting of shareholders
to reorganize the board of directors,

495
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,079
and then we will take Mingting.

496
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Do you want me to arrange

497
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,519
the general meeting on next Monday?

498
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,319
Not in a hurry.

499
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,720
What is Lu Zheng up to lately?

500
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,839
The project team said

501
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,160
that Mingting has given up struggling.

502
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,480
Your brother Lu Zheng

503
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,720
doesn’t seem to care about this.

504
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,640
Maybe he just

505
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,960
got nothing to do.

506
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,519
A major shareholder who owns

507
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,279
41 percent of the shares

508
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
got nothing to do?

509
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:47,839
I don’t think so.

510
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,039
What’s on your mind?

511
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,279
Set up a special team

512
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,519
to check these two

513
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,839
companies for me.

514
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,759
Taiyue Group and Chenxing Holdings.

515
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,200
Shall we continue?

516
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,960
Of course.

517
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
As planned.

518
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,319
What brought you here?

519
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,079
I feel bored

520
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,680
at home.

521
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,200
Wanna find someone to talk.

522
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,359
Are you busy?

523
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,720
Did I disturb you?

524
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,319
No.

525
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,920
I got no shift today.

526
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,279
You came so early.

527
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,319
Had breakfast?

528
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,680
It’s twelve o’clock now.

529
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,200
Twelve o’clock.

530
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,359
Would you like to have lunch together?

531
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:53,839
All right.

532
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
You go in.

533
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,319
I’ll go throw the trash.

534
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,079
I’ll go with you.

535
00:33:58,599 --> 00:33:59,440
Okay.

536
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Have more.

537
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,359
Help yourself.

538
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,079
Sorry.

539
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,239
I didn’t go to Uncle Lu’s funeral.

540
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,840
You know,

541
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,679
your relationship with Lu Jin,

542
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,559
and you two families…

543
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Shengnan, don’t.

544
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,079
I understand.

545
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,320
Because of the competition
between Zhenghong and Mingting,

546
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,960
my brother and I are getting
more and more distant.

547
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,800
Actually, I have a wish in my heart.

548
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,599
I hope the grievance

549
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,840
in our last generation could end,

550
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,599
especially after my father passed away.

551
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,000
I hope I got a kinfolk by my side.

552
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,320
I hope Lu Jin…

553
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,960
I hope Lu Jin

554
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,000
can admit me as his brother.

555
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,079
I know.

556
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,079
Don’t worry.

557
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,960
Leave it to me.

558
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,719
I will help you realize it.

559
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,760
Lu Jin is a person

560
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,440
who is cautious in everything.

561
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,639
There is no reason not trusting
his own brother, right?

562
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:34,920
Shengnan,

563
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,719
thanks for your help.

564
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,199
I really appreciate it.

565
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,199
But I don’t want

566
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,199
my brother to know this.

567
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:47,360
I haven’t achieved anything yet.

568
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,559
I want to make some achievements.

569
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:53,599
I guess…

570
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,480
I guess at that time,

571
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,000
my brother would think much of me.

572
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,000
Okay.

573
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,719
Hurry up and eat.

What’s wrong?

575
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,320
Nothing.

576
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,719
Good.

577
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,079
Eat some vegetables.

578
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,559
Do you feel hot?

579
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,480
What’s wrong?

580
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,320
What’s wrong with you?

583

Take a good rest.

584
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:23,840
Stay here for one night for observation,

585
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,079
and you can be discharged tomorrow.

586
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,800
Remember, never contact allergens again.

587
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,719
Thanks.

588
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,599
Seriously, what is your problem?

589
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,679
You’re allergic to crabs. Why ate them?

590
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,599
You made it for me.

591
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,960
Are you out of your mind?

592
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,239
It’s okay.

593
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,599
I’m not absolutely allergic to crabs.

594
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,000
Sometimes I am,

595
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,960
but sometimes I’m fine.

596
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,960
I’ve been in bad luck lately.

597
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,719
My dad is gone.

598
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,480
All my mom does is nagging and weeping.

599
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,800
I finally

600
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,320
had a chance to eat crabs

601
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,480
but got allergic.

602
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,559
It’s okay. Everything will get better.

603
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:14,960
Don’t worry.

604
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
You are my little brother now.

605
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,119
I got your back.

606
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,599
I think I’m older than you.

In seniority,

608
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,320
I am your sister-in-law.

I am older than you.

610
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,199
Yeah, right.

611
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,039
All right. Have some rest.
