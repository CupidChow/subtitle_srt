I’ll not add Lu Zheng’s WeChat.

Next time? What’s wrong with you?

Naughty girl.

25
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,199
Did you see it?

26
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,439
Someone is conducting a rite downstairs.

27
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,560
There is a big Eight Diagrams.

28
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,080
Do you think

29
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,639
there is something wrong
with geomancy of our company?

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,159
Let’s go down and have a look.

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,960
I’m in bad luck lately.

32
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,000
Let’s see how the master does it,

33
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,919
and ask for some amulets.

34
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,919
Yeah, I need an amulet too.

35
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,680
Right.

36
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,319
Let’s go.

37
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,919
Go. Hurry up.

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,479
Before he leaves.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
What?

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,759
This is no Eight Diagrams.

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,080
There are no dots.

42
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,560
He’s not conducting a rite.

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,439
Red roses and white roses.

44
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,199
Excuse me.

45
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,360
It’s like a two-flavor

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,639
hot pot.

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,719
Who is this guy?

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
Celine,

49
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,159
isn’t he the guy who drove Maserati

50
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,360
to pick you up last time?

51
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,639
Xu Zhaodi,

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,479
I heard

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,319
the story of hot pot from you that day.

54
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,719
You said you couldn’t afford hot pot

55
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
when you were little.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,719
Your mom added some salt
in the water to make it hot pot base.

57
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,120
And put Chinese cabbages,

58
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,800
small cabbages,

59
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,400
round cabbages,

60
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,360
milk cabbages and something like that.

61
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,639
So today

62
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,479
I made a bunch of flowers

63
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,120
with beef rolls

64
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,639
for the loveliest you.

65
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,759
Please marry me.

66
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,960
Marry him.

67
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,360
I hope our future

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,319
can be as flavorous

69
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,199
as the hot pot.

70
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,960
Okay.

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,080
Zhaodi.

72
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,000
Why did she leave?

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,960
Zhaodi.

74
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,000
Too excited.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,759
She’s shy.

76
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,400
Zhaodi.

77
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,719
Sir, what else do you want to order?

78
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,439
Do you need anything else, sir?

79
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,720
Meng Xinjie,

80
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,439
you think

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,519
two people like each other

82
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,319
so they can be together?

83
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,439
What I wanted to say is,

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680
I grew up

85
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,560
in that environment,

86
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,439
now I left it.

87
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,079
And I never want to go back again.

88
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,839
Meng Xinjie,

89
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,839
I am not reconciled.

90
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,040
This is Lu Jin’s mom.

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,480
Hi, Ma’am.

92
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,720
What’s up?

93
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,160
Still call me Ma’am?

94
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,959
Time to make a change.

95
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,480
Um… Ms. Zheng.

96
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,240
What can I help you?

97
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,439
Nothing.

98
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,319
It’s a good day today.

99
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,199
I just want you to go out with me
to do some gardening.

100
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,920
Are you willing to do so?

101
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,319
Okay, sure.

102
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,000
I’ll be there right away.

103
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,879
The car is waiting for you downstairs.

104
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,800
Okay, give me a minute.

107
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,480
Ms. Zheng,

108
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,120
isn’t this also an industry
of Zhenghong Group?

109
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,480
No,

110
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,959
this is my private property.

111
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,560
You rich people’s world is surprising.

112
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,519
If you want to eat vegetables,

113
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,319
just buy them at the groceries.

114
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,399
Why bother to build your own greenhouse?

115
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,720
You know,

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,040
Lu Jin cares much about foods

117
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,120
and he is very particular
about the ingredients.

118
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,079
In order to let him

119
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,720
eat natural fresh vegetables,

120
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,120
I bought this field

121
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,519
to plant natural fresh vegetables

122
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,720
Lu Jin likes to eat.

123
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,480
But Lu Jin travels a lot

124
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,519
over the world,

125
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,720
he got very few times to eat at home.

126
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,000
As long as one day he lives at home,
I’ll cook him for one day.

127
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,759
You know my son

128
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,040
is working really hard outside.

129
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
So I try to provide him

130
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,439
with the best food and clothing.

131
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,639
Especially the dishes

132
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,279
he cares about most.

133
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,040
I don’t care what junk foods
he eats outside.

134
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
As long as he is home,

135
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,439
I’ll prepare him the exquisite

136
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,879
and the best dishes as I can.

137
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,480
I think Miss Gu can understand it.

138
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,399
Ms. Zheng,

139
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,120
the best dishes you think,

140
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,240
might not suit his taste.

141
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,560
What he eats outside might not

142
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,759
be the most expensive or the best,

143
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,000
it’s no junk foods as you think.

144
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,639
I cook every dish

145
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,240
for him dedicatedly.

146
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,759
So you can rest assured,

147
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,519
Lu Jin enjoys eating it very much.

148
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,580
= Chengdeli =

149
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,000
Shengnan.

150
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,759
Shengnan.

151
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,519
I’m here.

152
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,480
What happened?

153
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
What’s wrong with you?

154
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,080
I think I’m having a fever.

155
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,240
My head aches.

156
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,639
A fever?

157
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,559
It’s so hot.

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,519
I’ll take you to the hospital.

159
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,559
I’m not going to the hospital.

160
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,240
You are sick.

161
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,399
It’s costly in the hospital.

162
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay. I’m giving you a chance
to spend my money.

163
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,039
I’m not going.

164
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,519
Be a good girl.

165
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,679
No.

166
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,519
Okay.

167
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,639
You win.

168
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,559
We’re not going.

169
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,159
We’re not going to the hospital.

170
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,399
Drink more water,

171
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,279
I’ll let you stay home.

172
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,399
Tell me about it.

173
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,919
What happened today?

174
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,759
Why did you suddenly become like this?

175
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,120
What happened?

176
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,759
Your mom…

177
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,240
Seems you’re very confident

178
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,679
in your cooking.

179
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,240
It’s not about the cooking.

180
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,720
It’s about the heart.

181
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,200
About the heart?

182
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,080
Since you care about my son so much,

183
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,879
why not stay

184
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,200
and remove the weeds?

185
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
So you can

186
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,559
show him your sincerity.

187
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,960
You see, this vegetable field

188
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,759
may be too fertile recently.

189
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,679
It grows a batch of weeds

190
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,759
without self-knowledge.

191
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,720
They grow arrogantly.

192
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,799
If you don’t remove them all,

193
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,639
the nutrients of this land
will be all absorbed by them.

194
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,480
Then the vegetables I carefully planted

195
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,240
for my son are no longer nutritious.

196
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,919
What do you think, Miss Gu?

197
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,759
Okay, I’ll help you.

198
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,440
Okay.

199
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,679
Well.

200
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,720
Unfortunately, before you came,

201
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,960
I was informed to hold a meeting.

202
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,480
I’ll leave you here then.

203
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,279
Here are tools.

204
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,039
Suit yourself.

205
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,039
I’ll be back after the meeting.

206
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,240
Remove the weeds.

207
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,519
Fine. It’s no big deal.

208
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,320
So you removed

209
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,519
all the weeds?

210
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,639
No.

211
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:54,720
Gu Shengnan,

212
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,159
you are a chef,

213
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,879
can’t you distinguish weeds

214
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,000
from vegetables?

215
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,240
Ms. Zheng,

216
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,240
I didn’t leave

217
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,039
because I want to tell you something.

218
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,000
Weeds are also living things.

219
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,519
All beings are equal.

220
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,519
Then how did you get a fever?

221
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,320
I sweated out doing farm work

222
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,759
and caught a chill, that’s why.

223
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,639
Did I go too far?

224
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,039
You did a great job.

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,120
I knew it.

226
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,720
It’s a pity

227
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:47,799
that I wasn’t there

228
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,399
to see my mother’s face.

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,879
It must be exciting.

230
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,440
Your mother went wild

231
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,519
and her hair bristled.

232
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:57,879
However,

233
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,440
she said something to me.

234
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,399
What did she say?

235
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,399
She said I’m like the younger her.

236
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,519
Do you think it’s a compliment or what?

237
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,879
I don’t get it.

238
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,720
It’s a compliment.

239
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,000
I wish you could transfer the cold to me.

240
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,720
I want to eat canned fruit.

241
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,279
It’s all preservatives.

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,200
If you want to eat fruit,

243
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,960
- I can buy you fresh ones.
- When I was sick,

244
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,240
my grandpa bought me canned fruit.

245
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,960
Medicine didn’t work on me.

246
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,200
But as long as I ate canned fruit,
I got refreshed.

247
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,000
But…

248
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,759
I wanna eat canned fruit.

249
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,960
I wanna eat canned fruit.

250
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,720
Buy me canned fruit, please.

251
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,480
Okay.

252
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,159
Wait for me.

253
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
Canned fruit.

254
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
Canned fruit.

255
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,020
= CEO Office =

256
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,580
= Fresh Fruit =

257
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,120
Sir.

258
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,960
You don’t really want to make
canned fruit yourself, do you?

259
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,399
Let’s get started.

260
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,360
Come on.

261
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,960
What?

262
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,759
Yeah, right. And then this.

263
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,240
Good.

264
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,440
Where are the oranges?

265
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,320
You’re a quick learner.

266
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,519
The water is boiling.

267
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,919
Pour the pear cubes
while the water is boiling.

268
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,080
Then what?

269
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,919
Then the rock candies.

270
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,720
Wait till it boils again…

271
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,960
What?

272
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,599
When to pour it?

273
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,799
Wait till the water boils again.

274
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,640
That’s it.

275
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,079
Then what?

276
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,319
Wait.

277
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,759
Can you hurry up?

278
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,559
Okay.

279
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,759
Is it good?

280
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,759
I don’t know if it’s because
I’m grown up or what.

281
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,240
My mouth is getting more
and more spoiled.

282
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,720
It doesn’t taste like
what I ate in my childhood.

283
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,799
But it is fresh.

284
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,200
Taste another piece.

285
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,119
But you said there are preservatives.

286
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,720
Not in the one I bought.

287
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,960
Does it taste fresh?

288
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,079
Well done.

289
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,319
The last piece.

290
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,240
No.

291
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,079
I’ll eat up all of them.

292
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,160
Can you stay here

293
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,519
tonight?

294
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,960
Stay with me.

295
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,680
Okay.

296
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,079
I’m not going anywhere.

297
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,240
I’ll stay with you tonight.

298
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,319
Don’t eat too much.

299
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,039
No.

300
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,519
I have to finish it all.

301
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,200
Try this test.

302
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,000
See if you are sincere.

303
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,880
Yeah, I know.

304
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,759
But I don’t have time this week.

305
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
Okay, listen.

306
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,160
I want a reason,

307
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,079
okay?

308
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,279
You need to know who the boss is.

309
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Keep in touch.

310
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,599
Still working?

311
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,119
You…

312
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,880
Why are you up?

313
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,559
Am I too self-willed?

314
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,000
Why?

315
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,000
Don’t you think I’m self-willed?

316
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,319
You have to take care of me.

317
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,359
You have to work.

318
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,559
And I quarreled with your mom

319
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,359
and got myself like this.

320
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,240
But,

321
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:36,559
I will try not to get sick again.

322
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,920
I will take care of myself.

323
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:45,599
I don’t want to see you with red eyes.

324
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,440
I don’t want to see you
with red eyes, either.

325
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,240
Let me stay here with you.

326
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,680

No.

369
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,799
We just slept in one bed.

370
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,480
What a gentleman

371
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,079
he is.

372
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,599
Uncle.

373
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,200
You know he got a lot of work to do.

374
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,240
As his fiancée,

375
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,839
I must protect him in all aspects.

376
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,200
But I can’t do anything.

377
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,000
I don’t know what I can do.

378
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,359
Who said you can’t do anything?

379
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You can cook, can’t you?

380
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:25,359
I’m cooking for him every day, but…

381
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,240
I can deliver him meals.

382
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,839
Love meals.

383
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,000
Five meals a day.

384
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,720
You wanna feed him like a pig?

385
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,640
You don’t know.

386
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,279
Elites like them

387
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,759
work intensively every day

388
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,559
and their brains are running fast.

389
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,359
He is easy to be hungry.

390
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:51,000
Look, if so,

391
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,480
except the three meals a day,

392
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:55,200
breakfast, lunch and supper,

393
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,359
and he has to eat fruit

394
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,079
in 10 a.m.

395
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,480
It’s good for his health.

396
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:02,519
And when it comes to 3 p.m.,

397
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,519
he must feel sleepy.

398
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:05,119
An afternoon tea

399
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,119
would be perfect for him then.

400
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,519
If he works overtime,

401
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,960
midnight snacks are indispensable, right?

402
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,759
Right.

403
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,960
If I cook for him,

404
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,079
I have to cook for his colleagues too.

405
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,519
How many colleagues he got?

406
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,599
In our kitchen,

407
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,240
there are about ten.

408
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:21,200
But,

409
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,640
his company is quite big,

410
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,880
there must be

411
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,519
about 40 or 50 at least.

412
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,240
So I have to prepare

413
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,880
for about 60 or 70.

414
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,279
No, that’s not enough.

415
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,480
Let’s say 80,

416
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,079
to be safe.

417
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,319
If I have to prepare for 80 people,

418
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:38,599
three meals a day,

419
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,759
80 multiplies 3 equals 240.

420
00:27:40,823 --> 00:27:42,163
- It’s 240 portions.
- Stop.

421
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,119
First,

422
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,200
don’t go.

423
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,599
You will disturb Lu Jin.

424
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,359
It is very likely

425
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,519
that he will dislike it.

426
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:50,519
Second,

427
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,960
you’re just a newbie,
why do you have to go

428
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,119
to the elites’ world?

429
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,839
You will regret it

430
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
when you mess it up.

431
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,079
First,

432
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,000
I will not disturb him.

433
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,240
I’ll just watch him aside

434
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,880
and be good.

435
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,960
But if he needs me,

436
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,359
I will be the first one he can reach.

437
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:10,720
Second,

438
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,759
I took care of his mom,

439
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,480
that big boss.

440
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,119
I’m not afraid of those elites.

441
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Third,

442
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,519
Uncle,

443
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:22,000
if you’re really gonna
wear this silk scarf,

444
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,599
you are a newbie.

445
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,759
You…

446
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,759
Shengnan.

447
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,000
You’re bullying me.

448
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:30,599
Yes, I am.

449
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,279
Wait to be bullied.

450
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:03,839
Excuse me,

451
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,240
can you please open the gate for me?

452
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,759
I need go up to find someone.

453
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,680
Sorry, we got rules.

454
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,960
Delivery men are not allowed
to go in there.

455
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,119
Please wait here.

456
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,400
I’m not delivering food.

457
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,759
I’m going up for Lu Jin.

458
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,599
Mr. Lu. You’re here for Mr. Lu?

459
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,880
Who are you?

460
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,720
Shengnan.

461
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,640
Mr. Lu, she said she was looking for you.

462
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,119
She is my fiancée.

463
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,599
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

464
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:26,880
Mr. Lu,

465
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,759
we will wait for you outside.

466
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,640
Okay.

467
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,519
Why did you come?

468
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,640
I’m here to accompany you.

469
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:35,119
I brought you love meals.

470
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,640
These are all your favorite dishes.

471
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:40,119
But I will be very busy today.

472
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,000
- It’s okay.
- I might not have time…

473
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,279
I’ll be quiet.

474
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,720
I’ll just wait for you.

475
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,000
Okay.

476
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,599
Let’s go.

477
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,519
After you.

478
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
Let me do it.

479
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,200
Thanks.

480
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,759
Shengnan,

481
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,599
I got important matters

482
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,519
to discuss with Li Man.

483
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,880
Can you sit in the front?

484
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,119
Mr. Lu, it’s okay.

485
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,640
Ms. Gu can sit wherever she likes.

486
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,200
No.

487
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,599
It’s okay. I’ll sit in the front.

488
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,759
You guys go ahead.

489
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,839
With your business.

490
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,119
I’ll go from that side.

491
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
Why does the bank
want to see Lu Mingting?

492
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,880
Mingting provided Wayne Group

493
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,880
with a project book for the re-planning

494
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,079
and transformation
of Sinan Villa District.

495
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:54,000
You know Wayne has always been interested

496
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,200
in this kind of art style old buildings.

497
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,880
And I heard that Mingting provides

498
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,079
very favorable terms for this cooperation.

499
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,599
I think Lu Mingting is looking for

500
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,599
a strong credit guarantee for himself.

501
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,480
In this case,

502
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:08,759
the bank will

503
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,480
give Mingting another chance

504
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,000
for the sake of Wayne.

505
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,240
Why am I informed of it till now?

506
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,519
Something must go wrong
with the review team,

507
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,519
I just learnt it now.

508
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,200
Lu Jin,

509
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,839
I made you this.

510
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,839
Hello, James.

511
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,640
Winter Melon and Lotus Leaf Soup.

512
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,000
The president has acknowledged
of this situation.

513
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,519
He is with me right now,

514
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,839
if you need to…

515
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,119
Okay.

516
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,720
Jamie.

517
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,960
That’s ridiculous.

518
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,240
Yeah.

519
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,119
What’s coming will come.

520
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,079
I will meet you one day at last.

521
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,119
I will handle Wayne Group by myself.

522
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,119
It’s a matter of time, okay?

523
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,240
I will be in Vancouver next week,

524
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,759
and talk to you in person.

525
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
Jamie, listen,

526
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,279
it’s a matter of time.

527
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,400
From now on,

528
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,480
anything,

529
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,279
report to me directly.

530
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,759
Keep in touch.

531
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,359
Shengnan.

532
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,960
Sorry, what did you say?

533
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,359
Nothing.

534
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I’m okay.

535
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,480
Okay.

536
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,839
Get the review team over.

537
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:46,759
Emergency meeting.

538
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,720
Will arrange now.

539
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,240
U-turn. To Zhenghong.

540
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:49,920
Okay.

541
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,200
I have reminded you many times.

542
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,480
When things seem to go smoothly,

543
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,279
there are often great risks
hidden behind them.

544
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,000
You never listen.

545
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,400
Turn a deaf to my words.

546
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,599
So you have your own solution.

547
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:20,599
Well.

548
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:25,359
Give me an explanation.

549
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,599
Why did Mingting

550
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,160
submit a new project

551
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,759
development letter to Wayne,

552
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,759
and I am the last to know?

553
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,480
Who comes first?

554
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:49,640
As a team leader,

555
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,480
you got no sense of responsibility.

556
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,640
Mr. Lu, I’m sorry,

557
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,359
it was our negligence.

558
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,720
Don’t say sorry to me.

559
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,119
You know I hate this word.

560
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:03,599
If you say sorry,

561
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,279
I have to pretend to be very forgiving

562
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,680
and think for you

563
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,519
from your perspective. I can’t do it.

564
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,360
So please

565
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,239
don’t insult me

566
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,719
with my tolerance to you.

567
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,840
Mr. Lu,

568
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,880
it was really our negligence.

569
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,360
I thought Mingting was in a dead end.

570
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,920
But…

571
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,599
But I didn’t expect that
they are playing a deep game.

572
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,880
You didn’t expect that

573
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,480
you will be fired either, did you?

574
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,000
Mr. Lu.

575
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:33,960
Get out.

576
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,320
Why are you guys still sitting here?

577
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,320
This project got nothing to do
with you anymore.

578
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,159
Get out, all of you.

579
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,840
Notify the human resources department…

580
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,679
To give them three months off.

581
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,000
Okay.

582
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,159
Why are you here?

583
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,280
Got bullied?

584
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,159
I told you not to go.

585
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,480
You asked for it.

586
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:39,519
