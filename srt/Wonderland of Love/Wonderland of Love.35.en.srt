No need.

31
00:02:10,912 --> 00:02:13,113
Later, you should have something
before sleeping.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,110
You mustn't starve yourself.

33
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:20,993
Taozi will deliver
the dessert later.

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,470
Remember to have some.

35
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:26,352
Crown Prince,

36
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:27,553
Crown Princess,

37
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:28,313
Lady Gu

38
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:29,833
is here to greet you two.

39
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,232
Tell her to go back.

40
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:32,553
Tell her that I'm unwell.

41
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:33,752
Yes.

42
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:34,713
Wait.

43
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:37,833
I almost forgot

44
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:39,352
there's also Lady Gu

45
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:40,912
in Eastern Palace.

46
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:44,273
Invite her in.

47
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,313
Yes, Your Highness.

48
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,495
(Chengluan Hall)

49
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,232
Greetings, Crown Prince,

50
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:06,352
Crown Princess.

51
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,410
Spare the formalities.

52
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:09,180
Yes, Your Highness.

53
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:11,672
I should've greeted

54
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:13,192
both of you

55
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,553
early in the morning.

56
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,273
However, I was thinking

57
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:18,232
that you two went to

58
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:19,952
Fengzhang Hall to greet

59
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:21,570
His Majesty and Her Highness
this morning.

60
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,873
That's why I only came now.

61
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:26,672
I'll definitely come by dawn tomorrow

62
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:28,912
to serve Your Highness.

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,590
No need for that.

64
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,310
I don't wake up
that early.

65
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:34,593
And, there are plenty of servants here.

66
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:37,313
You don't need to come here
and serve me.

67
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:38,752
Yes.

68
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,672
I made a mandarin duck painting

69
00:03:48,873 --> 00:03:50,072
to congratulate both of you

70
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:51,512
on your wedding.

71
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:54,232
Not bad.

72
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,110
Your Highness, you flatter me.

73
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:57,593
I was delighted

74
00:03:57,593 --> 00:03:58,912
ever since I heard about

75
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,993
His Highness' wedding.

76
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:03,192
First, I was lucky enough

77
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,072
to be one of your old acquaintances.

78
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:07,800
Your Highness, you're intelligent
and straightforward.

79
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,570
You're not as indecisive
as ordinary girls.

80
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:12,192
Second, His Highness is happy

81
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:14,153
that you're the crown princess.

82
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:16,352
Naturally, that makes me happy too.

83
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:17,850
I feel like there's a backbone now.

84
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:22,033
Lady Gu, you did a great job

85
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:23,290
with the mandarin duck painting.

86
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:24,912
Coincidentally,

87
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:26,992
I lack a folding screen.

88
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:29,593
Please make a huge folding screen for me.

89
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,250
It's no trouble for you, right?

90
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,472
Your Highness, you're too courteous.

91
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:38,393
Not at all.

92
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:41,033
It's my fortune
that you took a liking to my embroidery.

93
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:42,393
Great.

94
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:43,833
I'm exhausted.

95
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:45,672
You may go back and rest.

96
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:47,153
Yes.

97
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:48,593
I will come here again

98
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:49,792
and greet you tomorrow.

99
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,820
You don't need to come tomorrow.

100
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,153
Since the crown princess likes your work,

101
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,870
you should finish it
as soon as possible.

102
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:06,273
Yes.

103
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,273
Why not get changed
before sleeping?

104
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,640
I'm sure the crown princess
did it on purpose.

105
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,992
Why would anyone take a nap
this early in the day?

106
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:29,472
She knew

107
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:30,273
that our lady

108
00:05:30,273 --> 00:05:31,393
must greet her

109
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:32,472
and His Highness today.

110
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,713
She's disregarding you on purpose.

111
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,840
She even told you
to make a folding screen.

112
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:38,153
It's a huge item.

113
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:40,153
How long does it take to finish it?

114
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:42,193
The worst thing is

115
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,352
that His Highness
was also siding with her.

116
00:05:45,393 --> 00:05:45,992
Shut up!

117
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:48,153
Who are you to complain
about His Highness?

118
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:54,232
The crown princess is the lone daughter
of Great General Cui.

119
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:55,672
She has an arrogant demeanor.

120
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,770
She's not willing to wake up
even when it's dawn.

121
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,472
I have no idea

122
00:05:58,472 --> 00:05:59,992
what time she slept and woke up

123
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,792
when she was serving in the military.

124
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:05,312
It's obviously a set of excuses.

125
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,273
She just didn't want to see me.

126
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:09,713
Since she didn't want to see me,

127
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,552
that means she minds my presence.

128
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,513
Since she minds my presence,

129
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,073
I have to show up

130
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:16,193
in front of her more often.

131
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:18,593
I'll make her remember

132
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,210
that there's a lady of excellence

133
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:21,352
besides the crown princess

134
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:22,992
in Eastern Palace.

135
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:40,393
Your Highness.

136
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,073
You may go now.

137
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,393
The dessert is here.

138
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:30,672
Taozi just delivered it.

139
00:07:31,112 --> 00:07:31,953
Take a sip.

140
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,513
Shiqi,

141
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,112
Great General Cui
spends his time here every day.

142
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:14,193
Great General Cui.

143
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:21,633
Were you guys calling for me?

144
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:23,872
Who are you guys?

145
00:08:30,992 --> 00:08:31,953
Look.

146
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,513
This terrain is pretty strategic.

147
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:38,712
What should we do if our enemies

148
00:08:39,993 --> 00:08:40,832
invade the bend?

149
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:49,672
It depends on our numbers
and our enemies' numbers.

150
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:51,592
If we're equal in strength,

151
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,920
naturally, I would arrange archers
to set up an ambush there.

152
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:57,912
If our enemies outnumber us,

153
00:08:58,393 --> 00:08:59,620
I'll set up a bramble trap here

154
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,432
and arrange archers on both sides.

155
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:03,712
If we outnumber our enemies,

156
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,790
we'll attack them from the center.

157
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:09,753
You're right.

158
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:12,192
It's rare

159
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:13,672
to see a young talent like you

160
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:16,552
in Cui Army.

161
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:19,432
Tell me your name.

162
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,870
I'll promote you to the rank of captain
in the future.

163
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,310
Remember to render merit.

164
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,273
You have a bright future ahead of you.

165
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:30,473
Great General,

166
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:32,592
my name is Li Ni.

167
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:40,633
That sounds familiar.

168
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,393
But I can't remember anything.

169
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:49,912
I think

170
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:52,832
I've seen you before as well.

171
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:55,993
But I can't remember.

172
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:17,353
Young Lady,

173
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:20,780
I give Great General acupuncture
treatment and medicine every day.

174
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,312
Although he's more clear-headed now,

175
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:24,912
he still can't remember

176
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,033
most of the things.

177
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:31,712
Father is mentally troubled.

178
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,740
I'm afraid acupuncture treatment
and medicine alone

179
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,192
cannot cure his condition.

180
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:40,792
We have to come up with other methods.

181
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:42,832
I'll read more medical books

182
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:44,633
when I get back.

183
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:46,353
I'll see if there are any treatments

184
00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:48,033
I haven't tried yet.

185
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:55,672
What's wrong?

186
00:10:58,672 --> 00:10:59,753
What is it?

187
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,072
Just tell me about it.

188
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:07,310
I received news from
the Court of Judicial Review.

189
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:09,792
Due to his serious injuries

190
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:11,873
and the cold and fever

191
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,312
he had been sustaining

192
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:15,712
all along,

193
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:18,273
Liu Chengfeng died last night.

194
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:32,072
He died?

195
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,290
When you were getting married
to His Highness,

196
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:38,952
His Majesty intended to spare all
from their punishment.

197
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:41,273
The Court of Judicial Review thought

198
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,340
that Liu Chengfeng was
going to be spared too.

199
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:46,072
Therefore, they transferred him

200
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:47,312
to the prison

201
00:11:47,432 --> 00:11:48,473
from his single cell.

202
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:50,473
However,

203
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:51,993
one of the criminals

204
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:53,072
caught typhoid fever.

205
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,432
And, he infected it to the others.

206
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:57,192
Liu Chengfeng was infected too.

207
00:11:58,113 --> 00:11:59,312
He died after that.

208
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:04,952
Where is his body then?

209
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,810
As it was a case of typhoid fever,

210
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:09,153
Court of Judicial Review
dare not cover it up.

211
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:12,393
They set fire to his body

212
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:14,592
and several others

213
00:12:14,672 --> 00:12:15,912
and burned them to ashes.

214
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,312
They buried them at the mass grave.

215
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:26,552
I see.

216
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:38,753
Lady Gu,

217
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:40,552
you made such a huge draft.

218
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:42,312
When will you be able to finish this?

219
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:44,393
Why don't you pick a simple pattern

220
00:12:44,552 --> 00:12:46,233
and finish it quickly?

221
00:12:47,153 --> 00:12:48,912
Since she praised me for my skill,

222
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,192
naturally, I can't just brush her off.

223
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:55,072
I'll make
100 Birds' Homage to the Phoenix.

224
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:57,552
100 Birds' Homage to the Phoenix?

225
00:12:57,952 --> 00:12:59,993
It'll take at least 100 kinds of threads
to make it.

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,113
I'm afraid it'll take you
at least one year to complete it.

227
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:02,993
Young Lady.

228
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,273
No, I mean Lady Gu.

229
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:08,072
That's too exhausting for you.

230
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:09,592
That's right.

231
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:12,033
It contains complex
patterns and stitches.

232
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:14,473
I have to take my time.

233
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:18,592
Chengluan Hall, which is the
crown princess's residence,

234
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:22,033
deserves a painting like this.

235
00:13:22,513 --> 00:13:23,832
It implies good fortune.

236
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,273
I just don't know

237
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,010
whether she can still live there in peace
when I'm done with this.

238
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:40,912
I'm getting old now.

239
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:44,873
I wasn't this patient when I was young.

240
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:47,952
Fishing?

241
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:50,552
Isn't it better to go into the river

242
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,233
and catch them myself?

243
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:56,952
But after that, when I thought about it,

244
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:00,753
fishing was just like
setting up an ambush.

245
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:02,312
Look.

246
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:04,672
You scatter the bait

247
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:08,312
onto the river.

248
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:10,672
You use them to lure the fish.

249
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:13,513
After that, you have to hold down
your breath

250
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,273
and wait for the fish to bite the hook.

251
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:18,552
Look.

252
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:22,113
Isn't it the same as
setting up an ambush?

253
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:24,873
Great General,

254
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,192
please tell me about the Cui Army.

255
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:33,113
The Cui Army was first known

256
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:37,192
during the reign of Wenzong.

257
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:40,552
Back then, the Jieshuo people
kept robbing us of our food.

258
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:43,912
My great-grandfather's eldest uncle

259
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:46,432
gathered the members of the Cui family

260
00:14:46,592 --> 00:14:47,753
to resist them.

261
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,473
After that,

262
00:14:51,552 --> 00:14:53,353
the Cui Army was formed.

263
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:56,113
After that,

264
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:57,792
it kept expanding.

265
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,113
The imperial court started providing
them with wages and food.

266
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:04,353
The members of the Cui family
had to fight on the battlefield.

267
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:05,952
Most of them died young.

268
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,552
That's why the elders

269
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,832
always told us to get married and give birth
as soon as possible.

270
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:17,033
I already had a wife

271
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,513
when I was your age.

272
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:22,592
I'm already married too.

273
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:26,473
Is that so?

274
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:30,952
Which family does she come from?

275
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:34,473
Bring her to me next time.

276
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:38,552
Okay.

277
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:50,153
What a shame.

278
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:53,473
My poor wife.

279
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:56,153
One time,

280
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,513
I left the city with my army
to engage in a battle.

281
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,912
Only the old and weak
were left in the city.

282
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:06,672
Our enemies attacked the city.

283
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:09,393
She fought them together

284
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:11,912
with the women's army.

285
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:14,513
They didn't back off.

286
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:20,072
(She died then.)

287
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:32,513
When I was back,

288
00:16:40,473 --> 00:16:43,353
I didn't even get to see her
one last time.

289
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,753
I carried her cold corpse in my arms

290
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:52,473
as I cried in anguish.

291
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:58,712
But luckily,

292
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:04,513
we still had a child.

293
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:11,010
If not, it would've been difficult for me
to go through that.

294
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:14,592
Great General.

295
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:20,233
Men don't shed tears easily

296
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,552
because they're not heartbroken yet.

297
00:17:24,673 --> 00:17:27,152
My wife and I were
married for over a decade.

298
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:30,673
She followed me as I guarded
Yingzhou and our borders.

299
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:33,913
She never got

300
00:17:33,993 --> 00:17:35,953
to lead a good life.

301
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:39,832
We were married at a young age.

302
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:41,473
Not only

303
00:17:41,592 --> 00:17:43,953
did we not grow old together,

304
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,792
but I also didn't manage

305
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:49,552
to see her at her dying moment.

306
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:54,193
That's my biggest regret in life.

307
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:56,273
Say,

308
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,953
what's the use of

309
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:01,473
rendering great merit?

310
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,072
That's my biggest regret

311
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:09,513
in life.

312
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,072
Back then,
I only had one thing on my mind.

313
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:18,233
Revenge.

314
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,632
I had to avenge my wife.

315
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:27,072
After that,

316
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:31,033
I avenged my wife.

317
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:36,792
The Cui Army has improved considerably

318
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,792
under my lead.

319
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:42,352
Therefore, the imperial court

320
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:44,753
named us

321
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:46,352
the Army of Victory.

322
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:49,433
The Cui Army has a flag.

323
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:52,552
The word "Victory" is embroidered on it.

324
00:18:53,072 --> 00:18:55,112
It was granted to us
by the late emperor.

325
00:18:57,713 --> 00:18:59,112
I kept thinking

326
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:02,033
that the Cui Army

327
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:04,913
was able to achieve
all those achievements

328
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:09,592
all thanks to my wife's contribution.

329
00:19:11,352 --> 00:19:13,792
I wonder how happy she'll be

330
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:18,993
if she gets to see our flag?

331
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,112
It's a shame that she'll never
be able to see it.

332
00:19:25,273 --> 00:19:26,473
If only

333
00:19:27,193 --> 00:19:28,473
I'm lucky enough

334
00:19:29,352 --> 00:19:31,112
to take a glance at the flag myself.

335
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:36,552
You're born too late.

336
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:39,872
You didn't get to see

337
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,340
the time when I set up
an ambush at Qinshui Spring.

338
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:45,112
It snowed heavily that day.

339
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,713
Tens of thousands of our troops

340
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,720
were lying in ambush
within the snowy ground.

341
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:53,112
No sound could be heard.

342
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:58,792
There were no birds in flight,

343
00:20:00,473 --> 00:20:02,392
and no human traces to be found.

344
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:04,673
The snow was so thick

345
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:08,953
that no living being could be sighted.

346
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:11,713
I thought to myself,

347
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:17,552
"Could it be that the Jieshuo people
aren't taking this path?

348
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:20,433
If the snow gets any thicker,

349
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:22,552
my tens of thousands of troops

350
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:25,233
will die a snowy death here."

351
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,513
In the end,

352
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:32,233
the Jieshuo people still fell for it.

353
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,152
It was such a satisfying battle.

354
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:38,233
It was so satisfying.

355
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:40,993
I heard

356
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:44,273
that the Jieshuo people

357
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,070
never dared to set foot on Juyi Mountain

358
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,620
ever since the battle at Qinshui Spring.

359
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:49,312
Sun Jing

360
00:20:50,312 --> 00:20:51,592
defeated Yiluo flawlessly.

361
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:55,233
I chased the Jieshuo people

362
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:56,552
out of Mount Juyi.

363
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,552
Pei Xian

364
00:20:57,993 --> 00:20:59,273
made the Qing Army

365
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:00,673
stay away from Laolan River.

366
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,552
No matter if it's the imperial court
or the people,

367
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:06,112
all of them were so happy

368
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:07,352
that they called us

369
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:08,993
The Three Heroes.

370
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:13,473
His Majesty summoned us
and held a banquet for us.

371
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:15,592
In the end, I didn't have my fill.

372
00:21:16,913 --> 00:21:18,072
After I left the palace,

373
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:21,792
I went to Fengying Pavilion
for another round.

374
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:24,152
Later,

375
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:26,112
Sun Jing and Pei Xian

376
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:27,513
arrived there too.

377
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:30,112
We drank until we dropped.

378
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:45,753
I think I remember

379
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:46,993
who you are now.

380
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:47,913
Come here.

381
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:53,802
You're the son of Pei Xian,

382
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:55,363
Pei Mang.

383
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:57,242
Back then, you were 13 years old.

384
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,740
You were waiting for your father
outside of Fengying Pavilion with his horse.

385
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:03,510
He was so drunk that
he couldn't get on his horse.

386
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,962
You even blamed me and Sun Jing

387
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:06,962
for getting your father drunk.

388
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:08,722
Great General,

389
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,482
Pei Mang is my elder brother.

390
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:12,923
I'm Pei Yuan.

391
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:20,802
I think

392
00:22:21,643 --> 00:22:23,802
you look pretty familiar too.

393
00:22:26,522 --> 00:22:27,843
Wait,

394
00:22:29,562 --> 00:22:32,083
are you Sun Jing's son?

395
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:20,943
Wait.

396
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,282
The floor is cold.

397
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,340
You should use this blanket

398
00:23:29,203 --> 00:23:30,002
to cover the ground.

399
00:23:30,762 --> 00:23:31,522
It's fine.

400
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:33,282
We only have two blankets here.

401
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,640
Cover yourself with it.

402
00:24:31,062 --> 00:24:33,405
(Chengluan Hall)

403
00:24:35,762 --> 00:24:36,720
What are you doing here?

404
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:37,962
I'm here to serve

405
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:39,282
Her Highness.

406
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,643
As the flowers have bloomed today,

407
00:24:40,802 --> 00:24:42,083
I went to the garden

408
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:43,203
and picked some of them

409
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:45,562
so that Her Highness could admire them.

410
00:24:45,722 --> 00:24:47,363
The crown princess is still asleep.

411
00:24:47,883 --> 00:24:48,443
Yes.

412
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:50,002
Her Highness said

413
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:51,322
she couldn't wake up early.

414
00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:52,962
I was waiting here silently

415
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,590
as I was afraid I might
disrupt her sleep.

416
00:24:54,603 --> 00:24:55,310
No need for that.

417
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,923
The crown princess never likes

418
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:58,683
flowers and plants in general.

419
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:00,110
You can take them back.

420
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,500
But Your Highness...

421
00:25:04,522 --> 00:25:06,050
She told you to make
a folding screen.

422
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,722
You can come back
once you're done with it.

423
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,910
Yes, Your Highness.

424
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,083
Your Highness,

425
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:28,363
you don't look too well.

426
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:30,603
Is your old wound acting up again?

427
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:32,042
That's not it.

428
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,680
I just didn't sleep well
as it was too cold last night.

429
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,322
It was too cold?

430
00:25:36,683 --> 00:25:37,522
How did the servants

431
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:38,883
in Eastern Palace serve you?

432
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:39,643
Don't they know

433
00:25:39,722 --> 00:25:41,083
how to get you some thick blankets?

434
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:42,802
Enough. Let's drop the topic.

435
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:45,123
Let's get down to business.

436
00:25:49,363 --> 00:25:50,562
The imperial physician said

437
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:52,042
Great General Cui's condition

438
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:54,522
was caused by damp phlegm,

439
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:55,810
causing him to be delirious.

440
00:25:55,962 --> 00:25:58,042
That's why his mental state is unstable.

441
00:25:58,363 --> 00:25:59,810
But the imperial physician also said

442
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:01,883
mental ailments require mental remedies.

443
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,810
For Great General Cui's condition,

444
00:26:04,002 --> 00:26:04,683
it's hard to cure

445
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:05,883
if we don't target

446
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:07,562
the cause of the condition.

447
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:09,110
The imperial physician said

448
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,363
we could either stimulate him

449
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:11,802
and make him cough out

450
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:13,322
the blood pooled in his lungs.

451
00:26:13,482 --> 00:26:14,522
He might recover by then.

452
00:26:15,802 --> 00:26:17,123
Or we could go with the flow

453
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
and let Great General Cui

454
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:20,002
lead his army to battle again.

455
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,683
He might also recover by then.

456
00:26:22,843 --> 00:26:24,683
Great General Cui is no longer young.

457
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,923
And, you know
the current circumstances too.

458
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:28,603
The Cui Army has been disbanded.

459
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:30,363
How can he lead them to battle again?

460
00:26:31,282 --> 00:26:32,810
If so, we can only take a leap of faith

461
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,123
and try to stimulate him.

462
00:26:36,923 --> 00:26:37,683
Your Highness,

463
00:26:38,203 --> 00:26:40,002
this is a risky move.

464
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,322
The imperial physician said

465
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:43,042
Great General Cui's condition

466
00:26:43,163 --> 00:26:44,522
might get worse

467
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:46,363
if we fail.

468
00:26:46,843 --> 00:26:47,923
I kept him company

469
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,650
when he went fishing
for the past few days.

470
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:52,562
I found out that he was
most heartbroken

471
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:54,403
about the death of his wife.

472
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:57,443
We can only fight fire with fire

473
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,083
in order to cure his condition.

474
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:00,282
I think

475
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,070
Great General Cui would
take the risk too

476
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,522
if he knew about

477
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:07,203
his condition.

478
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:08,603
It's because

479
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:10,002
he's bold and brave.

480
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,722
I trust him.

481
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:14,762
Understood.

482
00:27:21,762 --> 00:27:22,683
Young Lady.

483
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:26,923
Young Lady,

484
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,962
the garden in Eastern Palace
is massive.

485
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:30,843
The flowers have bloomed too.

486
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:32,282
I got you a bouquet.

487
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,083
Coincidentally,

488
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,163
I bumped into His Highness.

489
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:40,802
He asked me whether I had
enough flowers here.

490
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:43,522
If not, I can pick them
from the flowerbed at the back.

491
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:44,962
He also asked me

492
00:27:45,242 --> 00:27:46,562
whether you were used
to the food

493
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:47,802
served in Eastern Palace

494
00:27:47,923 --> 00:27:48,883
and that if you needed

495
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,203
a private kitchen.

496
00:27:53,883 --> 00:27:54,962
You guys may leave first.

497
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:00,923
It's nice, right?

498
00:28:09,282 --> 00:28:10,163
What's wrong?

499
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,962
Are you still mad at him?

500
00:28:14,203 --> 00:28:15,722
Judging from the way he behaved,

501
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:17,242
it seemed as if he was trying

502
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,470
to inquire about something.

503
00:28:19,123 --> 00:28:20,123
But don't worry.

504
00:28:20,403 --> 00:28:21,603
I didn't tell him anything.

505
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:23,242
I tried to scare him instead.

506
00:28:23,762 --> 00:28:25,643
I said you couldn't eat

507
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:26,923
or sleep well.

508
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:28,802
Wait.

509
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:32,282
You two are sleeping
in the same room now.

510
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:34,123
I don't think he'll fall for it.

511
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:36,683
Young Lady,

512
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:38,683
did I give myself away?

513
00:28:39,242 --> 00:28:39,603
But...

514
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,282
But you didn't eat well for real.

515
00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:42,363
You barely ate

516
00:28:42,562 --> 00:28:43,923
for the past few days.

517
00:28:44,843 --> 00:28:45,482
Taozi,

518
00:28:46,403 --> 00:28:47,600
I've been wondering about this

519
00:28:48,363 --> 00:28:49,762
for the past few days.

520
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:51,562
What is it?

521
00:28:52,282 --> 00:28:53,522
I have the feeling

522
00:28:55,363 --> 00:28:56,802
that Liu Chengfeng is still alive.

523
00:28:58,603 --> 00:28:59,643
That can't be.

524
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:01,802
Look,

525
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,810
everything was too much
of a coincidence.

526
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:05,403
He caught typhoid fever

527
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:06,722
right after he was transferred

528
00:29:07,242 --> 00:29:08,643
to prison from his single cell.

529
00:29:09,282 --> 00:29:10,722
After that, he was reported dead.

530
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:12,363
As it was typhoid fever,

531
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,810
their bodies couldn't be preserved.

532
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:15,883
They have to be reduced to ashes.

533
00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:18,562
Don't you think

534
00:29:19,242 --> 00:29:20,883
this is too much of a coincidence?

535
00:29:22,322 --> 00:29:23,042
Young Lady,

536
00:29:23,403 --> 00:29:24,762
are you saying that...

537
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,250
Although the Cui Army
has been disbanded,

538
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:29,002
the spies we planted in the capital

539
00:29:29,163 --> 00:29:30,163
are still around.

540
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,002
Send your men to investigate

541
00:29:32,242 --> 00:29:33,562
whether there are any movements

542
00:29:33,683 --> 00:29:34,722
within the prison

543
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:36,403
before and after Liu Chengfeng's death.

544
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,950
Tell them to observe
if Jieshuo is up to anything.

545
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:41,403
I have the feeling

546
00:29:41,962 --> 00:29:43,522
that Liu Chengfeng and Jieshuo

547
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,883
won't call it a day yet.

548
00:29:47,482 --> 00:29:48,482
This is the medicine

549
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:49,883
delivered by the Jieshuo people.

550
00:30:03,962 --> 00:30:04,562
Young Master,

551
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:08,203
we received a letter from Wuluo.

552
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,522
He was very satisfied

553
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:11,482
with what you did.

554
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:13,522
He said he has another important task

555
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:15,083
for you to accomplish.

556
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:18,403
Wuluo's greed knows no bounds.

557
00:30:19,163 --> 00:30:19,843
Young Master,

558
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:22,282
why don't we think of a way

559
00:30:22,683 --> 00:30:24,242
to escape from Jieshuo's clutch

560
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:25,923
and run away?

561
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:30,843
How's Ying doing?

562
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,440
Eastern Palace has tight security.

563
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,720
I was unable to procure any news

564
00:30:38,482 --> 00:30:39,802
due to my incompetence.

565
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:48,883
Young Master!

566
00:30:50,322 --> 00:30:51,083
Shu,

567
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:53,363
calm down.

568
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,762
I won't die from this anyway.

569
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,802
It does hurt.

570
00:31:12,643 --> 00:31:14,603
However, how can I remember

571
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,242
the pain of being heartbroken

572
00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:21,443
if it doesn't hurt?

573
00:31:25,242 --> 00:31:27,242
Li Ni truly deserves to die.

574
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:29,522
I will snatch Ying back

575
00:31:29,683 --> 00:31:31,242
one day.

576
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:34,843
I will let him feel the pain of

577
00:31:36,322 --> 00:31:38,363
getting his beloved

578
00:31:39,443 --> 00:31:41,962
stolen from him.

579
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:49,843
Your Highness,

580
00:31:50,683 --> 00:31:53,683
to be honest, my wife

581
00:31:53,843 --> 00:31:56,282
is also worried about my daughter.

582
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:58,123
I told you before.

583
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:00,522
It's not like my daughter is married
to someone else

584
00:32:00,923 --> 00:32:03,363
and can visit or send her men

585
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:04,923
to visit her hometown.

586
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:07,762
My daughter joined Eastern Palace

587
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,002
as your lady of excellence.

588
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,450
Due to the disparity of our ranks,

589
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,643
it's inappropriate for her mother
to visit her.

590
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:14,522
Therefore,

591
00:32:14,722 --> 00:32:16,083
I'm making a bold move

592
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:17,883
by visiting my daughter here today.

593
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,810
Prime Minister Gu, you're too courteous.

594
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,322
If Madam is worried about her,

595
00:32:22,443 --> 00:32:23,210
it's common for her

596
00:32:23,282 --> 00:32:24,522
to come here and visit her.

597
00:32:25,802 --> 00:32:27,083
I'm just worried

598
00:32:27,203 --> 00:32:29,482
that my daughter wasn't serving you
well, Your Highness.

599
00:32:29,762 --> 00:32:31,482
I've already asked her before.

600
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,042
My daughter was
eternally grateful to you.

601
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:36,083
She said

602
00:32:36,242 --> 00:32:37,883
Your Highness and the crown princess

603
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,683
took great care of her.

604
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:42,403
Initially, I should've felt relieved.

605
00:32:43,123 --> 00:32:43,643
However,

606
00:32:44,123 --> 00:32:45,603
my daughter's servant

607
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:47,002
told me this in secret

608
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:48,282
when she was seeing me off.

609
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:52,482
She said my daughter

610
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,603
had made you upset for some reason.

611
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:56,683
Your Highness

612
00:32:57,002 --> 00:32:58,163
never treated her sincerely

613
00:32:58,322 --> 00:33:00,562
ever since she joined
Eastern Palace.

614
00:33:00,683 --> 00:33:01,962
Your Highness, you never

615
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:03,163
visited her

616
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:06,403
in Liuxiang Hall as well.

617
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:10,960
Prime Minister Gu,
I'm sure you know

618
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,820
how busy I am
with official affairs here.

619
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,482
I understand.

620
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:17,762
I'm just worried.

621
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,203
I'm worried that my daughter

622
00:33:19,322 --> 00:33:21,282
had committed some mistakes

623
00:33:21,443 --> 00:33:23,522
that had irked you,

624
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:24,923
Your Highness.

625
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,540
Your Highness, you don't need
to spare me any dignity.

626
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:28,562
If she did

627
00:33:28,762 --> 00:33:29,802
commit any mistakes,

628
00:33:29,962 --> 00:33:31,110
please let the crown princess

629
00:33:31,203 --> 00:33:33,282
teach her a lesson.

630
00:33:33,363 --> 00:33:33,943
This...

631
00:33:36,123 --> 00:33:38,722
Lady Gu didn't commit any mistakes.

632
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,322
If so,

633
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:41,962
Your Highness,

634
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,762
please take care of her

635
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:45,962
on my behalf.

636
00:33:47,203 --> 00:33:48,762
You've never

637
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:51,403
stepped foot in Liuxiang Hall

638
00:33:51,403 --> 00:33:52,603
and visited her all this while.

639
00:33:52,762 --> 00:33:54,403
To the others,

640
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:56,242
they thought

641
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:59,403
you were upset with my daughter

642
00:33:59,562 --> 00:34:01,450
and that you were showing her
the cold shoulder.

643
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,482
Prime Minister Gu, don't worry.

644
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:07,883
I'll visit her one day.

645
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:13,722
Tell Taozi

646
00:34:14,043 --> 00:34:15,362
to tell the crown princess

647
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:16,922
that I'm not having dinner

648
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,203
with her today.

649
00:34:18,643 --> 00:34:21,603
I'm having dinner with Lady Gu.

650
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,043
Yes.

651
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:25,882
And,

652
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,242
you must make sure

653
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:29,163
to report back to me

654
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,842
after she notifies the crown princess.

655
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,210
Yes, Your Highness.

656
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:47,070
Are you sure I should relay
Her Highness's message word for word?

657
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:48,003
Of course.

658
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:49,282
Young Lady said...

659
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:50,242
No,

660
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:52,043
I mean, Her Highness said

661
00:34:52,563 --> 00:34:54,242
you must relay her message

662
00:34:54,402 --> 00:34:55,402
to His Highness

663
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:56,963
word for word.

664
00:34:59,043 --> 00:34:59,762
All right then.

665
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:02,563
Go now.

666
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:05,802
Taozi,

667
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,762
we're finally seeing each other
after so long.

668
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:09,563
Are you chasing me away already?

669
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,242
I'm not chasing you away.

670
00:35:12,882 --> 00:35:14,003
You were the one who said

671
00:35:14,163 --> 00:35:15,910
that you had to report back
to His Highness.

672
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,762
If so, don't you have anything
to say to me?

673
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:20,282
I...

674
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,842
Forget it. You can tell me.

675
00:35:24,402 --> 00:35:25,043
What do you want

676
00:35:25,242 --> 00:35:26,322
to tell me?

677
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:43,683
That fool.

678
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,643
He ran away so quickly.

679
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,952
(Account Records)

680
00:35:58,242 --> 00:35:58,810
Your Highness.

681
00:35:59,362 --> 00:35:59,922
How did it go?

682
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:01,402
What did the crown princess say?

683
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:03,683
Her Highness said

684
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:04,762
she never intended

685
00:36:04,922 --> 00:36:06,163
to have dinner with you.

686
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:07,643
So, Your Highness,

687
00:36:07,683 --> 00:36:09,163
you can go wherever you like.

688
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,322
Taozi even told me

689
00:36:11,523 --> 00:36:13,922
to relay Her Highness's message to you
word for word.

690
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:18,123
My liver hurts.

691
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:20,203
What? Your liver hurts?

692
00:36:20,228 --> 00:36:22,163
Do you need me
to summon the imperial physician?

693
00:36:22,322 --> 00:36:23,003
No need for that.

694
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:24,747
I know you have excellent hearing.

695
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,523
Your Highness, you knew

696
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,043
that I had a great hearing
all along, right?

697
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:30,683
That's right.

698
00:36:40,842 --> 00:36:41,523
Lady Gu,

699
00:36:41,523 --> 00:36:42,722
His Highness is here.

700
00:36:49,563 --> 00:36:50,163
Your Highness.

701
00:36:50,362 --> 00:36:51,762
Spare the formalities. You may sit.

702
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:00,043
Your Highness,

703
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,430
when we heard that you were
having dinner,

704
00:37:01,442 --> 00:37:03,802
Lady Gu prepared
and made all these dishes herself.

705
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,550
Your Highness,
I don't know your preferences.

706
00:37:05,563 --> 00:37:06,083
Therefore,

707
00:37:06,163 --> 00:37:07,340
I made some home-cooked dishes

708
00:37:07,362 --> 00:37:08,882
that I learned from Nanny.

709
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:12,003
You guys may leave.

710
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,710
I need to speak with Lady Gu in private.

711
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:15,150
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

712
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:31,483
Miss Gu,

713
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,442
you've always been nice to me.

714
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:36,282
And, I know

715
00:37:36,683 --> 00:37:37,842
what's on your mind.

716
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:45,282
Your Highness, I know you detest me.

717
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:47,802
You think that I'm shameless.

718
00:37:48,362 --> 00:37:49,940
You think that I joined
Eastern Palace

719
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,110
while you were away
after His Majesty granted us a marriage.

720
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:54,922
However,

721
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:56,683
I had no choice too.

722
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:04,963
Yes.

723
00:38:05,442 --> 00:38:07,242
I do admit that I'm a bit selfish.

724
00:38:07,322 --> 00:38:08,203
But it's all because

725
00:38:08,282 --> 00:38:09,483
I admire you, Your Highness.

726
00:38:10,282 --> 00:38:11,043
I know

727
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,802
I shouldn't trouble you.

728
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,322
I also know

729
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,762
that Your Highness only fancies
Her Highness.

730
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,762
This has nothing to do with
the crown princess.

731
00:38:20,322 --> 00:38:21,483
I will never fancy you

732
00:38:21,922 --> 00:38:23,282
even if she doesn't exist.

733
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:25,842
I saved you

734
00:38:26,802 --> 00:38:28,402
because

735
00:38:29,402 --> 00:38:30,402
I would save anyone else

736
00:38:30,963 --> 00:38:31,963
who was in your shoes

737
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:33,882
under the same circumstances.

738
00:38:34,203 --> 00:38:35,722
I don't expect you to repay me.

739
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,603
After that, you've done a lot for me.

740
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:40,980
You made an embroidery
of my mother's portrait.

741
00:38:41,123 --> 00:38:41,922
You located my nanny

742
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:43,203
and took care of her for me.

743
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,643
I'm grateful to you
for everything.

744
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,882
Your Highness, I don't expect you
to be grateful to me.

745
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,322
When I returned to the capital,

746
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,670
you already joined Eastern Palace

747
00:38:56,683 --> 00:38:58,043
as my lady of excellence.

748
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,110
And, you tried to
take your own life too.

749
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,640
So I thought
it was inappropriate for me

750
00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:03,563
to tell you all these back then.

751
00:39:04,282 --> 00:39:05,322
But I came here today

752
00:39:06,123 --> 00:39:07,762
to clarify myself.

753
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,680
I don't want your future
to be ruined because of me.

754
00:39:14,362 --> 00:39:15,362
Your Highness,

755
00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:18,643
you're my future!

756
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:19,922
How could you say

757
00:39:20,043 --> 00:39:21,242
such a thing?

758
00:39:22,523 --> 00:39:23,762
Although I'm the crown prince,

759
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:25,683
I don't intend to have

760
00:39:26,402 --> 00:39:28,322
any other wives or concubines except for

761
00:39:28,402 --> 00:39:29,483
the crown princess.

762
00:39:31,123 --> 00:39:32,603
I know that I'm cornering you

763
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,010
if I kick you out of Eastern Palace.

764
00:39:34,242 --> 00:39:35,003
So, you can stay

765
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,123
in Eastern Palace.

766
00:39:36,683 --> 00:39:38,963
I'll visit you from time to time

767
00:39:39,322 --> 00:39:40,802
so that you won't be embarrassed.

768
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:44,322
At least you won't be humiliated
in Eastern Palace.

769
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:47,242
However, you and I
will never form a relationship.

770
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,802
You can only carry a false title
as my lady of excellence.

771
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,910
However, you don't need
to restrain yourself.

772
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:55,322
Just tell me when you find
someone you like.

773
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:58,270
I can announce
that you've passed away from illness

774
00:39:58,802 --> 00:40:00,362
or that you intend to become a nun.

775
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:02,043
I'll find an excuse

776
00:40:02,362 --> 00:40:03,710
to send you out of Eastern Palace.

777
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,320
You can change your name
and identity.

778
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:07,083
After that,

779
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,802
you can get married
to your loved.

780
00:40:10,362 --> 00:40:11,563
You're still young.

781
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,110
You should spend your life

782
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,842
together with someone who loves you.

783
00:40:17,722 --> 00:40:19,563
But Your Highness, I only fancy you.

784
00:40:19,922 --> 00:40:20,483
I only wish

785
00:40:20,483 --> 00:40:22,163
to spend my life together with you.

786
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:24,163
Your Highness,

787
00:40:24,203 --> 00:40:25,282
these words of yours

788
00:40:25,282 --> 00:40:27,083
are like daggers stabbing
through my heart!

789
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:30,043
I truly have no idea

790
00:40:30,163 --> 00:40:31,802
what I've done

791
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:34,203
for you to detest me this much!

792
00:40:35,603 --> 00:40:36,762
You're a fine girl.

793
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:40,362
I just don't fancy you.

794
00:40:42,402 --> 00:40:44,603
But Your Highness, I fancy you!

795
00:40:44,762 --> 00:40:45,802
Your Highness, I fancy you

796
00:40:45,922 --> 00:40:47,322
more than Her Highness!

797
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:48,922
Her Highness has a strong personality,

798
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:50,643
and she always argues with you.

799
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:51,762
As for me,

800
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:52,762
I'll be content

801
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:54,523
as long as you show me

802
00:40:54,643 --> 00:40:56,563
some love.

803
00:40:56,643 --> 00:40:58,043
I will never treat you

804
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,410
like how Her Highness treats you!

805
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:02,802
Your Highness,

806
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,483
you always treated Her Highness well.

807
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:06,683
But how did she treat you back?

808
00:41:07,563 --> 00:41:08,842
That's our personal affair.

809
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:11,083
Miss Gu,

810
00:41:11,483 --> 00:41:12,402
I assume

811
00:41:12,523 --> 00:41:13,402
you know

812
00:41:13,563 --> 00:41:15,523
the vast difference
between a one-sided affair

813
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:16,963
and mutual affection all along.

814
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:18,362
Your Highness.

815
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:19,882
Your Highness,

816
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:21,163
you never

817
00:41:21,242 --> 00:41:22,483
even gave me a chance.

818
00:41:22,722 --> 00:41:26,083
How would you know
that you wouldn't love me in the future?

819
00:41:26,842 --> 00:41:28,322
I don't like to drag things out.

820
00:41:28,483 --> 00:41:30,242
And, I don't like being ambiguous.

821
00:41:30,963 --> 00:41:31,603
Miss Gu,

822
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,000
I've already said
everything I needed to say.

823
00:41:34,802 --> 00:41:35,483
Take care.

824
00:42:12,882 --> 00:42:13,603
Lady Gu?

825
00:42:16,442 --> 00:42:17,282
Lady Gu?

826
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,163
What exactly did His Highness tell you?

827
00:42:26,563 --> 00:42:28,842
Seems like His Highness
didn't take a single bite.

828
00:42:35,003 --> 00:42:36,123
Why?

829
00:42:55,003 --> 00:42:56,922
His Highness told me

830
00:42:57,483 --> 00:42:59,922
to settle down in Eastern Palace.

831
00:43:01,483 --> 00:43:03,483
He said he would visit me often.
