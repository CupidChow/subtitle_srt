=Episode 27=

29
00:01:50,604 --> 00:01:51,283
Young Master,

30
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,110
I've helped Lieutenant He
to settle down.

31
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:54,923
She won't wake up

32
00:01:56,323 --> 00:01:57,644
no matter how bumpy the ride is.

33
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:00,080
Now that we're parting ways,

34
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:03,960
I don't know if we'll be able to
see each other again.

35
00:02:05,403 --> 00:02:07,043
Young Master, it was my pleasure

36
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:09,723
to serve you all these years.

37
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:12,364
Don't be silly.

38
00:02:13,244 --> 00:02:15,204
If Great General does rush inside,

39
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:16,324
just tell him

40
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,003
that I forced you to do so.

41
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:23,044
You must protect yourself.

42
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:25,403
Come and find me

43
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:27,204
once you've escaped.

44
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:37,644
What sound is that?

45
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:46,123
That's the sound of the Cui Army's
heavy cavalry.

46
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:48,364
What kind of heavy cavalry is that?

47
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:49,964
Even the ground is trembling.

48
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:51,044
That's the reason

49
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:53,244
why the Cui Army was known as
the Army of Victory.

50
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:55,003
Nothing can stop

51
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:56,364
the Cui Army's heavy cavalry.

52
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:00,123
No matter who

53
00:04:00,244 --> 00:04:01,764
or what formation is in front of them,

54
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:04,683
the Cui Army's heavy cavalry

55
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:08,484
will trample upon all of them.

56
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:17,043
Ying?

57
00:05:17,363 --> 00:05:18,043
Ying!

58
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:33,803
Run!

59
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,283
Run!

60
00:05:39,843 --> 00:05:40,524
Run!

61
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:41,884
Didn't you hear me?

62
00:05:42,564 --> 00:05:44,283
Run!

63
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,723
This fellow is still useful to us.
Take him with us!

64
00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:56,483
Ying?

65
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:57,564
Ying?

66
00:05:58,403 --> 00:05:59,084
Ying!

67
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:13,684
Ying,

68
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:16,723
you mustn't do this again.

69
00:06:17,884 --> 00:06:19,204
If you keep this up,

70
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:22,043
you'll break my heart.

71
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:28,124
Shiqi!

72
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:29,803
I'm here.

73
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:36,843
Shiqi,

74
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,004
are you real?

75
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:44,043
It's me.

76
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:47,803
Did you know something?

77
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:49,483
One day,

78
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:52,324
I finally managed to escape

79
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,324
and see you.

80
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:57,843
In the end, I realized
that it was a dream.

81
00:06:58,163 --> 00:06:59,403
It wasn't real.

82
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:03,283
You're seeing the real me now.

83
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,270
Don't believe me? Look.

84
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:09,324
It's true.

85
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:27,444
We've gathered

86
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:28,603
all the bulls we could find

87
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:30,163
within 100 li radius.

88
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:32,923
We tied barks

89
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:34,204
onto their stomach.

90
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:36,004
You guys have no idea.

91
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:37,764
When the bulls were charging,

92
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:39,243
the ground was trembling.

93
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:41,764
The people from the mansion

94
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:44,204
thought that it was
the Cui Army's heavy cavalry.

95
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:47,043
They were so terrified
that they shouted:

96
00:07:47,163 --> 00:07:49,723
"The Army of Victory's
heavy cavalry is here!"

97
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:52,884
It was such a magnificent scene.

98
00:07:54,243 --> 00:07:55,884
What's with your injury then?

99
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:00,644
Don't mention that.

100
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,243
When I was charging ahead

101
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:04,644
with the bull,

102
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:05,803
the Jieshuo people

103
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:07,324
panicked for some time.

104
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:10,124
But when they saw that it wasn't
the Cui Army's heavy cavalry,

105
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:12,043
they started to fight back.

106
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:13,564
During the encounter,

107
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:16,004
I saw that Shu was running away.

108
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:17,163
I went after him.

109
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:18,483
I was injured

110
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:20,723
due to my carelessness.

111
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:22,843
Keep on bragging, won't you?

112
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:24,843
That's more than just a minor injury.

113
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,084
Listen,

114
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:28,084
Bao has sustained serious injuries.

115
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:29,843
You're not allowed to fight

116
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,884
for at least one year.

117
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,044
If not, even the deities can't save you
when your internal organs are ruptured.

118
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:35,603
I can't fight?

119
00:08:35,603 --> 00:08:36,404
That's worse than

120
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:37,804
forbidding me to drink!

121
00:08:38,843 --> 00:08:40,243
You can't drink either.

122
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:40,763
You...

123
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:41,830
But you can have some peanuts.

124
00:08:41,843 --> 00:08:43,164
Yeah, you should have more.

125
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:43,964
Have more peanuts.

126
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:44,804
Ear,

127
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:46,363
you should hurry

128
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:47,204
and marry Taozi.

129
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:48,523
If not,

130
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:50,483
she'll interfere
with our affairs all day long.

131
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:52,404
Precisely.

132
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:54,123
You're wrong.

133
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:56,044
Miss Taozi still can interfere
with our affairs

134
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:57,404
after getting married to Ear.

135
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,804
- Wait.
- That's right.

136
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,363
You didn't understand what Bao meant.

137
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:03,444
After Miss Taozi gets married to Ear,
she'll only be minding his business.

138
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:05,804
- She doesn't have time for us.
-  That's right.

139
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:07,123
Miss Taozi is a righteous person.

140
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:08,483
Even after she gets married,

141
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:10,284
she'll still tend to us if we're injured.

142
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:12,603
Touch wood.

143
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:13,804
I don't want to get injured.

144
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:14,564
Miss Taozi,

145
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:15,924
you don't need to worry about me.

146
00:09:16,284 --> 00:09:17,164
Miss Taozi

147
00:09:17,164 --> 00:09:18,723
doesn't need to worry about us.

148
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:20,400
She only needs to worry about
the number

149
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,324
of children she'll have with Ear.

150
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:23,003
Am I right?

151
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,883
- That's right!
- Get yourself some babies!

152
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:25,564
Taozi!

153
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:27,564
Miss Taozi, don't go!

154
00:09:27,564 --> 00:09:28,363
Taozi! How many children?

155
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:28,964
Miss Taozi!

156
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:29,763
How many children?

157
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:30,924
- Go away!
- What about a dozen?

158
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:32,324
Taozi, don't listen to their nonsense.

159
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:34,550
They're just spouting nonsense.

160
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,210
Don't be angry.

161
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:39,444
(Qingyun Temple)
Greetings, Your Highness. I, Han Chang, am here.

162
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,260
General Han, spare the formalities.

163
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:43,763
Now,

164
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:45,483
I'm just a cultivator.

165
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:47,483
Please do not mention

166
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,204
my past titles again.

167
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:50,843
Yes.

168
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:53,763
Please have a seat.

169
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:03,284
His Highness

170
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:04,204
is doing well.

171
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,404
He was elated when he heard

172
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,523
that I was going to see you.

173
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:11,084
He wished that he could see you
personally one day.

174
00:10:12,924 --> 00:10:14,643
He must be much taller now.

175
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,960
The situation in the capital
is still chaotic.

176
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:20,883
If not,

177
00:10:21,523 --> 00:10:23,044
I would've brought him here secretly.

178
00:10:25,404 --> 00:10:26,964
Lord Qin once promised me

179
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,110
that he would assist
the great imperial grandson

180
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:30,243
to ascend the throne.

181
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:33,924
Even now, you still think

182
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:35,763
that Lord Qin is trustworthy?

183
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:40,123
I still think that he's trustworthy.

184
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,940
Although Lord Qin is trustworthy,

185
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,324
Lord Xin and Lord Qi have the intention
of usurping the throne.

186
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:47,620
Lord Xin is the eldest prince.

187
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:48,964
Lord Qi is ranked second.

188
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,780
However, Lord Qin has rendered
plenty of military merit.

189
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,180
His siblings are
extremely jealous.

190
00:10:54,123 --> 00:10:56,044
Lord Xin is heartless and unfaithful.

191
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:57,723
He's easily

192
00:10:58,164 --> 00:10:59,204
irritable

193
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:00,804
and ruthless.

194
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:02,843
However, he's quite dense.

195
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,444
I could tell from the incident
where he murdered his wife.

196
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:09,684
I just hope

197
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:11,564
that he could be imprisoned forever.

198
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:13,924
Yes.

199
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,510
I will contact the old subordinates
loyal to the late crown prince.

200
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:19,084
I'll make sure Lord Xin

201
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:20,883
stay imprisoned.

202
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:23,164
As for Lord Qi,

203
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,500
although he's trying his best to
hide his intention,

204
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:26,883
people can tell

205
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:28,883
that he has his eyes on

206
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:30,284
the crown prince's throne.

207
00:11:31,564 --> 00:11:32,363
He's only

208
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:36,444
witty without possessing true intelligence.

209
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,363
He'll give himself away eventually.

210
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:41,643
When that happens, we can take him down

211
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:43,044
in one fell swoop.

212
00:11:45,243 --> 00:11:45,723
Yes.

213
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:55,404
She's here.

214
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,723
Miss Cui, please try the Zhenxi Army's
special roasted lamb.

215
00:11:57,723 --> 00:11:58,363
Thank you.

216
00:11:58,723 --> 00:11:59,483
Let me have a try.

217
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,200
- Let's eat.
- It's delicious.

218
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:02,084
Mister Shiqi.

219
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,603
Yeah, right?

220
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:04,883
Mister Shiqi,

221
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,164
we've been hiding something
from you all along.

222
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,523
What is it?

223
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:12,763
Did you drink in Fengying Pavilion
without my permission again?

224
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,763
That's not it.

225
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:15,804
Before this,

226
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:16,444
I asked you

227
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,723
for some money so that

228
00:12:17,723 --> 00:12:19,603
we could drink in Fengying Pavilion.

229
00:12:19,603 --> 00:12:20,670
Actually, that wasn't the case.

230
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:21,804
We spent the money

231
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:23,123
on something else.

232
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:24,483
Bao, you shouldn't say that.

233
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:25,404
You're making it as if

234
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:26,804
we spent the money

235
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:28,044
on somewhere indecent.

236
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:28,804
That's right.

237
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:30,776
You guys spent the money

238
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:31,736
on somewhere indecent?

239
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:32,736
What kind of place?

240
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:33,937
It's that place
in Fengying Pavilion...

241
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:36,097
Taozi, eat up.

242
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:37,457
Yeah, you should eat up.

243
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:37,937
Have some lamb.

244
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:38,720
What kind of place?

245
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:39,416
I don't know.

246
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:41,697
We spent that money to rescue a person.

247
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:42,937
That's right.

248
00:12:42,937 --> 00:12:44,457
That's right. We rescued a person.

249
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:45,337
That's right.

250
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:47,896
No, we rescued two people.

251
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:49,016
That's right. Two.

252
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:49,510
That's right.

253
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:50,496
We saved Madam Qin

254
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:52,177
and her daughter, Xi.

255
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,496
War has been going on
for quite some time.

256
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:55,416
Madam Qin's husband

257
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,937
was beaten to death
because he couldn't return

258
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:58,500
the grain borrowed
from the imperial mansion.

259
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,857
Madam Qin couldn't repay his debt

260
00:12:59,857 --> 00:13:01,136
even when she's a performer.

261
00:13:01,136 --> 00:13:02,896
The troupe leader was forcing her
to be a prostitute.

262
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,977
He even wanted to sell her daughter off, Xi.

263
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:06,776
She's only four years old.

264
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:08,136
Can we stand for that?

265
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:09,736
Of course not!

266
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:11,256
After our discussion,

267
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:13,817
we redeemed Madam Qin from the troupe.

268
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:15,496
We helped Madam Qin

269
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,917
to settle down in Youde's hometown.

270
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:19,256
And, we even made
three straw huts for her.

271
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,896
It's in Zhao Village,
Pangxiang Sanlichong,

272
00:13:20,896 --> 00:13:22,697
Yizhou, Ju Prefecture.

273
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:24,217
Sanlichong is a great place.

274
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:25,256
There are mountains and rivers.

275
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:27,016
There are also plenty of
ducklings in the river.

276
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:27,857
Ducklings.

277
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:28,697
That's right.

278
00:13:28,697 --> 00:13:29,577
They can lay eggs too.

279
00:13:30,297 --> 00:13:32,136
All those ducklings will breed
new ducklings.

280
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:33,416
Mister Shiqi,

281
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,697
by then, we'll return to Laolan Pass
together with you.

282
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:36,217
That's right.

283
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:37,256
Return to Laolan Pass!

284
00:13:37,577 --> 00:13:38,376
Head to Sanlichong!

285
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:39,136
Mister Shiqi,

286
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:40,496
we already came to an agreement.

287
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:42,280
We'll retire from the military
when we get old.

288
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:44,896
We'll move to Sanlichong
from Laolan Pass.

289
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:46,016
You can visit us

290
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:47,177
when you're bored.

291
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:48,896
Come and visit us.

292
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:49,736
Mister Shiqi,

293
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:50,496
we've realized

294
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,416
your bragging for you.

295
00:13:51,616 --> 00:13:52,776
16 mu of fertile land

296
00:13:52,776 --> 00:13:55,177
and four top-grade cows,
we've already prepared them for you.

297
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:56,457
We've prepared them for you.

298
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,616
If that's the case, I think...

299
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:01,697
All right. It's a deal!

300
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:03,577
It's a deal!

301
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:05,577
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

Yingzhou is a cold place.

307
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,610
There are rarely any fireflies there.

308
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:10,990
You're considered lucky
if you can encounter one

309
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:12,457
during the eve of fall.

310
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:14,656
However,

311
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:16,496
on the night I was born,

312
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:18,217
a firefly

313
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,616
flew in from the window

314
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,577
and stopped on top
of my swaddling clothes.

315
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:23,937
It was gleaming.

316
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:25,376
That's why Mother

317
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:28,097
gave me the nickname, Ying.

318
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:30,577
So, that's how

319
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:31,416
you got your name.

320
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:35,416
I got my name

321
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:38,297
from Bureau of Imperial Clan.

322
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:41,337
It has a positive meaning.

323
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:45,057
They hoped that I could
be witty and intelligent.

324
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,616
That's why they named me Ni.

325
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,256
However,

326
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:49,697
I didn't have a nickname.

327
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,937
My nanny called me Shiqi since young.

328
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,457
Everyone started calling me that eventually.

329
00:15:57,817 --> 00:15:58,857
If so,

330
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:01,097
I'll only call you Shiqi from now on.

331
00:16:03,656 --> 00:16:04,457
I was so furious

332
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:07,536
when you addressed me as Lord Qin.

333
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:26,577
My father knew that I liked fireflies
since I was young.

334
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:28,097
He always told me this:

335
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,177
"Ying,

336
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:30,937
I'll catch a firefly for you.

337
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:32,817
Promise me one thing after that, okay?"

338
00:16:33,256 --> 00:16:34,776
He either made me read

339
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,097
or write.

340
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:37,536
But I always tricked him.

341
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:38,736
I told him this:

342
00:16:38,857 --> 00:16:39,697
"Father,

343
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:41,697
one firefly isn't enough.

344
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:43,496
You have to catch 100 fireflies for me

345
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:44,770
before I'll make you a promise."

346
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:47,776
But he was too busy.

347
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:49,376
He didn't have the time

348
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:50,896
to catch them for me.

349
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:53,136
Therefore,

350
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,217
I've never witnessed

351
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,656
how it looked like
when 100 fireflies were together.

352
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:02,857
But tonight,

353
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:04,097
I'm sure there are

354
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:05,376
at least 100 fireflies here.

355
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:13,570
Give me your hand.

356
00:17:34,257 --> 00:17:34,936
Ying,

357
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:38,216
I'll catch 100 fireflies for you.

358
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:40,136
Can you promise me one thing?

359
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:48,577
I won't.

360
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,616
I won't agree to it

361
00:17:52,976 --> 00:17:54,737
no matter how many fireflies

362
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:56,936
you catch for me.

363
00:18:02,696 --> 00:18:04,257
Tonight's a joyous occasion.

364
00:18:05,857 --> 00:18:07,497
Let's drop the topic,

00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:08,936

This is an emergency!

394
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:12,537
Jieshuo has captured Baishui Pass?

395
00:20:12,696 --> 00:20:14,057
Where is Baishui Pass?

396
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:15,817
Your Majesty,

397
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:17,216
Baishui Pass

398
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,976
is a key point in Lianzhou.

399
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:21,136
It's the most important gateway

400
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,456
to our north.

401
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:23,896
Yanzhou and Zhuozhou

402
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:25,857
lie beyond Baishui Pass.

403
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,416
There's no defensible position there.

404
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,656
They can only fend off our enemies
near Mang River.

405
00:20:30,737 --> 00:20:32,017
Jieshuo's cavalry

406
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:35,057
can actually go straight
for Shuozhou's inland.

407
00:20:36,696 --> 00:20:37,376
Your Majesty,

408
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:40,257
how were they able
to capture Baishui Pass?

409
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:41,376
That's an important pass

410
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:43,456
for us to keep Jieshuo at bay.

411
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:45,976
Cui Yi, General Pingliang,

412
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:48,136
should have stationed
his main army there.

413
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:50,210
According to the emergency report,

414
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:52,057
the defending general of Baishui Pass

415
00:20:52,057 --> 00:20:53,936
was convinced by Liu Chengfeng,
Cui Yi's adopted son,

416
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:56,696
to surrender to Jieshuo.

417
00:20:56,976 --> 00:20:59,057
Cities southward of Baishui Pass

418
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,497
were filled with fire and smoke.

419
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:03,416
They were trampled upon by
Jieshuo's cavalry.

420
00:21:03,616 --> 00:21:05,057
We need a few more days

421
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:07,936
before we could hear about the details.

422
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:10,176
I heard

423
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,817
that a few days ago, Cui Yi left Luoyang

424
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:12,696
together with his army

425
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:13,656
and headed northward.

426
00:21:14,337 --> 00:21:16,497
What does Cui Yi mean by that?

427
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,057
Since his adopted son was the one
who captured Baishui Pass,

428
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:20,176
if Cui Yi

429
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:22,057
was colluding with Jieshuo all along,

430
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:22,896
I'm afraid

431
00:21:22,936 --> 00:21:24,737
our nation is in peril now.

432
00:21:25,176 --> 00:21:26,216
Where's Lord Qin?

433
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,737
He wants to fight

434
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,696
whenever I don't need him.

435
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,510
But where has he gone to
when I need him now?

436
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
That brat!

437
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,176
He just has to make me mad, huh?

438
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:46,737
Jun,

439
00:21:47,216 --> 00:21:49,337
Father still sees you
as his favorite son.

440
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,656
However, some officials

441
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:52,896
appeared out of nowhere

442
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:55,017
and demanded you
to be severely punished.

443
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,777
Putting you
under house arrest wasn't enough.

444
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,817
They wanted Father to strip you
of your title too.

445
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:00,936
Father wasn't happy
when he heard that.

446
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:03,416
But it was inappropriate for him
to defend you in public.

447
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:05,376
It's all Li Ni...

448
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:06,300
It's all his fault.

449
00:22:07,017 --> 00:22:07,896
By the way, Jun,

450
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,297
this time, Father

451
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:10,936
was truly irritated with Li Ni.

452
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,577
He even reprimanded him today.

453
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,010
He said not only did he leave the capital
without an imperial edict,

454
00:22:15,097 --> 00:22:16,456
but he also went

455
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:18,136
to your imperial mansion,

456
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,337
stole the grain there,

457
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:20,817
and distributed them to the farmers.

458
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,656
He went overboard!

459
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:25,337
He's bent on going against me!

460
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:27,817
He wants to embarrass me!

461
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:29,817
How dare he...

462
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:30,896
How dare he rob my mansion

463
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:32,376
when I'm under house arrest?

464
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:33,577
Father said

465
00:22:33,577 --> 00:22:34,537
he was expecting

466
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:36,136
Li Ni to fend off Jieshuo.

467
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,136
But Cui Yi kept telling him

468
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:39,577
that he was near Shuozhou.

469
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:42,310
In the end, Father changed his mind
and let Cui Yi fend off the invaders.

470
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:44,216
He even said that he would send him
to reclaim Luoyang

471
00:22:44,216 --> 00:22:45,696
after his return.

472
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:47,777
In conclusion,

473
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:50,297
he just owns the Zhenxi Army.

474
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:51,817
So what if he can fight a war?

475
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:54,416
We have no choice.

476
00:22:54,737 --> 00:22:55,656
The Zhenxi Army

477
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:57,297
only listens to his command.

478
00:22:57,857 --> 00:23:00,136
The Zhenxi Army belongs
to the imperial court!

479
00:23:00,656 --> 00:23:01,976
It doesn't belong to him!

480
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:03,976
People neglected that fact before this

481
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:05,057
because times were chaotic.

482
00:23:06,057 --> 00:23:07,656
Now that the world is at peace,

483
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:10,297
what gives him the right
to command the Zhenxi Army?

484
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:11,616
Doesn't that give him

485
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,456
the power to do whatever he wants?

486
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:14,737
That's right, Jun.

487
00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:16,577
The officials have
already criticized him.

488
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:18,696
Father told him off too.

489
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:19,537
But even so,

490
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:21,817
he still retains power
over the Zhenxi Army.

491
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:28,094
(Cui)

492
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:33,537
Father.

493
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:34,696
Excellent.

494
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:36,416
I'm glad that you're safe.

495
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,456
Let me take a look at you.

496
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:41,216
You're fine.

497
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,936
Luckily, you just lost some weight.
You're not injured.

498
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,297
Father, you've gotten slimmer too.

499
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,616
You look frailer too.

500
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,550
I'm sure it was because
you were worried about me

501
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,936
while having to command your army.

502
00:23:52,136 --> 00:23:53,817
When I received a letter from Taozi

503
00:23:53,936 --> 00:23:55,857
saying that Lord Qin had rescued you,

504
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,537
to be honest, that was the only night

505
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,017
I could sleep.

506
00:24:00,777 --> 00:24:01,970
I was deeply worried about you

507
00:24:02,456 --> 00:24:04,497
from the start until the end.

508
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,176
Sorry for making you worried.

509
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,017
Why hasn't Lord Qin entered our camp?

510
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:21,297
Is he afraid of

511
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:22,817
the Cui Army's might?

512
00:24:23,936 --> 00:24:24,817
Father,

513
00:24:24,936 --> 00:24:26,017
Lord Qin sent me here

514
00:24:26,017 --> 00:24:27,017
to rendezvous with you.

515
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,297
He'll be leaving soon.

516
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:31,057
Look at him.

517
00:24:31,896 --> 00:24:33,656
He's not even sweating a bit.

518
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,280
How dare he say
that he's making an effort

519
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:37,136
to rescue my daughter?

520
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,297
Father,

521
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:40,896
he already took a huge risk
by leaving the capital

522
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,470
with his army without an imperial edict.

523
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:45,537
Tell his stupid father

524
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,337
to chop off his head then.

525
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:48,456
Father!

526
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:15,737
He's actually leaving, huh?

527
00:25:18,176 --> 00:25:19,616
He rescued you, you know?

528
00:25:20,176 --> 00:25:21,456
Why didn't you send him off?

529
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:23,537
Father, you just said

530
00:25:23,537 --> 00:25:24,857
you wanted his stupid father

531
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,136
to chop off his head.

532
00:25:26,136 --> 00:25:27,936
That's a different matter.

533
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:30,097
He saved your life, you know?

534
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:31,817
Why didn't you see him off?

535
00:25:33,337 --> 00:25:34,057
Forget it.

536
00:25:35,216 --> 00:25:36,297
There's no need for that.

537
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:37,896
I told you already.

538
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:42,097
Everyone from the Li family is stupid.

539
00:25:42,216 --> 00:25:43,176
Father,

540
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,896
whose side are you on now?

541
00:25:46,656 --> 00:25:47,777
He's truly hopeless.

542
00:25:47,777 --> 00:25:48,777
He's hopeless.

543
00:25:53,456 --> 00:25:54,456
Reporting in!

544
00:25:55,696 --> 00:25:56,456
Great General,

545
00:25:56,456 --> 00:25:57,777
Jieshuo has captured Baishui Pass!

546
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:04,097
Father, do you remember

547
00:26:04,257 --> 00:26:05,696
what you should say about Cui Yi

548
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,017
and Baishui Pass?

549
00:26:07,216 --> 00:26:08,737
You must refute Lord Qin

550
00:26:08,737 --> 00:26:09,777
and make him

551
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,616
unable to speak up for Cui Yi.

552
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,017
Don't worry.

553
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:14,616
It's not that long.

554
00:26:14,777 --> 00:26:16,497
I can remember that.

555
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:19,057
If so, I shall take my leave.

556
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:31,297
His Highness has arrived.

557
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,817
Greetings, Father.

558
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:41,936
So, you still remember
that this is your home?

559
00:26:42,616 --> 00:26:44,976
I did go a little further
than I expected for my hunt.

560
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,416
You said you went on a hunt, huh?

561
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,616
If so, why were you

562
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:51,456
at your brother's imperial mansion?

563
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:52,416
And, you even robbed

564
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:54,057
his mansion

565
00:26:54,297 --> 00:26:55,497
of food.

566
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,976
Father, I was planning to ask you why

567
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,370
you said you wanted to
release Lord Xin from house arrest

568
00:26:59,656 --> 00:27:01,497
on the imperial court.

569
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,017
You want to release him
after such a short period?

570
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:05,656
You're abusing your power here.

571
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:07,410
The people will think ill of you.

572
00:27:08,257 --> 00:27:10,376
Don't tell me what to do here.

573
00:27:10,777 --> 00:27:12,656
You're the same
as those civil officials.

574
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:14,497
You say that I'm abusing my power here?

575
00:27:14,577 --> 00:27:15,537
Who's the emperor here?

576
00:27:15,537 --> 00:27:17,057
You? Or me?

577
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,060
Father, you shouldn't
say something like that.

578
00:27:19,257 --> 00:27:21,097
Don't try to lecture me.

579
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:22,696
I dare not do so.

580
00:27:23,097 --> 00:27:24,257
You dare not do so?

581
00:27:25,216 --> 00:27:27,410
But you're bold enough
to do all the things, aren't you?

582
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:35,497
Cui Yi left Luoyang
together with his army.

583
00:27:35,497 --> 00:27:36,737
I heard that his daughter

584
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:38,416
had just returned to Luoyang.

585
00:27:39,216 --> 00:27:41,097
Not many troops were stationed there.

586
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:45,136
Since you're back,

587
00:27:45,976 --> 00:27:47,497
you should reclaim Luoyang

588
00:27:47,616 --> 00:27:48,817
together with the Zhenxi Army.

589
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:51,337
Father.

590
00:27:52,656 --> 00:27:54,656
Cui Yi is fending off Jieshuo
at the North.

591
00:27:55,136 --> 00:27:57,010
But now, you're ordering me
to attack Luoyang?

592
00:27:57,857 --> 00:27:59,577
What if Cui Yi hears about this?

593
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:02,510
Father, aren't you afraid that this news
will affect their morale?

594
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:06,416
Luoyang is imperial court's capital.

595
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:10,136
Cui Yi has occupied it
shamelessly for a long time.

596
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:13,537
Shouldn't we attack him
while he least expects it and reclaim it?

597
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:15,817
I wonder what's on your mind.

598
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,337
You love to fight, right?

599
00:28:18,337 --> 00:28:19,616
Now I'm sending you to fight them.

600
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:20,950
But you're defying my orders here.

601
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:22,696
Father,

602
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,380
Cui Yi is fending off the invaders
at the frontline.

603
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:26,857
We can't attack him
from the back.

604
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:32,337
The military report
already stated the reason

605
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:35,176
why Baishui Pass was captured.

606
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:37,896
Cui Yi's son was the one
who convinced them to surrender.

607
00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:40,857
The defending general
spared him on account

608
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:42,257
of their past ties.

609
00:28:42,257 --> 00:28:43,057
But him?

610
00:28:43,176 --> 00:28:44,817
He killed the defending general

611
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:46,577
together with Jieshuo.

612
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:51,216
Cui Yi raised a traitorous son

613
00:28:51,216 --> 00:28:52,936
who betrayed his nation.

614
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:55,416
Everyone in the imperial court

615
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:57,376
wants him to be punished.

616
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,577
Prime Minister Gu was the one
who advised me

617
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,857
to let him atone for his sin
by rendering merit.

618
00:29:03,257 --> 00:29:03,936
Father,

619
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:07,577
Cui Yi severed his ties with his adopted son,
Liu Chengfeng, long ago.

620
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:09,810
Because Liu Chengfeng
colluded with Jieshuo.

621
00:29:10,456 --> 00:29:12,537
The Cui family and Jieshuo
are sworn enemies.

622
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:14,416
Of all the families to doubt,

623
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,110
the Cui family shouldn't be the one
you doubt.

624
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:19,176
Lord Qin,

625
00:29:21,057 --> 00:29:22,696
you've truly

626
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:24,737
disappointed me.

627
00:29:26,136 --> 00:29:27,936
Let me ask you this.

628
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,010
My order is for you to reclaim Luoyang
with the Zhenxi Army.

629
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:34,017
Will you

630
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:35,656
follow my order or not?

631
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:36,976
I will not.

632
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:40,857
Father, please permit me

633
00:29:41,097 --> 00:29:42,416
to return to Laolan Pass.

634
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:54,497
Lord Qi

635
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,017
will take command of
the Zhenxi Army for now.

636
00:29:57,456 --> 00:29:58,817
You can return to your residence

637
00:29:59,656 --> 00:30:01,456
and reflect upon your actions.

638
00:30:01,857 --> 00:30:02,577
Yes, Father.

639
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:03,976
I shall take my leave.

640
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:16,787
(Lord Qin's Residence)

641
00:30:20,297 --> 00:30:21,136
Shiqi!

642
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,696
What are you doing here?

643
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:27,297
Don't mention that.

644
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:28,737
His Majesty allowed Lord Qi

645
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,470
to take command of the Zhenxi Army for now
during morning court.

646
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,290
Lord Qi ordered me and Father
to leave the capital immediately.

647
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:35,616
Father will head to Lingzhou

648
00:30:35,896 --> 00:30:36,936
while I'll head to Bizhou.

649
00:30:37,577 --> 00:30:40,257
Lord Qi has premeditated this
for a long time.

650
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,290
That day, Father was abnormally eloquent

651
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:43,777
when he ordered me

652
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:45,537
to reclaim Luoyang.

653
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,936
Father can never
think of something like that.

654
00:30:49,216 --> 00:30:52,176
I assume Lord Qi was the one
who told him what to say.

655
00:30:52,857 --> 00:30:54,017
He's doing so

656
00:30:54,176 --> 00:30:55,777
to divide

657
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:57,057
our forces

658
00:30:57,216 --> 00:30:59,057
and segregate the Zhenxi Army.

659
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,097
I'm unhappy with life in the capital.

660
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,337
We've been spending time
ever since I went to Laolan Pass

661
00:31:06,337 --> 00:31:07,456
while I was a teenager.

662
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:09,497
You understand my feelings too.

663
00:31:10,497 --> 00:31:13,416
I think there's no point in living
in the imperial residence.

664
00:31:14,057 --> 00:31:15,017
The palace

665
00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:16,857
is even worse.

666
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:21,857
But Shiqi,

667
00:31:23,057 --> 00:31:24,737
none of us can
return to Laolan Pass now.

668
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:34,136
Ying always wanted me to understand

669
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:36,136
that both Lord Xin

670
00:31:36,497 --> 00:31:37,337
and Lord Qi

671
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:38,696
were untrustworthy.

672
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:42,520
She said they shouldn't be the ones
ruling the world.

673
00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:46,857
She wants me to be the crown prince.

674
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:50,097
But I promised Consort Xiao

675
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,320
that I would assist
the great imperial grandson.

676
00:31:54,057 --> 00:31:55,097
Ying and I

677
00:31:55,777 --> 00:31:57,057
were deeply in love.

678
00:31:58,857 --> 00:31:59,976
However, we grew estranged

679
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:02,057
because of this issue.

680
00:32:04,497 --> 00:32:05,376
Actually, I understand

681
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,537
where she's coming from.

682
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:09,537
However, there's something

683
00:32:11,216 --> 00:32:12,497
I haven't told her yet.

684
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:15,737
Shiqi,

685
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:19,497
what exactly are you worried about?

686
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:21,857
That's right.

687
00:32:23,936 --> 00:32:25,337
I'm indeed worried about something.

688
00:32:28,176 --> 00:32:29,456
Sun Jing is dead.

689
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:31,376
The world is at peace.

690
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:34,376
Where should the Zhenxi Army

691
00:32:35,097 --> 00:32:36,416
go from here?

692
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,456
Where should the Cui Army

693
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:40,696
go from here?

694
00:32:43,737 --> 00:32:45,176
If I do become the crown prince,

695
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:47,817
will the imperial court be able to agree

696
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:49,480
that the crown princess
owns the Cui Army?

697
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:52,857
Even if I do become the crown prince,

698
00:32:54,216 --> 00:32:55,216
Cui Yi will never

699
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:57,057
hand the Cui Army to me.

700
00:32:59,176 --> 00:32:59,857
That day,

701
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:04,097
Father ordered me
to reclaim Luoyang.

702
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:05,337
I rejected him.

703
00:33:06,497 --> 00:33:09,857
He handed the Zhenxi Army to Lord Qi
out of spite.

704
00:33:11,097 --> 00:33:13,497
It's because I didn't want
to engage Ying in battle.

705
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:16,777
But once I become the crown prince,

706
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:19,656
I have no choice

707
00:33:19,656 --> 00:33:21,497
but to suppress the Cui Army myself.

708
00:33:34,535 --> 00:33:36,027
(Cui Residence)

709
00:33:37,456 --> 00:33:38,416
400,

710
00:33:38,857 --> 00:33:39,497
500,

711
00:33:40,097 --> 00:33:40,857
600.

712
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:48,337
Where is he?

713
00:33:50,337 --> 00:33:50,936
Taozi!

714
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:53,456
You scared me.

715
00:33:54,896 --> 00:33:55,416
Here you go.

716
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:56,976
What is it?

717
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,656
That's a lot of money.

718
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:05,057
These are my savings.

719
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,497
I forgot to give it to you last time

720
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:09,177
as I was in a rush.

721
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:11,976
This is a lot of money.

722
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:13,080
Why are you giving it to me?

723
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:14,137
Keep it for me first.

724
00:34:14,777 --> 00:34:15,976
We can use it in the future.

725
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:18,456
In the future, I...

726
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,056
Why must I keep it for you?

727
00:34:20,576 --> 00:34:21,456
In the future?

728
00:34:21,617 --> 00:34:22,976
What do you mean by that?

729
00:34:23,217 --> 00:34:24,137
I don't understand.

730
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:27,376
Taozi,

731
00:34:27,697 --> 00:34:29,737
I thought you already said yes
to me last time.

732
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:30,496
But you...

733
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:31,857
Silly guy.

734
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:33,217
I was just teasing you.

735
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,857
You fell for it so easily.

736
00:34:36,536 --> 00:34:37,737
You scared me.

737
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:39,016
All right.

738
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,536
I'll keep this money

739
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,737
on your behalf.

740
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:42,817
In the future,

741
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:43,576
I'll keep

742
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:44,737
my money together with it too.

743
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,096
Maybe

744
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,857
we can buy some land

745
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:49,376
or open a shop in the future.

746
00:34:49,496 --> 00:34:50,016
Okay.

747
00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:51,697
Whatever you say.

748
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:53,697
You have to be more alert in the future.

749
00:34:53,817 --> 00:34:54,576
You mustn't

750
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:55,617
be duped that easily.

751
00:34:55,936 --> 00:34:56,416
Okay.

752
00:34:56,657 --> 00:34:57,657
Let's go then.

753
00:34:57,657 --> 00:34:58,896
I'll bring you around Xichang.

754
00:34:59,297 --> 00:34:59,936
Let's go.

755
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:01,576
Taozi.

756
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:03,657
Over here. This side is busier.

757
00:35:05,496 --> 00:35:07,257
Mister Shiqi!

758
00:35:07,376 --> 00:35:08,536
Wake up!

759
00:35:08,896 --> 00:35:10,016
Wake up!

760
00:35:10,536 --> 00:35:12,297
Mister Shiqi, wake up!

761
00:35:13,217 --> 00:35:14,257
What's the matter?

762
00:35:14,617 --> 00:35:16,177
I have good news for you.

763
00:35:16,337 --> 00:35:17,896
Miss Cui is here.

764
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:19,177
What?

765
00:35:19,337 --> 00:35:21,257
Miss Cui has arrived at Xichang.

766
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:22,376
Taozi is here too.

767
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:24,096
Ear is meeting up with Taozi
as we speak.

768
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:25,096
I heard

769
00:35:25,096 --> 00:35:28,617
that Miss Cui came here just to seek
an audience with His Majesty.

770
00:35:30,317 --> 00:35:31,576
Seeking an audience with
His Majesty?

771
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:33,496
That's what I heard from Miss Taozi.

772
00:35:33,657 --> 00:35:34,376
She said

773
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:37,056
Miss Cui came here to seek an audience
with His Majesty

774
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:38,297
on Great General Cui's behalf.

775
00:35:38,297 --> 00:35:39,137
Therefore, she hopes

776
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,936
that she can seek an audience
with His Majesty during a court session.

777
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,360
She's trying to drive me crazy here.

778
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:47,617
Mister Shiqi,

779
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:48,896
you shouldn't say that.

780
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:50,617
Although she's here to see His Majesty,

781
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,337
it's likely that she's here to see you.

782
00:35:53,456 --> 00:35:54,617
You'll break her heart

783
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:56,217
if you say that.

784
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,257
You don't understand.

785
00:35:58,857 --> 00:35:59,896
What do you mean?

786
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:00,936
Teach me then.

787
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:01,817
I'm all ears.

788
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,110
The imperial court is fearful
of the Cui family.

789
00:36:09,177 --> 00:36:10,257
It's a controversial topic.

790
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,376
All of them are like boiling pots
filled with oil.

791
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:15,936
It'll explode as long as
there's a single drop of water.

792
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:18,817
And now, she's adding fuel to the flame.

793
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:23,416
Besides, she said she would seek
an audience with His Majesty

794
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:24,610
on Great General Cui's behalf.

795
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:26,976
That's beyond comprehension.

796
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,936
Even Great General cannot enter the capital
without an imperial edict.

797
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:30,737
Moreover,

798
00:36:30,737 --> 00:36:32,016
she's just his daughter.

799
00:36:32,297 --> 00:36:33,896
How could she attend a court session?

800
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:36,576
The civil officials

801
00:36:36,576 --> 00:36:38,217
will drown her with their words.

802
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,617
I don't understand at all.

803
00:36:40,737 --> 00:36:42,337
Why does it sound like

804
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:45,777
you're worried about Miss Cui?

805
00:36:52,456 --> 00:36:53,737
She's witty and intelligent.

806
00:36:54,217 --> 00:36:55,576
I don't need to worry about her.

807
00:36:57,297 --> 00:36:59,016
Since she's already here,

808
00:36:59,936 --> 00:37:02,177
why don't you go and see her?

809
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:07,817
No, I won't.

810
00:37:10,217 --> 00:37:11,096
Are you sure?

811
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:12,777
I won't.

812
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:14,376
Are you sure about this?

813
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:28,876
(Go Classics)
The Ministry of Rites

814
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:30,710
has been arguing among themselves
for the past few days.

815
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:32,617
Even now, there's no result.

816
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:34,217
I wonder when

817
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:35,817
you can see His Majesty.

818
00:37:42,337 --> 00:37:43,217
Young Lady,

819
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:45,857
do you wish to see Lord Qin?

820
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:52,617
Lord Qin is something else.

821
00:37:53,456 --> 00:37:55,096
You've already been here for a few days.

822
00:37:55,257 --> 00:37:56,697
But he didn't even visit you.

823
00:37:57,416 --> 00:38:00,576
Last time, he rushed all the way there
just to rescue you.

824
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:01,896
After that,

825
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:03,617
he even sent you back to Great General.

826
00:38:03,737 --> 00:38:04,936
Back then, I thought

827
00:38:06,137 --> 00:38:09,337
that he was pretty nice to you.

828
00:38:09,976 --> 00:38:11,576
It's only been a few days,

829
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,217
yet he's treating you

830
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:14,697
like a stranger again.

831
00:38:16,456 --> 00:38:18,016
Have you met Xie Chang'er?

832
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:20,297
Of course I have.

833
00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:21,217
If so,

834
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:22,817
what has he told you?

835
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:28,337
Nothing much.

836
00:38:28,936 --> 00:38:30,536
It wasn't anything important.

837
00:38:30,657 --> 00:38:32,096
If so, I assume Lord Qin

838
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:33,056
has nothing important

839
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:34,177
to tell me.

840
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,710
That's why he's not visiting me.

841
00:38:37,096 --> 00:38:38,456
That's not the case.

842
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,670
Although there was nothing important
he wanted to say,

843
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,976
you see,

844
00:38:42,297 --> 00:38:43,617
Ear and I

845
00:38:43,617 --> 00:38:45,217
went to see an acrobatic performance.

846
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:46,777
We even shopped around

847
00:38:46,777 --> 00:38:48,337
in the city.

848
00:38:48,697 --> 00:38:49,617
Even if

849
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:51,177
there's nothing important to say,

850
00:38:51,337 --> 00:38:52,297
we're happy

851
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:53,376
when we get

852
00:38:53,657 --> 00:38:55,297
to take a walk together.

853
00:38:55,976 --> 00:38:57,657
Why are you flustered when Lord Qin

854
00:38:58,217 --> 00:38:59,576
isn't visiting me?

855
00:39:00,576 --> 00:39:02,137
I'm not flustered.

856
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:03,817
I'm just worried about you.

857
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,096
Worried about me?

858
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:06,016
I was just thinking

859
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:07,976
that you might want to see Lord Qin.

860
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:09,536
Could it be...

861
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,657
Could it be that
you wish to see someone else?

862
00:39:13,257 --> 00:39:14,257
That's not true.

863
00:39:17,096 --> 00:39:18,337
What a lousy whistle.

864
00:39:24,257 --> 00:39:24,936
Taozi!

865
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:25,530
(Cui Residence)

866
00:39:25,536 --> 00:39:27,376
(Cui Residence)
What took you so long?

867
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,416
Mister Shiqi was treating everyone
to a drink at Fengying Pavilion.

868
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:31,910
I rushed here when I heard the whistle.

869
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,697
I was late because it was too far away.

870
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:36,416
Did you say Lord Qin was treating
you guys to a drink

871
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,456
at Fengying Pavilion?

872
00:39:37,657 --> 00:39:38,337
That's right.

873
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,096
If so, did he say

874
00:39:41,096 --> 00:39:42,496
that he would visit Young Lady?

875
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:44,697
No.

876
00:39:46,496 --> 00:39:47,817
What's wrong with him?

877
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:49,576
Since he's treating you guys to a drink,

878
00:39:49,576 --> 00:39:50,936
that means he's not busy.

879
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:51,857
If he's not busy,

880
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,040
why didn't he visit Young Lady?

881
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:54,896
Bao asked him the same question.

882
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:56,777
But Mister Shiqi acted as if

883
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:58,056
he didn't hear him.

884
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,337
Why did they

885
00:40:01,737 --> 00:40:03,257
get into a quarrel again?

886
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:04,177
Yeah.

887
00:40:04,617 --> 00:40:05,217
They seemed

888
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:06,416
harmonious

889
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:09,697
on their way back
after Mister Shiqi saved Miss Cui.

890
00:40:09,857 --> 00:40:11,536
They didn't argue

891
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:12,496
or get into a fight.

892
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:13,976
They were courteous to each other.

893
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:16,217
Silly guy, what do you know?

894
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,576
It's only troublesome when
they don't argue

895
00:40:18,737 --> 00:40:19,976
or get into a fight.

896
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:22,337
This won't do.

897
00:40:22,737 --> 00:40:24,257
We have to think of something.

898
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:25,536
What do you mean?

899
00:40:26,896 --> 00:40:28,177
Since

900
00:40:28,496 --> 00:40:30,297
he's not willing to see her,

901
00:40:30,737 --> 00:40:32,416
and she's not willing to see him,

902
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:35,096
one of them

903
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:37,137
has to

904
00:40:37,257 --> 00:40:38,576
take the first step somehow.

905
00:40:39,297 --> 00:40:41,257
Wait, come again?

906
00:40:41,257 --> 00:40:42,456
I'm confused.

907
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:43,697
Got it.

908
00:40:44,496 --> 00:40:45,697
Let's buy some dried fruits.

909
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,777
What's with that response?

910
00:40:47,936 --> 00:40:49,217
Let's buy some dried fruits.

911
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:50,896
Come on.

912
00:40:50,896 --> 00:40:51,536
Hurry up.

913
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,950
I heard that Fengying Pavilion's
the best restaurant in the capital.

914
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,137
It does live up to its name.

915
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,777
The food here is great.

916
00:41:01,777 --> 00:41:02,777
The liquor is great.

917
00:41:03,737 --> 00:41:04,896
Although it's great,

918
00:41:05,056 --> 00:41:05,936
it's a shame

919
00:41:05,936 --> 00:41:07,230
that Bao can't take alcohol now.

920
00:41:07,337 --> 00:41:08,177
Where's Bao?

921
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,697
He said he was going to take a leak.

922
00:41:09,697 --> 00:41:10,297
Don't tell me

923
00:41:10,297 --> 00:41:11,137
he fell into the loo?

924
00:41:11,896 --> 00:41:12,896
Since he said that,

925
00:41:12,896 --> 00:41:14,056
I'm sure he went to the loo.

926
00:41:14,177 --> 00:41:15,777
Why did you say he fell into the loo?

927
00:41:15,777 --> 00:41:16,817
One can only take a leak

928
00:41:16,817 --> 00:41:17,617
in a loo.

929
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:18,617
Is he going to somewhere else?

930
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:19,496
But of course.

931
00:41:19,697 --> 00:41:20,416
What about this?

932
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:21,337
Let's make a bet.

933
00:41:21,657 --> 00:41:22,456
Let's play a game.

934
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:23,536
The winner

935
00:41:23,737 --> 00:41:24,297
will drink

936
00:41:24,337 --> 00:41:27,100
while the loser has to find Bao
and see if he has fallen into the loo.

937
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:27,697
All right.

938
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:28,456
Let's do it!

939
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:29,576
Come on!

940
00:41:31,337 --> 00:41:32,576
My good brothers!

941
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:33,857
Three stars!

942
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:35,056
Five leaders!

943
00:41:35,056 --> 00:41:36,297
Six prosperity!

944
00:41:36,297 --> 00:41:38,817
Five leaders!

945
00:41:38,817 --> 00:41:40,096
Four wealth!

946
00:41:40,217 --> 00:41:41,416
My good brothers!

947
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,657
Six prosperity!

948
00:41:42,657 --> 00:41:43,976
Five leaders!

949
00:41:43,976 --> 00:41:45,257
Eight horses!

950
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:46,697
I won!

951
00:41:46,697 --> 00:41:48,857
Mister Shiqi,
guess who's in the next room?

952
00:41:49,657 --> 00:41:50,217
My turn.

953
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,376
- Again!
- Let me take a bite.

954
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:52,857
My good brothers!

955
00:41:52,857 --> 00:41:54,096
Seven wonders!

956
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,536
Six prosperity!

957
00:41:55,536 --> 00:41:56,056
Eight horses!

958
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,056
Three stars!

959
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:57,896
He lost!

960
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,496
I lost.

961
00:41:58,496 --> 00:41:59,056
Mister Shiqi,

962
00:41:59,056 --> 00:42:00,496
don't you wish to check it out?

963
00:42:02,137 --> 00:42:02,857
Fine.

964
00:42:02,857 --> 00:42:03,976
Anyway, I've already notified you.

965
00:42:03,976 --> 00:42:05,330
It's your business
whether you go or not.

966
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:06,697
Come! Give it a try!

967
00:42:06,697 --> 00:42:07,456
Let's do it.

968
00:42:07,936 --> 00:42:08,896
Let's continue.

969
00:42:09,056 --> 00:42:10,496
My good brothers!

970
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:11,976
One star!

971
00:42:11,976 --> 00:42:13,217
Five leaders!

972
00:42:13,217 --> 00:42:14,536
Seven wonders!

973
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:15,177
Taozi,

974
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:17,697
(Wolong Dried Fruits Store)
why did you buy so many dried fruits?

975
00:42:18,297 --> 00:42:20,217
Young Lady loves them.

976
00:42:20,576 --> 00:42:22,896
I intend to move her

977
00:42:22,976 --> 00:42:24,096
with these dried fruits.

978
00:42:24,496 --> 00:42:24,737
Bao,

979
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,857
Taozi instructed us
to forbid you from drinking

980
00:42:27,857 --> 00:42:28,456
in the next year.

981
00:42:28,456 --> 00:42:28,990
Put it down.

982
00:42:29,576 --> 00:42:31,137
Fine.

983
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:33,456
Bao, get us some peanuts.

984
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,297
- Yeah.
- That's right.

985
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:34,936
That's right, Bao.

986
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:36,177
I have plenty of peanuts.

987
00:42:36,496 --> 00:42:37,217
Here you go.

988
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:37,737
Give it to me.

989
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:38,297
Catch.

990
00:42:38,496 --> 00:42:39,416
Eat up.

991
00:42:40,617 --> 00:42:41,737
What is this?

992
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:43,297
Mister Shiqi, I'll give you two.

993
00:42:43,857 --> 00:42:44,536
Bao is so stingy.

994
00:42:44,536 --> 00:42:45,456
You're so stingy.

995
00:42:45,456 --> 00:42:46,777
Take it or leave it.

996
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:49,056
This liquor is pretty strong.

997
00:42:49,137 --> 00:42:50,376
I need to take a leak.

998
00:42:52,016 --> 00:42:53,016
Mister Shiqi, take your time.

999
00:42:53,257 --> 00:42:55,496
Let's continue.

1000
00:42:55,936 --> 00:42:57,137
Six six!

1001
00:42:57,137 --> 00:42:58,737
My good brothers!

1002
00:42:58,737 --> 00:43:00,217
Six prosperity!

1003
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:01,777
Come here.

1004
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:05,416
Place your bets.

1005
00:43:05,536 --> 00:43:06,617
Let's make a bet

1006
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,857
whether Mister Shiqi
will check out the next room or not.

1007
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,016
Place your bets.

1008
00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:12,896
I think he'll surely check it out.

1009
00:43:12,896 --> 00:43:13,337
All right.

1010
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:14,217
Ten wen!

1011
00:43:14,576 --> 00:43:15,657
He'll go, ten wen!

1012
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:16,536
Anyone else?

1013
00:43:16,536 --> 00:43:18,137
He won't go, all-in!

1014
00:43:18,217 --> 00:43:19,496
He has to go!

1015
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:20,137
All right!

1016
00:43:20,857 --> 00:43:22,137
20 wen!

1017
00:43:23,056 --> 00:43:24,257
He won't go, 20 wen!

1018
00:43:24,257 --> 00:43:26,137
All right. He won't go, huh? It's a deal.

1019
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,217
No sore losers here, all right?

1020
00:43:27,217 --> 00:43:28,257
- All right!
- All right!

1021
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:06,536
We can't hear anything.

1022
00:44:06,536 --> 00:44:07,857
If only Ear was here.

1023
00:44:32,777 --> 00:44:33,817
Young Lady.

1024
00:44:35,617 --> 00:44:36,257
Young Lady,

1025
00:44:37,137 --> 00:44:39,576
Lord Qin bought
your favorite dried fruits

1026
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,496
to deliver them to you.

1027
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:41,576
Really?

1028
00:44:42,657 --> 00:44:43,337
Yeah.

1029
00:44:43,657 --> 00:44:44,337
Young Lady,

1030
00:44:44,456 --> 00:44:45,737
you might not know,

1031
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:48,056
but one has to queue for eons
before they can buy

1032
00:44:48,056 --> 00:44:49,016
these dried fruits.

1033
00:44:50,297 --> 00:44:51,096
Let me try them.

1034
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:53,536
He's back.

1035
00:44:53,697 --> 00:44:54,737
He's back.

1036
00:44:54,737 --> 00:44:55,617
Mister Shiqi,

1037
00:44:56,177 --> 00:44:57,536
did you check out the room?

1038
00:44:57,536 --> 00:44:58,496
Did you? You didn't, right?

1039
00:44:58,496 --> 00:44:59,536
Did you enter the room?

1040
00:44:59,817 --> 00:45:00,536
I didn't.

1041
00:45:03,137 --> 00:45:04,297
Guys, accept your losses.

1042
00:45:04,297 --> 00:45:05,416
Fine.

1043
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,536
Youde, here you go.

1044
00:45:06,936 --> 00:45:07,857
Youdao, here.

1045
00:45:08,137 --> 00:45:09,337
Mister Shiqi,

1046
00:45:09,337 --> 00:45:10,536
why didn't you enter the room?

1047
00:45:10,536 --> 00:45:12,177
I lost so much money because of you.

1048
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,056
You must have no idea.

1049
00:45:14,936 --> 00:45:16,217
Mister Shiqi was the best scout

1050
00:45:16,217 --> 00:45:17,536
we had.

1051
00:45:17,536 --> 00:45:18,896
I'm sure he found out

1052
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:20,657
that there were two burly men

1053
00:45:20,657 --> 00:45:22,177
instead of Miss Cui
in the next room.

1054
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,617
That's why he didn't fall for it.

1055
00:45:23,617 --> 00:45:24,376
That's right.

1056
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:25,310
There were three people.

1057
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:26,536
Three people?

1058
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:28,737
But I only saw two people.

1059
00:45:29,337 --> 00:45:31,617
They ordered liquor and food
enough for two.

1060
00:45:31,617 --> 00:45:33,610
They only had two pairs
of chopsticks in the room.

1061
00:45:33,737 --> 00:45:34,177
You...

1062
00:45:34,536 --> 00:45:35,617
How did you find out

1063
00:45:35,617 --> 00:45:36,976
that there were three people?

1064
00:45:37,056 --> 00:45:38,416
One of them is downstairs.

1065
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:39,310
He just came upstairs.

1066
00:45:39,857 --> 00:45:41,576
They are hemp traders.

1067
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,016
They just arrived from Xingzhou.

1068
00:45:43,376 --> 00:45:45,016
They have plenty of money.

1069
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,297
The other guy went
to exchange his currency.

1070
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,857
He didn't want to
eat at Fengying Pavilion.

1071
00:45:48,857 --> 00:45:50,016
He still came here eventually.

1072
00:45:50,177 --> 00:45:51,017
That's why the waiter

1073
00:45:51,017 --> 00:45:52,790
prepared another set of bowl
and chopsticks for them.

1074
00:45:52,976 --> 00:45:55,297
Mister Shiqi is amazing indeed.

1075
00:45:56,016 --> 00:45:57,337
I'm impressed.

1076
00:45:57,456 --> 00:45:58,576
I told you already.

1077
00:45:58,576 --> 00:46:00,536
Although Mister Shiqi
didn't enter the room,

1078
00:46:00,536 --> 00:46:02,016
he could definitely

1079
00:46:02,016 --> 00:46:03,376
figure out

1080
00:46:03,376 --> 00:46:04,817
who was in the next room.

1081
00:46:04,817 --> 00:46:05,936
You weren't willing to believe me.

1082
00:46:05,936 --> 00:46:07,177
You just had to make the bet.

1083
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,056
Now, you've lost.

1084
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:08,697
Pay up!

1085
00:46:08,697 --> 00:46:09,857
We'll pay up.

1086
00:46:11,096 --> 00:46:12,297
- This is mine.
- I've lost ten wen again.

1087
00:46:12,297 --> 00:46:12,936
Young Lady,

1088
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,300
since Lord Qin bought these dried fruits
for you especially,

1089
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:16,697
don't you think

1090
00:46:16,697 --> 00:46:18,257
we should buy him something

1091
00:46:18,257 --> 00:46:19,536
in return?

1092
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:23,496
They're pretty nice.

1093
00:46:23,896 --> 00:46:25,337
At least you didn't queue in vain.

1094
00:46:28,657 --> 00:46:29,737
How did you know

1095
00:46:29,737 --> 00:46:31,536
that Lord Qin didn't buy
these dried fruits?

1096
00:46:34,697 --> 00:46:36,496
You saw through at once, huh?

1097
00:46:37,016 --> 00:46:39,016
I guess Lord Qin
wouldn't fall for it too.

1098
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:40,857
Fall for what?

1099
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,610
Xie Chang'er brought some of these

1100
00:46:43,416 --> 00:46:45,456
back to him too.

1101
00:46:45,657 --> 00:46:47,297
We intended to say

1102
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:48,416
that you were the one

1103
00:46:48,416 --> 00:46:49,416
who bought these for him.

1104
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:50,777
But now,

1105
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:52,976
I don't think he'll fall for it.

1106
00:46:54,456 --> 00:46:55,056
Here.

1107
00:46:56,177 --> 00:46:57,817
The buyer should finish it then.

1108
00:47:02,016 --> 00:47:03,896
I queued for a long time
just to buy them.

1109
00:47:03,896 --> 00:47:05,137
They're pretty good.

1110
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:06,456
It must've been tough.

1111
00:47:07,217 --> 00:47:08,400
Fine, I'll finish them myself.

1112
00:47:11,016 --> 00:47:12,737
Here. Let me offer you a toast.

1113
00:47:14,936 --> 00:47:15,896
Jun,

1114
00:47:16,217 --> 00:47:17,777
I'm sure you know this too.

1115
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,310
Although Father put me in charge
of the Zhenxi Army temporarily,

1116
00:47:21,376 --> 00:47:22,737
Pei Xian and his son

1117
00:47:22,737 --> 00:47:24,177
would never obey my orders.

1118
00:47:24,576 --> 00:47:25,617
My position

1119
00:47:25,777 --> 00:47:27,617
is just for show.

1120
00:47:28,257 --> 00:47:29,337
You're 100 times better

1121
00:47:29,337 --> 00:47:30,857
than me.

1122
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,817
I'm stuck here for an unknown period.

1123
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,817
Jun, you shouldn't be so dejected.

1124
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,657
Right now, there's
an opportunity for you

1125
00:47:36,657 --> 00:47:38,210
for you to make a plea
in front of Father.

1126
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:41,337
What opportunity?

1127
00:47:41,777 --> 00:47:42,617
What opportunity?

1128
00:47:43,456 --> 00:47:45,096
Mother's death anniversary is arriving.

1129
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:47,257
Father will definitely go easy on you

1130
00:47:47,337 --> 00:47:48,817
on account of our late mother.

1131
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:50,137
You're right.

1132
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:53,257
Mother's death anniversary is nearing.

1133
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,217
If so, I'll submit a fold to Father

1134
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:56,536
to tell him about it.

1135
00:47:56,657 --> 00:47:57,936
Maybe Father

1136
00:47:57,936 --> 00:47:58,936
will release me

1137
00:47:58,936 --> 00:47:59,857
on account of Mother.

1138
00:47:59,857 --> 00:48:00,817
Jun, don't worry.

1139
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,376
I'll definitely do my best
to make a plea on your behalf

1140
00:48:03,376 --> 00:48:04,536
in front of Father.
