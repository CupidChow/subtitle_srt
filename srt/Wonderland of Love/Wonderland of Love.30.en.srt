Move.

31
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:48,949
Father, save me!

32
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:50,110
Get out of my way!

33
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,470
Father, save me!

34
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,509
Father!

35
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:55,589
Jun,

36
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,589
get up.

37
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,429
This...

38
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,630
What's going on?

39
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,630
Lord Qin is trying to kill me!

40
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:03,429
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,110
What's wrong?

42
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:07,149
Lord Qin wants to seek an audience.

43
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,309
Father, did you see that?

44
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,950
He came after me
all the way to the palace

45
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,110
just so he could kill me!

46
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,869
Father, you must save me!

47
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:14,749
Save me!

48
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,189
Do not allow Lord Qin to enter!

49
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,610
Tell him to kneel
in front of the palace!

50
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,790
He is not to get up

51
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:20,749
without my order!

52
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,790
Yes.

53
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,510
Thank you, Father.

54
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,550
Thank you, Father.

55
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,990
Young Lady, I heard from Ear

56
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,189
that General Pei Yuan stopped Lord Qin.

57
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,270
But now, Lord Qin is still trying
to enter the palace.

58
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,670
General Pei Yuan is still trying
to persuade him.

59
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:46,950
But luckily,

60
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,990
Great General Pei Xian has brought
his men toward the palace entrance.

61
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,510
I assume

62
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,110
Lord Qin can be stopped.

63
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,110
At least he cannot carry a sword
into the palace.

64
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:56,830
Seems like

65
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,990
he's heartbroken this time.

66
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,029
Young Lady,

67
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,629
how did you know

68
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,709
that General Pei Yuan

69
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,909
could persuade Lord Qin
to stop by saying that?

70
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,429
That person

71
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,390
is loyal and devoted.

72
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,629
When he's overwhelmed with grief,

73
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,589
he would get his way

74
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:20,869
at all costs.

75
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,149
However, he would still

76
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,070
cherish Pei Yuan and his soldiers

77
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:26,909
in the Zhenxi Army.

78
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:29,869
You just need to tell him

79
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,550
that the emperor would surely

80
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,990
lash out

81
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,550
on Pei Yuan and the Zhenxi Army

82
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:36,510
if he kills Lord Xin.

83
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:39,350
Young Lady,

84
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,469
you do know Lord Qin the best indeed.

85
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,629
Since it has come to this,

86
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,629
so what

87
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,550
if I do know him?

88
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,189
So, Nanny wasn't struck
with a sudden illness.

89
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:07,869
She was poisoned.

90
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,749
Lord Xin wanted to poison Lord Qin.

91
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:14,110
However, Nanny was poisoned instead.

92
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,469
My goodness.

93
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,910
I was terrified

94
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,389
when Nanny

95
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,949
fainted in front of me.

96
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:22,590
Young Lady, that was close.

97
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:25,350
The dried lettuce was actually poisoned.

98
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,389
You almost had

99
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:27,790
the poisoned bun.

100
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:29,189
That's right.

101
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,189
I escaped death narrowly

102
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,470
this time.

103
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,230
Young Lady,

104
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:38,670
this is too dangerous.

105
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:39,710
You shouldn't

106
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:42,550
seek out Lord Qin in the future.

107
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,110
As the saying goes,

108
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,309
wealth and honor are sought from risks.

109
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,230
How could I stop seeing Lord Qin

110
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,150
because of this incident?

111
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,869
Excellent words.

112
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,869
You're my daughter indeed.

113
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,829
Father.

114
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,350
Please have a seat.

115
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:09,030
So, you found out?

116
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,670
I heard that Lord Qin

117
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,629
headed to Lord Xin's Residence
personally

118
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:15,550
together with the evidence and witness.

119
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,189
Luckily, General Pei Yuan
was there in time.

120
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,020
So Lord Xin was able to enter the palace.

121
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:23,590
This is how straightforward Lord Qin is.

122
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,949
It's also why people
take advantage of him.

123
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:28,230
Lord Xin was the one who tried
to poison him.

124
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,269
But His Majesty is
biased toward Lord Xin.

125
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,990
Naturally, he'll defend Lord Xin.

126
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,949
Lord Qin

127
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,470
made an unwise decision.

128
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:39,990
Father, what do you mean?

129
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:44,990
Lord Qin should've shown his weakness.

130
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,110
I would've told him to bring the evidence
and witness to the palace

131
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:52,590
had I known about it earlier.

132
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,710
I'll tell him to kneel and complain
to His Majesty.

133
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,910
He should say something like
he cannot believe

134
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,350
that Lord Xin tried to poison him
in order to ascend the throne.

135
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,890
However, he had to believe that.

136
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,710
Therefore, His Majesty should

137
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:06,110
strip him of his title

138
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:08,110
on account of their ties

139
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,829
and banish him to the borders.

140
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,070
If he doesn't mention anything

141
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,790
about pressing charges against Lord Xin,

142
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,069
His Majesty will definitely feel guilty.

143
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,829
All the civil and military officials,

144
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:20,470
including me, Pei Xian,

145
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,590
and Great General Cui,

146
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,429
would naturally help him

147
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,990
to keep Lord Xin in check.

148
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:30,949
I'm sure this isn't
Lord Qin's true intention.

149
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:32,550
That's right.

150
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,230
It was his game all along.

151
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,429
He could've made

152
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:36,710
an outstanding move.

153
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,829
He could even get rid of

154
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,110
Lord Xin entirely.

155
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:41,749
But he acted recklessly.

156
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:44,030
And now, he has landed himself
in such a plight.

157
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,189
Father, what do you plan to do now?

158
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,550
As subjects,

159
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,629
since Lord Qin was almost harmed,

160
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,829
we can't just sit idly by.

161
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:01,509
Lord Qin cherishes

162
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,949
his nanny greatly.

163
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,949
Naturally, he's heartbroken.

164
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:06,309
And, you were the one

165
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:07,790
who found his nanny for him.

166
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:09,910
He'll definitely be deeply moved

167
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,550
when he sees you.

168
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:14,309
You must tell him

169
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:17,189
to take care of his body.

170
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,189
I understand.

171
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,619
I've already prepared
the necessary offerings.

172
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,180
I'll head to the mourning session
in Lord Qin's Residence later.

173
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:31,030
I've never expected

174
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:34,230
that Li Jun is so unlucky.

175
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,829
He only managed to poison

176
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:37,230
Lord Qin's nanny.

177
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,309
Your Highness,

178
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,710
we're already

179
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,710
halfway there.

180
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,590
For the rest of the plan,

181
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,389
I have to go and persuade

182
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,150
my terrified brother

183
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,869
to give it one last push.

184
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:00,990
(Lord Qin's Residence)

185
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,829
Miss Gu,

186
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,790
Lord Qin isn't in.

187
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,480
His Highness has entered the palace.

188
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:07,550
He hasn't returned yet.

189
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,509
It doesn't matter.

190
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:12,829
I'm here to pay my respects to Nanny.

191
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:16,470
Your Highness,

192
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,980
we should return to the residence
if you're not entering the palace.

193
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,370
You haven't had anything the entire day.

194
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:26,350
Who taught you to say that
when we were in Lord Xin's Residence?

195
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,590
I came up with it myself.

196
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,029
It was Miss Cui.

197
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,590
She said I could only stop you

198
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,669
by saying that.

199
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:43,749
And, I also asked her why she didn't
want to tell you that herself.

200
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,340
She said you didn't want to see her.

201
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:46,830
And, you might not

202
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,830
listen to her too.

203
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,149
That's why I have to say it.

204
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,310
Shiqi,

205
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,149
actually, I was prejudiced
against Miss Cui at first.

206
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,910
However, after observing her
all this while,

207
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,909
I realized that she
had extraordinary qualities.

208
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,290
She's very considerate,

209
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:03,710
and she always plans for you.

210
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,830
The rarest thing about her

211
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,400
is that she's not arrogant or conceited.

212
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:07,710
Shiqi,

213
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,720
you two have mutual feelings
for each other.

214
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,240
You are quite the perfect couple.

215
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,909
What?

216
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,110
Pei, are you telling me

217
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:21,990
to banish Lord Xin?

218
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:24,149
Your Majesty,

219
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,110
that's my intention too.

220
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,350
But he's my son!

221
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:36,990
Even if

222
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:39,470
there's evidence and witness
that can prove

223
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,389
that Lord Xin tried to poison Lord Qin,

224
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,149
Li Ni didn't die, did he?

225
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:46,710
Why must I strip Lord Xin

226
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,950
of his title

227
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,230
and banish him?

228
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,269
Your Majesty,

229
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:52,990
Lord Qin is your son too.

230
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,029
Moreover, Lord Qin reclaimed
the two capitals.

231
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,320
He has rendered numerous merit.

232
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,350
As for Lord Xin,

233
00:09:58,509 --> 00:09:59,869
he murdered his consort.

234
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,389
Everyone in the court knows about this.

235
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,830
However, he wasn't punished for it.

236
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,549
Right after his detainment was lifted,

237
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,350
he's trying to harm his sibling.

238
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,909
He's an inhumane individual

239
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:11,310
who has committed heinous crimes.

240
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,310
Your Majesty,

241
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:15,070
are you still trying
to go against the law

242
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,509
to defend him?

243
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:20,310
Gu, it isn't that serious.

244
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,590
It's not that serious.

245
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,990
He and his brother

246
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,509
just had an argument.

247
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,710
Moreover, Lord Qin got back at Lord Xin

248
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,590
by cutting him, right?

249
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:31,909
Besides, he has already vented
his frustrations.

250
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,470
Why can't he

251
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:34,950
just let his brother off?

252
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,549
Lord Xin is his real brother, you know?

253
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,190
Your Majesty!

254
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,749
Pei!

255
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,710
What's with the sudden gesture?

256
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:49,669
Your Majesty,

257
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,190
ever since Lord Qin led
the Zhenxi Army to save the country,

258
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,470
he had reclaimed two capitals

259
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,180
and rendered numerous merit
for the nation.

260
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,310
But now, the person
who tried to harm him

261
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,070
is getting away scot-free.

262
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,110
Does that mean

263
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:04,470
anyone is free to harm your loyal subjects
who had rendered merit for the nation?

264
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,149
In the Zhenxi Army,

265
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,629
if any one of us suffers any grievances,

266
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:12,749
I will uphold justice for them
if they're under me.

267
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,909
That's the heart and soul
of the Zhenxi Army.

268
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,629
Your Majesty,
you're disregarding the law

269
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,149
in order to defend Lord Xin.

270
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,149
If so, I'll have no choice
but to lead the Zhenxi Army

271
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,350
and bring Lord Qin away
from the imperial court

272
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:27,549
so that he can be safe.

273
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:28,430
Your Majesty,

274
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,509
if you're not willing to banish Lord Xin
in accordance with the law,

275
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:32,590
I have no choice

276
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,789
but to resign from
the Palace Secretariat

277
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,629
together with the other civil officials.

278
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:40,070
Gu, Pei!

279
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,070
Do you guys need to resort to this?

280
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,629
There's no need to resort to this!

281
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:45,710
Can't you guys

282
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:48,149
just let Lord Xin off?

283
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:48,950
This...

284
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,029
Your Majesty,

285
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,509
Lord Xin harmed his wife
and tried to harm his sibling.

286
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:54,350
He has committed

287
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,909
an unpardonable sin.

288
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,990
Stripping him of his title
and banishing him

289
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,549
is the lightest punishment.

290
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,710
Jun!

291
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,389
How can you withstand

292
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:14,350
the pain of being banished?

293
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,110
I shall take my leave.

294
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,070
My subjects!

295
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,310
Please wait!

296
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,669
I can banish him.

297
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,230
But how far away
do I have to banish him?

298
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,310
According to our law,

299
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,509
he should be stripped of his title and
be banished to a place 3,000 li away.

300
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:40,149
He should be banished to the
northernmost part.

301
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,029
Can't it be somewhere nearer?

302
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:52,909
Empress Dong's death anniversary
is in a few days.

303
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:55,590
Can Lord Xin follow me

304
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:57,710
to pay respect to his mother?

305
00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:00,389
By then, I'll tell Lord Qin
to attend the session too.

306
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:02,029
I'll tell Lord Xin

307
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,149
to apologize to him.

308
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,350
That's okay, right?

309
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:07,869
Can I just banish him

310
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,549
to Qiongzhou, which is 1,000 li away?

311
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,990
Can I?

312
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,110
Your Majesty,

313
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:17,389
Empress Dong

314
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:19,549
isn't Lord Qin's biological mother.

315
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,110
Consort Liu is
Lord Qin's biological mother.

316
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,350
Lord Qin already suffered
a lot of grievances

317
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,029
when it came to the title of his mother.

318
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,910
And now, you want him to pay respect
to Empress Dong?

319
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,629
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

320
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,310
I should've appointed Liu

321
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,230
as one of my empresses too.

322
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:35,190
I shouldn't have

323
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,310
done that out of spite.

324
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:40,669
What about this?

325
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:42,869
We'll pay respect to Empress Dong first.

326
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:44,549
After that, we'll pay respect
to Consort Liu.

327
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:46,950
I'll bring Lord Xin

328
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,310
to Consort Liu's grave

329
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,110
and tell him to apologize to Lord Qin.

330
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,350
That's okay, right?

331
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,110
If Lord Xin

332
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,549
can repent in front of

333
00:13:58,669 --> 00:13:59,950
Consort Liu's grave,

334
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,430
I guess banishing Lord Xin
to Qiongzhou, which is 1,000 li away,

335
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,470
is a sign of

336
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:06,430
your love toward your son.

337
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,669
However, that's the lightest punishment
he can get.

338
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:19,149
My dear subjects,

339
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:22,269
I understand what you two mean.

340
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,990
I understand.

341
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:28,149
I cannot

342
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:33,669
defend him in the future.

343
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:42,629
Young Lady,

344
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,210
according to Great General's letter,

345
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,310
Jieshuo sent out a team
to follow Liu Chengfeng

346
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,430
into the Central Plains.

347
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,350
According to Great General's
investigation,

348
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:50,470
they disappeared

349
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,310
after entering Jizhou.

350
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,070
I assume they must've gone into hiding.

351
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:55,669
Where is Father now?

352
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:56,990
He's near Jinzhou.

353
00:14:57,869 --> 00:14:58,880
Let's meet up with Father

354
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:00,590
at the North together with our team

355
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,850
so that these Jieshuo people
won't be able to harm him.

356
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:03,110
Yes.

357
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,830
Father!

358
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,590
I was framed!

359
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:08,629
And now, I'm going to be banished?

360
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,070
You're killing me here!

361
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:12,990
Father!

362
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,190
Jun,

363
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:19,310
I've negotiated this
with Prime Minister Gu for a long time.

364
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,350
He agreed

365
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,470
to banish you to Qiongzhou,
which is 1,000 li away,

366
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,909
instead of banishing
to somewhere 3,000 li away.

367
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,070
Qiongzhou is not too bad.

368
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,190
You just need to avoid the miasma.

369
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,310
Can't they spare me from banishment?

370
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:41,110
I can't bear to part with you!

371
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:43,070
I'm afraid

372
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,070
I can never return alive

373
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,669
after parting ways!

374
00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:50,869
Jun!

375
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,830
Father!

376
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:02,470
Father!

377
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,430
Jun.

378
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,749
I can't bear to part with you.

379
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,470
I have no choice.

380
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:09,950
I have to think about

381
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,830
the officials in the court.

382
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:16,669
I can't bear to part with you.

383
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:18,310
I can't bear to part with you!

384
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:22,110
I can't bear to part with you!

385
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,430
I can't bear to part with you!

386
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:29,350
I can't bear to part with you!

387
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,350
Father,

388
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:44,190
please take care.

389
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:06,710
What kind of shabby place is this?

390
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,029
I can't get here

391
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,470
with a carriage or my horse.

392
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:13,230
Your Highness, you're already planning
to usurp the throne.

393
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,269
I'm sure you can

394
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,589
meet me in such a discreet place.

395
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:18,950
Liu Chengfeng,

396
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,789
what nonsense are you saying?

397
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,829
The one who bribed the Imperial Army
and tried to usurp the throne

398
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,349
was my eldest brother.

399
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,430
I have no intention
of killing my father.

400
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,069
Once both of my siblings are dead,

401
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:31,269
the throne will be mine.

402
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,950
Right.

403
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:36,430
Your Highness, you only wish
to reap the reward

404
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,230
while they duke it out to the death.

405
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:39,990
But don't worry.

406
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:41,670
Your Highness, I'll make sure

407
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:43,190
your wish will be fulfilled.

408
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:45,069
After all, both you and I

409
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,910
want Li Ni

410
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:49,630
dead.

411
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,990
Relay a message to Chief Wuluo for me.

412
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,829
As long as you guys

413
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:59,670
can help me become
the crown prince,

414
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,050
I'll give Yanzhou and Zhuozhou,

415
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:04,549
which are north of the Mang River, to Jieshuo.

416
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,829
I'm a man of my word.

417
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,425
(Lord Qin's Residence)

418
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,390
Shiqi.

419
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,190
Since he said

420
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,309
we're going to pay respect to
both Empress Dong and my mother,

421
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:20,789
and he'll make Lord Xin

422
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,589
repent in front of my mother's tomb,

423
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:23,950
don't worry.

424
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:25,589
I won't cause a ruckus.

425
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,789
Shiqi,

426
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,490
Lord Xin will be stripped of his title
and be banished soon.

427
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,309
That's the heaviest punishment
he'll receive.

428
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,309
Today

429
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,349
is Nanny's funeral procession.

430
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:41,670
I will let Bao and the rest

431
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,430
make it as if
I'm still part of the line.

432
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:45,829
Once we exit the city,

433
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,250
I'll proceed with
Nanny's funeral procession first.

434
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:49,400
Then I'll head to Xing Mausoleum.

435
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,710
I don't think that's appropriate.

436
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:52,430
If someone finds out...

437
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,029
We usually
exit the city in carriages.

438
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:56,749
No one will know
if I'm in the carriage or not.

439
00:18:57,789 --> 00:18:59,269
All right. You should head back.

440
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,830
Don't make your father worry.

441
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:04,910
Yes.

442
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:07,269
Brothers,

443
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,390
please take care.

444
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,190
Take care.

445
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,870
Later, you must apologize

446
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:27,789
to Lord Qin

447
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,710
in front of Consort Liu's tomb.

448
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,230
Do not stir up any trouble.

449
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,390
Yes, Father.

450
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,870
Calm down.

451
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,509
It's still early.

452
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:27,386
(Madam Zheng Meng lives on)

453
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,683
(Tomb of Madam Zheng Meng)

454
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:36,509
The Jieshuo people?

455
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,269
They're all Jieshuo people.

456
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,710
Tell Pei Yuan to bring the army here
and protect the emperor.

457
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,710
I'll lure them away.

458
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:01,509
You rush back.

459
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:02,010
Yes.

460
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:02,269
Quick.

461
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:05,990
Watch out!

462
00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:47,509
Youde,

463
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,589
something's off.

464
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,190
I feel like something's off too.

465
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,749
We're following His Majesty,

466
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,420
yet we're not allowed to
bring any weapons.

467
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,029
Guys, stay alert.

468
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:14,589
There's an assassin!

469
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:26,390
What's going on?

470
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,770
Father, don't be scared.

471
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,069
Father, I'm here to protect you!

472
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,160
I'm here to protect you.

473
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:37,890
There's an assassin!

474
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,710
Protect the emperor!

475
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,509
Capture Li Ni!

476
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,490
I never expected the Jieshuo people

477
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,620
to send out the Divine Arrow Team,

478
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,840
the strongest team under Wuluo.

479
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,749
I wonder if we can

480
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:02,309
reach Xichang by today?

481
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,870
Relay my order.

482
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,920
Cast away the heavy equipment
and get new horses.

483
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:11,069
We shall make haste.

484
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,180
Cast away your heavy equipment
and change horses.

485
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,150
We shall make haste!

486
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:15,069
- Yes!
- Yes!

487
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:39,349
Father!

488
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,430
Don't be scared!

489
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:42,269
Protect the emperor!

490
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,820
Protect the emperor!

491
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,220
Your Majesty! Protect the emperor!

492
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,320
Your Highness, the carriage is empty.
Lord Qin isn't around.

493
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,630
Jun?

494
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,630
That...

495
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:56,670
Why did that assassin
address you as His Highness?

496
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,710
Father!

497
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:09,749
Protect His Majesty!

498
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,420
Since you're not willing
to kill Lord Qin,

499
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,230
I shall do it on your behalf!

500
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,390
I have no choice since I was born
in the imperial family!

501
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,109
This...

502
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,349
So, these assassins are your men?

503
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,029
I'm your biological son.

504
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,069
But you're actually trying to banish me!

505
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:30,509
Why don't you pass the throne to me
and retire in the Western Palace?

506
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,430
Why don't you become
Emperor Emeritus?

507
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:35,509
Jun,

508
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,269
are you trying to stage a revolt?

509
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:42,870
Lord Xin is trying to stage a revolt!
Stop him!

510
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:44,829
Li Lai, you're something else.

511
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,029
I actually couldn't tell

512
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,710
that you were a backstabber all along.

513
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,150
Kill Lord Qi!

514
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:49,789
Your Majesty!

515
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,970
I'll reward you with gold
and make you a marquis!

516
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,190
Jun,

517
00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:00,190
are you trying to stage a revolt here?

518
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,509
You're actually

519
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:04,870
trying to kill your younger brother!

520
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:08,509
Your Majesty, we should hide for now.

521
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,589
Li Lai!

522
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,630
You backstabber!

523
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,150
Jun, stop struggling.

524
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:38,190
Go to hell!

525
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:11,029
So, you were the mastermind

526
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:17,029
behind everything all along.

527
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:34,990
To think that I've trusted you

528
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,630
for so many years.

529
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,990
We have no choice.
We were born in the imperial family.

530
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,150
Mister Shiqi!

531
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:22,950
Bao!

532
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,509
Are you okay?

533
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,430
Mister Shiqi, I'm fine.

534
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:31,670
Mister Shiqi!

535
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,349
Are you okay?

536
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,430
I'm fine.

537
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,109
Lai, are you okay?

538
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:51,990
Where's Father?

539
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,670
Lord Qin and Lord Xin
are staging a revolt!

540
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,230
Protect His Majesty

541
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,470
and kill Lord Qin!

542
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:50,269
Are you guys okay?

543
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,270
- Fine!
- Fine!

544
00:31:51,749 --> 00:31:53,990
Come on, you scoundrels!

545
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:56,670
Bring it on!

546
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,990
Come on, you scoundrels!

547
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,910
Kill him!

548
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:39,150
There are archers here!

549
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,190
You guys should retreat!

550
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:10,149
Youde!

551
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,470
Youde!

552
00:34:37,029 --> 00:34:38,149
Youde!

553
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,589
Youde!

554
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:44,029
Run!

555
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,950
Youde!

556
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:07,350
Youde!

557
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,029
Youde!

558
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:17,270
