Young Master Cui, General Pei Yuan,
Bingzhou is honored

30
00:02:03,027 --> 00:02:04,787
to have you two here
for the Qixi Lantern Festival.

31
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:06,548
May I request you two

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,700
to make a wish and write something
for our Qixi Lantern Festival?

33
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:09,148
Please.

34
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,428
We'll do it first.

35
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:13,547
Come, bring us a lantern.

36
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:29,025
(Peace)

37
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:29,748
Excellent words.

38
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:30,880
It brings good meaning.

39
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:33,507
Excellent!

40
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:34,588
General Pei Yuan,

41
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:36,387
let's write something practical.

42
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:37,680
Let's just write something like:

43
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:39,267
"May all of us get a wife."

44
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:41,547
Bring all of them here.

45
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:53,787
All the men in Zhenxi Army are single.

46
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:55,320
It's an army consisting of single men.

47
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,827
And now, we can't even make that wish?

48
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:58,017
(Good weather for the crops)

49
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,068
Good weather for the crops!

50
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:04,107
Excellent!

51
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:05,387
Good weather for the crops!

52
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:07,588
Excellent.

53
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:09,705
(Peace and prosperity for the nation)

54
00:03:09,947 --> 00:03:15,028
Excellent!

55
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:17,348
Excellent!

56
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:32,507
If we made that kind of fire

57
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:33,707
in Laolan Pass,

58
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:35,320
we would definitely
roast an entire lamb

59
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,840
and roast it until oil drips from it.

60
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,160
Can you imagine how nice it'll be?

61
00:03:39,308 --> 00:03:40,348
When I was young,

62
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,787
my mother often

63
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:43,947
roasted yams for me.

64
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:48,588
If so, I'll roast them for you next time.

65
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:51,908
I'm getting hungry after hearing that.

66
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:56,628
Come on, let's go and eat.

67
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:07,428
The wantons here are pretty good.

68
00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:09,267
Thank you, young lady.

69
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:11,068
I made the broth with my own recipe.

70
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:13,348
That's why it's nice.

71
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:15,428
Sir,

72
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:17,027
how's business tonight?

73
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:19,188
It's not that good.

74
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:20,707
Everyone is lining up

75
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,868
to see Han Li's execution.

76
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:23,308
He will be beheaded.

77
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:25,147
They will be beheading

78
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:28,347
the mighty Lord Han,
who ruled Bingzhou before this.

79
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:46,628
Kill him!

80
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:47,748
Young Master,

81
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:49,308
everything is ready.

82
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:57,308
Time's up!

83
00:04:57,387 --> 00:05:01,907
Execute Han Li and offer his head
to the Lake Deity!

84
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,308
Save Lord Han!

85
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:32,920
Let's go.

86
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:36,548
Guys,

87
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:38,428
check out our bracers.

88
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,147
We made them with
top-tier buffalo leather.

89
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,628
My wife sewed them personally.

90
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:44,628
It's very solid with
three layers of leather.

91
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:46,147
Mister,

92
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:47,988
you look like you practice archery.

93
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:49,827
This is the best bracer you can find.

94
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:51,347
It's pretty good.

95
00:05:51,788 --> 00:05:52,548
Young lady,

96
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:54,387
why don't you buy one
for your husband?

97
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:59,068
I fixed your pinwheel for you.

98
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:01,308
Don't you think you should
give me something in return?

99
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:03,267
He's not my husband.

100
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:06,947
But...

101
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:10,080
They look like a perfect couple.

102
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,707
Was I mistaken?

103
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:12,988
Sir,

104
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:14,907
what was that mister
inquiring about just now?

105
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:16,587
My bracers.

106
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:18,100
He inquired about them
without buying them.

107
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:19,680
I don't know what he's thinking about.

108
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,400
Your Highness, seems like
everything is under your control.

109
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,228
I guess you staged
another huge act for us.

110
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:40,507
Lieutenant He, I feel like my plan
isn't as good after hearing  what you said.

111

♪There are 18 river bends
in Laolan River♪

112

- Ying!
- Mister Shiqi!

116
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:00,147
What happened?

117
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:01,147
I'm fine.

118
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:01,907
Mister Shiqi.

119
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:02,827
How did it go?

120
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:04,880
We killed and captured those
who deserved it.

121
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,720
None of them were spared.

122
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,228
That's right.

123
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:07,600
Where's the stuff?

124
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,188
Huang,

125
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:08,947
take it out.

126
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:10,668
I found the tiger tally, you know?

127
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:11,587
It's over here.

128
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:20,548
It's over here.

129
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,707
These people are so dumb.

130
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:24,360
They didn't even know
that this was a trap.

131
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:25,840
It's not that they're dumb.

132
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,280
It's because Mister Shiqi is too smart.

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,587
- They're dumb.
- He's too smart.

134
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:30,628
Wait, I can't find it!

135
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:32,827
I thought you kept it.

136
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:35,080
You said you wanted to use it
to ward off killing intent.

137
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,788
Hurry and find it.
Where did you put it?

138
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:38,188
Youde, is it with you?

139
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:38,748
No.

140
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:39,827
Since the Cui Army

141
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:41,748
is the oriole to our mantis,

142
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:43,587
you guys don't need to hide it anymore.

143
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,228
Chen Xing.

144
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:52,748
The tiger tally!

145
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:53,827
You stole our tiger tally!

146
00:07:54,027 --> 00:07:55,027
Give it back!

147
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:56,628
- Give it back!
- It's ours!

148
00:07:56,827 --> 00:07:57,587
You stole it!

149
00:07:57,587 --> 00:07:59,947
Young lady, didn't you say you were
the imperial grandson's concubine?

150
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:01,837
Didn't you say you were going
to elope with Mister Shiqi?

151
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:03,147
Although you belong to the Cui Army,

152
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:04,587
I thought you were siding with us.

153
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:05,748
Why are you helping

154
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,587
that fair boy over there to trick us?

155
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,548
- Precisely!
- Explain yourself!

156
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:10,428
What's going on?

157
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:11,707
Such nonsense.

158
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:14,108
You two don't need to turn your argument
into such a huge ruckus.

159
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:14,868
Shut up!

160
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:20,387
Li Ni, what do you mean by this?

161
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,628
Why did you say my subordinate
was your concubine?

162
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:25,548
How could you let them

163
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:28,188
humiliate the Cui Army like this?

164
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,347
She said so herself.

165
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:32,747
She told us that she was the concubine
of the imperial grandson.

166
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:34,520
She even wanted to elope
with Mister Shiqi!

167
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,308
Precisely. Why would she
help a gigolo like you?

168
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:36,987
Ying?

169
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:38,668
Young Master,

170
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:40,028
I was in danger back then.

171
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:42,240
That's why I pretended to be a member
of the imperial family.

172
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:43,747
These guys misunderstood me

173
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,740
because they didn't know
what was going on.

174
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:50,107
Lieutenant He,

175
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:51,587
let us speak in private.

176
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:52,467
Let's go.

177
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:54,148
Do not waste your breath with him.

178
00:08:58,148 --> 00:08:58,707
Young Master,

179
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:00,308
I'll be back in a second.

180
00:09:06,148 --> 00:09:07,308
How did you find out?

181
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,508
Your men searched every corner

182
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:11,068
of the Han Residence.

183
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:12,107
I knew it by then.

184
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:13,920
I knew that you didn't manage
to find the tiger tally

185
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
even though you captured Han Li.

186
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,640
That's why you didn't waste your effort
in search of the tiger tally.

187
00:09:18,947 --> 00:09:21,068
Han Li is paranoid.

188
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,827
Since he didn't carry it with him,

189
00:09:23,148 --> 00:09:25,467
and you didn't find it
after searching the entire residence,

190
00:09:25,827 --> 00:09:27,227
that means he was keeping it

191
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:29,227
on his trusted aide.

192
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:31,908
And, you spread the news

193
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:33,908
that Han Li was going
to be executed today,

194
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:35,508
luring his remaining forces here

195
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:36,467
to save him.

196
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:38,388
Your bait

197
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:39,867
worked pretty well.

198
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:41,668
As for you,

199
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:43,188
you just need to keep an eye on my men

200
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:44,827
and steal the tiger tally from them

201
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,107
after they take it.

202
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:47,107
That's right.

203
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:51,947
There's one more thing
I don't understand.

204
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:55,428
So, you agreed
to spend the Qixi Festival together.

205
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:57,548
Did you do it
to spend the festival with me?

206
00:09:58,028 --> 00:09:59,668
Or did you do it to keep an eye on me

207
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:02,388
so that I won't find out
that you had other plans in mind?

208
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:06,587
What about you then?

209
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:08,668
Did you ask me out

210
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:09,508
so that we could

211
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:10,788
enjoy the festival together?

212
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:12,800
Or did you ask me out
because you were worried

213
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:14,227
that I might catch on to something

214
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:16,388
and spoil your plan?

215
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:22,347
Seems like we're the same.

216
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:24,587
You flatter me.

217
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:35,188
Let me take a break.

218
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:38,620
Her Highness came up with a way

219
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,240
for me to exit the palace
and practice cultivation.

220
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,107
She'll arrange for you

221
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,640
to blend into the mix
with the other servants

222
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
and exit the palace with me.

223
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:44,520
Don't be afraid.

224
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,428
We should be able to leave

225
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:47,028
in the next few days.

226
00:10:47,587 --> 00:10:48,227
Someone's coming.

227
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:49,947
I'll be going now. Take care.

228
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:55,308
Sister!

229
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:57,827
Sister!

230
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:07,827
Grand Governor has issued an order.

231
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,668
The female official serving Xiao

232
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:10,668
will replace her

233
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,520
and practice cultivation
outside the palace.

234
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:15,508
What?

235
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:17,827
Only the female official
is leaving the palace?

236
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:19,508
What about that wretch then?

237
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:20,788
Is she still here

238
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,068
to infuriate me?

239
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,268
Sister, what are you anxious about?

240
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:26,788
Since Grand Governor is smitten
with Xiao right now,

241
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,627
we have to take it one step at a time.

242
00:11:28,827 --> 00:11:29,788
As the saying goes,

243
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:31,707
a watched pot never boils.

244
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:34,068
As long as we get rid of her forces

245
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:35,467
one by one,

246
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,867
we'll be able
to get rid of her eventually.

247
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:44,987
She's the consort
of the late crown prince.

248
00:11:45,148 --> 00:11:46,600
And, she's colluding with the rebels.

249
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,388
Isn't that obvious enough?

250
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,788
Sister,

251
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:50,867
Xiao

252
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:52,627
is just a wretch.

253
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:53,788
Grand Governor is just

254
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:54,987
infatuated with her for now.

255
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,908
Since she's this arrogant,

256
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,028
I have plenty of ways to deal with her.

257
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:00,388
Sister, don't worry.

258
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:02,610
I'll be heading back to Luoyang
and observing the battle from there.

259
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:04,467
As long as the Yuan Family
keeps rendering merit

260
00:12:04,587 --> 00:12:06,227
at the frontline,

261
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:08,028
your position

262
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:09,107
in Grand Governor's heart

263
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:10,947
will be secured.

264
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:18,707
Lieutenant He,

265
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:21,227
this is a new anesthesia I invented.

266
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,120
I've applied it to the tip.

267
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,707
Try it.

268
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:24,908
Let me take a look.

269
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:40,908
Young Lady, back then,
when the imperial grandson saved you,

270
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:42,548
he took off his cloak

271
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:43,788
and put it on you.

272
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,788
He was so cool.

273
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:47,560
I was stunned
when I was watching from upstairs.

274
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:48,627
He promised us

275
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:50,028
that we could follow him.

276
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:50,788
We won't need

277
00:12:50,908 --> 00:12:52,388
to be fearful anymore.

278
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:55,068
It's all thanks to His Highness.

279
00:12:58,107 --> 00:12:59,627
Young Lady, do you think

280
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:01,308
His Highness will like this bracer?

281
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:05,508
Of course he will.

282
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:12,388
I only applied a tiny amount to it.

283
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:13,908
Greetings, Lieutenant He.

284
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:17,867
Miss Gu, you're too courteous.

285
00:13:20,388 --> 00:13:22,068
Lieutenant He, you look good

286
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:23,747
in such a dashing outfit.

287
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:25,388
Young Lady,

288
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:27,240
His Highness told us
to disguise ourselves as men

289
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,148
and follow the army.

290
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,467
Lieutenant He looks good

291
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:30,747
with a man's disguise.

292
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:32,987
Young Lady, why don't you learn
from Lieutenant He

293
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:34,587
and use her cutting?

294
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:35,747
Do not speak anymore.

295
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,388
Lieutenant He looks dashing

296
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:39,080
because of all the military training
she received.

297
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,268
That's why she looks cool

298
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:41,548
and dashing.

299
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,947
Even if I wear the same thing,

300
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:45,827
I will never look as good as her.

301
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:47,240
It doesn't matter.

302
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:50,148
Taozi prepares my attire for me.

303
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:52,160
Since you're not used
to wearing male outfit,

304
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,400
you might have no idea
that their sleeves and collar are larger

305
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,747
than the usual size.

306
00:13:58,068 --> 00:13:59,827
The male outfit you buy on the market

307
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:01,548
must be modified according to your size.

308
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:02,867
Taozi,

309
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:04,867
send the blueprint we have

310
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:06,388
to Miss Gu's room later.

311
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:07,068
Okay.

312
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,707
Thank you, Lieutenant He.

313
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:11,987
Miss Gu, you're too courteous.

314
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:14,668
This is the outfit, right?

315
00:14:15,908 --> 00:14:16,908
It's too large.

316
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:17,707
It's hard to modify.

317
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:18,388
No.

318
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:20,548
This is the shirt
His Highness had lent to Young Lady.

319
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:22,308
She washed it personally,

320
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:23,800
and she's going to return it
to His Highness.

321
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:24,548
Qiucui,

322
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:26,028
you talk too much.

323
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:29,827
Actually,

324
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:31,987
His Highness lent me this shirt

325
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:34,347
to cover my body when he saved me.

326
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:36,867
Lieutenant He,
please don't misunderstand us.

327
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:38,467
Not at all.

328
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:40,760
Miss Gu, I don't know
why you're explaining yourself to me.

329
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:42,707
I think

330
00:14:44,188 --> 00:14:45,627
I'll stop bothering you.

331
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:55,668
Lieutenant He,

332
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,788
why do I feel like

333
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:59,107
they always speak in circles?

334
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:00,827
They keep beating around the bush.

335
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:04,107
They're fair maidens.

336
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:07,068
Naturally, they're more reserved than us.

337
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,000
All right now.
Stop wasting your time here.

338
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:13,548
But they kept mentioning
the imperial grandson.

339
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:15,747
What has he got to do with us?

340
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:17,827
What has he got to do with them?

341
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:21,308
How could you know

342
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,347
that he has nothing to do with them?

343
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:35,867
(Mister, you look like you practice archery.)

344
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,987
This is the best bracer you can find.

345
00:15:38,987 --> 00:15:39,760
It's pretty good.

346
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:40,627
Young lady,

347
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:42,587
why don't you buy one for your husband?

348
00:15:45,308 --> 00:15:46,908
I fixed your pinwheel for you.

349
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,100
Don't you think you should
give me something in return?

350
00:15:54,668 --> 00:15:55,788
That Ying,

351
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,188
she never means what she says.

352
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:02,148
It looks great.

353
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:10,107
Lieutenant He,

354
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:15,520
I have something to tell you.

355
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:23,227
Some people

356
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:24,548
never mean what they say.

357
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:26,840
She never even told me
that she went out early

358
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:27,908
just to buy the gift for me.

359
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:29,908
Is that so?

360
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:34,388
She said she didn't want
to buy it for me,

361
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:35,827
but she bought it anyway.

362
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:39,268
Your Highness, seems like
you do cherish the person

363
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:41,428
who bought you these bracers.

364
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:42,508
Of course.

365
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:44,867
Although

366
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:46,188
I cherish her,

367
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:47,668
I feel like

368
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,028
she cherishes me even more.

369
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:53,188
If so,

370
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:55,947
I have to congratulate you.

371
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:02,000
What do you think about the person
who bought me these bracers

372
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,867
compared to my concubine?

373
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,000
Your Highness, mind your words.

374
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,948
Back then, I said so
as a makeshift plan.

375
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:09,960
That's why I made up such a lie
to deceive the others.

376
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:11,107
I didn't expect you

377
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:12,587
to be so frivolous

378
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:15,548
that you humiliated me and my reputation
in front of my young master.

379
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,880
You do care about
your young master very much.

380
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:18,948
Naturally.

381
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:20,000
Why is that the case?

382
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:25,760
Before this, it was inappropriate
to reveal this fact to the public.

383
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:27,187
That's why I didn't tell you about it.

384
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:28,387
Actually,

385
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,708
I'm the young master's concubine.

386
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:33,788
So, please mind your words.

387
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:35,788
Do not ruin my reputation

388
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:37,228
in front of my young master.

389
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:38,640
Taozi, let's go.

390
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:51,387
Lieutenant He,

391
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:54,748
why did you tell him
that you were Young Master's concubine?

392
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,640
We're getting to the crucial part
of the negotiation.

393
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:58,827
If we wish to disrupt him,

394
00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:01,187
we have to tell him something unexpected.

395
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:04,548
You're saying that to disrupt him?

396
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:05,387
But aren't you

397
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:07,187
ruining your reputation by doing so?

398
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:08,708
There's nothing between you

399
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:09,907
and Young Master.

400
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:12,387
You weren't his concubine.

401
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:14,640
How could you tell an outsider
something like that?

402
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,280
Don't you wish
to get married in the future?

403
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:19,228
Silly girl,

404
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:20,708
if a man truly wishes to marry me,

405
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,360
he won't mind me
saying something like that.

406
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:25,147
Wait.

407
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,268
In the past, you always said

408
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:29,107
the man who could marry you

409
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:30,508
hadn't been born yet.

410
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,708
What's with the different statement?

411
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:35,187
Did you finally find the man

412
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:36,907
you think is worthy enough to marry you?

413
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:38,268
Hurry and tell me who he is.

414
00:18:39,627 --> 00:18:40,827
He's...

415
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:43,948
It's a secret.

416
00:18:44,068 --> 00:18:45,627
Let's go. You're so long-winded.

417
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:47,068
Tell me!

418
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:48,308
I want to know who he is!

419
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:54,347
The garrison of Jianzhou
only recognizes the tiger tally.

420
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:56,387
Since the Cui Army has the tiger tally,

421
00:18:56,788 --> 00:18:58,468
Jianzhou is ours now.

422
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:00,827
You guys can go
and take the tiger tally then.

423
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,667
Don't think that I have no idea.

424
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:04,667
You guys just want Han Li, right?

425
00:19:04,907 --> 00:19:06,400
You'll use the tiger tally
to enter the city

426
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:07,760
and use Han Li to blackmail them.

427
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,948
This way, you guys can conquer Jianzhou

428
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:11,187
without wasting a single troop.

429
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:12,907
You guys already took over Bingzhou.

430
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,347
What's the use of keeping Han Li?

431
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:16,667
If so, you guys should return

432
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:18,867
the military supplies you seized
to the Zhenxi Army!

433
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:22,468
We should end this today.

434
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:24,867
I'm afraid that imperial grandson

435
00:19:25,228 --> 00:19:26,867
isn't that easy to convince.

436
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:30,867
I will get my hands on

437
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,748
Han Li by hook or by crook.

438
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:37,268
Young Master,

439
00:19:37,948 --> 00:19:39,268
your ponytail is loose.

440
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:41,228
Let me comb it for you.

441
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:42,068
Okay.

442
00:20:00,228 --> 00:20:00,988
Shiqi,

443
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:03,187
regarding Lieutenant He of the Cui Army,

444
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:05,548
I don't know if I should tell you this.

445
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:06,468
Don't tell me.

446
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,468
All right.

447
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:14,867
My young master said

448
00:20:15,068 --> 00:20:16,920
that this negotiation has been
going on for a few days.

449
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,187
According to the promise we made,

450
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:21,107
since the Zhenxi Army
has captured Han Li,

451
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:23,867
Bingzhou will belong to the Zhenxi Army.

452
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:25,587
However, the tiger tally

453
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:27,147
is with the Cui Army.

454
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:28,387
Logically speaking,

455
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:30,308
Jianzhou should belong to us.

456
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:33,068
We were the ones
who found the tiger tally.

457
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:35,028
You guys devised a plot to steal it!

458
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,907
And, Bingzhou

459
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:38,788
was ours!

460
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:40,387
But you guys entered the city

461
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:41,587
and stole our supplies!

462
00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:42,748
Return the supplies to us,

463
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,268
and we can talk about Jianzhou!

464
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:45,867
Since it has come to this,

465
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:48,068
why don't all of us calm down

466
00:20:48,187 --> 00:20:49,708
and discuss this thoroughly?

467
00:20:50,788 --> 00:20:52,347
It's easier said than done.

468
00:20:52,827 --> 00:20:54,040
You want to discuss a deal with us?

469
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:56,748
You guys just want
to take advantage of the Zhenxi Army!

470
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:58,228
Sir,

471
00:20:58,387 --> 00:20:59,708
you mustn't say that.

472
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:00,948
Since it's a deal,

473
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:02,508
our Cui Army

474
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:03,627
can compromise with you

475
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:05,468
one way or another.

476
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:06,948
Fine.

477
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:08,468
Tell me then.

478
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:10,508
How do you plan to compromise with us?

479
00:21:11,627 --> 00:21:13,347
His Highness wants

480
00:21:13,468 --> 00:21:14,867
to revive the fallen dynasty

481
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,080
and take back the two capitals
in the East and West, right?

482
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,160
But according to the military supplies
the Zhenxi Army currently has,

483
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,840
forget about taking back the two capitals.

484
00:21:22,107 --> 00:21:24,708
I'm afraid you guys can't even
reach Luoshui in this state.

485
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:27,347
If you spend a few more days in Bingzhou,

486
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:30,548
I'm afraid you'll run out
of supplies soon.

487
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:32,308
Now, our armies

488
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:34,508
are arguing over Jianzhou.

489
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:35,907
But according to the rules,

490
00:21:36,347 --> 00:21:37,228
since the Cui Army

491
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,347
has already obtained the tiger tally,

492
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:42,427
Jianzhou should belong to the Cui Army.

493
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:44,788
However, we wish to use Han Li

494
00:21:44,988 --> 00:21:46,028
to our advantage.

495
00:21:46,548 --> 00:21:50,107
That's why my young master said
we would compromise with you

496
00:21:50,387 --> 00:21:52,667
by giving you guys
50 carts of military supplies.

497
00:21:52,907 --> 00:21:55,627
This way, we can aid you guys
to reach Luoyang soon too.

498
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,347
With an army as mighty as yours,

499
00:21:57,468 --> 00:21:58,867
conquering Luoyang is an easy feat.

500
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:00,627
You're making it as if

501
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,948
we have a great deal over here.

502
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:05,548
50 carts of military supplies?

503
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,748
They can only feed the Zhenxi Army
for two meals per day.

504
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:11,760
It's barely enough for us
to reach the edge of Luoyang.

505
00:22:13,268 --> 00:22:15,988
Your Highness, I'm sure
you know which is more important

506
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:17,867
between Jianzhou

507
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:19,627
and Luoyang, right?

508
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:23,228
Naturally.

509
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:25,508
So, Your Highness, are you willing
to exchange Han Li

510
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:27,788
for 50 carts of military supplies?

511
00:22:30,907 --> 00:22:31,587
Fine.

512
00:22:31,988 --> 00:22:33,548
Mister Shiqi!

513
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:34,308
All right.

514
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:35,468
Your Highness,

515
00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:36,880
I'm sure you're a man of your word.

516
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:38,228
As long as you hand Han Li

517
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:39,548
to the Cui Army,

518
00:22:39,748 --> 00:22:40,627
our young master

519
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:42,028
will keep his promise too.

520
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:44,988
We'll deliver the supplies
to you on time.

521
00:22:45,587 --> 00:22:46,187
Mister Shiqi!

522
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:48,068
50 carts is too little for us.

523
00:22:48,587 --> 00:22:49,147
Bao,

524
00:22:49,988 --> 00:22:51,107
let me be alone for a while.

525
00:22:54,347 --> 00:22:54,827
Tell me.

526
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:56,187
What plan do you have?

527
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,068
What plan?

528
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:05,347
I assume you agreed
to Lieutenant He's deal

529
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:07,480
of exchanging Han Li for
50 carts of military supplies

530
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,360
so that you can kill three birds
with one stone.

531
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,770
You plan to take back
both military supplies

532
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,907
and Han Li while the Cui Army
let down their guard

533
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:15,268
and conquer Jianzhou
while you're doing it, right?

534
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,387
Getting back
the military supplies, Han Li,

535
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:20,107
and conquering Jianzhou.

536
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:22,520
Do you have any good plans in mind?

537
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,587
Shouldn't you say that confidently
while telling me your plan?

538
00:23:26,068 --> 00:23:26,508
If not,

539
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,320
why did you agree to Lieutenant He's deal

540
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,560
when there was nothing in it for us?

541
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:31,147
I have a friend.

542
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:36,788
This friend of mine,

543
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:38,708
he fell for a lady.

544
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,508
Once the Zhenxi Army hands Han Li to us,

545
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:44,508
tell Left Camp to start off immediately
with Han Li and the tiger tally

546
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:45,827
(Jianzhou)
tp take back Jianzhou.

547
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:47,748
I should head there personally.

548
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:48,920
No need for that.

549
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,960
With both Han Li and the tiger tally
in our hands,

550
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:53,147
Jianzhou will definitely be ours.

551
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:54,907
Conquering Luoyang

552
00:23:55,107 --> 00:23:56,268
is the hardest part.

553
00:23:57,147 --> 00:23:59,228
I assume Li Ni
will march toward Luoyang directly

554
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:00,700
after receiving the military supplies.

555
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:01,788
We must reach there

556
00:24:01,948 --> 00:24:02,827
before him.

557
00:24:04,347 --> 00:24:05,867
So, this friend of yours,

558
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,708
is he a member of the Zhenxi Army?

559
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:09,948
Or is he a friend
you made in the capital?

560
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:13,360
Why are you shaking your head?

561
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,827
Tell me.

562
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:17,147
He fell for a lady

563
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:19,147
he wasn't supposed to.

564
00:24:20,147 --> 00:24:21,548
Wasn't supposed to?

565
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,907
Could it be that he fell for a courtesan?

566
00:24:27,468 --> 00:24:28,587
That's fine.

567
00:24:29,107 --> 00:24:30,387
It doesn't matter

568
00:24:30,548 --> 00:24:31,468
as long as

569
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:32,867
the courtesan is kind.

570
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:33,600
That's not it.

571
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:35,228
What is it then? Tell me about it.

572
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,520
He finally fell for someone
after such a long time.

573
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:41,867
However, that lady

574
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:43,280
is actually someone's concubine.

575
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,748
Shiqi,

576
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:51,187
I finally understand now.

577
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:53,907
You were behaving abnormally today

578
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:55,708
all because of this.

579
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:00,387
What do you mean by that?

580
00:25:00,508 --> 00:25:01,760
Who said I was behaving abnormally?

581
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,867
I was talking about my friend.

582
00:25:04,107 --> 00:25:04,548
Fine.

583
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:07,228
Let's talk about your friend then.

584
00:25:08,147 --> 00:25:09,520
Now, the nation is facing a crisis.

585
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:11,360
Even so, he's still
thinking about his relationship.

586
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:12,948
He told you about it

587
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:14,667
because he was frustrated with it.

588
00:25:14,907 --> 00:25:16,907
That means he'll surely dwell on it
in the future.

589
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:18,587
That's not it.

590
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:19,228
Enough.

591
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:21,548
He knew that she was already taken,

592
00:25:21,748 --> 00:25:22,788
yet he still coveted her.

593
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,107
Shiqi, listen.

594
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:26,347
Lust makes one lose one's reason.

595
00:25:26,548 --> 00:25:27,708
- Actually...
- Stop.

596
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:28,827
Shiqi,

597
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:29,948
I suggest you

598
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:32,028
sever your ties with
that friend of yours.

599
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:34,028
If not, you'll be influenced by him.

600
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:37,068
What if you fall
for another person's wife one day?

601
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:40,548
Shiqi,

602
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,667
please think twice.

603
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:53,468
Li Ni looked distracted today.

604
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:55,667
He agreed to our deal that easily.

605
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,068
I wonder what happened.

606
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:00,788
Who knows?

607
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:03,240
If so, I'll ask Chen Xing
to make arrangements for the supplies.

608
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:04,308
Wait.

609
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:08,948
I have another plan.

610
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:10,308
If, by then,

611
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:12,347
they reach Luoyang earlier than us,

612
00:26:12,548 --> 00:26:13,867
we can prepare an ambush.

613
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:14,988
By then, we can...

614
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,040
Your Highness, it's my fortune
that I'm able to practice cultivation

615
00:26:27,147 --> 00:26:28,867
on your behalf.

616
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:32,107
However, Your Highness, I served you

617
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:33,788
from our residence

618
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:35,548
until the palace.

619
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:37,627
It's been so many years.

620
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:39,667
I can't bear to part with you.

621
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:41,988
Your Highness, please take care

622
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:44,788
of yourself!

623
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,587
Practicing cultivation is a good deed.

624
00:26:54,308 --> 00:26:55,708
You can render merit for both me

625
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,268
and yourself.

626
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:02,988
(I still have Jin'niang with me.)

627
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:05,187
(Don't worry about me.)

628
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:07,748
(But you,)

629
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:10,228
you should take care of yourself.

630
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:14,028
Take care of Miss Jiang
on my behalf too.

631
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:17,347
Go now.

632
00:27:17,907 --> 00:27:18,748
Yes, Your Highness.

633
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:27,120
(Your Highness, don't worry.)

634
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:30,107
(I'm leaving now.)

635
00:28:14,468 --> 00:28:15,160
Grand Governor,

636
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,480
it's done.

637
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:17,147
Excellent.

638
00:28:18,268 --> 00:28:19,587
Tell Madam about it.

639
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:20,748
Tell her

640
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:22,920
that I've vented
her frustration on her behalf.

641
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:24,627
But if Consort Xiao

642
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:25,548
finds out...

643
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:26,948
She's intelligent.

644
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:28,867
She'll surely think

645
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:30,228
that it was Duke Zheng

646
00:28:30,387 --> 00:28:31,667
who killed those maids

647
00:28:32,187 --> 00:28:33,988
to help Lady of Wei get her revenge.

648
00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:37,228
What if Consort Xiao

649
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:38,748
stirs up trouble because of this?

650
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:41,028
It'll be detrimental to Duke Zheng.

651
00:28:42,827 --> 00:28:44,667
It's just several servants.

652
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:46,187
Their lives are worthless.

653
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:48,468
I told you already.

654
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:50,508
She's intelligent.

655
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:53,760
She won't foil the bigger picture
and throw straws against the wind

656
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,988
because of the servants.

657
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:19,880
Your Highness, you're visiting me
at such a late hour.

658
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:22,187
Could it be that
you're here to steal something?

659
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:33,548
Why exactly are you here?

660
00:29:36,268 --> 00:29:37,308
I came here today

661
00:29:38,268 --> 00:29:39,107
to return this to you.

662
00:29:46,228 --> 00:29:46,907
Return what?

663
00:29:49,508 --> 00:29:50,948
I came here to explain myself to you.

664
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:52,680
I misunderstood you this morning.

665
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:54,548
I thought you bought me these bracers.

666
00:29:55,028 --> 00:29:56,600
I must've offended you with my words.

667
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:57,587
Please forgive me.

668
00:30:05,427 --> 00:30:06,740
You thought I bought them for you.

669
00:30:08,387 --> 00:30:09,028
Yes.

670
00:30:09,468 --> 00:30:11,508
I only realized that it was Miss Gu
who bought them for me.

671
00:30:11,827 --> 00:30:13,427
But I've returned the bracers to her.

672
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:16,508
You thought I bought them for you.

673
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,347
That's why you loved them.

674
00:30:18,988 --> 00:30:20,187
But after that, you realized

675
00:30:20,308 --> 00:30:21,708
that Miss Gu bought them for you.

676
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,147
And, you returned them to her.

677
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,560
You came all the way here
just to tell me that?

678
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:27,468
That...

679
00:30:27,988 --> 00:30:28,867
That's not true.

680
00:30:29,748 --> 00:30:30,508
I...

681
00:30:32,187 --> 00:30:33,627
Since the moon is so bright today,

682
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:35,600
it's a good time for me
to steal the tiger tally.

683
00:30:36,427 --> 00:30:37,708
You're wrong this time.

684
00:30:38,028 --> 00:30:39,147
The tiger tally isn't with me.

685
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:39,867
I know.

686
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:42,387
If that's the case,

687
00:30:43,147 --> 00:30:44,280
what are you doing here then?

688
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:46,627
I...

689
00:30:49,028 --> 00:30:49,948
I just...

690
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:08,347
Lieutenant He,

691
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:09,587
are you asleep?

692
00:31:14,187 --> 00:31:15,587
I'm getting ready to sleep.

693
00:31:17,147 --> 00:31:18,228
I'll go to sleep too.

694
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:20,387
All right. You may go.

695
00:31:21,147 --> 00:31:22,788
You should rest early then,
Lieutenant He.

696
00:31:22,988 --> 00:31:23,667
Got it.

697
00:31:47,347 --> 00:31:48,468
Why are you covering your eyes?

698
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:51,988
Why is your face so reddish?

699
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:54,387
This place is too hot.

700
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,187
The weather is cold today.

701
00:31:57,468 --> 00:31:59,948
But Your Highness,
you think it's hot in here?

702
00:32:00,427 --> 00:32:01,508
Just now,

703
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:03,587
why did you cover up for me?

704
00:32:05,028 --> 00:32:07,040
You intruded upon a girl's room
in the middle of the night.

705
00:32:07,147 --> 00:32:09,548
Even if you don't mind it,
my reputation will be ruined.

706
00:32:09,988 --> 00:32:11,107
I'll tell you something.

707
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:13,480
It's obviously unfair
that you used 50 carts of supplies

708
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,627
in exchange for Jianzhou.

709
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:15,827
I know the Cui Family

710
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:17,347
has planted your men in the capital.

711
00:32:17,907 --> 00:32:19,748
Sun Jing has detained my father
in the capital.

712
00:32:20,028 --> 00:32:21,387
I wish to borrow your forces

713
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:22,387
to save my father.

714
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,280
You're not shy at all when it comes
to making requests, huh?

715
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:28,548
What if I say no?

716
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,187
If you say no,

717
00:32:32,427 --> 00:32:33,268
I'll...

718
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,548
Ying,

719
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,427
are you asleep?

720
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:43,187
I was just about to sleep.

721
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,880
I have something important
to discuss with you.

722
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,508
All right. I'm coming.

723
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:13,748
Young Master.

724
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:26,040
Young Master, did you receive
any news from the frontline?

725
00:33:27,948 --> 00:33:29,268
Actually, it's nothing major.

726
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:32,347
I heard from Taozi
that you hadn't had dinner yet.

727
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,200
That's why I came here to check on you.

728
00:33:34,827 --> 00:33:37,268
But you look good.

729
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:39,400
Seems like I was worried for nothing.

730
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:41,308
I had too much food this afternoon.

731
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:43,268
That's why I had no appetite
during dinner time.

732
00:33:52,187 --> 00:33:53,228
You should sleep early then.

733
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:55,560
Young Master, you should rest early too.

734
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,187
Have you received any news?

735
00:34:24,868 --> 00:34:26,707
Madam Shen's and Miss Jiang's ashes

736
00:34:27,508 --> 00:34:28,988
were scattered outside the city.

737
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,707
She was my loyal follower.

738
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:40,548
In the end,

739
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:42,508
she couldn't even die in peace.

740
00:34:45,307 --> 00:34:46,080
Your Highness,

741
00:34:46,147 --> 00:34:47,627
you can cry if you like.

742
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:50,468
I won't cry.

743
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:54,868
As the consort of crown prince,

744
00:34:55,747 --> 00:34:57,948
I have to be strong. I cannot cry.

745
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:02,587
But I hate myself

746
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:04,227
for being useless.

747
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,280
I wasn't able to protect
the late crown prince's offspring,

748
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,508
which was in Miss Jiang's tummy.

749
00:35:15,508 --> 00:35:17,667
If I do head to the underworld one day,

750
00:35:22,107 --> 00:35:24,587
I'm sure the crown prince
will never forgive me for this.

751
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:29,508
Your Highness,
the great imperial grandson is still alive.

752
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:32,548
He wouldn't be alive without you.

753
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:34,948
Your Highness,
he's still waiting for you.

754
00:35:37,828 --> 00:35:39,107
I know.

755
00:35:40,408 --> 00:35:41,840
For the great imperial grandson's sake,

756
00:35:42,988 --> 00:35:44,707
I have to survive.

757
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:47,508
Your Highness,

758
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:50,000
I know why you're enduring
all these humiliations.

759
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:51,908
Madam Shen knew about it too.

760
00:35:52,388 --> 00:35:56,908
Before she left, she told me
that she had no regrets serving you.

761
00:35:57,548 --> 00:35:58,548
It's the same for me.

762
00:35:59,147 --> 00:36:00,307
Your Highness,

763
00:36:00,627 --> 00:36:02,107
even if you want me to die,

764
00:36:02,267 --> 00:36:03,388
I'll gladly die for you

765
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:04,508
without any regrets.

766
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:08,187
Your Highness.

767
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:09,667
Do not speak of death easily!

768
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:12,667
Death is the easiest.

769
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:19,068
When the crown prince passed away,

770
00:36:20,307 --> 00:36:22,428
the easiest option

771
00:36:23,707 --> 00:36:25,468
was for me to
slit my throat with a knife.

772
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:30,240
People of the world would have also
praised me for my devotion.

773
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,348
But I knew

774
00:36:32,747 --> 00:36:33,787
that I mustn't do so.

775
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:35,068
I have to survive.

776
00:36:37,187 --> 00:36:38,707
I have to

777
00:36:39,348 --> 00:36:41,068
deal with Sun Jing.

778
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:46,428
Maybe I can still find a chance
to protect the great imperial grandson.

779
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:52,068
I can still act accordingly
if there's a chance.

780
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:56,028
I will restore the Dayu Dynasty
to its former glory.

781
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:01,468
Your Highness,
I understand your pain completely.

782
00:37:05,948 --> 00:37:06,908
Tell me.

783
00:37:10,147 --> 00:37:12,107
Has Xuanze

784
00:37:15,787 --> 00:37:17,348
grown taller again?

785
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:21,348
Han Chang has to go into hiding
together with him.

786
00:37:23,028 --> 00:37:24,508
I wonder if they can

787
00:37:26,187 --> 00:37:27,508
have their fill

788
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:31,428
and have a good night's sleep tonight?

789
00:37:37,913 --> 00:37:42,178
(Han Chang, General Yunchang)

790
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:48,147
Your Highness,

791
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:50,988
have some water.

792
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:54,988
General Han,

793
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:57,068
I thought you were supposed

794
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:59,600
(Li Xuanze, Great Imperial Grandson)
to pretend to be my uncle.

795
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,428
You may call me Ze.

796
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,960
Your Highness,
your identity is different.

797
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:06,508
There's no one here.

798
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:09,267
I have to follow the customs
when I have to.

799
00:38:11,508 --> 00:38:12,587
Your Highness, are you hungry?

800
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:14,147
No.

801
00:38:14,868 --> 00:38:15,707
General Han,

802
00:38:15,908 --> 00:38:17,348
have you received any news from Mother?

803
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:24,627
No.

804
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:25,707
Here.

805
00:38:30,627 --> 00:38:32,667
Her Highness is tough

806
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:34,147
and has strong willpower.

807
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:36,468
Without her arrangements,

808
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:40,147
I'm afraid we would have no way
to escape from Sun Jing.

809
00:38:41,207 --> 00:38:42,720
Since we're quite far away
from the palace,

810
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:44,868
it's normal to not receive

811
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:46,667
any updates from Her Highness.

812
00:38:53,227 --> 00:38:56,348
I hope Mother can stay safe.

813
00:39:18,587 --> 00:39:19,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

814
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:22,267
I wonder why you invited me here.

815
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,307
We're in Bingzhou,
yet we're troubled by military affairs.

816
00:39:25,368 --> 00:39:27,000
I haven't had the chance
to chat with you yet.

817
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:28,187
I've prepared some liquor.

818
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:30,147
I wish to drink with you.

819
00:39:33,028 --> 00:39:34,468
I never drink.

820
00:39:36,348 --> 00:39:37,468
I have a request.

821
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:41,028
I hope you can fulfill it.

822
00:39:51,707 --> 00:39:52,787
Your Highness,

823
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:54,187
please speak up.

824
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,880
I didn't know about
Lieutenant He's identity before this.

825
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,667
Please forgive me

826
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:00,107
if I've offended you.

827
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:02,107
Her identity?

828
00:40:02,687 --> 00:40:03,880
What do you mean by her identity?

829
00:40:05,307 --> 00:40:06,068
Mister,

830
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,428
you shouldn't ask the obvious.

831
00:40:10,187 --> 00:40:11,627
She's just my lieutenant.

832
00:40:12,028 --> 00:40:13,280
What other identity does she have?

833
00:40:17,828 --> 00:40:19,360
There's no need to hide the truth.

834
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,627
I've already found out.

835
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:23,267
As long as you promise to help me out,

836
00:40:24,227 --> 00:40:25,667
I'll keep this a secret.

837
00:40:25,908 --> 00:40:27,667
I won't tell anyone about it.

838
00:40:35,787 --> 00:40:36,707
Don't worry.

839
00:40:37,548 --> 00:40:38,787
I, Li Shiqi,

840
00:40:39,068 --> 00:40:40,028
am a man of my word.

841
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:41,747
As long as you agree to it,

842
00:40:42,227 --> 00:40:43,107
I shall keep this secret

843
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:44,267
until the day I die.

844
00:40:52,187 --> 00:40:53,908
Don't tell me you wish to silence me?

845
00:40:54,548 --> 00:40:55,227
Mister,

846
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:57,880
although the Cui Army is a force
to be reckoned with,

847
00:40:58,307 --> 00:41:00,227
the Zhenxi Army is in Bingzhou too.

848
00:41:00,948 --> 00:41:02,948
Are you sure you can do it?

849
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:07,840
Your Highness, you must be joking.

850
00:41:08,147 --> 00:41:09,828
Both you and I are loyalists.

851
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,760
Your Highness, please speak up.

852
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,068
What exactly do you need

853
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:14,948
from the Cui Family?

854
00:41:16,028 --> 00:41:17,147
You may go ahead.

855
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:20,548
My father, Lord Liang,

856
00:41:20,868 --> 00:41:22,587
was detained in the capital by Sun Jing.

857
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:24,908
I know your family

858
00:41:25,468 --> 00:41:26,948
has planted your men in the capital.

859
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:29,267
I can definitely rescue my father

860
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:31,587
as long as I receive your aid.

861
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:37,868
Young Master.

862
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:41,948
Young Master,

863
00:41:42,107 --> 00:41:43,468
I only found out that you were here

864
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:44,960
when Lieutenant He asked me about it.

865
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,360
It's time for you to take your medicine.

866
00:42:04,227 --> 00:42:05,348
Mister Shiqi,

867
00:42:05,628 --> 00:42:07,960
I thought you were going to set a trap
disguised as a drinking session?

868
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:11,307
What? Is it over already?

869
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:14,868
Say,

870
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:15,627
what kind of person

871
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:17,068
do you think Young Master Cui is?

872
00:42:18,508 --> 00:42:19,747
He looks refined

873
00:42:19,948 --> 00:42:21,147
and well-educated.

874
00:42:21,548 --> 00:42:23,707
He doesn't seem like someone
who can fight in wars.

875
00:42:23,948 --> 00:42:24,587
You're right.

876
00:42:24,787 --> 00:42:26,267
A refined and frail person like him

877
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:28,667
could actually conquer this many cities

878
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:30,468
all the way from Yingzhou.

879
00:42:31,707 --> 00:42:33,267
Don't you think it's strange?

880
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,908
Cui Yi's son
should be just as good as his father.

881
00:42:37,587 --> 00:42:38,508
Cui Yi

882
00:42:38,707 --> 00:42:39,707
is a famous general.

883
00:42:39,908 --> 00:42:41,548
He, Sun Jing, and General Pei,

884
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:43,747
were known as the Three Heroes.

885
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,028
If so,

886
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,320
what kind of person do you think
Lieutenant He is?

887
00:42:50,587 --> 00:42:51,948
About that,

888
00:42:52,227 --> 00:42:54,028
I have no idea.

889
00:42:56,147 --> 00:42:57,468
You know this too.

890
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,440
I've been on the battlefield
for over a decade.

891
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,787
I have met all kinds of people.

892
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:02,787
But I have never met
someone like her before.

893
00:43:02,988 --> 00:43:04,667
Although she's a woman,

894
00:43:04,868 --> 00:43:06,468
she's decisive, merciless,

895
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,627
and intelligent.

896
00:43:09,707 --> 00:43:11,627
I can't figure her out.

897
00:43:12,428 --> 00:43:13,828
That's why I kept thinking

898
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,548
that there's more to her
than meets the eye.

899
00:43:17,468 --> 00:43:18,787
I don't know how much

900
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:20,908
I can trust her.

901
00:43:22,627 --> 00:43:23,280
By the way,

902
00:43:23,508 --> 00:43:24,147
Mister Shiqi,

903
00:43:24,388 --> 00:43:26,267
our army is ready to depart.

904
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:29,107
Defensive arrangements
have also been made for Bingzhou.

905
00:43:29,348 --> 00:43:30,548
When will we depart?

906
00:43:30,988 --> 00:43:31,828
The sooner the better.

907
00:43:33,587 --> 00:43:34,160
Lieutenant He,

908
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,028
when I reached there,

909
00:43:35,107 --> 00:43:36,508
Young Master didn't look too happy.

910
00:43:37,187 --> 00:43:37,880
It doesn't matter.

911
00:43:38,227 --> 00:43:39,587
Young Master already told me

912
00:43:39,707 --> 00:43:41,068
what Li Ni told him.

913
00:43:41,868 --> 00:43:43,107
That Li Ni,

914
00:43:43,348 --> 00:43:45,828
he wants to kill two birds
with one stone with his eloquence.

915
00:43:47,227 --> 00:43:49,267
He wants to find out
about my real identity

916
00:43:49,948 --> 00:43:52,187
and trick Young Master into helping him
to save Lord Liang.

917
00:43:52,988 --> 00:43:54,480
Luckily, Young Master didn't fall for it.

918
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:55,828
However, Li Ni

919
00:43:56,627 --> 00:43:57,948
