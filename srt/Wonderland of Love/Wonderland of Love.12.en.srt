00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,450
(Letter to Cui Lin)

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,241
Lieutenant He has returned!

31
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:54,160
Young Master,

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
what's the situation in Yingzhou?

33
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:00,401
Father suddenly fell ill.

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,520
The seal is genuine.

35
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,440
What about the messenger?

36
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:03,880
The messenger was Father's trusted aide.

37
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:05,800
He was wounded from ambushed
while on his way here.

38
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:06,920
After he delivered the message,

39
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,160
he collapsed and died.

40
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,820
Young Master, was it a relapse
of the old illness, or was it poisoning?

41
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,160
It doesn't mention in the letter.

42
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:13,280
Please allow me

43
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:15,519
to lead a light cavalry unit
for immediate assistance.

44
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,840
It's a matter of Father's safety.

45
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:17,880
I want to go with you.

46
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,639
No, the main army
is still carrying military supplies.

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,880
It's not suitable for a fast march.

48
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,360
You should follow the original plan
and lead the main army for aid.

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,039
Besides, you're still not fully recovered.

50
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,280
Traveling day and night,

51
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:27,759
your body won't be able to take it.

52
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,680
Ying, my decision is final.

53
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,960
Let's lead a light cavalry unit
to advance for aid.

54
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:33,240
Don't talk me out of this anymore.

55
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:36,800
Very well.

56
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,960
Greetings, Grand Governor.

57
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:00,640
Grand Governor, are you well?

58
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,519
After your three sons received your letter,

59
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,881
both Li Jun and Li Lai
showed great filial piety

60
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,601
and immediately agreed
to withdraw the troops.

61
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:13,761
They also sent a letter,
begging me to take good care of you.

62
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:17,240
As for Li Ni,

63
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,960
he actually decapitated
Duke Zheng's head and sent it here

64
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
(Letter to Grand Governor Sun)
with a letter.

65
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:41,441
("I'm not the legitimate son.)

66
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,041
(If you kill my father,)

67
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:45,240
(I shall declare myself emperor
and give thanks.")

68
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,960
If Li Ni becomes the emperor,

69
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,520
he will naturally posthumously honor
his birth father as an emperor.

70
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,881
Lord Liang,

71
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,201
this is indeed a great cause
for celebration.

72
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,479
If I ever have

73
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,680
such treacherous thoughts,

74
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:00,360
the lightning will strike me!

75
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,759
My unfilial son did this.

76
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,881
The unfilial son did it.

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,240
Grand Governor, please be impartial.

78
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,441
Be impartial about this.

79
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:12,759
Please be impartial.

80
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,041
Please be impartial, Grand Governor.

81
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,360
Please...

82
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:42,040
Get the imperial physicians here

83
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,561
to check what's wrong with him.

84
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,321
Yes.

85
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:11,001
Find a way to inform Madam of Wei.

86
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,280
Yes, Your Highness.

87
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,720
Grand Governor,

88
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,199
Lord Liang has always been frail

89
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
and has heart problems.

90
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:28,160
The extreme fear triggered
the heart attack,

91
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,480
and he's showing a sign of a stroke.

92
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,361
I'm afraid...

93
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm afraid this illness
is life-threatening.

94
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,280
Can you save him?

95
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,600
I'm not confident.

96
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Carry him away.

97
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,241
Be gentle.

98
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,680
You must be very gentle.

99
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:58,639
Don't jolt him.

100
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,201
It could be fatal.

101
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,361
Shiqi. Shiqi.

102
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,240
There's urgent news from Luoyang.

103
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,480
Our scouts reported

104
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,561
there was an unusual movement
in Lord Linzi's troops.

105
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,320
A light cavalry unit armed
with heavy crossbows

106
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,201
has left Luoshui and disappeared.

107
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,520
Something's wrong.

108
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:19,441
A light cavalry unit armed
with heavy crossbows?

109
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:21,000
It doesn't look like
they're leaving Luoyang

110
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:22,400
and more like
they're setting up an ambush.

111
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,400
Who are they trying to ambush?

112
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,560
Enemy attack.

113
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:30,681
We're under attack!

114
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:03,600
Master,

115
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:05,921
we can take them all down this time.

116
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,600
Cui Lin,

117
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:09,959
I want to see

118
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,840
if you'll make it out alive this time.

119
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,521
Young Master!

120
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,281
Chen Xing...

121
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,840
Chen Xing!

122
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,880
Ying...

123
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:18,681
Young Master.

124
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:29,681
Ying.

125
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,240
Ying. Ying.

126
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,720
Bear with it for a moment.

127
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:36,960
Are you all right?

128
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:54,080
Attack!

129
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:55,161
Charge!

130
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,960
No, we can't charge.

131
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:58,159
The Zhenxi Army is here.

132
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,000
It's Li Ni.

133
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:00,360
Li Ni has come to rescue them.

134
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:01,561
What?

135
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:03,201
Li Ni, again?

136
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,561
Young Master!

137
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,921
Come on.

138
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,080
Am I supposed to watch

139
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:44,000
Cui Lin and He escape?

140
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:46,399
The Zhenxi Army
is not to be trifled with.

141
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,521
The soldiers Li Ni brought with him
are elite soldiers.

142
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,200
Although we borrowed some troops,

143
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:51,360
we suffered too many casualties.

144
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:53,041
It'll be hard for us to explain.

145
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,880
Master,

146
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:55,960
as long as we live,

147
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:57,760
there's still hope.

148
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:11,120
What happened?

149
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,439
Why did you bring her back?

150
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,960
Get the military physician now. Hurry!

151
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,720
Are you injured?

152
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,880
The arrowhead went too deep,
and there were barbs on its head.

153
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:32,360
If we remove it by force,

154
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:33,639
it might damage the blood vessels

155
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,000
and cause uncontrollable bleeding.

156
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:37,039
At the moment, we can only
slowly pull out the arrowhead.

157
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,120
I'm old,

158
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,041
and my hands are not steady.
I dare not do it.

159
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:41,880
It's all right.
I know some medical skills.

160
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,520
I can do it.

161
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,639
But, this method can be excruciating.

162
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,600
Can she bear it?

163
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,641
Ying.

164
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,960
The physician said that we need to
pull out the arrowhead slowly.

165
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:01,240
It'll hurt a bit.

166
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,921
Can you bear it?

167
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,641
With me around,

168
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,441
you'll definitely be safe.

169
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,921
Lieutenant He, bear with it.

170
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:38,521
Hang in there.

171
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:39,641
It'll be over soon.

172
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,321
It's coming out soon.

173
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,720
Here, bite my hand. Bite it.

174
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,399
It's all right now.

175
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,760
You're all right now.

176
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:03,201
Everything is all right now.

177
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:08,000
You're all right.

178
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,401
I'll help you clean up.

179
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:42,441
That valley has treacherous terrain.

180
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,200
Do you know

181
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:44,840
how many enemies were hiding there?

182
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,000
Also,

183
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:47,600
they even have heavy crossbows.

184
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,200
You're lucky

185
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:51,720
to have come out of it alive.

186
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,480
Shiqi,

187
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,000
a noble man doesn't put himself
in unnecessary danger.

188
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:02,801
You're a perfect military soldier.

189
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:04,039
Why do you have to

190
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,401
cite classical texts

191
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:06,960
and lecture all day

192
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,161
like your uncle?

193
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,161
We just captured Tong Pass.

194
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:17,080
It's a crucial moment
for planning to retake the capital.

195
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:18,919
If anything bad happened to you,

196
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,561
what should we do?

197
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:22,480
Moreover,

198
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,880
that woman

199
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:25,439
is from the Cui Army.

200
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,120
Do you have to

201
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:27,521
go to such lengths to save her?

202
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,760
Who said I went to save her?

203
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Didn't you...

204
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,041
I did it to save Mister Cui.

205
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,080
Do you think I'll believe that?

206
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:37,720
I think you do.

207
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,281
Fine.

208
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,201
Whatever you say.

209
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,279
What are you...

210
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,960
What...

211
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,801
Who... Who are you?

212
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,880
Li Ni dares to kill my brother.

213
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:08,921
How dare he kill my brother?

214
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,600
I'm going to kill you now

215
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:12,480
to avenge my brother's death!

216
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,320
Madam, no!

217
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:15,239
How dare your son

218
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,479
kill my brother!

219
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,960
I'm going to kill you now!

220
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:24,000
Our people restrained Madam of Wei in time.

221
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:26,199
The physician also knows what to say.

222
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,921
So, you can rest assured.

223
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:30,161
Grand Governor has arrived!

224
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:42,360
Please forgive me, Grand Governor.

225
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,719
Lord Liang was already in great fear,

226
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,239
and his pulse was very weak.

227
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,520
Moreover, just now...

228
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,639
Just now, he was suffocated
for a long time

229
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,040
because Madam strangled him
out of anger.

230
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,560
The vital energy has dissipated,
so the medicine no longer works.

231
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
He has already passed away.

232
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,959
I want to cut off his head

233
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,399
and send it to his son.

234
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,121
So his son can also

235
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,441
experience the pain.

236
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,280
This person is not much of a loss.

237
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:17,999
Keep this news a secret.

238
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,040
Burn his remains to ashes

239
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,641
as revenge for Duke Zheng.

240
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:24,560
No!

241
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:26,600
I want to cut off his head

242
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:27,921
and send it to his son!

243
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:32,479
You hit me!

244
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,040
You actually hit me!

245
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:39,040
Madam, please.

246
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:03,441
What's wrong?

247
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:07,441
Lord Liang is dead.

248
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,401
What?

249
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:12,399
Li Ni

250
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,841
cut off Duke Zheng's head
and sent it back.

251
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,040
Madam of Wei strangled Lord Liang to death

252
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:19,720
in a moment of grief.

253
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:23,040
We must immediately block this news.

254
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:24,479
Li Ni must not know

255
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
that Lord Liang is dead.

256
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:30,601
I only know that Madam of Wei is foolish.

257
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,520
I didn't expect her to ruin my plans.

258
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:41,401
Li Ni is a determined

259
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,240
and cunning person.

260
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,441
Even if Lord Liang were alive,

261
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,760
he might not have backed down.

262
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,800
Grand Governor, no need to be upset.

263
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,719
A man should marry a virtuous wife.

264
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,800
My mistake was marrying the wrong one.

265
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:01,040
That's how I lost Luoyang.

266
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,320
Even so,

267
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,760
with all her mistakes,

268
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:13,040
you never treated her badly.

269
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,560
I'm sure she must have stood by you
through hard times.

270
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:18,201
After all, she has a special place
in your heart.

271
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:23,000
What is that all about?

272
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,240
She's your legal wife.

273
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,881
I just don't like her.

274
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,520
You know very well that in my heart,

275
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,520
you're the only wife I care about.

276
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,320
Stop the cart.

277
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:14,560
This place will do.

278
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:15,800
Just burn it and be done with it.

279
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:18,400
Orders from above, we need to
break the bones and scatter the ashes.

280
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,081
All right.

281
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,520
This place makes me feel uneasy.

282
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:25,601
I feel the same too.

283
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,399
Sirs, the negative energy
is usually very heavy

284
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,600
when burying a coffin.

285
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:33,239
These several days, some palace servants
who did something wrong

286
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,881
were dragged out here
and beaten to death.

287
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,399
So, the villagers say

288
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,401
there are evil spirits at work.

289
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,161
Sirs,

290
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,719
this dead man

291
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,679
wears luxury clothing,

292
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,280
with several layers of silk,

293
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:49,280
and fine shoes.

294
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:50,919
Just one look, I know he was rich.

295
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,999
Well,

296
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,959
instead of burning them,

297
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
why not sell them to us for money?

298
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,760
You don't hesitate
to take a dead man's belongings.

299
00:21:57,121 --> 00:21:58,760
No wonder people
are willing to offer bribes

300
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:00,760
and to go to great lengths
to get this sort of task.

301
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,999
All right, then.

302
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,199
Get it done quickly.

303
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,999
Yes, sir.

304
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,959
We were ordered

305
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,121
to watch the body reduced to ashes.

306
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:09,560
Come this way, please.

307
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,960
Change it quickly.

308
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,681
All right.

309
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,720
Come on, be quick about it.

310
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,081
Move it.

311
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:34,000
Hurry.

312
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,361
Oh, keep it moving.

313
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:54,601
Father.

314
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,760
Father, are you feeling better?

315
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,441
"I'm not the legitimate son.
If you kill my father,

316
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:14,560
I shall declare myself emperor
and give thanks."

317
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,760
You wrote these, didn't you?

318
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,040
Yes, I did.

319
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,040
Father.

320
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,681
You unfilial child.

321
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,401
You brat!

322
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,681
You're trying to get me killed.

323
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,080
Grand Governor Sun is a ruthless man.

324
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,600
Yet, you want to take the throne.

325
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:37,800
You're really trying to get me killed!

326
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,401
Father,

327
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,399
it was just a ruse

328
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,000
to provoke Sun Jing.

329
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,280
I did it to rescue you.

330
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,601
Rescue me?

331
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,520
What is this place?

332
00:23:57,841 --> 00:23:59,201
Tong Pass.

333
00:24:00,121 --> 00:24:01,881
Since Sun Jing rebelled,

334
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:04,361
you've been held hostage in the capital.

335
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,760
I've been planning how to rescue you.

336
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,000
Earlier,

337
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,840
with the help of the people
belonging to the Cui Army in the palace,

338
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,120
we secretly made the arrangement.

339
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,201
We were waiting
for the right moment to act.

340
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:20,959
The right moment to act, huh?

341
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,520
Is the right moment of yours

342
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:26,199
to deliver such a treacherous letter
to Sun Jing?

343
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,641
Do you realize

344
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:30,280
if Sun Jing had acted on that,

345
00:24:30,281 --> 00:24:32,601
I would have been dead by now?

346
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,121
Father,

347
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,280
I know you would be upset

348
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:41,960
after reading that letter.

349
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,960
Your health has always been fragile,

350
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,480
and you often suffer from dizziness.

351
00:24:45,761 --> 00:24:47,199
I thought you might faint

352
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,800
in anger.

353
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:51,081
So, I had someone use
a simulated death medicine

354
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,401
to fake your death, fooling Sun Jing.

355
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:55,420
When they were preparing
for the cremation,

356
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:58,560
I arranged for a substitute
to take your place and rescue you.

357
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,240
Rebellious child.

358
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,520
You, rebellious child.

359
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:09,520
You act recklessly.

360
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:12,520
Don't you know you're gambling

361
00:25:12,521 --> 00:25:14,401
with your own father's life?

362
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:16,600
I dare not.

363
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:18,720
What else do you not dare to do?

364
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:26,401
Just looking at you makes me angry.

365
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,280
Get out.

366
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:31,520
Get out now.

367
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:37,441
Yes, Father. I'll leave.

368
00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:39,441
After you've calmed down,

369
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,121
I'll come and visit you again.

370
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,161
Get out now.

371
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:16,881
Greetings, General Li.

372
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:19,159
I heard that Lord Liang
has been rescued.

373
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,120
So, I've prepared
chicken and mushroom soup.

374
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,320
I've removed the excess fat.

375
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:23,800
So, it's light and easy to digest.

376
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:24,880
At the thought of Lord Liang

377
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:27,280
being physically and mentally exhausted
from all those hardships,

378
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,239
eating some light and nourishing food

379
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,919
can help restore his energy.

380
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,080
Your Highness, my lady

381
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:35,600
personally tended to the stove for hours.

382
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:37,201
Qiucui, quiet.

383
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:39,840
Miss Gu, thank you.

384
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,560
General, this is no trouble at all.

385
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:43,360
You have a great cause to achieve

386
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:44,719
and military affairs to attend to.

387
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,560
I'm not particularly good at anything

388
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:47,999
and am just a fragile woman.

389
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,361
I've also caused quite a bit of trouble
in the camp.

390
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:52,439
Now that Lord Liang
has been brought back,

391
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,679
please allow me to take care

392
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,520
of Lord Liang's needs.

393
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:02,000
But...

394
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,121
It's not appropriate to trouble Miss Gu.

395
00:27:04,601 --> 00:27:06,280
My father has just been rescued.

396
00:27:06,521 --> 00:27:08,000
He's still a bit unsettled.

397
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,639
His temper isn't very good too.

398
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,479
There's no need to worry.

399
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,719
At home,

400
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,199
I also served and cared for my elders.

401
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,479
So, I understand

402
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,639
they can be irritable

403
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,641
when they suffer from illness.

404
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:21,120
Please rest assured, General.

405
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:23,520
I'll take good care of Lord Liang.

406
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:24,320
Indeed,

407
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:25,800
My lady is very attentive.

408
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:27,320
When my master was ill,

409
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:29,040
she was the one taking care of him.

410
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,121
Please let me do my part.

411
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:38,760
Then, I'll leave it to you, Miss Gu.

412
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,480
Miss Taozi,

413
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,280
is your injury better now?

414
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,280
It's not that serious.

415
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,040
At most, it'll hurt for a few days.

416
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:09,921
You must be hungry. Here, eat this.

417
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,641
Here you go.

418
00:28:12,521 --> 00:28:13,480
All right.

419
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:22,121
What's wrong? Does it taste bad?

420
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,441
Soup noodles can't compare to pig ears.

421
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,479
Why are you giggling?

422
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,760
Nothing.

423
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:34,480
Eat up before the noodles get cold.

424
00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:45,581
(General's Residence)

425
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,959
Why are you being sneaking around?

426
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,320
Were you trying to steal a kiss?

427
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,960
What do you have
that's worth stealing a kiss for?

428
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:10,800
I can't believe you.

429
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:12,641
I saved your life.

430
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,881
How many times
have I saved you already?

431
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,201
Is this the way you treat your life savior?

432
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,881
Don't worry.

433
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,520
If you ever face
a life-threatening situation,

434
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,399
I'll definitely overcome all obstacles

435
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,441
and go through thick and thin
to save you.

436
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:30,361
I have your promise
engraved deep in my heart.

437
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:38,080
How did you know

438
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:39,841
someone was trying to ambush us?

439
00:30:41,521 --> 00:30:44,081
I heard that Luoyang
deployed a unit of light cavalry.

440
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,121
This unit was armed with heavy crossbows.

441
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,280
Clearly, they intend to lie an ambush.

442
00:30:48,841 --> 00:30:50,280
After thinking it over,

443
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:51,639
I suddenly remembered

444
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,641
Cui Li from the Cui Army

445
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,641
once approached Pei Yuan

446
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,441
about ambushing Mister Cui.

447
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,760
I believe Cui Li

448
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:00,280
may join forces with others

449
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:02,121
to target Mister Cui.

450
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:08,000
Yes, Cui Li.

451
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,720
It must be him.

452
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:14,520
What method did he use

453
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,320
to convince Luoyang

454
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:17,720
to lend him troops?

455
00:31:18,121 --> 00:31:20,240
Since Cui Li wants to kill Mister Cui,

456
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:21,880
he must find someone

457
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,881
to frame and make him appear
as the perpetrator.

458
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,479
I'm close to Tong Pass,

459
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,161
and I'm the marshal
of the Zhenxi Army.

460
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:29,161
I would make the best choice for him.

461
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,320
Probably,

462
00:31:31,321 --> 00:31:32,959
he used this method

463
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,000
to persuade my brothers
to lend him troops.

464
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,161
Your brothers?

465
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,560
They would actually do this?

466
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,320
They are muddled and foolish.

467
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,760
So they are easily manipulated.

468
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,081
That's how things often are
in this world.

469
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:55,960
Cui Li is also
your young master's cousin, right?

470
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,280
Isn't it the same sibling rivalry?

471
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:09,040
Oh, no.

472
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:11,600
The situation in Yingzhou
must be even more complicated.

473
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,921
Where are my young master and Taozi?

474
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:16,560
Are they also hurt?

475
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,441
And where's my horse?

476
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,320
Don't tell me you want
to go back to Yingzhou now.

477
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,401
I'm worried about...

478
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:27,720
Yingzhou is the Cui Army's foundation.

479
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:29,760
This won't do.

480
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,081
I must find a way to go back.

481
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,800
Ying,

482
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,520
your injury isn't fatal.

483
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:37,999
But your young master

484
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,161
must recuperate for some time.

485
00:32:40,801 --> 00:32:42,560
If you insist on going back,

486
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:43,520
I won't stop you.

487
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:45,400
But you need to think
about this carefully.

488
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,641
Do you have the strength
to meet up with the main army

489
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,641
and resources to save Yingzhou?

490
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:58,720
Don't rush it.

491
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,560
Given the situation,

492
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,360
let's think to see

493
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:03,681
if there's another way.

494
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,760
Young Master.

495
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,240
Young Master, you're finally awake.

496
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:30,401
Where's Ying?

497
00:33:31,081 --> 00:33:32,280
Young Master, don't worry.

498
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,320
Lieutenant He is fine.

499
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,520
Just some minor injuries.

500
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:35,560
Nothing serious.

501
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:37,280
That's good to hear.

502
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:40,361
What about Xing?

503
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:45,361
Where's Xing?

504
00:33:46,321 --> 00:33:47,081
Young Master,

505
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:50,121
Xing is no longer here.

506
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,520
Young Master,

507
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:57,280
don't be sad.

508
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,881
Protecting you is our duty.

509
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:02,081
But now,

510
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:06,201
Xing is gone.

511
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:11,001
Xing is really gone.

512
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,360
Young Master,

513
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,840
Xing wouldn't want to see you so upset.

514
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:16,561
Xing and I

515
00:34:17,761 --> 00:34:19,720
were both abandoned orphans.

516
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,559
If it hadn't been for you
and Lieutenant He taking us in

517
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,121
and allowing us
to stay with the Cui Army,

518
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:26,121
we wouldn't have had a place to stay.

519
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,440
Xing wouldn't regret giving his life

520
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:30,201
for Young Master,

521
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:31,800
and neither would I.

522
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:33,400
I forbid you to say these things.

523
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,641
Where are we?

524
00:34:41,321 --> 00:34:42,240
We're at the Tong Pass,

525
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:43,559
the Zhenxi Army's camp.

526
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,641
It's His Highness Li...

527
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,880
It was him who brought us back here.

528
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,320
Li Ni...

529
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:55,561
Young Master,

530
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,121
please take good care of yourself.

531
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:01,920
Taozi and the Zhenxi Army's
military physician checked your condition,

532
00:35:02,241 --> 00:35:03,920
and they both said
you're seriously wounded,

533
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,800
and you need proper rest.

534
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:07,360
No,

535
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,640
I can't stay here.

536
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:10,399
Young Master,

537
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,840
use any means necessary when in crisis.

538
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,800
We must recover first.
Then, we can make plans.

539
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,041
It's a long journey to Yingzhou.

540
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,121
If you don't take care of yourself,

541
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,880
that would be damaging the core

542
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,481
and be a total loss.

543
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:27,720
There's one more thing.

544
00:35:30,281 --> 00:35:31,320
About Chen Xing

545
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:32,880
and the Cui Army soldiers

546
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,521
who died in battle,

547
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,041
I'd appreciate it
if you could send someone

548
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,561
to help me collect their bodies
for their burial.

549
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,760
Don't worry.

550
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,521
When you were unconscious,

551
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,599
I've already sent my men

552
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,320
to collect the fallen Cui Army soldiers.

553
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:51,240
I know Chen Xing

554
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:53,201
was your young master's personal guard.

555
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,121
I've ordered a memorial stone for him.

556
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,161
When Mister Cui has recovered,

557
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,760
he can pay his respects in person.

558
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:03,161
Ying, please accept my condolences.

559
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,001
Thank you.

560
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,561
All right.

561
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,280
Now that you're awake,

562
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:16,559
it's time to take your medicine.

563
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,079
Taozi has repeatedly told me

564
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,800
to make sure you take it

565
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:21,161
to prevent infection in the wound.

566
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:23,481
It looks bitter.

567
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,999
Miss Taozi,

568
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,200
I was on my way to see you.

569
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:49,240
What a coincidence.

570
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,920
I was looking for you too.

571
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,440
What do you need from me?

572
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:55,280
This is the best pain-relief ointment
I found for you.

573
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,760
If you apply it to your wound,
then you won't feel pain anymore.

574
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,119
Silly.

575
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,720
Did you forget

576
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:06,081
that I can blend medicine myself?

577
00:37:06,281 --> 00:37:07,959
Of course, I didn't forget.

578
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,880
I just...

579
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:10,641
I was worried in case you don't have it.

580
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:11,800
Didn't you say

581
00:37:11,801 --> 00:37:13,641
your wound would hurt for a few days?

582
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:16,079
All right. I'll accept it, then.

583
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,121
Thank you.

584
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,640
So, why were you looking for me?

585
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,680
I wanted to see you

586
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:23,481
to ask you for a favor.

587
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:24,760
What favor?

588
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:25,240
Just tell me,

589
00:37:25,241 --> 00:37:26,081
and I'll help for sure.

590
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:28,240
Do you have any icing sugar?

591
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:29,079
It will be even better

592
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,601
if you have honey.

593
00:37:31,241 --> 00:37:32,880
Icing sugar?

594
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:34,720
How could we possibly
have icing sugar in the kitchen

595
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:35,760
of a marching army?

596
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:37,161
Let alone honey.

597
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,840
What do you need icing sugar for?

598
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:40,680
Since young, Lieutenant He

599
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:42,840
would refuse to eat food after taking medicine.

600
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:44,840
If we had icing sugar now, we could

601
00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:47,040
give her a bowl of sugar water
after she took medicine.

602
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,400
So, she would eat.

603
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,760
But there are no markets nearby.

604
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:52,161
We have nowhere to buy it.

605
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:05,521
Lord Liang has already
safely arrived at Tong Pass.

606
00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:08,641
I hope Li Ni will also
have a stroke of good luck

607
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,440
in the midst of adversity.

608
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,200
Don't worry, Your Highness.

609
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:14,081
His Highness will surely be safe.

610
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:19,400
Li Ni has already made it to Tong Pass.

611
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:21,519
Sun Jing

612
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,920
must be feeling restless.

613
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,959
You see,

614
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,079
he has issued an order
to collect food supplies

615
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,680
and told the capital residents

616
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:30,920
to stockpile enough food
for three months.

617
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,481
It seems Sun Jing
is preparing for a siege.

618
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,160
Will His Highness

619
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,840
lead the army to besiege the capital?

620
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:44,240
Xichang has strong defense

621
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,720
and is difficult to attack.

622
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,240
Li Ni probably won't attempt
a direct assault.

623
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:49,961
I really hope...

624
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:01,680
I hope before Sun Jing

625
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:03,880
recalls the Baiyue Army
from their war campaign,

626
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,681
Li Ni will already
have captured Xichang.

627
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,079
Where have you been?

628
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,280
You even skipped lunch.

629
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:21,840
I just went for a walk up the hill.

630
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:26,640
Shiqi,

631
00:39:26,641 --> 00:39:28,599
you're the marshal of the Zhenxi Army now.

632
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,919
You can't do

633
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,681
anything reckless now.

634
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,920
Like this time,

635
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,481
you risked your life to save He.

636
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,800
She is cunning

637
00:39:37,801 --> 00:39:39,760
and loyal to Cui Lin.

638
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:41,880
Such a person will become

639
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:43,481
a big threat to us sooner or later.

640
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:45,001
But I think

641
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:47,601
she's more loyal to Cui Yi.

642
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,840
Didn't you notice

643
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:51,360
there's something strange

644
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,681
between her and Mister Cui?

645
00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:53,880
What's so strange about it?

646
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,640
Whether she is loyal to Cui Lin or Cui Yi,

647
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:57,479
it's the same.

648
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,240
Father and son are one and the same.

649
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,121
I know I shouldn't say this.

650
00:40:04,681 --> 00:40:06,559
But if I don't tell you,

651
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,280
no one else will.

652
00:40:08,761 --> 00:40:10,640
It's foolish

653
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,641
to let desire cloud your judgment.

654
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,880
You got it wrong.

655
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:15,280
It's not what you think.

656
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,240
Mister Shiqi, look!

657
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:19,641
I've prepared everything.

658
00:40:20,641 --> 00:40:21,681
I'll talk to you later.

659
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:23,880
Where are you two going?

660
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:25,360
Not telling you!
