Lieutenant He.

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,790
Please.

Shu.

Young Master!

34
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,860
Young Master, you're awake.

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,990
Young Master, you're finally awake.

36
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,420
Where's Lieutenant He?

37
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,620
Lieutenant He is fine.

38
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,300
Lieutenant He is truly fine.

39
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,070
I saw the Zhenxi Army
rushing down from the mountaintop.

40
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,390
I'm sure they've saved her.

41
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,490
Young Master, you need to
rest and recuperate.

42
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,110
We still have to see Lieutenant He
when we go back.

43
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,270
Here.

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,110

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,490
(Zhenxi)

46
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,140
General.

47
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,900
Great General.

48
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,180
I'm glad that you're back.

49
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,110
Lord Qin,

50
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,030
I've told my men to send
Lord Xin and Lord Qi back to your camp.

51
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,620
As for your father,

52
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,420
since you're already here,

53
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,860
you can pick him up later.

54
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,110
Great General Cui, you have
a benevolent heart.

55
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,350
I'm eternally grateful to you.

56
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,820
Lord Qin,

57
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,590
since you're already at my camp,

58
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,940
why don't we speak in private
inside the tent?

59
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,420
Sure.

60
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,590
I was planning to do so too.

61
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,670
We're finally back.

62
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,060
You've finally met Great General again.

63
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,860
Father has gotten thinner.

64
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,300
Don't worry.

65
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,230
I took a look at Great General's face
just now.

66
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,710
I'm sure he's as healthy as always.

67
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,790
Lieutenant He, don't worry about him.

68
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,910
Lieutenant He,

69
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,060
aren't you worried at all?

70
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,940
Worried about what?

71
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,110
This is the Cui Army's camp.

72
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,910
Li Ni doesn't dare to
do anything to Father.

73
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,550
That's not what I mean.

74
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,300
Say,

75
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,620
aren't you worried

76
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,500
Great General might
do something to Lord Qin?

77
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,940
You see,

78
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,110
Great General could've
prepared an ambush

79
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,790
before inviting Lord Qin into his tent.

80
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,180
Once he's inside,

81
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,230
he'll give the kill order

82
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,350
by smashing the cup.

83
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,820
Don't worry.

84
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,620
That won't happen.

85
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,710
Lieutenant He,

86
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,350
do you trust Lord Qin

87
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,300
or Great General that much

88
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,940
for you to be so sure about this?

89
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,500
I trust none of them.

90
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,420
That hairpin,

91
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,500
Lord Qin, why do you have it with you?

92
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,060
Miss Cui gave it to me.

93
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,820
Lord Qin,

94
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,420
do you think

95
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,260
you can act brazenly because of that?

96
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,020
Great General Cui, you misunderstood me.

97
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,590
I escorted Miss Cui back here today

98
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,940
because I have

99
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,590
pressing matters to discuss with you.

100
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Lord Qin, you wish to borrow
the strength of the Cui Army

101
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,990
to reclaim Xichang, right?

102
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,940
Lord Qin, you blackmailed me

103
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,180
with your letter before this.

104
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,590
Today, you even
escorted my daughter back.

105
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,300
Lord Qin, I assume

106
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,470
you think I dare not

107
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,110
behead you, huh?

108
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,590
However,

109
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,420
I trust both of them at the same time.

110
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,420
What kind of riddle was that?

111
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,480
I don't understand at all.

112
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,300
Why are you so anxious?

113
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,710
I almost forgot.

114
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,990
Is Xie Chang'er here as well?

115
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,260
You're worried that

116
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,670
Great General might kill Lord Qin

117
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,990
and his followers as well, right?

118
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,180
Lieutenant He,

119
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,500
I'm being serious here.

120
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,030
You always tease me.

121
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,300
Great General!

122
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,470
Father!

123
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,710
Time to eat.

124
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,710
Try the noodles I made for you.

125
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,350
It's delicious.

126
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,110
Ying,

127
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,590
why didn't you ask me

128
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,260
where Lord Qin had gone to?

129
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,230
Father, don't tell me

130
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,300
you want to kill Lord Qin?

131
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,590
He detained my daughter

132
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,110
and blackmailed me with his letter.

133
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,940
Should I not kill him then?

134
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,470
Father,

135
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,820
you detained both of his brothers

136
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,940
and his father too.

137
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,790
That's why Lord Qin has no choice

138
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,940
but to escort me back
without putting up a fight.

139
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,260
We're even now.

140
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,360
Now that I think about it,

141
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,030
you got a better deal out of it.

142
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,670
I wanted to ask you this.

143
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,420
Why did you give Lord Qin
the hairpin your mother

144
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,860
left for you?

145
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,710
It's because he won a bet.

146
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,420
That was my reward for him.

147
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,590
What kind of bet?

148
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,550
What kind of bet is so valuable

149
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,350
that you're using the keepsake
your mother left for you as the reward?

150
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,820
Father, it's like this.

151
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,550
Back then, when we were in Bingzhou,

152
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,420
Han Li fell out with us.

153
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,790
Both Li Ni and I

154
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,350
were in danger.

155
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,470
Therefore,

156
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,710
we made a bet.

157
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,110
The winner of the bet

158
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,110
will receive the aid
of the other person to escape

159
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,470
the place successfully.

160
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,140
The loser will stay in Bingzhou
as the backup.

161
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Li Ni lost the bet.

162
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,710
Therefore,

163
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,470
he helped me to escape first.

164
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,540
I gave him my hairpin

165
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,710
as a reward.

166
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,660
Nonsense.

167
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,230
You won the bet, right?

168
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,020
Why did you give him a reward?

169
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,540
Could it be

170
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,990
that he lost to you on purpose?

171
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,950
Father.

172
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,230
Ying,

173
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,540
don't let him fool you.

174
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,950
Why would he let you know

175
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,310
if he lost to you on purpose

176
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,020
so that you could escape safely?

177
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,860
Father,

178
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,260
do you think your daughter is that dumb?

179
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,830
That's hard to say.

180
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,260
Maybe she became muddle-headed
all of a sudden.

181
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,830
Anyway,

182
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,660
this brat deceived my daughter

183
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,350
and even trapped her in Taiqing Palace.

184
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,740
He's despicable.

185
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,350
That's right.

186
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,540
He's despicable indeed.

187
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,230
Li Ni

188
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,230
is finally in my hands now.

189
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,590
I'll kill him

190
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,350
to vent my frustrations.

191
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,780
Now, Dongdu is
under the control of the Cui Army.

192
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,260
Once we reclaim Xichang,

193
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,310
peace will be restored to the world.

194
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,140
The wish you made
when you left Yingzhou,

195
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,260
which was for the people

196
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,070
to lead a peaceful life,

197
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,950
it'll be realized soon.

198
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,470
Father,

199
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,410
if you kill Li Ni right now,

200
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,650
the people won't be able

201
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,100
to lead a peaceful life.

202
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,010
You didn't say that

203
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,410
when you were in Yingzhou.

204
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,260
You said the imperial Li Family
was incompetent.

205
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,530
Only those who were capable
should rule the world.

206
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,380
Back then,

207
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,260
I didn't know Li Ni yet.

208
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,050
Father,

209
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,260
listen.

210
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,860
Li Ni

211
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,170
comes from Laolan Pass.

212
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,380
He excels at battles.

213
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,860
The rarest thing about him

214
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,290
is that he's not a utilitarian.

215
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,810
He only wishes to quell the rebellion

216
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,380
and return to his pass.

217
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,580
He's someone who can shoulder
great responsibilities

218
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,380
with a benevolent heart.

219
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,860
A person like him

220
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,220
is the best ruler

221
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,410
after the ravages of war.

222
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,580
If not,

223
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,260
the world will descend into chaos again

224
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,100
no matter who ascends the throne.

225
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,220
You were always a proud person.

226
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,500
I never expected you

227
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,530
to take such a liking to Li Ni.

228
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,530
I've already killed him.

229
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,740
Do not mention him again.

230
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,290
I don't trust you.

231
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,290
Father, you'll never kill him.

232
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,770
Why do you say so?

233
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,220
It's because I know you well.

234
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,860
No matter how much you hate him,

235
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,520
you'll have to wait
until we reclaim Xichang

236
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,620
before you burn your bridges

237
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,620
and kill him.

238
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,810
So, according to you,

239
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,690
we should keep Lord Qin alive

240
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,290
as he's still useful to us.

241
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,860
Of course.

242
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,010
Father.

243
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,460
Hurry.

244
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,460
My daughter said

245
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,010
you're still useful to us.

246
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,380
I won't kill you for now.

247
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,810
Are you dumb?

248
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,930
You should escape
if you can't defeat my father.

249
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,620
Do you like it when he ties you up

250
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,530
and put you in a box?

251
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,530
It's not that I can't defeat him.

252
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,500
I mean, I can't defeat him.

253
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,980
Even so, I can't just escape.

254
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,860
I was hoping

255
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,110
that Great General Cui

256
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,530
can help the Zhenxi Army

257
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,740
to reclaim Xichang.

258
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,140
So, Father, you promised Lord Qin

259
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,140
that you'd reclaim
Xichang together with him?

260
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:07,980
Thank you, Father!

261
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,100
Now, you don't need to worry.

262
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,050
You don't need to urge me to eat.

263
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,500
Your noodles must've been soggy by now.

264
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,530
I'll make you another bowl immediately!

265
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,690
Slow down.

266
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,620
Take your time.

267
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,410
Is it nice?

268
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,100
Yeah.

269
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,810
Did the rope do this to you?

270
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,000
It's fine. I'll be fine
after a few days.

271
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,810
You're so silly.

272
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,510
A small punishment is fine, but you
should run when it's severe.

273
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,740
You're a grown-up.

274
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,650
You were tied up and trapped in the box
for an unknown duration.

275
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,520
Aren't you afraid that
you might get injured?

276
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,140
It wasn't that long.

277
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,860
You see,

278
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,260
before you came in,

279
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,140
Great General said

280
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,740
he could dispatch his troops
and aid me in reclaiming

281
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,410
Xichang.

282
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,460
However, he has to tie me up

283
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,380
and keep me in a box.

284
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,770
It all depended on your will.

285
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,890
If you wanted me dead,

286
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,600
he wouldn't need to dispatch his troops.

287
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,580
He would chop my head off immediately.

288
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,860
However, if you wish

289
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,980
to keep me alive,

290
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,110
he promised me that he would dispatch his troops
and aid me in reclaiming Xichang.

291
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,580
Are you that confident

292
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,260
that I didn't want you dead?

293
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,010
What if I duped you into escorting me

294
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,620
to the Cui Army's main camp

295
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,010
so that I could seek my revenge?

296
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,010
You trapped me in Taiqing Palace

297
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,140
for a long time after all.

298
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:49,890
Are you mad at me?

299
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,170
Of course.

300
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,270
You actually held a grudge against me?

301
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,530
Of course.

302
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,720
If so, it wouldn't be good enough

303
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,980
if you just asked your father

304
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,340
to chop my head off.

305
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,500
I have an idea.

306
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,930
What idea?

307
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,100
You see,

308
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,650
a lifetime is a long time.

309
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,610
From now on, why don't you torture me

310
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,140
and order me around

311
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,140
every day?

312
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,210
You can take your frustrations out on me

313
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,290
whenever you feel like it.

314
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,930
I think

315
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,340
that's more fitting.

316
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,400
What do you think?

317
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,050
Just you wish.

318
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,500
I do wish for that to happen.

319
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,380
What should I do?

320
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,010
What should I say?

321
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,290
Taozi?

322
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,770
Eat up.

323
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,220
What's wrong with you?

324
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,690
You were pacing around

325
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,340
like a cat on a hot tin roof.

326
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,860
Don't worry.

327
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,410
I've already checked on Lord Qin.

328
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,100
He's safe.

329
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,500
He's having a meal together with

330
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,010
Lieutenant He in her tent now.

331
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,410
Actually...

332
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,220
Actually, it wasn't because of Lord Qin.

333
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,460
It wasn't because of Lord Qin?

334
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,930
What's wrong then?

335
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,050
I...

336
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:40,930
I was afraid...

337
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,100
I was afraid that I might not be able
to see you again.

338
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,890
You wish to see me every day, huh?

339
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,220
However,

340
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,340
we'll part ways soon.

341
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,620
And, there's a war incoming.

342
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
What if I get injured

343
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,260
or...

344
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,050
No one will tell you about it anyway.

345
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,100
Maybe

346
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,200
I won't get to see you again after this.

347
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,980
What nonsense are you saying?

348
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,930
You won't get injured.

349
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,050
Don't spout nonsense.

350
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,690
You're right.

351
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,110
I have the medicine you gave me.

352
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,410
It's fine even if I get injured.

353
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,930
What a silly guy.

354
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,260
Eat up. It's getting cold.

355
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,690
You have to be careful

356
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,890
when you fight in war.

357
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,570
Don't just think that
you'll get injured.

358
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,770
It's so nice!

359
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,930
Slow down.

360
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,810
The physician said

361
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,300
I mustn't let you overexert yourself.

362
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,930
I don't know

363
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,340
if Ying is safe or not.

364
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,290
How can I wait?

365
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,850
However, you haven't
recovered completely yet.

366
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,580
You're harming yourself
by rushing like this.

367
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,930
Look at the marks on the road.

368
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,020
The Cui Army is nearby.

369
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,060
I have to return to the camp by today.

370
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,860
I can only rest at ease when I see Ying.

371
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,100
Young Master,

372
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,110
Lieutenant He is blessed by the heavens.

373
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,450
I'm sure she's fine.

374
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,300
Young Master!

375
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,210

00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,450
Ying will definitely fall for me.

562
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,300
Ying will definitely fall for me.

563
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:36,860
Ying!

564
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,100
Ying.

565
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:39,970
By then,

566
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,730
you'll definitely fall for me.

567
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,060
The weather is cold tonight.

568
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,490
You should rest inside.

569
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,170
Back then,

570
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,620
I thought no one could rival me.

571
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,380
Pei Xian was getting old

572
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,580
while Cui Yi was being restrained
by Jieshuo.

573
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,210
But now,

574
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,140
it seems like I made the wrong move.

575
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,490
Since Cui Yi has reclaimed Dongdu,

576
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,450
he and Li Ni will surely
be engaged in a conflict.

577
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,930
If he kills Lord Liang,
the fake emperor,

578
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,580
he'll be

579
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,380
Li Ni's sworn enemy by then.

580
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,650
Even if they come at me together,

581
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,580
we can have a showdown

582
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,250
and see who has the last laugh.

583
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,780
I told you so.

584
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,580
Lord Xin cannot defend a city

585
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,100
with his capability.

586
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,250
Luckily, we escaped quickly.

587
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,250
If not,

588
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,210
once Uncle conquers Luoyang City,

589
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,650
who knows what will happen to us by then?

590
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,060
Now that Uncle

591
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,170
has lost his son,

592
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,490
I'm sure he's enraged.

593
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,870
He won't have time to care for me.

594
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,340
But this way,

595
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,930
I'm the only person

596
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,340
who can inherit the Cui family's assets.

597
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,580
He's my uncle after all.

598
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,010
What if Great General finds out
that Young Master Cui was assaulted...

599
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,410
That's impossible.

600
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,930
All of our men disguised themselves.

601
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,410
Even if he does investigate the case,

602
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,380
he can only find out

603
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,580
that they were Li Jun's men.

604
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,300
If not,

605
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,380
how could he attack Luoyang City

606
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,580
out of spite?

607
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,100
If Great General interrogates Lord Xin,

608
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,410
I'm afraid Lord Xin will...

609
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,110
Even if he did
extract information from him,

610
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,580
even if Li Jun did reveal every detail,

611
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,780
he would be just shooting his mouth off.

612
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,780
He'd be spouting nonsense.

613
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,580
Think about it.

614
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,690
Not only did Li Jun set up

615
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,380
and kill his son,

616
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,890
but he also drove a wedge
between me and my uncle.

617
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,620
Why would Uncle trust him?

618
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,980
You've been serving me
for such a long time.

619
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,540
Can you use your brain for once?

620
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,490
Yes, sir.

621
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,580
If so, should we hide

622
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,730
somewhere and see how the situation goes?

623
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,020
That's the only thing we can do.

624
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,300
Master, there's...

625
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,170
That's all we have!

626
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,540
You still want to eat?

627
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,140
What a glutton.

628
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,170
Lieutenant He,

629
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,450
Lord Qin sent us a letter.

630
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,790
He had something nice for you too.

631
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:31,930
Here you go.

632
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,170
(The war is nearing.)

633
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,610
(I suddenly remember
that you loved this.)

634
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,110
(I sent this to you
to relieve your boredom.)

635
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,680
(As the saying goes, chew it delicately
like crushed jade,)

636
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,300
(and seize the momentum
like chopping bamboo.)

637
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,020
(I hope to crush the enemy's morale.)

638
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,730
(I wish you success,
and may you achieve victory.)

639
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,370
(After I return to the capital,)

640
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,910
(I'm willing to head to
the dried fruit store)

641
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,910
(and enjoy the dried fruits there
in large amount.)

642
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,100
(I will entrust both flanks
and my rear wing)

643
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,780
(to you.)

644
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,620
(Send my regard to Great General Cui.)

645
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,730
Lieutenant He,

646
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,820
what did Lord Qin write in his letter?

647
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,300
He hopes

648
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,060
that we may achieve victory.

649
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,450
So, he sent all these here

650
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,860
as a sign of good luck?

651
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,860
That's right.

652
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,650
He troubled Ear to deliver
these dried fruits all the way here

653
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,450
to wish us luck.

654
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,860
Him delivering the dried fruits here

655
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,690
has nothing to do with me.

656
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,300
You're being stubborn when you haven't had
these dried fruits, huh?

657
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,970
Lieutenant He.

658
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,580
Eat up.

659
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:53,860
Youde.

660
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:54,890
What's wrong?

661
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,860
Mister Shiqi, I can't take it anymore!

662
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,620
The Cui Army sold Tong Pass off

663
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,450
and caused the death
of many brothers!

664
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,100
How could we

665
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,510
form an alliance
and attack Xichang together with them?

666
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,610
What if they betray us again?

667
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,480
What should we do by then?

668
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,250
That's right!

669
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,020
What if

670
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,020
they betray us

671
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,420
and surround us from the back?

672
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,810
I met Cui Yi before.

673
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,100
He won't do that.

674
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,020
Like father, like son.

675
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,060
If his son did that,

676
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,400
I'm sure his father would too!

677
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,460
If Cui Yi were someone like that,

678
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,370
he wouldn't let me leave Luoyang.

679
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,310
He wouldn't let me
bring Father back here.

680
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,250
Mister Shiqi,

681
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:28,850
are you sure

682
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,210
we can still trust the Cui Army?

683
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,460
The Zhenxi Army has entrusted
their flanks and rear wing

684
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,580
to us?

685
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,100
It's because our army
is stronger than theirs.

686
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,810
That's why they entrusted their flanks

687
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,100
and rear wing to us.

688
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,420
Li Ni is bold indeed.

689
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,580
He's not afraid

690
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,140
that I might cut off his retreat

691
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,940
and trap him in Xichang, huh?

692
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,500
Father, will you do so?

693
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,140
I trust them.

694
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,290
If Mister Shiqi trusts them,

695
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,330
I'll trust them too.

696
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,290
I trust them too.

697
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,170
Mister Shiqi, I trust you.

698
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,060
If so,

699
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,460
I'll trust Mister Shiqi too.

700
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,650
Youde,

701
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,330
do you trust me?

702
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,980
Of course I trust you.

703
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,650
Thank you for trusting me.

704
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:29,730
Come.

705
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,980
Once we reclaim Xichang,

706
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,170
let's roast a whole lamb together.

707
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,500
Forget about the lamb.

708
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,580
We need to have liquor.

709
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,540
That's right. We need to have liquor.

710
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,060
Cheers.

711
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,210
- Come on.
- Cheers!

712
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,690
I would've dealt with him long ago

713
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,250
if it weren't for you.

714
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,500
Father,

715
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,020
you wouldn't do so.

716
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,020
However,

717
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,020
even if the Cui Army

718
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,500
and the Zhenxi Army

719
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,170
have more soldiers than
Sun Jing's garrison,

720
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,770
Xichang is easy to defend

721
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,580
and hard to attack.

722
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,170
Although Li Ni is a brat,

723
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,290
he doesn't seem like a reckless person.

724
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,420
Has he made other arrangements

725
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,900
in the city?

726
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,730
So Father, you found out.

727
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,140
Actually, Li Ni already sent his men to the city

728
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:27,460
and spread rumors in secret
a few days ago

729
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,690
so that the people would panic

730
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,020
and vie for food.

731
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,460
Now, the people are panicking.

732
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,470
Once we attack the city,

733
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,420
the city

734
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,650
will descend into chaos.

735
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,500
And, I predict

736
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,100
that he'll set fire to the granary

737
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,210
or steal food from it.

738
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,140
Once the city is in chaos
and there's no food in the granary,

739
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,650
the soldiers guarding
the city will starve.

740
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,730
This way, attacking the city
will be much easier.

741
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,580
Really?

742
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,370
What's wrong?

743
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,900
Father, do you think

744
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,940
that arrangement is inappropriate?

745
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,170
Li Ni may look young, but he's mature.

746
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,100
It's likely that he has one more ace
up his sleeves.

747
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,900
And, it's likely that his plan
will be the nail in the coffin.

748
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,460
Setting fire to the granary

749
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,290
and disrupting the people's peace

750
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,290
aren't good enough.

751
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,650
Actually, I also predict

752
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,540
that he has another ace up his sleeves.

753
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,100
However,

754
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,980
I can't tell

755
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,980
what he has in mind for now.

756
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,540
Now, I feel like I understand

757
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:28,900
why

758
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,460
you fell for him.

759
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,650
Father,

760
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,900
we're talking about
official matters here.

761
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,210
I wasn't as bold and meticulous as he is

762
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,170
when I was his age

763
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,810
even though I engaged Jieshuo

764
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,140
in numerous battles

765
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,140
back then.

766
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,900
Father, how could he compare to you?

767
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,060
He was

768
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,370
just lucky.

769
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,560
He wasn't proud and arrogant even
though he was from the imperial family.

770
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,450
He engaged in various battles
from Laolan Pass

771
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,460
all the way here.

772
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,430
He intends to reclaim his lost empire,

773
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,940
and he's protected by a large army.

774
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,290
He's more than

775
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,100
just lucky.

776
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,600
Father, you're praising him too much.

777
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,460
I think

778
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,060
he doesn't

779
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,580
deserve all that praise.

780
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:07,900
Since he's praised

781
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,330
by my daughter,

782
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,290
naturally,

783
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,580
he deserves my praise too.

784
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,810
If so, Father, will you stop picking on him
in the future?

785
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,330
I said

786
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,170
he was good at warfare.

787
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,920
But when it comes to
marrying my daughter,

788
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,920
he can dream about it.

789
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
You're saying that again.

790
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,060
Lord Qin is going
to attack the city soon.

791
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,250
Didn't they say General Pingliang,
Cui Yi,

792
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,540
had conquered Dongdu?

793
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,330
That's Lord Qin's strength.

794
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,420
Not only did he give Cui Yi
a generous gift,

795
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,620
which was Dongdu,

796
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,290
but he also convinced

797
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,460
the Cui Army to join him

798
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,540
in conquering Xichang.

799
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,690
Father,

800
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,100
say, do you think Lord Qin
will achieve success?

801
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,490
On the surface, it seems like he's going
to attack Xichang

802
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,620
together with the Cui Army.

803
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,900
However, I'm sure he made

804
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,810
other plans in secret.

805
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,460
I just don't know

806
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,210
what his plans are

807
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,850
and how to support him.

808
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,810
Prime Minister!

809
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,370
We're in trouble!

810
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,540
Has Lord Qin attacked the city?

811
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,650
Some rioters have raided the granary.

812
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,770
They robbed the granary!

813
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,850
The guards there

814
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,140
couldn't stop them.

815
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,270
After that, for some reason,

816
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,370
the granary caught on fire.

817
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,500
It was raided and set on fire.

818
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,460
I'm afraid

819
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,670
there's nothing much left.

820
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,770
All right. I got it.

821
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,620
You may go.

822
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,500
Order our men to guard the door.

823
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,100
Yes.

824
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:35,980
Wan'niang,

825
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,770
do you understand now?

826
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,010
So, he was targeting the city
with his plans.

827
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:40,940
That's right.

828
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,460
First, he spread rumors of

829
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,210
the city's lack of food supplies.

830
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,770
He caused the people to panic.

831
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,620
After that, he instigated the rioters

832
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,140
to rob and burn down the granary.

833
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,290
Now,

834
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,060
there's no food in the city.

835
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,980
The soldiers guarding the city
will have to starve.

836
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,760
I'm sure they're in no mood
to defend the city.

837
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,540
That's right.

838
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,210
Now, Lord Liang has proclaimed himself
as the emperor.

839
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,650
Sun Jing was known as a tyrant.

840
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,330
And, the city is in chaos.

841
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,690
Xichang

842
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,580
will fall.

843
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,410
Your Highness!

844
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,020
Your Highness!

845
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,250
Your Highness!

846
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,540
The rioters have robbed the granary.

847
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,690
I'm afraid Li Ni will
attack the city soon.

848
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,060
Jing,

849
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,330
I don't want you to go to war anymore.

850
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,500
Let's leave.

851
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,140
I thought

852
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,900
time was flying by

853
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,620
ever since we were reunited.

854
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:47,060
We've already lived half of our lifetime
in a blink of an eye.

855
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,250
Why don't I

856
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,620
put on a suit of armor

857
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,140
and join you in defending the city?

858
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,010
Don't say such silly things.

859
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:05,900
Just stay here.

860
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,420
I'll come back and drink with you

861
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,060
once I fend off Li Ni.

862
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,100
I'll wait for your return.

863
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:34,940
Wait for my return.

864
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,020
Attack!

865
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:56,580
Charge!

866
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,690
Here, and here.

867
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,110
Increase the defense around those areas.

868
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,060
Reporting in!

869
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:10,840
Grand Governor,

870
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,620
the Zhenxi Army and the Cui Army
are too relentless.

871
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,810
They've set up scaling ladders.

872
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,310
Several of our gates are
under the assault.

873
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,580
Our forces are all worn out.

874
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,060
We're suffering heavy casualties!

875
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,500
Order the Imperial Army's rear
detachment to scale the city wall.

876
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,540
(Sun)
Guard the gates.

877
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:22,980
No one is allowed to retreat!

878
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,540
Those who go against my order
will be executed!

879
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:26,580
Yes, Grand Governor!

880
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:23,420
Grand Governor,

881
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,360
the rioters have started
fighting our soldiers.

882
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,050
Some are even stealing
the kerosene defending the gates!

883
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,720
Grand Governor, please give us
your instruction!

884
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:33,980
Leave none of

885
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,140
the rioters alive.

886
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,540
Kill all of them.

887
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:37,510
Yes, Grand Governor.

888
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,170
Grand Governor, the city is in chaos.

889
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,100
We're in dire straits.

890
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,640
Grand Governor, why don't
you leave the city

891
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,290
and regroup our forces in Tong Pass?

892
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,110
We just need to endure
their assault for a few more days.

893
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,500
By then, the army I've sent to Baiyue
will return.

894
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,610
Naturally, we'll be able to surround
the Zhenxi Army and the Cui Army

895
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,650
and annihilate them.

896
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,690
Grand Governor,

897
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,110
when there's life, there's hope!

898
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:04,770
Stop!

899
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,060
Order all soldiers to...

900
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:14,940
Grand Governor!

901
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:15,730
Grand Governor!

902
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,540
Grand Governor!

903
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:17,940
Grand Governor!

904
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:18,850
Grand Governor!

905
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,330
Grand Governor!

906
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:34,420
- Grand Governor!
- Grand Governor!

907
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,850
- Grand Governor!
- Grand Governor!

908
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:03,540
(Zhenxi)

909
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:58,690
Your Highness!

910
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,210
The Zhenxi Army has entered the city!

911
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:00,810
Your Highness!

912
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,330
The Zhenxi Army has entered the city!

913
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:05,460
(Madam Jin,)

914
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:09,850
(since I've agreed to launch
a two-pronged attack with Li Ni,)

915
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,210
(we have to deliver the killing blow)

916
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,500
(to Sun Jing inside the palace too.)

917
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,420
Your Highness, please wake up!

918
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:17,540
