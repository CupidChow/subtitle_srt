=Episode 32=

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,379
It used to be Bao
who would roast the lamb

30
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:51,019
while Youyi,

31
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:53,659
Youde and us would drink together.

32
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,540
I never thought that...

33
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:02,060
Ear.

34
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,418
You are injured.

35
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:04,900
You should drink tea instead.

36
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:12,339
Come.

37
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,260
Let's drink to Bao and the others.

38
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:16,299
To Bao.

39
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,578
Actually,

40
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,258
when His Highness was still unconscious,

41
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:27,459
I could see how calm Miss Cui was.

42
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,260
And it made me admire her so much.

43
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,459
And

44
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,320
I want to give special thanks
to Miss Taozi.

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,179
If you didn't stay by
His Highness's side and give him

46
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:35,440
the acupuncture treatment every day,

47
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,700
we wouldn't know when he would wake up.

48
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:39,978
Actually,

49
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:43,139
we have to thank the imperial physicians
for prescribing the right medicine for him.

50
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,019
It's just that they are not the experienced
when it comes to treating internal injury.

51
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,258
Luckily, the treasury
of the palace holds a lot

52
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:50,700
of premium-quality medicinal herbs.

53
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,698
Otherwise,

54
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,059
Lord Qin would not be able
to wake up so soon.

55
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,659
Actually,

56
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,059
there's something else

57
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,780
that I need your help with.

58
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,179
You can be frank with me,
General Pei Yuan.

59
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,138
I hope

60
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:08,100
that you can convince Miss Cui

61
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,299
to talk to Lord Qin.

62
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,578
All of the ministers in the court

63
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:16,059
are convinced that Lord Qin

64
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,299
will become the crown prince.

65
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,219
But Lord Qin himself
refuses to take that position.

66
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,738
Lord Xin and Lord Qi

67
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,379
both died in their rebellion.

68
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,578
The court is shaken up

69
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,139
and the ministers are feeling anxious.

70
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,500
But I know him.

71
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,820
He wants to return to Laolan Pass.

72
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,298
But if he doesn't

73
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,059
take over the position
as the crown prince,

74
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
I'm afraid that the country
will descend into chaos again.

75
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:40,980
And there won't be peace.

76
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,018
I understand your worries,

77
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,339
General Pei Yuan.

78
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,660
But

79
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,258
my young lady

80
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:53,820
is a very opinionated person.

81
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,059
It's not my place

82
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,700
to say those things to her.

83
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,420
But most importantly,

84
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,100
this

85
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,619
is between Lord Qin

86
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,459
and Miss Cui.

87
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,420
What do you think, Ear?

88
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,739
General Pei Yuan.

89
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,980
Actually,
I've discussed this with Taozi.

90
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:14,859
We won't meddle in

91
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,900
some of Mister Shiqi
and Miss Cui's issues anymore.

92
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,140
Just like some of the issues
between me and Taozi.

93
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,540
We won't tell them
about our issues as well.

94
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,179
Looks like I'm too pedantic.

95
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,619
Let's drink.

96
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:53,278
(Qingyun Temple)

97
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,379
Shiqi.

98
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,100
I won't go in with you.

99
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,859
I had never been to Qingyun Temple.

100
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:24,660
Now that I'm here, I want to explore it.

101
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,900
Greetings, Madam Xiao.

102
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,699
Please take a seat, Your Highness.

103
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,660
I'm sure you've already heard

104
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,580
about what happened in the court.

105
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,939
I never thought
that Lord Xin and Lord Qi

106
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:23,660
would go that far.

107
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,699
Luckily, His Majesty and Your Highness

108
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,499
are both safe and sound.

109
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:32,538
Before this,

110
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,540
I once promised you

111
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,259
that I would convince my father

112
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,299
to appoint Xuanze as the crown prince.

113
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:42,460
Times have changed.

114
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,619
I entrust the great imperial grandson to you
because I trust you.

115
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,900
You are someone who keeps your promise.

116
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:52,938
That's why

117
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:55,100
you are here to see me today.

118
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:58,939
Actually, you know

119
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,580
deep down in your heart

120
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:02,859
that in this current situation,

121
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,618
you have no choice

122
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:06,540
but to become the crown prince.

123
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,699
The court is unstable now.

124
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,780
And the great imperial grandson
is still a child.

125
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,340
He has yet to possess the capability

126
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,299
to handle such a volatile situation.

127
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,498
I also know

128
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:30,699
how reluctant and upset you are
to make this choice.

129
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,379
Just like me who had to become

130
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:36,340
the crown princess,
pretended to love him

131
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:38,938
and got married into the Eastern Palace

132
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:40,379
despite being unwilling.

133
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,140
There are many things in this life
that don't go our way.

134
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,540
We need to live in the now,

135
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,819
adapt to different situations

136
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,379
and live without regrets.

137
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,020
I thought that you were not
a religious person.

138
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,660
There are so many things
that don't go our way in life.

139
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,580
Life is like the morning dew.

140
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,298
You can't help but to cling on to it

141
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:31,780
and ask for more.

142
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:34,500
There are so many gods and deities.

143
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:37,459
Maybe one of them will take pity on us.

144
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:41,819
I know that you asked for...

145
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,660
Don't say it out loud.

146
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,500
Otherwise, it won't come true.

147
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,819
Mother!

148
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,258
Xuanze.

149
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,699
Mother.

150
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,380
I miss you so much, Mother.

151
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,260
Let me take a look at you.

152
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,500
Xuanze.

153
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,900
Are you okay?

154
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,260
It must be hard on you.

155
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,059
It must be so hard on you.

156
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,219
Mother.

157
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:25,420
It must be hard on you.

158
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,540
Mother, I miss you so much.

159
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,380
I really miss you so much.

160
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,420
I'll never leave you again.

161
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,579
I'll never part with you again either.

162
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,939
I won't leave you ever again.

163
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,339
Stop crying.

164
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,699
Mother.

165
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,699
I don't want to be apart
from you ever again.

166
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,099
I won't be apart from you ever again.

167
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,459
So, the divine tree in Qingyun Temple

168
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,059
looks like this.

169
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,140
Lord Qin.

170
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:13,699
Thank you for your constant help.

171
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:16,018
And thank you for escorting us
personally today.

172
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,378
The great imperial grandson

173
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,140
can return safely because of you.

174
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,860
You are too kind, General Han.

175
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,740
I should be the one

176
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,140
to thank you for your loyalty.

177
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,658
General Han

178
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:46,500
is someone who should go down in history.

179
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,219
Yes.

180
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,219
In the past,

181
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:53,540
I just wanted to be a valiant general

182
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,699
to defend the country from our enemies.

183
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,459
I wanted to make
my enemies quiver in fear

184
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:01,140
when they heard my name.

185
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,819
But now, you can stop

186
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:05,819
the tears of children

187
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,459
with your name.

188
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,939
Actually, I know deep down

189
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,540
that I can't return to Laolan Pass.

190
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:18,258
I saw my brothers

191
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:19,579
betraying our own father.

192
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,500
Actually,

193
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,380
they died

194
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,660
of thirst for power

195
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:29,260
and their uncontrollable wild ambition.

196
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,819
Before this,

197
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,780
I always wanted to go back
to Laolan Pass.

198
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,900
But I understand now.

199
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,740
It's not Laolan Pass
that I wanted to return to.

200
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,540
I just want

201
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:46,258
to go back

202
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:47,540
to that simple

203
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,979
and happy life

204
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,900
that was free of all kinds of scheming.

205
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:55,500
I understand

206
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:57,540
that once I become the crown prince,

207
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,658
there will be many things

208
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:01,140
that I have to do involuntarily.

209
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,099
The responsibility
that you have to shoulder

210
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:06,099
when you are a carefree person

211
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:08,780
and when you are a crown prince
is totally different.

212
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,780
I didn't know that in the past.

213
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,059
Or maybe I knew.

214
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,780
But I was unwilling to admit it.

215
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:21,579
For a long time

216
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,339
after the passing of my mother,

217
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:26,140
I didn't want anything either.

218
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,740
I just wanted to go back to the time

219
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:31,099
when my mother was still alive.

220
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,900
Ying.

221
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:39,819
Actually, I know

222
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,979
that both of us

223
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:45,939
wish for the same thing.

224
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:49,500
We wish for a peaceful world.

225
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:53,179
In the hope that the people
will not become homeless anymore.

226
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,320
We want civil officials
and valiant military officials

227
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,660
to be honest and upright.

228
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,780
We hope

229
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,860
that everyone can live a good life.

230
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,500
Xuanze is still young.

231
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:07,059
Yes.

232
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,339
He can't shoulder
such a heavy responsibility.

233
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,420
If he becomes the crown prince,

234
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:16,140
it'll take more than 10 long years

235
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,400
until he can take over
the reins of governing the country.

236
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,620
And my father

237
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:25,900
will not

238
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,500
be able to govern a country properly
for 10 more years.

239
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,540
Since no one else
is capable of doing that,

240
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,740
I'll have to see to it myself.

241
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:46,099
Bao and the others

242
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,579
will not be able to return
to Zhao Village.

243
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,018
But Zhao Village

244
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:52,860
is not the only village in this world.

245
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,260
There are so many wanderers out there.

246
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:01,059
And so many pairs of husband and wife,

247
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,179
parents and children

248
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,939
who are separated

249
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,500
due to unceasing war.

250
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,620
I feel remorseful.

251
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,939
I regret not being able to save

252
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,179
Bao and the others.

253
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,780
But now, I have a chance.

254
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,339
I have a chance

255
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,819
to save more people now.

256
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,819
I want to save more people.

257
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:04,939
(On the first year of Tiantai's reign,)

258
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,860
(the year of Yi Wei,)

259
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,660
(according to His Majesty,)

260
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,699
(Lord Qin, Li Ni,)

261
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,378
(is filial, loyal,)

262
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:15,339
(valiant and capable.)

263
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,339
(He saved the world,
the imperial family line)

264
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,699
(and society from danger.)

265
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,378
(With the agreement of the Lords)

266
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:23,018
(and fellow ministers,)

267
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:26,778
(Lord Qin will now be appointed
as Crown Prince.)

268
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,299
(Please accept His Majesty's decree)

269
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:31,778
(and may you be virtuous,)

270
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:34,618
(magnanimous and diligent)

271
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,658
(to protect and guard)

272
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:39,260
(the foundation of this country.)

273
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:55,913
(Coronation of Crown Prince)

274
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,179
Thank you, Your Majesty.

275
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:14,420
Your Majesty.

276
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,300
You seem unhappy today.

277
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,539
The crown prince left the city

278
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,099
together with Miss Cui again today.

279
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,819
Many people saw them.

280
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,858
They are talking about it

281
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:32,860
like a piece of interesting news now.

282
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,860
You are indeed wise, Your Majesty.

283
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:46,938
It's indeed

284
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:48,579
no appropriate to appoint Miss Cui

285
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,979
as the crown princess.

286
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,618
The Cui family is a powerful family.

287
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,860
Selecting her as the crown princess

288
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:55,378
will neither benefit the crown prince

289
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:57,019
nor the court.

290
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,339
You'll have to weaken

291
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,739
and dissolve the Cui Army in the future.

292
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,380
If Miss Cui becomes the crown princess,

293
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,100
she'll become an obstacle for you.

294
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,099
You are right.

295
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,499
You are totally right.

296
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:18,660
But

297
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,380
if Miss Cui can't become
the crown princess,

298
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:24,819
I'll have to choose

299
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,858
another outstanding woman
from a noble family

300
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:28,539
to become the crown princess.

301
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,499
During the banquet
that was held for Miss Cui,

302
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:34,620
I did some observations.

303
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,618
And I think
that Prime Minister Gu's daughter,

304
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,219
Gu Wan'niang, is a good choice for him.

305
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,979
Not only does she have your approval,

306
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,300
she is also
Prime Minister Gu's daughter.

307
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:46,259
Looks like

308
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,979
she's an outstanding woman.

309
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,300
Good.

310
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,660
This is great.

311
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,779
Young Lady.

312
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,779
What's wrong?

313
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:06,138
Third Lady's maidservant, Chunling,

314
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:08,458
mocked me today.

315
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:09,739
She said

316
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,819
that Lord Qin

317
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,259
goes out with Miss Cui every day.

318
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,339
Everyone knows

319
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,299
that Lord Qin is going
to marry Miss Cui.

320
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,539
She also said

321
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,178
that Miss Cui is such a capable person.

322
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:20,499
She can wield both pen and sword.

323
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,299
So, she said
that you should stop dreaming

324
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,618
about becoming the crown princess.

325
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:24,819
She also said

326
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,979
that you'll be a laughing stock

327
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,620
when Miss Cui becomes
the crown princess.

328
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,739
What did you say?

329
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,698
I did as you told me before.

330
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,618
So, I kept quiet

331
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,339
and left with my head down.

332
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,218
Just like that,

333
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:42,819
Chunling led a group of maidservants

334
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,860
to laugh at me together.

335
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:47,779
Don't get carried away by success.

336
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,140
And don't be defeated by failure.

337
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,340
That is how a great man
or woman should act.

338
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,499
Moreover,

339
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,698
it's improper for a lady

340
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:59,340
to travel with Lord Qin all the time.

341
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,660
It'll be fine if Miss Cui

342
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,459
becomes the crown princess.

343
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,979
But if another woman ends up
becoming the crown princess,

344
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:12,219
she'll become a laughingstock.

345
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:13,979
You are right.

346
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,739
I'll just sit back and see

347
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,579
if Miss Cui

348
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,699
will become the crown princess or not.

349
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,218
(Chaoqian Hall)

350
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:30,259
Your Majesty.

351
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,698
Since the crown prince
has been selected,

352
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:32,779
it's best

353
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,618
to choose a crown princess
for His Highness

354
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:37,520
so that they can have heirs
as soon as possible

355
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,060
to carry on the imperial family line.

356
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,380
I agree.

357
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:43,779
We should select a few good women

358
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,339
out of all the prestigious

359
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,499
and noble families

360
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,579
to be Crown Princess,

361
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,499
Lady of Excellence,

362
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,820
Lady of Treasure.

363
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,660
Your Majesty.

364
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:59,779
The war has just ended and everything
has just started to settle down.

365
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,979
I don't think it's a good time

366
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,819
to do a wife selection right now.

367
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,100
It'll alarm the people.

368
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:06,699
Crown Prince is right.

369
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,259
Now is not a good time to do

370
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,779
a grand selection.

371
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,779
We should choose the crown princess
for Crown Prince first.

372
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,898
I think

373
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:20,060
that the sixth daughter
of Prime Minister Gu is good enough

374
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,820
to be crowned as the crown princess.

375
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,979
Your Majesty.

376
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,178
My daughter is not worthy

377
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:31,340
of that title.

378
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,099
Your Majesty.

379
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,979
Your original intention was to select

380
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,418
the daughter of Cui Yi

381
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:37,739
as prince's consort.

382
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,979
Isn't it the perfect solution
to crown her as the crown princess now?

383
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:46,099
You are wrong, Minister Pei.

384
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,819
Cui Yi is an arrogant man.

385
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,259
He wrote a letter

386
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,819
saying that he'll choose a son-in-law

387
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,820
for his daughter among the princes.

388
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,499
And I didn't agree to it.

389
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,140
The idea was opposed
by many of the ministers too.

390
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:02,339
Moreover, it's inappropriate

391
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,580
to crown Miss Cui

392
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,259
as the crown princess now.

393
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,858
You are right, Your Majesty.

394
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,739
Cui Yi leads an army
of 100,000 soldiers.

395
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,259
He's swollen with arrogance.

396
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,618
It's unwise to crown

397
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:15,979
Miss Cui as the crown princess now.

398
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,698
Otherwise,

399
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:18,939
it'll become a threat to us.

400
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:20,819
I agree.

401
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,819
We can't crown

402
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,699
Miss Cui as the crown princess.

403
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,779
I agree.

404
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,618
I agree.

405
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:30,660
I agree.

406
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,499
- I agree.
- I agree.

407
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,499
Your Majesty.

408
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,779
I think it's too early
to talk about my marriage.

409
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:46,779
We have Jieshuo in the north,

410
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,580
Qing Army in the west

411
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:50,618
and Baiyue in the south.

412
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,858
How can I build a family

413
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:53,380
when our enemies roam about?

414
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:55,579
Getting married and having children

415
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,378
are of great importance.

416
00:22:57,379 --> 00:22:59,040
How can you not build a family

417
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,739
just because our enemies
are still out there?

418
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,499
Wise words, Your Majesty.

419
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,739
His Highness

420
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,779
should choose a crown princess
as soon as possible

421
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,138
to carry on the imperial family line

422
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:10,219
for the future of the country.

423
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,739
Wise words, Your Majesty.

424
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,618
His Highness

425
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:17,658
should choose a crown princess
as soon as possible

426
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:20,979
to carry on the imperial family line

427
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,860
for the future of the country.

428
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,218
Shiqi.

429
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:29,459
Give this a taste.

430
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,420
You didn't rush here

431
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:45,939
just to drink a cup of tea, right?

432
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:53,420
Shiqi.

433
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
I'm sure you know what His Majesty

434
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:57,779
and the ministers want.

435
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:01,458
Cui Yi is now Great General Pingliang

436
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:02,939
and Weiyang.

437
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,418
Although he has retired
as the commander-in-chief of Shuozhou,

438
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,178
the 100,000 soldiers in the Cui Army

439
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,580
are loyal to Cui Yi.

440
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:13,259
His power will be passed down to her.

441
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,420
How can a crown princess wield
that much military power?

442
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,858
Moreover,

443
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:20,178
if Cui Yi

444
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:21,499
really becomes imperial relative,

445
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,059
it'll be hard to keep him in line.

446
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,259
I'm afraid that it'll become
a huge trouble in the future.

447
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,739
Did Great General Pei

448
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,060
ask you to say these words to me?

449
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,900
No.

450
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:34,099
My father didn't want
to make it difficult for you.

451
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,259
But I feel

452
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,858
that I should tell you the truth

453
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:39,100
so that we can discuss it.

454
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:41,900
I will find a way.

455
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,699
Actually, as you can see today,

456
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,178
the majority of the ministers

457
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:48,898
feel the same way too.

458
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:49,739
Even you think

459
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,259
that I shouldn't marry Ying.

460
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,019
Shiqi.

461
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:57,458
I know you.

462
00:24:57,459 --> 00:25:00,019
I know that you love Miss Cui deeply.

463
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,019
But

464
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,979
if you marry Miss Cui

465
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,299
and crown her as the crown princess,

466
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,339
the ministers

467
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,660
will not be able to accept the Cui Army.

468
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:18,499
Time has changed.

469
00:25:18,699 --> 00:25:21,219
The world is at peace now.

470
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:23,019
It's inevitable to dissolve

471
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,259
some of the armies.

472
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,059
Even for the Zhenxi Army,

473
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,979
a portion of our extra soldiers

474
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,898
has been laid off.

475
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:33,019
Actually, you know better than anyone

476
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,218
that the Cui Army is out of our control.

477
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:37,938
And it's a big army.

478
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:39,698
If it's dissolved now,

479
00:25:39,699 --> 00:25:41,739
the soldiers return to their homes.

480
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,378
But if it's not dissolved

481
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:45,579
and we have to cross swords

482
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,380
with it in the future,

483
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:48,979
it'll be truly terrible

484
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,939
and it'll be hopeless for us.

485
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,019
I'm sure there's a way
that can satisfy both parties.

486
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,340
Shiqi, this is what I think.

487
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,499
Actually, Miss Cui

488
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:06,100
is a reasonable person.

489
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,099
If you explain the situation

490
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,138
to her sincerely,

491
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:10,698
I'm sure...

492
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:11,620
No.

493
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:13,979
I can't treat her like that.

494
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,200
(Pineapple Sakura Pastry, Yolk Pastry,
Date and Walnut Pastry)

495
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,499
Farewell.

496
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,458
Young Lady.

497
00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:32,080
This confection is delicious.

498
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,000
You won't get tired of it
no matter how much you eat.

499
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:35,938
It has the slight fragrance of rose

500
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:36,979
and the taste of lychee.

501
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,299
It's neither too sweet nor cloying.

502
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,340
Young Lady.

503
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:40,059
Ear and I

504
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,378
have made a decision

505
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:43,378
to open a shop like this

506
00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:44,218
in the future

507
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:46,138
that sells delicious confections.

508
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:47,059
That's a great idea.

509
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,299
When you open your shop,

510
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,600
I'll be your first customer.

511
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,618
You have to buy a lot of confections
from us then.

512
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:52,458
Of course.

513
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:53,787
I'll buy a lot from you.

514
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:54,698
(Tang Confectionery)

515
00:26:54,699 --> 00:26:56,418
Later, buy some

516
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:57,858
rose lychee sakura yoghurt cubes for me.

517
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:59,019
I want to give them to someone.

518
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,900
Young Lady.

519
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:03,060
Are you going to give them
to His Highness?

520
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,418
No.

521
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:05,938
Who else are you going to give them to

522
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:07,539
if not His Highness?

523
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,259
That's a secret.

524
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:12,340
Why do you have so many secrets?

525
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:15,620
Get into the horse stance.

526
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:17,140
Hold the squat.

527
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,699
Pay attention.

528
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,259
Focus.

529
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:22,459
Go.

530
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:27,420
Go.

531
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:31,938
Are you tired?

532
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:32,900
No.

533
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:34,140
Let's do it again.

534
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:38,179
Very good.

535
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
Again.

536
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,860
Harder.

537
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:49,100
Again.

538
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:55,787
(Meditate And Be Kind)

539
00:27:55,788 --> 00:27:57,584
(Tang Confectionery)

540
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:02,259
I'm grateful that you still remember me

541
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,420
who no longer
pay attention to secular things.

542
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:06,059
And thank you for bringing me

543
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,340
such delicate confections.

544
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:10,178
The great imperial grandson
is still a kid.

545
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:11,539
I think he'll love them.

546
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,499
So, I brought them over.

547
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,698
His Highness is the crown prince now.

548
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:19,219
Xuanze is no longer
the great imperial grandson.

549
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:21,618
Please don't address him like that

550
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:23,380
after this.

551
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:25,019
I understand.

552
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,660
To be honest,

553
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:29,618
in the past ten years or so,

554
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:32,100
I had never been
as peaceful as I am now.

555
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,979
Although this place is secluded

556
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,420
and away from bustling world,

557
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,779
it feels

558
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,779
like coming home after a long time.

559
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,779
I love it here.

560
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,860
Yes.

561
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,259
When you

562
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,218
looked at Xuanze just now,

563
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:48,939
you were smiling broadly.

564
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,019
It was a look of pure contentment.

565
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,699
Miss Cui.

566
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,299
You'll become

567
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,739
the crown princess soon, right?

568
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:03,459
I'm not so sure about it.

569
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,218
You and His Highness
are in love with each other.

570
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:10,380
I'm sure you will become
the crown princess.

571
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,820
But

572
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:18,739
to be honest.

573
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,019
I feel that it's a pity for you.

574
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,858
Others only know that the crown prince

575
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:26,938
is above all

576
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:28,340
but one.

577
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:30,059
And they only know

578
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,979
that the crown princess
will be the future empress

579
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,898
who will rule over the women
in the palace.

580
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,859
They only know that she is
the most important woman

581
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,380
after the empress.

582
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,579
But no one will know

583
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,218
how difficult it is

584
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:44,259
to be the crown princess.

585
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,939
Just now, you said

586
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,900
that you had never been
as peaceful as you are now

587
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:53,739
in the past ten years or so.

588
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,939
Yes.

589
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,699
During Sun Jing's rebellion,

590
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,820
I had to endure
all the contempts and insults

591
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:05,499
to seek revenge.

592
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:08,380
But when I was the crown princess,

593
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,378
there was never a day

594
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:12,340
where I could live as I pleased.

595
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:15,100
If you become the crown princess,

596
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:18,019
you'll lose yourself.

597
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,499
Your emotions

598
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:24,459
and your thoughts

599
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,380
won't matter anymore.

600
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:33,420
Your fate will be tied
to the actions of the crown prince

601
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,300
and the rise and fall of the court.

602
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:41,060
You'll never be free of it.

603
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,060
Being the crown princess

604
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:47,620
is an honor.

605
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,019
But it's a shackle too.

606
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,620
Did you

607
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:57,539
love the late crown prince?

608
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,539
Even if I loved him,

609
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,539
do you think these hardships

610
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,380
would be gone?

611
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:10,699
There are many things

612
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,299
that a crown princess

613
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,979
has to do because they are her duties.

614
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,580
You've made your sacrifice.

615
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,179
You didn't let
the late crown prince down.

616
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,060
Actually, I just want

617
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,739
to live with a clear conscience.

618
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,380
The hardest thing to do

619
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,060
in life

620
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,539
is to have a clear conscience.

621
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:39,979
We've just met

622
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,979
for a few times.

623
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,860
I've overstepped my boundaries today.

624
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:46,539
That's not true.

625
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,340
Since the beginning of time,

626
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:52,779
I think there has never been a time

627
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,300
when a crown princess
has a deep conversation

628
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,499
with another crown princess.

629
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,539
We are fated to meet each other.

630
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,860
Your Highness.

631
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:18,179
Be at ease.

632
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:19,259
Why did you

633
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,660
ask me to come here?

634
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,259
It is rude of me

635
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,858
to ask you out so abruptly.

636
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,140
Actually, I feel uneasy.

637
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,099
I know that you intend

638
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,820
to marry Miss Cui.

639
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,219
I never thought

640
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,060
that His Majesty would mention my name.

641
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:39,858
I don't know

642
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:41,939
why His Majesty would do so.

643
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,339
If you allow it,

644
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,300
I can ask my father to send in a report

645
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:49,299
to say that I'm not suitable
for marriage

646
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,739
due to my health issues.

647
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,858
I'm willing to become a nun.

648
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:55,340
You are overthinking this.

649
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:58,299
Don't ruin your future just because

650
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,259
of His Majesty's jesting.

651
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:02,200
But they say

652
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,300
that an emperor's words
are to be taken seriously.

653
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:06,299
I don't want to be the reason

654
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,939
to affect

655
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,420
the marriage between you and Miss Cui

656
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,860
or drive a wedge between you and her.

657
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:16,699
I don't mind becoming a nun.

658
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,539
It's really nothing.

659
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,739
Don't worry.

660
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:22,860
No one

661
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,299
can drive a wedge

662
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,660
between Ying and me.

663
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,380
Okay then.

664
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,819
Thank you

665
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,059
for visiting Madam Xiao.

666
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,898
It has been a long time

667
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:34,499
since she's this happy.

668
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,300
I need not tell you much

669
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,979
about what happened in the palace.

670
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,900
After the return of the great...

671
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,579
After the return of Xuanze,

672
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,939
she's finally starting to smile again.

673
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:46,979
And there's light in her eyes

674
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,618
when you visit her.

675
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:51,418
I'm really thankful to you

676
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:52,499
for being able

677
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,580
to speak to her heart.

678
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:56,339
At first, I felt bad

679
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,299
to disturb her peaceful life here.

680
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,739
But then, I remember

681
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,620
that Xuanze is still a child.

682
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,339
She must be feeling

683
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,858
mentally and physically exhausted

684
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:07,420
after so many years.

685
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,539
That's why I want to visit her often.

686
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,338
I hope you won't think
that I'm too noisy.

687
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:12,298
Of course not.

688
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:13,338
I always

689
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:14,899
look forward to your visit.

690
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,099
Although Madam Xiao doesn't say it,

691
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,298
she looks forward

692
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:20,059
to your visit too.

693
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,939
Ying.

694
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:31,979
His Highness is here to escort you.

695
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,859
I won't

696
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,380
see you off then.

697
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:35,419
If Madam Xiao

698
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,738
needs anything after this,

699
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,099
feel free to visit me or Taozi

700
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,379
at my residence.

701
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,220
Okay.

702
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,340
Is Xuanze doing well?

703
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,059
He's doing quite well.

704
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:00,780
Why don't you visit him?

705
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,300
Children are sensitive.

706
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,260
And he had endured so much.

707
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:06,619
He has just arrived here.

708
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:08,178
I'm afraid that if I visit him now,

709
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,698
I'll trouble him.

710
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:11,059
He won't.

711
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,818
General Han has taught him well.

712
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:13,579
And Madam Xiao

713
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,340
has taken care of him well too.

714
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,340
Is it too restrictive for him?

715
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:19,780
You are worried

716
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:21,338
about him feeling restricted

717
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:22,499
and troubled.

718
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,099
But you refuse to visit him yourself.

719
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:25,899
What am I going to do with you?

720
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,059
Young Lady.

721
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,539
Isn't that His Highness and Miss Cui?

722
00:35:33,259 --> 00:35:34,260
Wait.

723
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:36,459
Why do I feel like

724
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,059
what we said just now

725
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,659
sounded wrong?

726
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,698
A strict father and a kind mother.

727
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:43,658
Why do I feel like I'm the kind mother

728
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:45,298
while you are the strict father?

729
00:35:45,299 --> 00:35:47,979
I'm trying to accommodate him

730
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,300
while you are so decisive
and frank with him.

731
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,298
We are not parents.

732
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:54,300
I think you just want to get hit.

733
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,780
Let's get onto the carriage.

734
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,420
Let's go.

735
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,698
Madam Xiao and Xuanze

736
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:25,220
have finally settled down.

737
00:36:25,779 --> 00:36:27,419
Xuanze has grown taller again.

738
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,619
And he's getting better and better
at fighting.

739
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,618
The war has just ended.

740
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:34,939
The world

741
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,900
is like a child right now.

742
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,099
It needs to be cultivated slowly

743
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,420
so that it can recuperate in peace.

744
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,338
I plan to convince

745
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:43,859
my father to reduce or cancel the tax

746
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,780
next year in spring.

747
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:47,579
And for those unowned fields,

748
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:49,298
we should measure and register them

749
00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:50,420
one by one

750
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,520
so that we can distribute them
to those in need of a field.

751
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,138
That way,

752
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:55,379
we can ease the burdens

753
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,019
of the people.

754
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,740
Before the war,

755
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,939
most of the people

756
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,818
were once kind citizens.

757
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:05,659
But they were forced to become outlaws
just to survive.

758
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,459
And there are still many refugees

759
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,380
going back and forth
between different states.

760
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,818
It'll become a trouble

761
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:12,420
sooner or later.

762
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:14,139
Yes.

763
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:16,820
I'm thinking about that too.

764
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:19,380
Just like Huang and the others.

765
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,619
They were kind people.

766
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,180
However,
due to the war and the expropriation,

767
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:26,900
they were forced to become bandits.

768
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,340
I want to give you something.

769
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:44,019
This is so cute.

770
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:46,780
Is this me?

771
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:48,900
My legs are not that short.

772
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,160

773
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,380
This is you.

774
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,260
The face is so round.

775
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,709
I'm not good at drawing.

We can't see it if it's too small.

779
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,900
So, I have to enlarge it.

780
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:18,258
The painting that you drew

781
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:19,298
of me when I was working hard

782
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,979
is nicely framed up by me.

783

When are you

784
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,778
going to draw a picture of you for me?

785
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:25,658
Can't you draw it yourself?

786
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:27,150
I did. But you are not satisfied with it.

everything that
we had gone through together.

800
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:26,258
And I left the rest of the pages blank
so that we can draw on them together

801
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:27,419
in the future.

802
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,340
Okay?

803
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,939
We still have a long way ahead of us.

a lot more interesting stories for us.

806
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,019
After we use up all the pages,
we'll draw on a new drawing book.

we'll draw on another one.

Father.

819
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,459
I heard that Great General Pei was here.

820
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,740
What did he say?

821
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:48,979
He said

822
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,059
that His Majesty and the ministers

823
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,120
are against the idea of crowning you
as the crown princess.

824
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,939
I gave him a sarcastic rebuttal.

825
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,099
But he sighed instead.

826
00:40:57,659 --> 00:40:59,939
He said that you and His Highness
love each other.

827
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:03,499
He said that an old man like him

828
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:05,579
doesn't want to separate
the two of you either.

829
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:11,300
His advice for me is to

830
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:13,900
dissolve the Cui Army

831
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:17,258
and send all of our soldiers
back to their homeland

832
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:19,099
in order to give you a chance

833
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:21,860
to marry Li Ni and become
the crown princess.

834
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,300
But

835
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,300
now that the world is at peace,

836
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,459
I'm sure the court
wants to dissolve most of the armies.

837
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,618
Not only the Zhenxi Army,

838
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:35,059
the Cui Army

839
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,019
will be the first to bear the brunt.

840
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:42,300
If Jieshuo didn't ambush Baishui Pass,

841
00:41:43,179 --> 00:41:44,459
I'm afraid

842
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:46,178
that the court

843
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:48,260
would dissolve the Cui Army even sooner.

844
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,539
Father.

845
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,760
Now that you've sent
the spoils of war to the country,

846
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,780
maybe

847
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,860
you should return to Yingzhou now.

848
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,818
If you stay in the capital any longer,

849
00:41:56,819 --> 00:42:00,059
it won't do any good
to both the Cui Army and the court.

850
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:01,138
If the court

851
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:03,499
really wants to dissolve the Cui Army,

852
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,459
I'm worried

853
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,780
that someone will target you.

854
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,659
What about you?

855
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,820
Aren't you going to come back with me?

856
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:16,138
If I leave together with you,

857
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:17,939
they'll become suspicious of me.

858
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,019
I'll stay in the capital.

859
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,300
I'll be fine.

860
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,579
In the end,

861
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,579
you just want to stay here with Li Ni.

862
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,579
Father.

863
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,539
You always say that he's a fool, right?

864
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,859
Since he's a fool,

865
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,138
I should stay

866
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:32,260
and help him.

867
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,459
You are so biased.

868
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,979
You've never done so much for me.

869
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,019
But you always think

870
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,499
about helping an outsider.

871
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:41,059
If it was up to me,

872
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,298
I really wanted

873
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:43,939
to give him a good beating.

874
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,138
Enough, Father.

875
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:45,859
Don't be mad.

876
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,420
Come. Drink some tea.

877
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,059
He's Crown Prince now.

878
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,019
If you beat him up,

879
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,900
you'll be punished.

880
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,499
Young Master.

881
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:14,939
Eat some food.

882
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:16,820
I'm not hungry.

883
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:18,780
You can eat it.

884
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,059
I'm not hungry too.

885
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,939
Young Master.

886
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,059
You took Jieshuo's medicine.

887
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,420
If you don't take it again on time,

888
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:34,320
all of your tendons and bones
will break and kill you.

889
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:37,258
We better find a way

890
00:43:37,259 --> 00:43:38,380
to return to Jieshuo.

891
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,260
Chief Wuluo

892
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:46,939
gave his most trusted
Divine Arrow Team to me.

893
00:43:47,139 --> 00:43:49,260
But the whole team was destroyed.

894
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:54,700
Now, Li Ni has become the crown prince.

895
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,979
I won't allow him
to be together with Ying.

896
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,340
Looks like

897
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,820
I have to risk myself
to enter the capital.

898
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,619
What is your plan?

899
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:09,420
Looks like I'll have to use

900
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:11,499
that person

901
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:14,099
who was left behind by Sun Jing.

902
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,980
(Gu Residence)

903
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,220
Father.

904
00:44:34,779 --> 00:44:35,820
Father.

905
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,780
You are here.

906
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:50,860
Come here and take a seat.

907
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,218
Are you

908
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:56,619
exhausted?

909
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,539
An old friend came to visit me just now.

910
00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:01,258
We had a short conversation.

911
00:45:01,259 --> 00:45:03,619
That's why I was distracted.

912
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:06,698
Did you ask for me

913
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:08,260
because you have things to tell me?

914
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:09,979
Yes.

915
00:45:10,659 --> 00:45:12,939
Now, the court is in chaos

916
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,700
due to the issue of the crown princess.

917
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:17,780
You must be behind it then.

918
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,778
Our emperor

919
00:45:20,779 --> 00:45:21,859
is easily swayed.

920
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,700
He doesn't have his own opinion.

921
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,939
We just need to say the right thing
to get what we want.

922
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:32,298
Now, we have reached a mutual agreement
about not crowning Miss Cui

923
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:34,059
as the crown princess.

924
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,658
Even if His Highness

925
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:37,059
is bent on having his own way,

926
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:37,979
he won't be able

927
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,618
to fight against His Majesty's decree

928
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:41,740
and the opposition from the ministers.

929
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:43,778
But His Highness

930
00:45:43,779 --> 00:45:44,979
and Miss Cui

931
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,579
are not ordinary people.

932
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,738
If they work hand-in-hand on this,

933
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:51,419
I'm afraid that they'll be able
to come up with a way to counter it.

934
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,499
So, we need to come up with a way

935
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,658
to make sure that His Highness

936
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:56,340
can't work hand-in-hand

937
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,180
with Miss Cui.

938
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,019
You've been the prime minister
for decades.

939
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,618
No matter how difficult something is,

940
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:07,338
you are always capable

941
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:09,300
of handling it nicely.

942
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,300
This is nothing to you.

943
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,459
The child of the crown princess

944
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,340
will become the future emperor.

945
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:18,738
Whether or not
you can be the grandfather

946
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:20,539
of that future emperor,

947
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,820
it'll be up to you.

948
00:46:47,779 --> 00:46:48,658
Why are you lying here

949
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:49,860
in that outfit?

950
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,459
Come here.

951
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,979
Ying.

952
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,379
When your father left,

953
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,918
how many soldiers
did he leave behind for you?

954
00:46:58,918 --> 00:47:01,260
Why do I feel like this residence
is not protected at all?

955
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,218
I can't move well at all
when I'm wearing this.

956
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:04,579
When I came here just now,

957
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,499
I wasn't careful about it at all.

958
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,459
But no one noticed

959
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,579
and no one stopped me.

960
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,019
Although the capital is safe now,

961
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,619
you still need to be on guard.

962
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:15,379
So, did you come here

963
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,859
right after court without going back

964
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,459
to get changed first?

965
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,700
You don't know it.

966
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,979
But after my future father-in-law
left the capital,

967
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,019
the court burst into an uproar

968
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,178
and everyone was forcing me
to choose my crown princess.

969
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:28,059
And they refused

970
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,380
to let me marry you.

971
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,260
They were so noisy.

972
00:47:31,699 --> 00:47:33,499
So, I retaliated.

973
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:34,579
In the end,

974
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:36,939
they cried and screamed.

975
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,059
And my father

976
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,979
used that chance to lecture me again.

977
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,059
So annoying.

978
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,939
Who's your future father-in-law?

979
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,979
Are you serious?

980
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,818
Are you going to forget about me

981
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:52,220
now that your father is gone?

982
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:54,260
Ying.

983
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,340
Let's elope.

984
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,338
This world

985
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:03,780
belongs to the imperial family.

986
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:04,979
Where do you think

987
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,780
we can elope to?

988
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:11,700
How about you return to Yingzhou first?

989
00:48:11,739 --> 00:48:13,459
I'll tell those ministers

990
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,780
that I won't marry anyone.

991
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,900
Then, they can marry
the crown princess of their choice.

992
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:18,658
Next, I'll find a reason

993
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:19,738
and go to Yingzhou.

994
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:21,220
We'll get married there

995
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:23,539
and have seven or eight children.

996
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,400
We don't even need
seven or eight children.

997
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,720
By the time we have our third child,
maybe the ministers will give up

998
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,338
and crown you as the crown princess.

999
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,698
Do you know

1000
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,178
how long it'll take

1001
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:33,859
to have seven or eight children?

1002
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,260
I know.

1003
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:37,420
At least eight or ten years.

1004
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:40,420
By that time, it'll be too late.

1005
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,939
What can we do?

1006
00:48:42,299 --> 00:48:44,659
I can't just leave behind
the state affairs.

1007
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,338
If I leave,

1008
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:48,099
I don't know

1009
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,298
what kind of trouble

1010
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:50,939
my father will stir up again.

1011
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,860
If anything happens,
I'll have to clean up the mess again.

1012
00:48:56,259 --> 00:48:57,618
How about this?

1013
00:48:57,619 --> 00:48:59,380
I should return to Yingzhou.

1014
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,419
I just

1015
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,338
want to be your wife anyway.

1016
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,099
I don't want to be the crown princess.

1017
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,258
Then,

1018
00:49:05,259 --> 00:49:06,979
you can just visit me often.

1019
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:10,579
How could you say that?

1020
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:12,218
I'm the crown prince now.

1021
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:13,778
But you don't want
to be the crown princess.

1022
00:49:13,779 --> 00:49:15,080
Who else will be
the crown princess then?

1023
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,019
I'll punish you

1024
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,380
for saying that.

1025
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:22,579
Your Highness.

1026
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,698
General Pei Yuan is here.

1027
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:25,280
He has something urgent
to discuss with you.

1028
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:31,979
Wait for me.

1029
00:49:47,259 --> 00:49:48,059
Father.

1030
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,300
Be at ease.

1031
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,139
Bring in the criminal!

1032
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,059
(Jieshuo. Jia Li)
I'm Jia Li from Jieshuo's Shenli Troops.

1033
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,738
Greetings, Your Majesty.

1034
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:11,618
Long live, Your Majesty.

1035
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:12,700
Enough.

1036
00:50:13,699 --> 00:50:15,459
You say that you'll give us a name.

1037
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,859
Who is it?

1038
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,019
