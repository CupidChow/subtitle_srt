29
00:01:49,097 --> 00:01:49,817
Young Master.

30
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,097
Young Master.

31
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:53,138
Taozi, Chen Xing,

32
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:54,637
it must've been a long trip.

33
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:56,097
How's Father's health?

34
00:01:56,457 --> 00:01:57,298
Young Master,

35
00:01:57,298 --> 00:01:59,177
(Cui Army's Bodyguards,)
initially, His Lordship had a cold.

36
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:00,418
(Taozi, Chen Xing)
And, his old wound ruptured

37
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:01,457
when he was attacking Hanzhou.

38
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:03,440
That's why he rested
and recuperated for some time.

39
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,737
But now, he's fine.

40
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:05,897
You don't need to worry.

41
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:08,457
His Lordship misses you
and Lieutenant He.

42
00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:09,258
He said

43
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,617
you had old wounds,

44
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:12,497
and no one could
look after Lieutenant He.

45
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:14,177
That's why he dispatched
me and Chen Xing

46
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:15,080
to the frontline again.

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,018
Lieutenant He is missing.

48
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:17,457
What?

49
00:02:18,657 --> 00:02:19,777
But fortunately,

50
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:21,298
you made it back safely.

51
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:22,737
I'm afraid

52
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:24,897
you're the only person
who can locate her now.

53
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:26,777
Young Master, don't worry.

54
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:29,057
As long as Lieutenant He
uses the same medicinal powder,

55
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:30,538
I can definitely find her.

56
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:35,897
Speak!

57
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:39,320
(Bandit of Mingdai Mountain, Huang Youyi)
Why did you two sneak into our territory?

58
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:41,138
Boss, these two people

59
00:02:41,138 --> 00:02:42,798
(Bandit of Mingdai Mountain,)
are wearing leather boots.

60
00:02:42,798 --> 00:02:44,058
(Zhang Youren)
I'm sure they're rich.

61
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:46,177
This woman in a man's disguise
is quite pretty.

62
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:46,858
Boss,

63
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:48,378
you haven't gotten yourself a wife yet.

64
00:02:48,657 --> 00:02:51,418
(Bandit of Mingdai Mountain, Qian Youdao)
Why don't you marry her?

65
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:53,578
Yeah, make her your wife.

66
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:54,617
Make her your wife.

67
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:55,298
Sell her for money.

68
00:02:55,457 --> 00:02:57,858
- He should marry her.
- Sell her for money.

69
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,378
- He should marry her!
- Shut up!

70
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:01,337
Who's the boss here?

71
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:02,177
- Boss!
- Boss!

72
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:06,538
You!

73
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:08,378
Be honest with me.

74
00:03:08,777 --> 00:03:09,818
Who are you?

75
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:12,538
I'll be honest with you.

76
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,217
Actually, I'm the concubine

77
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:18,217
of Li Ni, the imperial grandson.

78
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:21,217
Not only is my husband an imperial grandson,

79
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:22,457
but he's also

80
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,897
the Marshal of Rebellion Suppression.

81
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,457
Although he's young,

82
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:27,258
he rules over Zhenxi Prefecture

83
00:03:27,578 --> 00:03:28,937
and commands 100,000 troops.

84
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:31,777
100,000 troops?

85
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:32,777
Really?

86
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:34,497
My husband

87
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:35,978
is in Wangzhou right now.

88
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:38,337
If you release me,

89
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:41,538
I'll surely reward you handsomely.

90
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:44,457
Nonsense!

91
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:45,818
You!

92
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:47,057
Tell me!

93
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:48,457
Who exactly is she?

94
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:50,698
She's

95
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:55,337
the concubine of Li Ni,
the imperial grandson.

96
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:57,258
Naturally, I'm her bodyguard.

97
00:03:57,897 --> 00:03:59,657
I'm escorting her to Wangzhou

98
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:01,378
under the imperial grandson's order.

99
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,098
I thought the emperor and his family
were slaughtered.

100
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:06,937
What nonsense

101
00:04:07,018 --> 00:04:08,098
are you guys saying?

102
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:09,418
Imperial grandson, huh?

103
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:11,217
Do you think we're that gullible?

104
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:11,818
That's right!

105
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:13,578
- Yeah!
- How dare you trick us?

106
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:14,858
You want to trick us?

107
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:15,617
Boss,

108
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:18,097
that woman said

109
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,058
her husband was a marshal
in Zhenxi Prefecture.

110
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:21,058
Mr. Zhao

111
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:22,777
once served
the military in Zhenxi, right?

112
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:24,918
Why don't we bring Mr. Zhao here
and let him help us out?

113
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:26,058
Go and invite Mr. Zhao here.

114
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:41,457
Where did these crooks come from?

115
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:43,618
How dare they impersonate
the soldiers of Zhenxi?

116
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:45,097
Mr. Zhao!

117
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,011
(Bandit of Mingdai Mountain, Zhao Youde)

118
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:54,077
Mr. Zhao, this...

119
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:55,560
Shiqi?

120
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:57,537
Buddy, it's really you!

121
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:00,498
Hurry! Untie them!

122
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:01,578
Untie them!

123
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:02,297
Untie them!

124
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:05,657
(He's actually Li Ni,
the 17th imperial grandson.)

125
00:05:05,657 --> 00:05:07,258
Can you do it or not?
Let me do it if you can't.

126
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:08,938
Slowly.

127
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:11,138
Tie her down.

128
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:13,938
- Hurry.
- Make it tight.

129
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:14,738
Make it tighter.

130
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:16,440
Don't let her escape.
Put your back into it.

131
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:20,297
This is my buddy

132
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,240
in the scout team
when we were in Zhenxi Prefecture.

133
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:23,818
We infiltrated West Mongolia together

134
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,417
to spy on the Qing Army.

135
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:27,097
There were 12 of us.

136
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:28,498
The only surviving members

137
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:30,217
were me and him

138
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:31,897
before we reached the king's tent.

139
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:36,698
I lost an arm.

140
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:38,818
Shiqi was the one

141
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:40,537
who carried me on his back
through the desert

142
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:41,618
and back to our camp.

143
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:49,938
Mr. Zhao!

144
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,258
He's my savior!

145
00:05:54,058 --> 00:05:54,698
Savior!

146
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:57,217
- Savior!
- Savior!

147
00:05:59,178 --> 00:05:59,498
Come.

148
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:01,897
We're buddies.

149
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:03,738
Don't be so courteous.

150
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:07,378
My buddy.

151
00:06:08,857 --> 00:06:09,537
Here!

152
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:10,537
Cheers!

153
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:12,578
Cheers!

154
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:13,698
This is nice.

155
00:06:16,618 --> 00:06:17,417
Shiqi,

156
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:19,618
you always bragged to me

157
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:21,537
that your father owned Jiangbei

158
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:23,498
and that your family
owned 16 mu of land.

159
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,337
And, you also owned four top-tier cattle.

160
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:28,138
He said his father owned Jiangbei, huh?

161
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:29,378
And you guys believed him?

162
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:30,378
Of course not.

163
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,578
If he's the landowner's son,

164
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:35,537
I'll be the emperor's uncle.

165
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,578
The emperor's uncle?

166
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:41,178
You have quite the status there, huh?

167
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:43,018
Girl,

168
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:44,178
shut up.

169
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:45,337
If you keep talking,

170
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:46,738
I'll shut you up.

171
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:48,938
Buddy,

172
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:50,537
what else did you say again?

173
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:53,337
You said you would become a baron

174
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:55,178
and collect rent

175
00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:56,800
for a living after
retiring from the military.

176
00:06:57,698 --> 00:06:58,417
I never expected us

177
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:00,097
to encounter each other here.

178
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:01,457
Shiqi,

179
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:02,977
I, Huang Youyi,

180
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:05,618
respect loyal heroes like you the most.

181
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:08,897
I only found out that you were a member
of the Zhenxi Army that was guarding

182
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:10,457
our borders and
fending off the Qing Army.

183
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:12,417
And, you saved Youde too.

184
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:14,698
It makes us want to join
the Zhenxi Army even more now.

185
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:15,537
Today,

186
00:07:15,897 --> 00:07:17,018
it was our fault.

187
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:18,417
Here,

188
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,178
we shall apologize!

189
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:25,018
Please get up.

190
00:07:28,537 --> 00:07:29,618
Ask your brothers to get up too.

191
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:31,378
All of you, get up.

192
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:32,138
Get up.

193
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:34,698
This time,

194
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:35,897
it's a misunderstanding.

195
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,780
Brothers, let me offer you all a toast.

196
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:38,258
Come.

197
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:39,018
Cheers!

198
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:39,578
Cheers!

199
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:45,777
General,

200
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:47,818
this horse belongs
to Lieutenant He of the Cui Army.

201
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:49,297
Since her horse is here,

202
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:51,018
I'm sure she's nearby.

203
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,378
The mountain forest is dense.

204
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:53,938
And, we've traveled the entire day.

205
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm afraid we can't catch up to her.

206
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:56,337
General,

207
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:56,977
why aren't we

208
00:07:57,097 --> 00:07:58,537
taking over Wangzhou directly?

209
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:00,578
The Zhenxi Army is robust and strong.

210
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:02,297
And, the Cui Army
has their eyes on them.

211
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:04,119
Our foes are stronger.
We mustn't attack them directly.

212
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:05,857
We can only take back the city

213
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:07,880
by capturing General Pei Yuan
and Lieutenant He

214
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,378
and using them as our hostages.

215
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:11,720
Right now, our men are tired,
and horses are exhausted.

216
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:13,097
Our main camp was burned down,

217
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:14,580
and many of our brothers are injured.

218
00:08:14,897 --> 00:08:15,857
If this continues,

219
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:17,657
not only will we not catch up to them,

220
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:18,578
but we might also

221
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,258
be stuck in the mountains.

222
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:21,760
Is there anywhere nearby

223
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,097
where we can rest?

224
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:24,097
Around Mingdai Mountain,

225
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:26,097
there's a group of bandits
who built their own fortress.

226
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:28,618
Although they rule over this area,
they do not harass the people.

227
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:29,258
Therefore,

228
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,457
the garrison of Wangzhou

229
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:31,818
didn't eradicate them.

230
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,080
Relay my order.

231
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,577
Take down the fortress.

232
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,258
Our main camp has been burned down.

233
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:37,697
We've lost a place to rest.

234
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,897
Let's take over the mountain
and rest here.

235
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:41,920
We shall wait here
for Grand Governor Sun's reinforcements.

236
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,458
Yes, sir.

237
00:08:54,297 --> 00:08:55,098
Shiqi,

238
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,218
where did you come from this time?

239
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:58,338
And where do you plan to go?

240
00:08:58,577 --> 00:08:59,338
Mr. Zhao,

241
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,738
Shiqi

242
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:02,657
is escorting the concubine
of the imperial grandson

243
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:04,057
to Wangzhou.

244
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,858
I knew that imperial grandson
was a good-for-nothing!

245
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,120
He's still thinking

246
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,680
about women
even when our enemies are coming!

247
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:13,577
After I got injured,

248
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:14,858
the imperial court said

249
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:16,537
they would reward me
with 20 mu of land.

250
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:18,297
I gave it some thought.

251
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:20,500
I thought that I could make a living
by planting crops too.

252
00:09:20,657 --> 00:09:22,697
But I never expected
the imperial court to deceive me!

253
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:26,177
They built a residence
for emperor's son on our land.

254
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:27,697
Due to that, my mother

255
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:29,777
starved to death.

256
00:09:30,498 --> 00:09:31,618
I joined Mingdai Fortress

257
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:34,018
out of rage.

258
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:38,978
That actually happened?

259
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:41,978
After Sun Jing's rebellion,

260
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:44,177
many villages were
destroyed by the military.

261
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:45,858
Even now, I still don't know

262
00:09:46,258 --> 00:09:48,297
if anyone from my village is still alive.

263
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:49,937
Shiqi, you may not know,

264
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:51,417
but I was

265
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:54,098
the fortune teller of the village.

266
00:09:54,258 --> 00:09:55,978
I could've made a living with that.

267
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:57,657
But the imperial court

268
00:09:57,817 --> 00:09:59,258
kept drafting us

269
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:00,978
to do corvees.

270
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:02,817
I couldn't even survive!

271
00:10:02,817 --> 00:10:03,138
I...

272
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:05,258
That's why I became a bandit!

273
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:08,378
Everyone here

274
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:10,858
has a bitter past behind them.

275
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,057
No matter if it's Emperor Li

276
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,018
or that crook Sun,

277
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,777
both of them are forcing us
to a dead end.

278
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:18,057
We had no choice

279
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:20,817
but to become bandits here.

280
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,378
Shiqi,

281
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,777
since you're already here,

282
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:25,858
why don't you lead us

283
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:28,138
and bring us to join the Zhenxi Army,

284
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:29,018
okay?

285
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:30,218
Boss, am I right?

286
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:31,498
Yes!

287
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:34,297
You shall be our boss now.

288
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:36,978
- Boss!
- Boss!

289
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:37,657
No.

290
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:38,680
There's no need to be modest.

291
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:40,138
Today's a good day.

292
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:41,697
Let's swear an oath
and become sworn brothers.

293
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:43,098
- Okay!
- Okay!

294
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:45,297
We'll kill this girl and offer her
as a sacrifice!

295
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:46,697
You mustn't kill her!

296
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:48,378
You mustn't.

297
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:51,258
Boss, but why?

298
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:53,378
Does anyone know why?

299
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:54,537
Do you guys know why?

300
00:10:54,657 --> 00:10:55,817
We don't.

301
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:56,897
It's because...

302
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:57,297
Who knows?

303
00:10:57,498 --> 00:10:58,138
Yeah.

304
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:00,240
Do you guys know why?

305
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:02,098
It's because

306
00:11:02,657 --> 00:11:03,978
she's the imperial grandson's concubine.

307
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:05,777
However,

308
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:07,817
she's my beloved.

309
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:10,760
We have mutual feelings for each other.

310
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,560
So, it's his beloved.

311
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,697
We finally found the chance

312
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:14,458
to elope together.

313
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:19,458
Boss, why didn't you tell me earlier?

314
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:21,777
Her hands are still tied, you know?

315
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:23,018
The ground is cold too.

316
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:24,138
- Lady Boss!
- Lady Boss!

317
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:25,417
Lady Boss, let me untie you.

318
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:27,057
I was just too embarrassed to admit it.

319
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,378
Sorry about that.

320
00:11:28,577 --> 00:11:29,858
Sorry about this, Lady Boss.

321
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:33,218
♪There are 18 river bends
in Laolan River♪

322
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:37,138
♪The first river bend is Yinsong♪

323
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:41,258
♪The fish in Yinsong is fat and meaty♪

324
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,296
(Bliss)

325
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:08,177
What is this?

326
00:12:08,657 --> 00:12:09,378
Boss,

327
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:10,937
we don't have much here.

328
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:12,057
We can't hold a wedding

329
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:13,057
for you and Lady Boss.

330
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,738
However, the nuptial chamber

331
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:15,858
is a must.

332
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:17,478
- That's right!
- Enter the nuptial chamber!

333
00:12:17,478 --> 00:12:18,897
Boss, don't be shy.

334
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:19,458
Come on.

335
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:20,697
Go inside.

336
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:22,018
Lady Boss, go inside.

337
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:23,218
Go now.

338
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:24,177
Go now.

339
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:25,777
- Go now.
- Hurry up.

340
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:27,577
Buddy, enjoyable moments
are short-lived.

341
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:28,680
We'll make a move first.

342
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,098
Let's go!

343
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:29,618
Let's go!

344
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:31,978
See you!

345
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:36,498
General Pei Yuan of
the Zhenxi Army, huh?

346
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:39,138
The concubine
of the imperial grandson, Li Ni, huh?

347
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:42,978
(Bliss)
Shiqi.

348
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:44,537
Shiqi.

349
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:47,098
These are some
of the rarer items we found.

350
00:12:47,218 --> 00:12:48,978
You have to put this
in the nuptial chamber.

351
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:49,858
Take them.

352
00:12:50,057 --> 00:12:51,240
Don't make Lady Boss wait too long.

353
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,577
Okay. Thank you.

354
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:54,177
Make haste. I'll make a move first.

355
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:56,858
So, the renowned Shiqi

356
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:58,378
within the Zhenxi Army,

357
00:12:58,498 --> 00:13:00,218
he's actually the imperial grandson, Li Ni.

358
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,258
However, the bandits have no idea.

359
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:06,738
But I know who you are.

360
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:08,537
Strange.

361
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,338
I thought Zhao Youde
was in the Zhenxi Army too.

362
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,978
Why did he have no idea at all?

363
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,577
So, someone

364
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:16,858
hid his real name and identity

365
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:18,258
while he was in the military.

366
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:19,978
However, he rendered so much merit

367
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:21,920
that he and his next two generations
were to be rewarded.

368
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,537
Due to that,
he couldn't hide it any longer.

369
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:24,817
But at that time,

370
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:25,378
Zhao Youde

371
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:26,978
had already left the Zhenxi Army.

372
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,338
Am I right?

373
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:30,458
So what?

374
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,218
You didn't expose me just now.

375
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:32,937
What?

376
00:13:33,258 --> 00:13:34,777
Don't tell me
you want to expose me now?

377
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:37,218
I never expected you

378
00:13:37,378 --> 00:13:39,057
to borrow General Pei Yuan's name.

379
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:41,057
You almost duped me too.

380
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:45,098
If not,

381
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:46,657
how could I have the chance

382
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:48,057
to hear someone saying

383
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:50,458
that she was the concubine of Li Ni,
the imperial grandson?

384
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:53,657
You're such a scum.

385
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:00,937
Get up.

386
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:02,920
I'll sleep on the bed.
You can sleep on the ground.

387
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:04,577
It's been a long day for me.

388
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:05,618
I need to rest well

389
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,057
so that I can deal with a tricky

390
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:08,777
and cunning liar like you.

391
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:09,218
Hurry up.

392
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:11,177
You're a gentleman.

393
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:12,338
You should sleep on the ground.

394
00:14:25,577 --> 00:14:26,498
What are you doing?

395
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,537
What do you mean?

396
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:32,738
Since you're my concubine,

397
00:14:33,177 --> 00:14:34,978
I think we can sleep

398
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:36,378
on the same bed.

399
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:40,138
You lecher.

400
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:45,440
Since you're already calling me that,

401
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,498
I must live up to my name,
don't you think?

402
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:17,498
Taozi, he's one of us.

403
00:15:17,978 --> 00:15:18,817
Lieutenant He!

404
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:21,177
Lieutenant He, are you okay?

405
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:21,978
I'm fine.

406
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:23,657
He's so rude.

407
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:25,480
Let me kill him so that
you can be appeased.

408
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,498
Go ahead.

409
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:28,417
Your lieutenant wanted to do so
from the start.

410
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:30,537
But even now, she couldn't do it.

411
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:31,657
Do you wish to give it a try?

412
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:33,258
You!

413
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:34,498
Stop!

414
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,537
It's my turn to say that.

415
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:40,817
They're one of us.

416
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:44,777
We're in trouble!

417
00:15:44,937 --> 00:15:46,338
We're invaded!

418
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:47,738
- Boss!
- Boss!

419
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:48,618
- Boss!
- Boss!

420
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:49,978
- Boss!
- Boss!

421
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:50,777
Boss!

422
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:51,560
What's the matter?

423
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:52,258
Boss!

424
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:53,937
Our brothers outside
sent a letter to us.

425
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:56,138
They said a large group of troops
are attacking our fortress.

426
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:57,138
They even said

427
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:58,618
they were the troops of General Guo Zhi

428
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:00,440
who was under
the General of Rebellion Suppression.

429
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,920
He said he was going
to take over the fortress

430
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,777
and offer us as sacrifices to the heavens!

431
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:05,018
That's nonsense!

432
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,018
Boss, it's fine.

433
00:16:06,218 --> 00:16:07,577
Our fortress is high up
in the mountains.

434
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:08,850
It's easy to defend and hard to invade.

435
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,018
We can defeat them flawlessly

436
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,657
using our terrain advantage!

437
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:12,498
That's right!

438
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:13,218
Kill them all!

439
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:14,417
Kill them all!

440
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:17,177
Kill them all!

441
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:18,177
Do not brag!

442
00:16:19,577 --> 00:16:19,937
Youde.

443
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:20,577
Mr. Zhao.

444
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:22,897
Guo is one of our old friends.

445
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,018
It's General Guo,

446
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:25,858
who has been stationed
at Wangzhou all along.

447
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:27,897
So, it's him.

448
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:29,978
I never expected him to join Sun Jing.

449
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:31,817
This is quite the dilemma.

450
00:16:32,777 --> 00:16:34,897
Guo was born in Shuoxi.

451
00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:36,417
However, when it comes to an army,

452
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:37,498
the Zhenxi Army

453
00:16:37,657 --> 00:16:39,057
is just as good as the others!

454
00:16:39,537 --> 00:16:41,177
- That's right.
- That's right.

455
00:16:41,297 --> 00:16:42,817
This is my buddy
from Zhenxi Army's scout team.

456
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:44,378
He followed Guo Zhi all day long.

457
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,840
He also came here
to report this news to us.

458
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,680
There are plenty of people
in Guo Zhi's remaining army.

459
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,200
And, they're good with bows and arrows.

460
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,218
We'll be at a disadvantage
if we go against them head-on.

461
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:52,738
Shiqi,

462
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:55,177
you should leave with your wife.

463
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:56,738
Lieutenant He,

464
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:58,070
you should return to the camp first.

465
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,560
Young Master is waiting for you
at Bingzhou.

466
00:17:02,378 --> 00:17:03,978
That's right, Shiqi.
You should leave first.

467
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:04,817
I'm here.

468
00:17:07,577 --> 00:17:08,360
He has a point.

469
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:10,337
My buddy, who was a former scout,

470
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:12,258
was an expert in forest warfare.

471
00:17:12,418 --> 00:17:13,178
He can definitely

472
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:14,817
defeat Guo Zhi and his remaining army.

473
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,658
I will stay and help too.

474
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:21,817
This female bodyguard of mine
is an expert at warfare too.

475
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:24,777
She can definitely provide you guys
with a huge boost in power.

476
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:26,377
- This is great!
- Thank you!

477
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:27,080
That's right.

478
00:17:27,498 --> 00:17:27,938
Thank you!

479
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:29,258
Thank you, everyone!

480
00:17:29,418 --> 00:17:30,817
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

481
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:44,258
I can't even take one more step.

482
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:46,738
You should return to Wangzhou.

483
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:47,938
Just forget about me.

484
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:49,418
That won't do.

485
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:50,377
You're my concubine.

486
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:51,817
How could I leave you behind?

487
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:54,698
If you try to talk glibly again,

488
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:56,218
I'll kill you.

489
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:57,377
Look at you.

490
00:17:58,097 --> 00:17:59,137
You have the energy to kill me,

491
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:00,720
but you don't have
the strength to walk, huh?

492
00:18:10,097 --> 00:18:10,777
No.

493
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,577
I'm too tired.

494
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:14,360
You should think of something.

495
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,097
I can't walk anymore.

496
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,337
I do have an idea.

497
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:28,018
However,

498
00:18:28,377 --> 00:18:29,537
you have to cooperate with me.

499
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:47,898
Let's go and get changed.

500
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:48,898
There's no one inside.

501
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:01,458
Are you done?

502
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll be done in a second.

503
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:04,480
It's just a change of attire.

504
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,418
What's taking you so long?

505
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:08,377
I'm done.

506
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:10,898
I'm done.

507
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:11,218
Let's go.

508
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:12,218
Let's go.

509
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:16,097
I'm done.

510
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:24,738
You...

511
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,498
You look too clean and proper.

512
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:27,760
This won't do.

513
00:19:28,137 --> 00:19:28,680
Come here.

514
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:30,560
What are you doing?

515
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:34,857
Don't move.

516
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:36,178
What are you doing?

517
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:37,800
You have to pretend
to be a village girl.

518
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,978
You don't look like one at all.

519
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:45,137
What are you doing?

520
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,857
You'll know it later.

521
00:19:59,777 --> 00:20:00,498
Put it in your shirt.

522
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:01,617
Why?

523
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:03,137
You need to pretend to be pregnant.

524
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:04,520
I can only borrow a cart

525
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,700
when you look like you're pregnant.

526
00:20:05,978 --> 00:20:07,178
You couldn't walk anymore, right?

527
00:20:07,297 --> 00:20:08,057
If so, I'll bring you

528
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:09,577
to the city on a cart.

529
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:12,137
- Pretend to be pregnant?
- Hurry up.

530
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:18,137
How do I do this?

531
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:22,297
Can you hurry up?

532
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:24,777
You should be grateful
that we have a cart.

533
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:26,018
Don't complain.

534
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:27,018
What's the rush?

535
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:29,297
Do you want people to know
that you're hiding hay in your shirt?

536
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,350
A gentleman settles disputes with
his words, not his hands.

537
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:34,577
I'm not a gentleman.

538
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:36,258
I'm a fair lady.

539
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:37,658
You're a fair lady.

540
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:38,377
Look at yourself.

541
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:40,258
How are you fair by any means?

542
00:20:41,097 --> 00:20:42,218
Say that again?

543
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:44,377
Hey, you better stop.

544
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:45,218
I'll retaliate.

545
00:20:50,337 --> 00:20:52,057
Dear, stop crying.

546
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,258
We can hunt again
even if we've lost our prey.

547
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:55,498
It's not worth it to be angry

548
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:56,337
over what they did.

549
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:57,658
It's not worth it.

550
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:03,777
Old mister,

551
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:04,938
excuse me.

552
00:21:05,418 --> 00:21:06,738
How far are we from Bingzhou?

553
00:21:07,377 --> 00:21:08,458
It's quite far away.

554
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,898
You still have over 100 li to travel.

555
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:13,137
There's a scar on your face.

556
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:14,458
Did something happen?

557
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,137
Just drop it.

558
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:18,617
Hurry!

559
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:19,258
(I don't know)

560
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:20,840
(what happened in the past few days.)

561
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,018
(Soldiers came to the mountains.)

562
00:21:22,617 --> 00:21:24,057
(And, they even set up a checkpoint)

563
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:25,857
(on the official path.)

564
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:27,377
(My wife and I)

565
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,258
(were heading to a market.)

566
00:21:29,258 --> 00:21:29,698
What's this?

567
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:31,418
But those people were much more barbaric

568
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:33,258
than bandits.

569
00:21:36,258 --> 00:21:37,978
We'll be having roasted hare tonight.

570
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:40,720
Give it to me!

571
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,537
We need to exchange this for salt!

572
00:21:44,057 --> 00:21:44,498
Take it.

573
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:46,538
We're hunting down the rebels
under General Guo Zhi,

574
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,240
who's under
the General of Rebellion Suppression.

575
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,458
What's wrong with taking your prey?

576
00:21:50,218 --> 00:21:50,658
Scram!

577
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:51,857
Young man,

578
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:53,817
do not take the official path.

579
00:21:54,057 --> 00:21:55,658
Those guys are evil.

580
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:57,498
They didn't let off

581
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,337
any women and maidens.

582
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,698
Your wife is young.

583
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:02,297
Besides,

584
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:03,857
it'll be terrible

585
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:06,018
if her baby is affected because of this.

586
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:08,617
So, are there any other paths we can take

587
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:09,777
besides the official path?

588
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:12,458
There's a small road

589
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:14,978
to the west if you go up the mountains.

590
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,057
However, it's a long detour.

591
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:19,377
And, it's a mountain path.
It's hard to traverse.

592
00:22:19,777 --> 00:22:21,237
It'll be even more difficult
to traverse it

593
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:23,218
once the sun sets.

594
00:22:24,898 --> 00:22:25,777
Thank you, old mister.

595
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:28,617
Remember, don't take the official path.

596
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:30,658
Don't take the official path.

597
00:22:31,178 --> 00:22:32,577
Don't take the official path.

598
00:22:44,057 --> 00:22:46,120
It's been a long time since I had
the honeydew yogurt you made.

599
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:47,418
Let me give it a try.

600
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:55,297
Not bad at all.

601
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:58,218
What do you think about Li Ni?

602
00:23:04,537 --> 00:23:05,617
Li Ni?

603
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:09,938
He has a modest reputation

604
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,137
among the imperial family.

605
00:23:11,577 --> 00:23:13,097
I heard

606
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:15,577
that he was a stubborn one.

607
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:18,018
The late emperor was so furious with him

608
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,057
that he demoted him
and sent him to the military.

609
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:26,097
I already asked my men
to investigate his profile.

610
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,018
When he was sent to the Zhenxi Army,

611
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,938
Pei Xian transferred

612
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:31,777
his son, Pei Yuan,

613
00:23:31,938 --> 00:23:32,938
from the Dragon Guards

614
00:23:33,097 --> 00:23:34,978
to the Zhenxi Army.

615
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:36,978
Since then,

616
00:23:37,258 --> 00:23:39,498
Pei Yuan stayed together with Li Ni.

617
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:41,018
They were always on the same team.

618
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:43,577
That old fox, Pei Xian,

619
00:23:43,777 --> 00:23:45,097
is a proud person.

620
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,337
Since he's letting his son

621
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,537
be Li Ni's follower,

622
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:49,370
I'm sure Li Ni is someone
we shouldn't underestimate.

623
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:52,658
However, I heard

624
00:23:53,218 --> 00:23:55,218
that Pei Xian has ten sons in total.

625
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:57,018
Some are in the military,

626
00:23:57,377 --> 00:23:58,857
some became academicians,

627
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:00,898
and some even became priests.

628
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:05,577
You're scheming and meticulous.

629
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:07,498
There's no way Pei Xian will know

630
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:09,698
that you will fight in the name of justice.

631
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:11,698
Since he has no idea about that,

632
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:13,857
why would he set his pieces
at such an early time

633
00:24:14,097 --> 00:24:15,577
and focus on

634
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:17,258
an imperial grandson

635
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,458
who was demoted
and sent to the military?

636
00:24:34,537 --> 00:24:35,137
What's the matter?

637
00:24:39,137 --> 00:24:40,258
Why are your hands this hot?

638
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,418
I'm fine. Let's go.

639
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:49,738
Come, let me take a look.

640
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:07,480
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

641
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:10,178
It's nothing.

642
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:11,258
Let's go.

643
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,577
How can you travel in this state?

644
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:14,600
Get up. I'll carry you on my back.

645
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:18,498
Get up.

646
00:26:19,418 --> 00:26:19,938
You're awake.

647
00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:21,377
Do you want some water?

648
00:26:27,577 --> 00:26:28,617
Where are we?

649
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:30,938
This is a place

650
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:32,458
where hunters rest

651
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:33,537
in the middle of their hunt.

652
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:35,577
It was quite late just now.

653
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,817
I only managed to find one herb.

654
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:38,880
I've applied it to you.

655
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,160
I don't know if it's effective or not.

656
00:26:42,658 --> 00:26:43,938
I'm not that fragile.

657
00:26:44,817 --> 00:26:45,418
Dear, stop crying.

658
00:26:45,418 --> 00:26:46,919
We can hunt again
even if we've lost our prey.

659
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,577
It's not worth it to be angry

660
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,418
over what they did.

661
00:26:50,137 --> 00:26:50,978
It's not worth it.

662
00:26:51,337 --> 00:26:52,178
It's not worth it.

663
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,537
Stop mulling over it.

664
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:55,178
What if you fall sick because of this?

665
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:57,258
All right. We'll arrive soon.

666
00:26:57,498 --> 00:26:59,137
Dear, slow down.

667
00:26:59,297 --> 00:27:00,337
Got it.

668
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:01,337
Old mister.

669
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:02,218
Who's there?

670
00:27:08,698 --> 00:27:09,137
Old mister.

671
00:27:09,258 --> 00:27:10,537
It's you guys?

672
00:27:10,857 --> 00:27:12,337
What are you guys doing here?

673
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:13,137
Who are they?

674
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:15,137
It's the couple we met today.

675
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,337
What a coincidence.

676
00:27:16,857 --> 00:27:17,617
Really?

677
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:20,978
You're right.

678
00:27:21,137 --> 00:27:22,377
Have a seat.

679
00:27:24,537 --> 00:27:25,817
Help yourself.

680
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,418
You should take more meat.

681
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:29,537
Try some pheasant.

682
00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:32,297
- Thank you, old madam.
- Drink up. It'll warm your body.

683
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:33,258
Try it.

684
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:35,018
The pheasant we used

685
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:36,658
was hunted by my husband just now.

686
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:38,137
It's delicious when
you make soup with it.

687
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:40,097
Have some meat.

688
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,297
Thank you, old madam.

689
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,498
Eat up.

690
00:27:45,018 --> 00:27:46,218
My husband

691
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,978
loves the soup I make.

692
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:49,458
It's a shame

693
00:27:49,658 --> 00:27:51,577
that I couldn't give birth
to a child for him.

694
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:56,097
If only I had a daughter like you.

695
00:27:57,817 --> 00:27:59,337
Here, dear.

696
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:01,377
You did a good job today.

697
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:05,377
- What do you think?
- It's delicious.

698
00:28:05,738 --> 00:28:06,617
Youngsters like you all

699
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:07,537
should have more meat.

700
00:28:07,857 --> 00:28:08,617
You still have

701
00:28:08,777 --> 00:28:10,258
a long way to travel tomorrow.

702
00:28:10,318 --> 00:28:12,040
You'll only have enough energy
if you have your fill.

703
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:14,018
By the way, old mister,

704
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:15,297
it's quite late now.

705
00:28:15,498 --> 00:28:16,698
Why did you guys come back suddenly?

706
00:28:19,018 --> 00:28:19,920
Don't even talk about it.

707
00:28:20,218 --> 00:28:20,898
My wife and I

708
00:28:20,978 --> 00:28:22,458
was supposed to head to a market.

709
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,458
In the end,

710
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:24,698
not only did we not get salt,

711
00:28:24,938 --> 00:28:25,537
but the soldiers

712
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,377
robbed us of our stuff too.

713
00:28:27,777 --> 00:28:30,137
My wife was unhappy about it.

714
00:28:30,857 --> 00:28:31,698
She forced me

715
00:28:31,938 --> 00:28:33,337
to spend extra time in the mountains

716
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:35,938
to see if I could get a prey or two.

717
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,097
In the end,

718
00:28:37,337 --> 00:28:39,018
I only got this pheasant.

719
00:28:40,057 --> 00:28:41,658
And, the sun was setting.

720
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:42,738
I knew

721
00:28:42,817 --> 00:28:44,418
that there was
a shelter here for us to rest.

722
00:28:44,777 --> 00:28:45,617
I didn't expect

723
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:47,297
to see you two here.

724
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:50,178
This must be fate, huh?

725
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:51,097
That's right.

726
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:52,057
That's right.

727
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:54,520
I thought crooks were approaching us
when I heard something out there.

728
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:56,337
You're traveling

729
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:57,978
with your wife.

730
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:00,178
You're supposed to stay alert.

731
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:01,658
The world is chaotic

732
00:29:03,218 --> 00:29:04,097
nowadays.

733
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:12,577
That's right.

734
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:15,258
Have some soup.

735
00:29:16,218 --> 00:29:16,938
Have some soup.

736
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:17,800
Have some soup.

737
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,577
Eat up.

738
00:29:19,137 --> 00:29:19,537
Here.

739
00:29:23,577 --> 00:29:24,738
Dear, you should eat too.

740
00:29:24,857 --> 00:29:26,418
You should eat first.

741
00:29:28,258 --> 00:29:28,817
Eat up.

742
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:29,898
One more sip.

743
00:30:53,698 --> 00:30:54,577
Someone is coming.

744
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:57,258
And, they're riding horses.

745
00:30:57,817 --> 00:30:58,857
It's likely that the soldiers

746
00:30:58,978 --> 00:31:00,057
from the checkpoint are here.

747
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:03,258
Dear!

748
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:04,418
Dear!

749
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:06,258
Get up!

750
00:31:06,377 --> 00:31:07,218
What's wrong?

751
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:11,938
Those two people might be hiding inside.

752
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,800
Order the heavy crossbowmen
to surround the place.

753
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,137
Yes, sir.

754
00:31:17,097 --> 00:31:18,698
I dug this cellar by myself

755
00:31:18,817 --> 00:31:19,857
a few years back.

756
00:31:20,018 --> 00:31:21,418
I use them to store my prey.

757
00:31:21,658 --> 00:31:22,218
It can fit

758
00:31:22,337 --> 00:31:23,738
two people.

759
00:31:24,097 --> 00:31:24,537
You.

760
00:31:24,698 --> 00:31:26,018
Take your wife with you

761
00:31:26,137 --> 00:31:27,458
and hide down there.

762
00:31:27,938 --> 00:31:28,617
That's right.

763
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:29,418
No.

764
00:31:29,817 --> 00:31:31,698
Old mister, you and your wife
should hide inside.

765
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:34,137
They know us.

766
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:35,297
They won't do anything to us.

767
00:31:35,537 --> 00:31:36,817
But you two are strangers.

768
00:31:36,817 --> 00:31:38,258
It'll be more dangerous

769
00:31:38,258 --> 00:31:39,498
if they find you.

770
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,258
By then, we will be implicated too.

771
00:31:41,258 --> 00:31:41,760
That's right.

772
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,297
Go and hide now.

773
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:43,218
Hurry, good girl.

774
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:44,577
Hurry.

775
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:45,840
- Don't be scared.
- Hurry!

776
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:56,137
Search the area.
Kill any strangers on sight.

777
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:00,297
Come.

778
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:01,777
Cover it.

779
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:02,258
Hurry!

780
00:32:14,258 --> 00:32:14,738
Sir,

781
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:17,938
we're hunters.

782
00:32:18,297 --> 00:32:19,498
Have you seen

783
00:32:19,617 --> 00:32:21,720
a fair man
who looks like a scholar around?

784
00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:23,018
Sir,

785
00:32:23,498 --> 00:32:25,178
this place is remote.

786
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:26,938
There's no scholar here.

787
00:32:27,057 --> 00:32:28,057
Speaking of scholar,

788
00:32:28,218 --> 00:32:29,738
only Mr. Shan from the town is a scholar.

789
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:31,097
Cut the crap!

790
00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:37,320
Will you tell us or not?

791
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,337
Sir, please spare us!

792
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,857
We know nothing!

793
00:32:42,097 --> 00:32:42,938
Bring them outside!

794
00:32:43,057 --> 00:32:44,018
Go!

795
00:32:44,817 --> 00:32:45,537
Go!

796
00:32:56,537 --> 00:32:57,817
Sir!

797
00:32:57,938 --> 00:32:58,698
Sir, please spare us!

798
00:32:59,137 --> 00:33:00,418
We know nothing!

799
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:02,297
We know nothing!

800
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,377
Are you sure you guys know nothing?

801
00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:08,137
We truly know nothing.

802
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:09,337
Okay.

803
00:33:09,577 --> 00:33:11,218
Since you guys know nothing,

804
00:33:11,498 --> 00:33:12,777
I'll release you guys.

805
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:14,057
Let them go.

806
00:33:17,018 --> 00:33:17,498
Go now.

807
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:19,377
Thank you, sir.

808
00:33:22,057 --> 00:33:22,498
Let's go.

809
00:36:07,217 --> 00:36:07,858
Where are they?

810
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:12,898
They're dead.

811
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:14,498
What?

812
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,018
I went out to take a look.

813
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:21,298
Both of them are dead.

814
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:26,378
Have you lost your mind?

815
00:36:27,778 --> 00:36:29,137
Why did you prick me with a needle?

816
00:36:30,498 --> 00:36:32,177
They wouldn't have died

817
00:36:32,298 --> 00:36:33,697
if you hadn't made me unconscious.

818
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,498
Do you know
how many archers are out there?

819
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:37,257
Do you know what'll happen
if they find us?

820
00:36:37,257 --> 00:36:38,057
We won't make it in time

821
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:39,360
if we rush outside recklessly.

822
00:36:39,378 --> 00:36:40,938
They will die immediately instead.

823
00:36:41,097 --> 00:36:41,938
What about now?

824
00:36:44,257 --> 00:36:46,538
If we tried to save them back then,
we might still stand a chance.

825
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:49,120
But you weren't willing
to give it a try.

826
00:36:49,818 --> 00:36:50,378
You're just

827
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:52,898
a coward who's afraid of death.

828
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,360
How dare a person like you still
dare to receive their grace?

829
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:05,018
You ingrate.

830
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:05,737
I am a coward!

831
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:06,697
Just kill me!

832
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:26,938
(Benefactors,)

833
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:28,498
(it was all my fault today.)

834
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:29,577
(I'll definitely)

835
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:33,137
avenge you guys in the future.
