=Episode 28=

29
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:45,894
(Lord Qin's Residence)
After receiving your invitation,

30
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:47,925
I realized you have such good taste.

31
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:49,125
You mentioned

32
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:50,804
you received two good teas

33
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:52,005
and invited me to taste them.

34
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:53,444
So, I came here

35
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:54,964
without hesitation.

36
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:56,285
You're so kind, Prime Minister Gu.

37
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:58,845
These two plum bonsai trees

38
00:01:58,846 --> 00:02:01,044
were sent by Pei Yuan

39
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:02,365
after he reached Bizhou.

40
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:03,365
They may not be valuable,

41
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,684
but they're unique.

42
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:06,125
Martial people like me

43
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,884
don't know about plants.

44
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:09,404
But I heard

45
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:11,526
you're an excellent painter of plum
in the capital.

46
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:12,325
So,

47
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:15,485
I think having these two bonsai trees
with me is a waste.

48
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:16,205
Later,

49
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:18,085
I'll deliver them to your mansion.

50
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:19,045
I see.

51
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:22,524
I really appreciate it.

52
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:24,246
I shall receive your gift.

53
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:27,365
By the way,

54
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:29,165
the daughter of Cui Yi,

55
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,445
Miss Cui,

56
00:02:30,446 --> 00:02:32,244
she requested an audience
with His Majesty.

57
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:34,885
Has the Ministry of Rites
sorted this out?

58
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:38,325
Not only it's a controversy
in the Ministry of Rites,

59
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,365
but now

60
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,725
even the Ministry of War
has gotten involved.

61
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:42,964
They argue

62
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:45,925
that the Cui Army defends
against the enemy at the frontier,

63
00:02:45,926 --> 00:02:48,765
Miss Cui should be deemed as
the descendant of Great General Cui

64
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:50,285
to see His Majesty.

65
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:52,165
However, the Ministry of Rites
disapproves of it,

66
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,804
saying that there's
no precedent for this.

67
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:55,445
While the Ministry of Revenue claims

68
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:58,565
that the military provisions and funds
of the Cui Army

69
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,045
weren't allocated
by the Ministry of Revenue,

70
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,045
instead, they're deducted
from the tax revenues

71
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:04,445
of Pingliang and Weiyang.

72
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:06,365
They insist on settling this account.

73
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:07,385
As of now,

74
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,244
the six ministries have already
started a great dispute

75
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:12,845
even before Miss Cui meets His Majesty.

76
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:17,045
Actually,

77
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:19,485
Ministry of Rites disagrees

78
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:22,445
with Miss Cui seeking an audience

79
00:03:22,446 --> 00:03:24,005
because there isn't any precedent, right?

80
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:26,485
Miss Cui's mother, Madam He,

81
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:28,646
was granted the title Heroic Lady
by the court.

82
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:31,206
I remember during the Ruijing's reign,

83
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:34,605
to present an honorary plaque
to Lady of Wise Assistance,

84
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:36,406
her daughter was summoned

85
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:37,804
to the court

86
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:39,165
to receive a gold plaque

87
00:03:39,646 --> 00:03:40,925
from Emperor Shizu

88
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:42,686
during the court meeting.

89
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:45,724
Your Highness,

90
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,605
thank you for enlightening me.

91
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:49,406
I remember this precedent.

92
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:53,165
In that case,

93
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:55,284
it should be fine

94
00:03:55,285 --> 00:03:57,766
for Miss Cui to see His Majesty.

95
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:01,365
I just sent someone

96
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,486
to look for the record.

97
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:04,806
As expected,

98
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:06,804
Lord Qin

99
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:08,806
checked this record a few days ago.

100
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:12,565
That the daughter of Lady of Wise Assistance
entered the court

101
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:14,926
was an event from 60 years ago.

102
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:19,406
Only old officials in
the Ministry of Rites could find that.

103
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:21,566
Lord Qin actually searched
for the record

104
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:24,165
for the sake of Miss Cui.

105
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:25,805
This apparently shows his devotion

106
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:27,365
to Miss Cui.

107
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:29,645
For that woman,

108
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:32,284
he tried every possible means

109
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,725
to fulfill her wish.

110
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:42,925
Wan.

111
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,365
You're smart.

112
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:47,964
If your rival is Miss Cui herself,

113
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:49,205
I believe

114
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,886
you still can give it a try.

115
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:52,245
But if your rival

116
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:53,524
isn't Miss Cui,

117
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:56,646
but rather Lord Qin's devotion for her,

118
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:58,446
do you think

119
00:04:58,686 --> 00:05:00,845
you stand a chance?

120
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:07,805
If I concede defeat before even trying,

121
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:09,044
I don't deserve

122
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:10,406
to be your daughter.

123
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:12,886
Besides, nothing is predictable.

124
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,966
While Lord Qin takes a liking
to Miss Cui,

125
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:19,044
what if Cui Yi is imperious
and disrespects the Emperor

126
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:20,646
and commits treason?

127
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:23,406
The entire Cui family
would be eliminated,

128
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:26,086
let alone marrying off his daughter
to a prince.

129
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:29,685
As for Cui Yi,

130
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:32,524
he may be imperious
and disrespectful towards the Emperor,

131
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:34,886
but he won't

132
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:37,725
commit to treason.

133
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:40,285
Father.

134
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,885
Chai Hong, Duke of Fan,
the founding General of the Left Martial Guard,

135
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,685
was accused of treason.

136
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:47,646
Eventually, he was beheaded
in front of the public.

137
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:50,085
Even the founding general,

138
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:52,406
Duke of Fan, could be accused of treason,

139
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:56,165
why couldn't that happen to Cui Yi?

140
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:10,526
Young Lady.

141
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:12,766
Young Lady.

142
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,480
Someone from the Ministry of Rites
came to inform

143
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,080
that you could seek
an audience with His Majesty

144
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,044
on the court meeting three days later.

145
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,045
Really?

146
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:20,685
It seems

147
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:22,646
that their dispute has led
to a protocol at last.

148
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:24,724
They said

149
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:26,205
it was based

150
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:28,844
on the previous case of the daughter
of Lady of Wise Assistance.

151
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:30,484
I'm clueless about that.

152
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:31,604
Anyway, the conclusion is

153
00:06:31,605 --> 00:06:33,365
that you can meet His Majesty.

154
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:35,685
It's faster than I expected.

155
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:37,164
However, I was told

156
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:38,005
that Prime Minister Gu

157
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,724
went to the Ministry of Rites in person

158
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:42,604
to search for a record from 60 years ago.

159
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:44,125
Therefore, the Ministry of Rites

160
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:45,605
permitted your request in a short time.

161
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,365
A record from 60 years ago?

162
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:50,966
It must be hard for him to find that.

163
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:52,364
It seems

164
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:54,765
that Prime Minister Gu is willing
to try every possible mean

165
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,725
to quell the dispute in court.

166
00:06:57,086 --> 00:06:58,485
By the way, Young Lady,

167
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:00,325
Ear told me

168
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:01,724
that a few days ago, Lord Qin also went

169
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:03,526
to the Ministry of Rites several times.

170
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:05,805
He went there

171
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:06,924
to search for case records

172
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:09,045
of the frontier for several days.

173
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:10,245
As you know,

174
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:11,284
those case records

175
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:13,086
have long been left aside.

176
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:14,724
They took quite some days to find it

177
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,445
and got themselves dirty all over.

178
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:18,164
Lord Qin

179
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:19,765
is insincere.

180
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:21,205
Even Prime Minister Gu

181
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:23,165
would look for the records to help us.

182
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:24,284
While he

183
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:25,805
only cares about himself

184
00:07:25,806 --> 00:07:27,526
and ignores you.

185
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:40,404
You...

186
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:42,446
What's wrong with your attire?

187
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:43,646
I'm attending the court meeting.

188
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:46,285
It's been ages since you went for it.

189
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,964
From what I know,

190
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:49,844
you never persisted in going.

191
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,044
Either you skip the meeting

192
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:52,685
or feign sickness.

193
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,085
What in the world

194
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:55,364
woke you up

195
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:56,805
to attend the court meeting today?

196
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:58,005
The weather is fine.

197
00:07:58,006 --> 00:07:59,406
So, I decided to go.

198
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:01,526
The weather is fine?

199
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:04,284
Do not forget to bring us

200
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:06,326
some fried quails
to pair with liquor afterward.

201
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:08,044
Summon

202
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:09,805
the daughter of Cui Yi,
Great General Pingliang,

203
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,685
Great General Weiyang,

204
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:14,284
Commander-in-chief of the Shuozhou,

205
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,964
General of the Left,

206
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:18,284
Cui Lin

207
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,285
into the court.

208
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:31,645
She's Cui Yi's daughter?

209
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:32,565
Yes.

210
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:33,766
It's out of my expectation.

211
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:55,165
I, Cui Lin, greet Your Majesty.

212
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,606
Rise.

213
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:00,965
Thank you, Your Majesty.

214
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:04,285
You insisted

215
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:06,364
on seeking my audience

216
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:08,646
on your father's behalf.

217
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:11,486
Go ahead.

218
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:15,405
I, Cui Lin, present myself to Your Majesty
on my father's behalf because of Luoyang.

219
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:17,205
The Cui Army
briefly seized control of it

220
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:19,726
during the rebellion led by Sun Jing.

221
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:21,844
Now that the country is in peace

222
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:24,526
in the early period of your reign,

223
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:25,925
the Cui Army

224
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,525
will promptly withdraw from Luoyang

225
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,726
and return it to the court.

226
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,325
That's good news.

227
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,805
You were saying

228
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:42,846
you wanted to return Luoyang to me?

229
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,165
Yes.

230
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:46,565
Luoyang, belongs to the country.

231
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:48,445
Naturally, it belongs
to Your Majesty as well.

232
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:51,165
The Cui Army merely
seized command of it temporarily.

233
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:53,244
Now that the rebellion has subsided,

234
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:53,844
the Cui Army

235
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:55,445
certainly has to withdraw from Luoyang

236
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:57,886
and return it to the court.

237
00:09:58,725 --> 00:09:59,805
Good.

238
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:01,246
Very good.

239
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:04,205
It turns out

240
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:05,884
this is your intention to meet me.

241
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:07,124
You should've said it earlier.

242
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,045
Good.

243
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:09,805
I really adore

244
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:11,726
straightforward young people like you.

245
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,364
I must tell the Empress

246
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,685
to set up a banquet

247
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:17,805
to receive you.

248
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,606
Thank you, Your Majesty.

249
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,165
Empress.

250
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:38,004
When Cui Lin came into the court

251
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,766
in her armor,

252
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:41,764
I thought to myself

253
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:44,004
that Cui Yi was a rude man,

254
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:45,604
his own daughter

255
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:47,526
must be uncouth as well.

256
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:49,244
Much to my expectation,

257
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:51,364
Cui Lin straightaway said

258
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:54,646
that she wanted
to return Luoyang to the court.

259
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,646
Congratulations.

260
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:00,085
We get to reclaim Luoyang

261
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,844
without using a soldier.

262
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:04,165
Advisor Wu said

263
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,604
I'm the emperor

264
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:07,884
chosen by Heaven.

265
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:10,925
Naturally, I'm blessed
with great fortune.

266
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:14,445
Just now, Your Majesty mentioned

267
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:16,886
about holding a banquet for Miss Cui.

268
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:20,724
Do you have any expectations
for the banquet?

269
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:22,405
As grander as possible.

270
00:11:22,406 --> 00:11:24,406
Invite noble ladies.

271
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,445
I want to show Cui Lin

272
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:29,805
how noble ladies from the capital behave.

273
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:31,886
I want to break her spirit.

274
00:11:32,806 --> 00:11:33,606
Yes.

275
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:36,925
The Cui Army is battling at Shuozhou,

276
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:39,085
while the court is wary of them.

277
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:40,964
Cui Lin came to the court meeting
on her father's behalf

278
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:43,244
to return Luoyang.

279
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,165
This move

280
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,486
is bold and straightforward.

281
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:47,925
Cui Yi

282
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:49,205
is indeed shrewd.

283
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,325
As expected of a seasoned general.

284
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:54,325
From what I know about Miss Cui,

285
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:55,604
I think

286
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:58,366
perhaps today's action

287
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,246
was suggested by Cui Lin to her father.

288
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:04,525
Cui Lin

289
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:06,965
is a surprise.

290
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:09,685
Father, in your opinion,

291
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:12,004
has the court permanently dispelled
their suspicion

292
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:13,764
about Cui Yi,

293
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:15,526
or is it just temporary?

294
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,965
Just temporary.

295
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:20,604
Cui Yi is the general
of Pingliang and Weiyang.

296
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,120
He possesses considerable
military power.

297
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,205
How could the court not be wary of him?

298
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:27,805
Just now, you mentioned

299
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:29,604
that the Empress intends to hold
a banquet for Miss Cui

300
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:31,805
and invite noble ladies from the capital
to accompany her.

301
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,085
I believe

302
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,205
I'm qualified to attend the banquet.

303
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:36,525
Certainly.

304
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:37,525
If so, I shall

305
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:38,884
go and have a good look

306
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:41,406
at Miss Cui.

307
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:46,285
I thought you'd already

308
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:48,124
gained some knowledge about her.

309
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,445
It's different now.

310
00:12:50,485 --> 00:12:52,646
She was in the army back then,

311
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:55,445
but she has come to the court.

312
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:02,406
Father.

313
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,964
When I saw Miss Cui earlier today,

314
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:06,884
I was amazed by her appearance.

315
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:08,644
Besides, she wore the armor,

316
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:10,085
which made her look even more unique.

317
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:13,646
I've been thinking

318
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:17,085
about one thing these days.

319
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,045
Although Cui Yi

320
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,964
has returned Luoyang to me,

321
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:22,805
but I'm worried

322
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:25,484
he might bear evil intentions
in the future.

323
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:26,646
So,

324
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,406
it's necessary to keep him close.

325
00:13:30,605 --> 00:13:32,925
Cui Yi has only one daughter.

326
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:35,006
If you marry her,

327
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:40,085
we could reclaim the Cui Army rightfully.

328
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:41,805
Father, this is brilliant.

329
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:43,165
I think this is a good idea.

330
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:44,764
Soon, the Empress

331
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:47,285
will hold a banquet for Cui Lin.

332
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:49,325
I asked the Empress

333
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:50,884
to invite a few noble ladies

334
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:52,965
to accompany her.

335
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,006
However, by the look of it,

336
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:57,325
you, the princesses,

337
00:13:57,446 --> 00:13:58,484
and Li Ni

338
00:13:58,485 --> 00:13:59,925
should attend the banquet too.

339
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:03,406
The rest are just companions.

340
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:04,606
But for you,

341
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:07,325
you must assess Cui Lin carefully

342
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:08,646
to see

343
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,525
if she could be your wife.

344
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:13,165
No need to force yourself.

345
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,406
Thank you, Father.

346
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:56,764
I, Cui Lin,

347
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,484
greet Your Majesty.

348
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,006
Rise.

349
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:03,685
You appeared in the court
with armor on a few days ago.

350
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,805
It's said that you exuded

351
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,205
an impressive aura.

352
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,565
So, I was thinking

353
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:09,724
of meeting

354
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:12,406
this female general today.

355
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:14,445
Unexpectedly,

356
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,724
you put on the maiden's clothes today.

357
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:20,445
You carry yourself elegantly

358
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:22,085
and look gorgeous.

359
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,325
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

360
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,445
Don't stand on ceremony. Have a seat.

361
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:29,006
Thank you, Your Majesty.

362
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:42,846
We have this banquet

363
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:45,726
to welcome Miss Cui.

364
00:15:46,005 --> 00:15:48,646
Besides, it's the season
of splendid views.

365
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:51,244
Miss Cui has been living in Yingzhou.

366
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:53,006
It's rare for you to come
to the capital.

367
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:54,484
So, today,

368
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:57,085
I'll have Lord Qi, Lord Qin,

369
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:58,724
and other young people

370
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,445
to accompany you.

371
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:05,884
Let's drink up

372
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:07,685
as a welcome sign for Miss Cui.

373
00:16:13,086 --> 00:16:14,644
Thank you, Your Majesty.

374
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:16,526
Thank you, Lord Qi.

375
00:16:21,086 --> 00:16:24,484
Mother, the show
of colored-ball snatching is ready.

376
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,004
Great.

377
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:27,644
I was worried

378
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:30,366
I couldn't prepare anything interesting
for you all.

379
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:33,244
So, Lord Qi specially arranged

380
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:35,325
an acrobatic troupe from the south.

381
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:37,285
Miss Cui

382
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:39,445
and all the guests here,

383
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:41,445
you may feast your eyes on it.

384
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:47,646
How considerate of you, Lord Qi.

385
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:51,644
The colored-ball snatching show
is the new trend.

386
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:53,124
When the two teams come onstage,

387
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,525
they could only use the silk streamer
as their weapon.

388
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:56,844
They're allowed to trip, stop,

389
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:58,525
wrestle, block, or tangle

390
00:16:58,526 --> 00:16:59,846
to halt the rival's action.

391
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:02,124
The team that first snatches
the colored ball

392
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,285
will be the winner.

393
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,805
Lord Qi is so caring

394
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:08,005
for Miss Cui.

395
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:09,805
Of course.

396
00:17:09,806 --> 00:17:12,124
After all, her father commands
military power.

397
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,800
If he manages to get
the Cui family on his side,

398
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
he's very likely to secure
the position as the crown prince.

399
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,844
No wonder a general's daughter

400
00:17:17,845 --> 00:17:18,644
dares to request

401
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:20,525
to choose a prince as her husband.

402
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:22,566
How daring.

403
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:23,844
Both teams

404
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:24,565
have to figure out

405
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:26,444
how to kick their rival off the stage

406
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,965
while thinking about how to snatch
the colored ball.

407
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:29,644
At the same time,

408
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:30,684
they have to watch themselves

409
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:31,765
from being kicked off the stage.

410
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:32,924
The show

411
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:34,326
is exciting.

412
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,286
It sounds very interesting.

413
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:39,644
It's not fun enough

414
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:41,045
if we just watch it.

415
00:17:41,046 --> 00:17:43,684
Why don't we make a bet

416
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:45,204
according to the custom in the capital?

417
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:47,925
You can place any bets you want.
It's just for fun.

418
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:50,685
Mother, that's a good idea.

419
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:55,085
Miss Cui, you're the guest.

420
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:58,205
Please place your bet.

421
00:17:58,605 --> 00:17:59,646
Yes.

422
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,245
Miss Cui, place the bet

423
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:07,644
on the team you think they might win.

424
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,565
Place the bet

425
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:10,604
on the gold tray.

426
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:11,884
Later, Miss Cui

427
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:13,604
will toss the silk streamer
onto the stage

428
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:15,126
to start the show.

429
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:19,406
Lord Qi, which team
will you choose?

430
00:18:20,286 --> 00:18:21,404
I think

431
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:23,364
the red team is agile.

432
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,165
They are sure to win.

433
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:26,485
If so, I place the bet

434
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,165
on the team you choose.

435
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,725
I bet on the red team.

436
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:35,725
My bet is a golden bracelet.

437
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:40,725
Lord Qin, do you want to place your bet?

438
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:42,844
Your Highness.

439
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:43,644
Please allow me

440
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:45,525
to choose for you.

441
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:46,806
Which team would you like to choose?

442
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:48,565
I believe

443
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:49,886
the blue team will win.

444
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:52,606
All right.

445
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:54,085
I'll bet on the blue team

446
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:55,245
on Miss Gu's behalf.

447
00:18:57,526 --> 00:19:00,005
This jade pendant is my bet.

448
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,965
You're generous, Ni.

449
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:03,326
So generous.

450
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:33,646
Miss Cui, please enjoy the show.

451
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:47,286
Bravo.

452
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:51,965
Fortunately, I didn't fail you
by my choice.

453
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:53,445
Your Highness, you have sharp eyes.

454
00:19:56,006 --> 00:19:56,924
Giving the rest

455
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:58,725
to the red team.

456
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:01,404
Miss Cui, which team

457
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:03,685
should we bet on in the next round?

458
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:06,126
I think we should stick
with the red team.

459
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:08,485
The red team will surely thrive

460
00:20:08,486 --> 00:20:09,965
on their success.

461
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:11,644
Pass my order.

462
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,364
All guests enjoyed the show today.

463
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:14,765
Regardless of which team wins,

464
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:16,245
reward them handsomely.

465
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:17,245
Wait.

466
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,566
This time, I'll participate in the show.

467
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:30,245
Lai.

468
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:31,844
You enjoy having fun.

469
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:33,205
Do you care

470
00:20:33,246 --> 00:20:34,525
to compete with me?

471
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:36,126
Um...

472
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:37,844
Lord Qi.

473
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:39,245
I'd like to

474
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:40,404
be your partner

475
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,685
for snatching the ball.

476
00:20:42,486 --> 00:20:43,684
With your help,

477
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:44,965
we'll surely win the game.

478
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:46,925
Ni.

479
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,085
We have two people here,

480
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:49,325
you're only alone.

481
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:50,565
It's not fair for you.

482
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:51,285
Why don't you

483
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:52,485
pick one from the troupe

484
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:54,364
to be your partner?

485
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:55,204
No need.

486
00:20:55,205 --> 00:20:56,925
I can handle this.

487
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:01,165
Lord Qin.

488
00:21:09,806 --> 00:21:11,085
If you don't despise

489
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:12,604
my clumsiness,

490
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,046
I'd like to be your partner.

491
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:16,406
Miss Gu.

492
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:19,326
The game is dangerous.

493
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:21,005
Don't worry.

494
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:22,326
I know.

495
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:26,566
All right.

496
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,366
If so, you'll go with me.

497
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:32,205
Knowing you enjoy this so much,

498
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:33,805
go to the treasury

499
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:35,646
to bring a pair of dragon
and phoenix hairpins.

500
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:37,765
I'd like to sweeten the pot.

501
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,604
They'll be the prize for you.

502
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:41,846
Thank you, Mother.

503
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:46,965
We can run a pastry store.

504
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:48,646
What do you say?

505
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:52,204
I was just saying.

506
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:53,805
You're taking it seriously?

507
00:21:53,806 --> 00:21:54,765
Of course.

508
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:57,205
I take every word you say seriously.

509
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:02,045
Actually,

510
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:04,164
running a pastry store

511
00:22:04,165 --> 00:22:06,005
can be a good idea.

512
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:07,285
Besides,

513
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:08,884
I've noticed

514
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:10,325
stores that sell trinkets

515
00:22:10,326 --> 00:22:12,165
are quite popular as well.

516
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:15,164
Many misses and madams

517
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:17,325
like to visit rouge stores too.

518
00:22:17,326 --> 00:22:18,165
Good.

519
00:22:18,326 --> 00:22:19,965
We'll open a store
to sell the things you like.

520
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:21,366
Silly.

521
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:30,566
The Empress holds a banquet today.

522
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:31,765
How will

523
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:33,765
it turn out?

524
00:22:33,925 --> 00:22:35,765
I wonder if Lord Qin and Young Lady

525
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:37,245
will meet each other.

526
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,406
They will.

527
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,566
Mister Shiqi likes Miss Cui very much.

528
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:43,644
He'll try his best

529
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:44,725
to coax Miss Cui.

530
00:22:45,806 --> 00:22:48,085
Hopefully, they can make peace
with each other soon.

531
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:49,325
Otherwise,

532
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,124
I'll feel bad for them

533
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,005
if they see us getting so close

534
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:54,285
when they're in disputes.

535
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:55,886
I feel sorry for Young Lady.

536
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:57,165
They will reconcile.

537
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:01,165
How could you do that?

538
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,325
It seems you may have forgotten

539
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:13,765
this is who I am.

540
00:25:18,326 --> 00:25:18,805
Bravo.

541
00:25:18,806 --> 00:25:20,646
Excellent.

542
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:22,445
Great.

543
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:23,765
Miss Cui.

544
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:25,406
You're a heroine.

545
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:29,525
Today, Miss Cui

546
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:31,846
really blows my mind.

547
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,565
Miss Cui,

548
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,725
you're indeed a warrior
who fought on the battlefield.

549
00:25:35,806 --> 00:25:37,725
The show

550
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:39,525
was epic.

551
00:25:46,246 --> 00:25:48,406
This is your reward, Miss Cui.

552
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,846
Thank you, Your Majesty.

553
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:03,765
This pair of dragon and phoenix hairpins

554
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:05,325
is an art by great hands.

555
00:26:05,326 --> 00:26:06,806
They are exquisite.

556
00:26:07,205 --> 00:26:08,325
Your Majesty.

557
00:26:08,326 --> 00:26:10,164
May I have your permission

558
00:26:10,165 --> 00:26:12,126
to give the hairpins to someone else?

559
00:26:12,726 --> 00:26:15,085
This is your reward.

560
00:26:15,086 --> 00:26:17,046
You can handle it the way you want.

561
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:18,886
Thank you.

562
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,806
Thank you for being generous,
Your Highness.

563
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:30,565
I'd like to present this hairpin

564
00:26:30,566 --> 00:26:32,086
to you

565
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:34,165
as my token of gratitude.

566
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:51,684
Lord Qi and Lord Qin

567
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:53,005
are men,

568
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:55,404
and I'm fighting on the battlefield.

569
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,005
However, Miss Gu has always
been sheltered in the boudoir.

570
00:26:58,006 --> 00:27:00,525
But she bravely took the initiative
to join the game

571
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:02,085
and didn't squeak

572
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:03,685
when she got injured.

573
00:27:05,046 --> 00:27:06,445
Therefore, I'd like
to present this hairpin

574
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:11,124
to Miss Gu

575
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:13,165
as an appreciation
for your bravery today.

576
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,685
Thank you, Miss Cui.

577
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:20,364
I'm just giving you a gift

578
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:22,406
that's prepared by Her Majesty.

579
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:25,285
Lord Qin,

580
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:27,085
both you and Miss Gu

581
00:27:27,086 --> 00:27:29,326
shall thank Her Majesty for her grace.

582
00:27:30,726 --> 00:27:32,005
Rightfully so.

583
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:37,245
Thank you, Mother.

584
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:39,205
Thank you, Your Majesty.

585
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:40,725
You may rise.

586
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,366
Please take a seat.

587
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:43,406
Yes.

588
00:27:45,806 --> 00:27:48,646
Kind lady, come on here.

589
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:02,326
Your Majesty.

590
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:08,685
You have a delicate and pretty look,

591
00:28:08,726 --> 00:28:10,566
but you also exude the heroic spirit.

592
00:28:10,885 --> 00:28:12,606
The rarest thing is,

593
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:15,005
you're generous and thoughtful.

594
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:18,565
After knowing Gu Wan'niang's injury,

595
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:19,884
I intended

596
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:21,684
to give her a pair of pear earrings

597
00:28:21,685 --> 00:28:23,046
to comfort her.

598
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:25,566
But you've already thought of that.

599
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:28,606
Please don't blame me.

600
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:31,046
I won't.

601
00:28:31,365 --> 00:28:33,005
Just now,

602
00:28:33,006 --> 00:28:34,325
you looked like

603
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:38,566
a light and agile sparrow onstage.

604
00:28:39,046 --> 00:28:40,164
Lord Qin

605
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:42,725
is regarded as a brave fighter.

606
00:28:43,006 --> 00:28:45,205
Yet, you won.

607
00:28:45,845 --> 00:28:47,005
Apparently,

608
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:48,444
you're a cut

609
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:49,925
above him.

610
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:52,245
You're flattering me, Your Majesty.

611
00:28:53,326 --> 00:28:54,445
You must be hungry, right?

612
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:57,165
Start the banquet.

613
00:28:57,246 --> 00:28:58,046
Yes.

614
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,965
Please return to your seat.

615
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:01,646
Thank you, Your Majesty.

616
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:31,126
Miss Gu.

617
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:33,126
Let me give you a toast.

618
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:44,525
Lord Qi.

619
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:45,765
Lord Qi.

620
00:29:58,526 --> 00:30:00,205
The water spreads far and wide.

621
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,765
What a crisp autumn day today.

622
00:30:03,326 --> 00:30:05,765
Rafting on Taiye Pond

623
00:30:06,086 --> 00:30:08,086
above the shimmering water

624
00:30:08,526 --> 00:30:10,085
in the mid-autumn night

625
00:30:10,086 --> 00:30:12,925
will be a marvelous view to imagine.

626
00:30:14,486 --> 00:30:16,765
Indeed, it's marvelous.

627
00:30:16,925 --> 00:30:18,846
However, in the eyes of yours,

628
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:22,204
beautiful sceneries

629
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:24,164
can never be more interesting

630
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:25,366
than your ambition.

631
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,806
You resent me.

632
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:35,165
Everyone has their own pursuit.
I can't resent you.

633
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:38,566
But you look upset.

634
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,444
I lost the game,

635
00:30:41,445 --> 00:30:43,046
so I'm not happy.

636
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:45,604
I'm afraid

637
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:47,646
you're not happy because you lost money,

638
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:49,565
it's because I kissed you.

639
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:50,485
Yes.

640
00:30:50,845 --> 00:30:53,165
How could you
do an inappropriate act like that?

641
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:54,846
It'd be troublesome

642
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:57,205
if people saw it.

643
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,286
If so, will you tell others?

644
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:05,126
It's not the behavior of a gentleman.

645
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:07,046
Naturally, I won't.

646
00:31:10,806 --> 00:31:12,126
Thank you.

647
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:14,525
I know

648
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:16,765
you went to
the Ministry of Rites to look for

649
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:18,765
the previous records

650
00:31:18,766 --> 00:31:20,765
and helped me to meet His Majesty

651
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,366
in the court.

652
00:31:22,685 --> 00:31:24,085
No need to thank me.

653
00:31:24,086 --> 00:31:26,124
It's my duty to placate Great General Cui

654
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,846
and share His Majesty's burden.

655
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:32,085
Your Highness,

656
00:31:32,086 --> 00:31:33,684
looking at your decent actions,

657
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,806
I really feel ashamed of myself.

658
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:43,005
It's Li Lai. Let's leave.

659
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:48,965
This is strange.

660
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:51,005
The eunuch told me

661
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:52,924
she came to the Taiye Pond.

662
00:31:52,925 --> 00:31:54,606
How come I see no sign of her?

663
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,525
Miss Cui.

664
00:32:21,845 --> 00:32:22,846
Miss Cui.

665
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:25,286
Lord Qi.

666
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:26,965
I'm leaving the palace

667
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:27,924
after the banquet.

668
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:29,525
I can see you off.

669
00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:32,366
Thank you so much.

670
00:32:34,326 --> 00:32:35,565
You did excellent

671
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:37,325
during the game just now.

672
00:32:37,326 --> 00:32:39,286
I'm very impressed by you.

673
00:32:39,486 --> 00:32:40,725
You flatter me.

674
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:42,164
Those were just

675
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:43,846
some cheap skills.

676
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:45,844
If it wasn't for you,

677
00:32:45,845 --> 00:32:47,164
we wouldn't have won Lord Qin

678
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,326
and claimed the reward.

679
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:50,325
Because you have discerning eyes

680
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:51,566
to bet it right.

681
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:06,126
Isn't that Miss Cui?

682
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:08,765
Your Highness.

683
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:17,165
Miss Gu.

684
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:18,406
Is your injury all right?

685
00:33:18,806 --> 00:33:20,124
I have a remedy that prevents scars

686
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,245
in my residence.

687
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:22,765
I'll have my men send it to you.

688
00:33:23,645 --> 00:33:24,765
Thank you, Your Highness.

689
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:25,925
You're welcome.

690
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:27,644
May I ask

691
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:28,765
what's your hobby?

692
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:30,045
Nanny likes

693
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:31,565
the rose lychee plum pasty you gave.

694
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:32,884
She wants me to thank you again.

695
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,444
Since Nanny likes it,

696
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,684
I shall invite her
to the store to taste it.

697
00:33:36,685 --> 00:33:38,684
It's said that riding horse
on Wonderland during autumn

698
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:39,925
- is a great experience.
- Thank you.

699
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:41,005
I believe tomorrow

700
00:33:41,006 --> 00:33:42,404
will be a good day.

701
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:44,005
Why don't we

702
00:33:44,006 --> 00:33:45,366
visit Wonderland tomorrow?

703
00:33:46,165 --> 00:33:47,525
That's very kind of you.

704
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,005
But

705
00:33:49,205 --> 00:33:51,580
I need to go to Ci'en Temple to thank
the deity for answering my prayer.

706
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,886
I can go there with you.

707
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:54,606
Your Highness.

708
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:56,886
Your Highness.

709
00:33:58,726 --> 00:33:59,884
Lord Qi.

710
00:33:59,885 --> 00:34:01,086
His Majesty requests for you.

711
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:03,085
It's a deal, then.

712
00:34:03,086 --> 00:34:04,600
I'll go to Ci'en Temple
with you tomorrow.

713
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,846
I need to meet my father now.

714
00:34:10,046 --> 00:34:10,764
Don't forget.

715
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:13,125
Tomorrow morning, I'll have my men
pick you up at your residence.

716
00:34:27,046 --> 00:34:28,324
Miss Cui

717
00:34:28,325 --> 00:34:30,125
is truly remarkable.

718
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:32,806
She actually returned Luoyang
to the court.

719
00:34:33,325 --> 00:34:34,645
Indeed.

720
00:34:34,685 --> 00:34:38,045
Luoyang and Xichang
are near to each other.

721
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:40,366
Given the current situation,

722
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:43,605
if the Cui family continues
to occupy Luoyang,

723
00:34:44,086 --> 00:34:45,366
I'm afraid

724
00:34:45,526 --> 00:34:48,326
it'll only do more harm to them.

725
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:50,684
Isn't this

726
00:34:50,685 --> 00:34:52,565
Great General Cui's idea?

727
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:54,565
Probably,

728
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:57,645
it's Cui Lin's.

729
00:34:57,725 --> 00:34:59,445
She went to the court meeting

730
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:00,925
to return Luoyang.

731
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:02,125
Hence,

732
00:35:02,245 --> 00:35:04,326
her marriage with a prince

733
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,005
is going

734
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:10,045
to be a done deal.

735
00:35:11,765 --> 00:35:13,445
Does Miss Cui

736
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:15,686
want to be Crown Princess?

737
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,246
Crown Princess?

738
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:27,605
Everyone knows Crown Prince
sits in a difficult position,

739
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:30,726
but no one has ever been concerned

740
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,366
about Crown Princess.

741
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,206
Even the most intelligent person

742
00:35:36,245 --> 00:35:38,085
has to restrain

743
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,886
their glow

744
00:35:41,245 --> 00:35:43,005
when they finally
take over the Eastern Palace.

745
00:35:44,805 --> 00:35:46,366
Miss Cui

746
00:35:46,406 --> 00:35:48,166
is born straightforward by nature.

747
00:35:48,486 --> 00:35:49,284
Besides,

748
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:51,005
she has a carefree soul.

749
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:54,045
If she really becomes
the Crown Princess,

750
00:35:56,205 --> 00:35:58,125
it's a woe to her.

751
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:02,326
Your Highness.

752
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:10,085
Jin'niang.

753
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:12,965
I brought you

754
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:15,286
to the palace from my maiden family.

755
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:19,965
I used to be a capricious person.

756
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:23,645
However, since I married
into the Eastern Palace,

757
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:27,645
my character has changed.

758
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:31,366
As Crown Princess,

759
00:36:31,486 --> 00:36:33,686
I have to be virtuous and generous.

760
00:36:34,046 --> 00:36:35,886
In such desperate states

761
00:36:36,046 --> 00:36:37,806
where Crown Prince has died

762
00:36:38,006 --> 00:36:39,726
and the great imperial grandson
is in exile,

763
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,766
I had to deal with Sun Jing

764
00:36:42,805 --> 00:36:44,925
to fight for a chance

765
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,886
to restore the Dayu.

766
00:36:54,406 --> 00:36:56,045
I understand

767
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,525
you're suffering inside.

768
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:07,125
I'll tell Crown Prince everything

769
00:37:07,886 --> 00:37:10,406
when I'm six feet under.

770
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:13,166
I did my best.

771
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,565
I fulfilled my responsibility

772
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:19,485
as Crown Princess.

773
00:37:21,526 --> 00:37:24,246
Even if I would be thrown into infamy,

774
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:27,406
I wouldn't care.

775
00:37:34,645 --> 00:37:36,206
The thing is, Jin'niang,

776
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:41,125
I can no longer recognize myself.

777
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,724
When history mentions me,

778
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:49,045
it'll only be a few short lines

779
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:53,005
saying that I'm a disloyal woman.

780
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,166
But I've done so much.

781
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:00,124
I'm confused

782
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,686
who I am now.

783
00:38:04,046 --> 00:38:05,085
Your Highness.

784
00:38:06,926 --> 00:38:08,406
You can cry.

785
00:38:08,926 --> 00:38:10,645
Have a good cry.

786
00:38:12,846 --> 00:38:13,686
No, I can't.

787
00:38:16,006 --> 00:38:18,246
Ever since I've become
the Crown Princess,

788
00:38:19,205 --> 00:38:21,005
I told myself

789
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:23,605
not to be weak and not to cry.

790
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:28,965
I mustn't forget

791
00:38:30,245 --> 00:38:33,045
that I was once
the Crown Princess of the Dayu.

792
00:38:45,165 --> 00:38:47,085
Last night, in the middle of the night,

793
00:38:47,086 --> 00:38:48,405
I heard Mister Shiqi

794
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:49,845
was practicing with his sword again.

795
00:38:49,846 --> 00:38:51,885
I suppose he didn't sleep all night.

796
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:53,124
It's normal that he can't sleep

797
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,686
when he suffers from lovesickness.

798
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:58,005
Isn't Miss Cui at Xichang?

799
00:38:58,006 --> 00:39:00,005
Yes, but so what?

800
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:02,284
Then why must he suffer?

801
00:39:02,285 --> 00:39:03,244
You don't know.

802
00:39:03,245 --> 00:39:04,365
You do?

803
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:05,565
Have you ever touched a woman's hand?

804
00:39:05,566 --> 00:39:07,604
Do you know better than I do?
Have you touched a woman's hand?

805
00:39:07,605 --> 00:39:08,684
- I did.
- Did you?

806
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:09,804
- I know.
- I did.

807
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:10,845
Fine. Enough.

808
00:39:10,846 --> 00:39:11,886
Eat the congee.

809
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:14,485
Mister Shiqi.

810
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:15,366
Mister Shiqi!

811
00:39:16,006 --> 00:39:17,726
Where are you going
early in the morning?

812
00:39:18,645 --> 00:39:20,085
I'm going for a walk.

813
00:39:20,086 --> 00:39:20,965
You said

814
00:39:20,966 --> 00:39:23,246
you wanted to give Miss Gu
the ointment yesterday.

815
00:39:23,285 --> 00:39:24,326
Who's sending it over?

816
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,846
Are you sending it yourself?

817
00:39:27,325 --> 00:39:28,366
You go.

818
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:30,525
Fine. I shouldn't have asked.

819
00:39:31,046 --> 00:39:32,045
Mister Shiqi.

820
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:34,366
Don't you have anything
to give Miss Cui?

821
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:36,286
No.

822
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:43,604
Why does he send medicine to Miss Gu

823
00:39:43,605 --> 00:39:45,525
and not to Miss Cui?

824
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:47,686
How am I supposed to know?

825
00:39:49,406 --> 00:39:51,605
- You don't know.
- You don't know.

826
00:39:54,886 --> 00:39:57,085
Come here and eat this.

827
00:39:57,973 --> 00:40:01,762
(Cui Residence)

828
00:40:12,406 --> 00:40:14,206
Greetings, Your Highness.

829
00:40:17,526 --> 00:40:18,684
Where's Miss Cui?

830
00:40:18,685 --> 00:40:19,885
We promised

831
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:21,286
to visit Ci'en Temple.

832
00:40:22,846 --> 00:40:23,965
Miss Cui

833
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:25,684
went out this morning.

834
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:28,485
Last night, she lit incense and divined
for an auspicious hour to go out.

835
00:40:28,486 --> 00:40:31,565
The sign showed it should be
quarter to seven in the morning.

836
00:40:31,566 --> 00:40:32,604
Besides,

837
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:34,124
she can't bring anyone with her

838
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,244
to show sincerity.

839
00:40:36,245 --> 00:40:38,045
I wasn't allowed to tag along.

840
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:39,804
However, Young Lady instructed me

841
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:40,925
to wait here

842
00:40:40,926 --> 00:40:42,284
and relayed a message to you.

843
00:40:42,285 --> 00:40:44,724
She's very sorry

844
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:46,485
to make you come here for nothing.

845
00:40:50,526 --> 00:40:51,365
Never mind.

846
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,085
I'll meet her at Ci'en Temple.

847
00:40:54,645 --> 00:40:55,965
I bid you farewell, Your Highness.

848
00:41:13,285 --> 00:41:14,885
It seems simple.

849
00:41:14,886 --> 00:41:16,645
But I can't weave it properly.

850
00:41:33,486 --> 00:41:34,886
What brings you here?

851
00:41:36,805 --> 00:41:38,206
I was thinking

852
00:41:38,285 --> 00:41:39,246
of taking a stroll,

853
00:41:39,645 --> 00:41:40,925
but ended up here.

854
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:43,846
I was just following my will.

855
00:41:45,366 --> 00:41:46,565
I didn't expect

856
00:41:46,846 --> 00:41:48,286
to see you here.

857
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:53,565
I didn't want to go to Ci'en Temple.

858
00:41:55,366 --> 00:41:56,286
I know.

859
00:42:01,046 --> 00:42:02,605
Since we met here,

860
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:04,366
Shiqi,

861
00:42:04,846 --> 00:42:09,366
can you accompany me today?

862
00:42:10,566 --> 00:42:11,846
Just today,

863
00:42:12,205 --> 00:42:13,965
you're not Lord Qin,

864
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,166
and I'm not Miss Cui.

865
00:42:16,645 --> 00:42:18,246
Let's stay together

866
00:42:18,966 --> 00:42:20,846
carefreely and happily for one day.

867
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:22,286
All right?

868
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:29,406
All right.

869
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:50,166
Do you remember

870
00:42:50,285 --> 00:42:51,965
you promised me

871
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:54,045
that if one day

872
00:42:54,325 --> 00:42:55,886
the world nestles in peace,

873
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,644
we would

874
00:42:57,645 --> 00:42:59,326
ride on horses
across the plains of Wonderland?

875
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:00,525
Ying.

876
00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:02,605
Once the country nestles in peace,

877
00:43:02,805 --> 00:43:04,324
let's go

878
00:43:04,325 --> 00:43:06,005
and have fun in Wonderland?

879
00:43:06,566 --> 00:43:07,846
Deal.

880
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:14,324
For whatever we said

881
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:15,965
and promises we made,

882
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:18,485
perhaps none will come true,

883
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:21,525
but I really hope

884
00:43:21,526 --> 00:43:23,125
that this day will come,

885
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:25,326
even if it's only 24 hours.

886
00:43:25,725 --> 00:43:28,525
We leave everything behind

887
00:43:28,805 --> 00:43:30,324
and spend a happy

888
00:43:30,325 --> 00:43:32,445
and carefree day together.

889
00:43:33,605 --> 00:43:34,471

that you wished

you could meet me earlier.

897
00:44:09,685 --> 00:44:11,406
I still feel the same now.

898
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:13,604
If I could meet you earlier,

899
00:44:13,605 --> 00:44:15,485
I would've taken you to Yingzhou

900
00:44:15,526 --> 00:44:16,965

Crystal clear water pond in autumn

merges with the amber sky.

918
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:27,132
This is picturesque.

919
00:45:28,332 --> 00:45:29,211
It reminds me

920
00:45:29,212 --> 00:45:30,453
of the days in Laolan Pass.

921
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:31,851
Every autumn,

922
00:45:31,852 --> 00:45:33,731
Bao would go to hunt Mongolian gazelle
by the riverside.

923
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:35,853
We ate roasted mutton every day.

924
00:45:36,493 --> 00:45:38,492
You're making me hungry.

925
00:45:41,332 --> 00:45:43,733
I can go down to catch fish.

926
00:45:44,093 --> 00:45:45,052
Sure.

927
00:45:45,852 --> 00:45:46,651
Shiqi.

928
00:45:46,652 --> 00:45:47,651
Over there.

929
00:45:47,652 --> 00:45:49,012
There's a big fish.

930
00:45:49,973 --> 00:45:51,132
Yes, over there.

931
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:55,213
Catch this.

932
00:46:00,613 --> 00:46:01,972
To think

933
00:46:01,973 --> 00:46:03,291
a good writer

934
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:05,052
and a brave warrior like Ying

935
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,813
can't even deal with a fish.

936
00:46:07,053 --> 00:46:08,371
To think Shiqi

937
00:46:08,372 --> 00:46:09,171
finally caught a fish

938
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:10,532
after great efforts

939
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:12,532
but didn't deliver the fish properly
to my hands.

940
00:46:13,692 --> 00:46:14,532
Let's try again.

941
00:46:15,013 --> 00:46:15,892
Behind you.

942
00:46:15,893 --> 00:46:17,132
Behind.

943
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:22,253
In front.

944
00:46:22,573 --> 00:46:23,572

Do you like it?

948
00:46:40,652 --> 00:46:41,932
Shiqi roasted the fish

949
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:42,932
so well.

950
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,453
You're indeed a peerless talent.

951
00:46:45,453 --> 00:46:46,651
Your compliment

952
00:46:46,652 --> 00:46:47,691
sounds unnerving to me, though.

953
00:46:47,692 --> 00:46:49,293
I think I smell a rat.

954
00:46:49,332 --> 00:46:50,771
I'm not complimenting you.

955
00:46:50,772 --> 00:46:52,291
I'm complimenting myself.

956
00:46:52,292 --> 00:46:53,253
Complimenting yourself?

957
00:46:53,893 --> 00:46:54,652

Doesn't that mean my taste

961
00:46:59,332 --> 00:47:00,652
is excellent?

962
00:47:01,212 --> 00:47:02,652
To me,

963
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:04,052
you're always the best

964
00:47:04,053 --> 00:47:05,052
and most exceptional.

965
00:47:05,053 --> 00:47:06,492
You're complimenting me,

966
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:07,651
but it sounds like

967
00:47:07,652 --> 00:47:09,132
