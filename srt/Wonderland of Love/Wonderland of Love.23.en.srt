Father,

30
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:59,041
I will propose a toast to you.

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,761
After this,

32
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,440
I will marry Ying.

33
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:09,720
Here.

34
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,620
Great General is awake?

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,950
- That's right!
- This is great!

36
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:21,410
He's awake!

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,180
Great General!

38
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,459
Someone!

39
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,820
Arrest this unfilial son of mine!

40
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,500
General?

41
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:44,299
Father hasn't regained clarity

42
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,380
from the poison yet.

43
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:47,459
Someone.

44
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,579
Send him back to his room.

45
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,790
- Young Master!
- Young Master!

46
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:01,660
You scum.

47
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,660
I never expected you

48
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,220
to turn on me like this.

49
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,780
Young Master!

50
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,820
Great General, watch out!

51
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,699
Great General!

52
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:24,859
Young Master,

53
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,899
why are you doing this?

54
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,220
This must be a misunderstanding!

55
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,139
Yeah, Young Master!

56
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,100
Young Master, that's Great General!

57
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,739
Great General is delirious.

58
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:50,220
Strip him of his sword

59
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,699
so that he won't hurt himself.

60
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,220
You think you guys can stop me?

61
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,380
That's Great General!

62
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,619
Great General, watch out!

63
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:58,310
Great General!

64
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,660
Young Master,

65
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,340
this must be a misunderstanding!

66
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:17,460
Great General!

67
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,220
Who dares to hurt Great General?

68
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,540
Be careful!

69
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,499
We have to get married later.

70
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,859
Do not harm my bride.

71
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,980
Who said she was your bride?

72
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:45,299
Shu, stop!

73
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,619
The Jieshuo people?

74
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,600
Young Master brought the Jieshuo people
here with the wedding as an excuse.

75
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:19,100
To think that we trusted him!

76
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:48,790
Young Master Cui,

77
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:50,751
don't think that you can escape.

78
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:51,871
Mister Shiqi said

79
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:53,751
he's not Young Master Cui Lin at all.

80
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,950
His name is Liu Chengfeng.

81
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,830
It's right to call him
Young Master Cui.

82
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,710
He's still impersonating
Young Master Cui now.

83
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,770
His name is Liu Chengfeng.

84
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,710
It's Young Master Cui.

85
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:01,590
Liu Chengfeng.

86
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,260
Young Master Cui!

87
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,030
Liu Chengfeng!

88
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:30,511
Traitor,

89
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,191
how dare you collude with
the Jieshuo people?

90
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,111
Have you forgotten
about the deep-seated grudge

91
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:37,631
the Cui family has against them?

92
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,191
Cui Yi,

93
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,671
since it has come to this,

94
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,431
you can stop pretending

95
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:45,311
to be a kind father!

96
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,311
Let me ask you this.

97
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,231
Have you ever treated me sincerely?

98
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,470
Have you ever treated me

99
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,071
like your own son?

100
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,830
You were just using me all along.

101
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:04,610
The deep-seated grudge the Cui family
has against the Jieshuo people

102
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,390
has nothing to do with me!

103
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:09,710
Fine.

104
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:13,631
I don't have a son.

105
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,150
I only have a daughter.

106
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,270
Ying,

107
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,551
there's no longer any need

108
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,751
to hide your identity.

109
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:35,710
Everyone,

110
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:39,590
this is my daughter.

111
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,991
She's the real Cui Lin.

112
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:46,871
He has always

113
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:49,511
been serving in the military

114
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,631
under the name of Cui Lin.

115
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,470
And, I always

116
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:54,470
thought of him as my real son.

117
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:58,511
Since he has brought our enemies here

118
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,871
and no longer wishes to be my son,

119
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:03,991
from now on,

120
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,671
I only have one daughter.

121
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,991
Cui Lin

122
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,910
is my lone daughter.

123
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,910
However, she's better than

124
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,551
many men in the world.

125
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,150
Liu Chengfeng,

126
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,270
you colluded with the Jieshuo people,
poisoned me,

127
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,460
violated the natural order,
invited foreign invaders to our land,

128
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,390
and violated the code of filial piety.

129
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,150
Now, you're done for.

130
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,951
You better surrender!

131
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:46,751
Do you think

132
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:48,511
you can capture me today?

133
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,110
These arrows have a blue tint on them.

134
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,390
I assume they're poisoned.

135
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:06,991
Li Ni,

136
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,711
due to the restraint of your identity,

137
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:12,631
you couldn't bring your army
into the city.

138
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,190
Do you think you guys

139
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,430
can capture me?

140
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:21,743
I'm going to kill this traitor!

141
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,302
- Father!
- Great General!

142
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:24,383
Are you okay?

143
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:25,743
I'm fine.

144
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,462
Don't worry.

145
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,503
The Zhenxi Army is outside the city.

146
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:34,542
If we fight again,

147
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:36,462
both sides will suffer major losses.

148
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:38,503
Let Liu Chengfeng go.

149
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,863
Scram!

150
00:09:58,062 --> 00:09:58,702
Shiqi,

151
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,710
you set up an ambush
outside the city, right?

152
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,770
Liu Chengfeng is exiting the city
with his men.

153
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:04,143
You can intercept them.

154
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:23,223
Slowly.

155
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:28,983
Father,

156
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:31,743
why don't I tell Taozi
to read your pulse again?

157
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:32,743
It's fine.

158
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:33,542
I'm fine.

159
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:35,182
Taozi said

160
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:37,302
she made the antidote herself.

161
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,760
It can neutralize the poison slowly.

162
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,540
I had better not do
any strenuous activities.

163
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:41,702
But I couldn't hold it in

164
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,110
when I knew what that brat had done.

165
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:46,383
He actually colluded with
the Jieshuo people.

166
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:50,302
He knew that the Cui family

167
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,143
had a deep-seated grudge against them.

168
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:57,582
I wonder what happened to him
for him to end up like this.

169
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,903
To think that I treated him
as my own son

170
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:02,263
for so many years.

171
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:08,263
Father,

172
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:11,702
don't be sad.

173
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:19,983
Ying,

174
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,662
your mother and I only had you
after we got married for over a decade.

175
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:27,623
Although I announced to the public

176
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:29,503
that I got a son

177
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,462
to prevent the imperial court from sending me
another concubine,

178
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:34,983
your mother and I

179
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:36,542
were selfish too.

180
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:40,542
We wanted to leave everything
behind for you.

181
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,903
However, in this world,
men are prioritized.

182
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,900
There's no such case of a daughter
inheriting the family inheritance,

183
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,542
especially in the military.

184
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:53,462
I announced that you were a man

185
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:55,062
so that you could

186
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:57,302
inherit the Cui family's inheritance.

187
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:01,863
Father, I know that.

188
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:04,103
You told me that

189
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:05,702
ever since

190
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:08,182
I could understand things.

191
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:11,263
This is my choice too.

192
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,110
I don't think it's tough on me at all.

193
00:12:14,263 --> 00:12:15,542
It's a shame

194
00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:19,462
that Liu Chengfeng and Cui Li,
had betrayed us.

195
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:22,542
It would've been best if they could

196
00:12:23,503 --> 00:12:25,263
assist you wholeheartedly.

197
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,540
It's a shame that people have
different motives and intent.

198
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:31,342
Even if I was already on my guard,

199
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:33,702
all of them

200
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:36,863
still showed how ambitious they were.

201
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,383
Father,

202
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:40,623
you've already

203
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:42,103
done enough for me.

204
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:45,223
Ying,

205
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:49,623
now that I've revealed your identity
to the public,

206
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,062
I'm afraid it'll cause you

207
00:12:52,182 --> 00:12:53,783
more trouble in the future.

208
00:12:56,302 --> 00:12:58,383
I know you're intelligent, decisive,

209
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,820
and way superior to ordinary people.

210
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:03,182
But as your father,

211
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,662
I'm still worried.

212
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:09,743
I'm afraid that I can't
take good care of you.

213
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,542
If so, I won't be able
to see your mother

214
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:16,103
in the afterlife.

215
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:20,103
Father,

216
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:22,182
don't worry about me.

217
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,302
I'm your daughter.

218
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:26,582
So what if trouble comes knocking

219
00:13:26,743 --> 00:13:27,783
on my door?

220
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,623
Do you think your daughter

221
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,783
will be troubled
by these worldly affairs?

222
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,023
Excellent words.

223
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:39,422
Times have changed.

224
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,783
Even if all the trouble
in the world comes

225
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:44,783
knocking on your door,

226
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:46,743
we have nothing

227
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,062
to fear.

228
00:13:49,743 --> 00:13:50,302
Precisely.

229
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:53,662
Father, don't worry.

230
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,980
- Greetings, Young Lady.
- Greetings, Young Lady.

231
00:14:17,302 --> 00:14:18,662
Greetings, generals.

232
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:21,623
In the past,

233
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,420
the imperial court insisted on
giving me a concubine

234
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:26,462
as I had no son.

235
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:30,062
However, my wife and I
were deeply in love.

236
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:32,783
That's why we said we had a son

237
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:34,983
even though we had a daughter.

238
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,462
After that, the situation in the court
was ever-changing.

239
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:42,503
I had no chance to tell you guys

240
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:43,783
the truth.

241
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,503
Actually, Cui Lin is my lone daughter.

242
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:53,462
I see.

243
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:56,462
Although Young Lady acted as

244
00:14:56,702 --> 00:14:57,903
a lieutenant usually,

245
00:14:58,462 --> 00:14:59,542
we saw the things she did

246
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:01,223
with our own eyes.

247
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,340
She's just as capable as any other man.

248
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,062
We will surely assist her wholeheartedly

249
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,223
without any other intent.

250
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:10,103
Great General, please rest assured.

251
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:19,023
General Pei Yuan and I set up an ambush

252
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:20,780
outside the city
as per your instruction.

253
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:23,302
We did encounter Liu Chengfeng
with the Jieshuo people.

254
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,342
We defeated them flawlessly.

255
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:26,462
But their poison

256
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:28,263
was too formidable.

257
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,700
Although we've slain many of them,

258
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:30,983
Liu Chengfeng

259
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:32,422
still escaped from our hands.

260
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:36,503
He has already lost his mind.

261
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,100
Even colluding
with foreign invaders.

262
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,970
The Jieshuo people
are experts at using poison.

263
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:41,260
We must be careful in the future.

264
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:42,182
Yes.

265
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:46,342
Isn't that Lieutenant He?

266
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:47,062
No.

267
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:49,062
I mean, Young Lady Cui.

268
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,702
Good job, Young Lady Cui.

269
00:15:53,182 --> 00:15:54,223
Good job, Bao.

270
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:55,903
We're a family.

271
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,223
The brothers of the Zhenxi Army

272
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:58,822
are happy to slay your enemies

273
00:15:58,942 --> 00:15:59,582
for you.

274
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:03,743
I'll make a move first.

275
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,743
You can have a chat with Mister Shiqi.

276
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:15,942
Luckily, you were here today.

277
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:17,539
We're a family.

278
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,263
Not only are the brothers of
the Zhenxi Army happy to slay your enemies

279
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,010
for Young Lady Cui,

280
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:21,810
but I'm also happy.

281
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:22,783
Just stop it.

282
00:16:24,223 --> 00:16:26,942
Bao told me that they'd slain
plenty of Jieshuo people.

283
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,960
However, Liu Chengfeng still managed to escape.

284
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,783
Liu Chengfeng actually colluded
with the Jieshuo people.

285
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,960
The Cui family has a deep-seated grudge

286
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:40,623
against the Jieshuo people.

287
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:42,623
From now on,

288
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,822
he's no longer my brother.

289
00:16:46,783 --> 00:16:48,542
He's the sworn enemy of the Cui family.

290
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:52,910
Although I'm not supposed to say this,

291
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:54,143
I'll say it anyway.

292
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:56,542
I feel much better after hearing that.

293
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:01,462
You still haven't told me

294
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:02,623
how you found out

295
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:03,662
that Father was poisoned

296
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:04,743
and how you planned

297
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:06,263
a two-pronged attack with Father

298
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:08,500
after finding out about
Liu Chengfeng's plot.

299
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,600
I was thinking about this incident
after returning to the camp.

300
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,822
There was something strange.

301
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:15,902
Thus, Taozi and I sneaked back here

302
00:17:16,023 --> 00:17:18,663
to find out the kind of poison
Great General was struck with.

303
00:17:26,142 --> 00:17:28,142
Ear, deal with them.
Don't let anyone find out.

304
00:17:47,302 --> 00:17:48,183
Taozi was sure

305
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,710
that Great General was struck
with Jieshuo's poison.

306
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,510
Coincidentally, you were struck with
that poison before.

307
00:17:54,102 --> 00:17:56,102
And, you met Liu Chengfeng before this.

308
00:17:56,503 --> 00:17:57,423
Therefore, I suspected

309
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,102
that he was related
to Great General's poisoning.

310
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,080
Initially, Great General wasn't willing
to believe that.

311
00:18:03,503 --> 00:18:04,223
Until he found out

312
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:05,943
that he was the culprit.

313
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:11,223
Father was truly heartbroken.

314
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:19,102
Your Majesty.

315
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,040
Spare the formalities.

316
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:21,783
Empress, have you heard?

317
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,650
Your Majesty, what are you referring to?

318
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:24,822
That Cui Yi,

319
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:26,023
everyone in the world

320
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:27,302
knows that he has a son.

321
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:28,902
(Empress, Madam Lu)
Guess what happened?

322
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,102
That son of his isn't his son at all.

323
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:33,582
He isn't his son?

324
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:34,463
That's right.

325
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:36,463
He only has a daughter.

326
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:38,542
He raised her like a boy.

327
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,510
His daughter was putting on
a man's disguise

328
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,062
all along and serving in the Cui Army.

329
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:44,542
I heard that she's pretty famous too.

330
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:46,703
What do they call her again?

331
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:47,943
Lieutenant He.

332
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,622
Is that true?

333
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:56,743
That Cui Yi,

334
00:18:58,142 --> 00:18:59,983
he has deceived the emperor!

335
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:04,302
However, the high-ranking officials
are saying

336
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:05,862
that Cui Yi has a massive influence.

337
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:08,663
And, that Sun Jing is still at Tong Pass,
a key location,

338
00:19:08,743 --> 00:19:10,862
with the intent of usurping the throne.

339
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:11,983
And now,

340
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:13,703
Cui Yi

341
00:19:14,142 --> 00:19:15,703
has taken over Changzhou.

342
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:19,183
Therefore, my subjects advised me

343
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:20,382
to comfort

344
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:23,223
and coax Cui Yi.

345
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:27,902
However, I came up

346
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:29,902
with a great idea.

347
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:33,023
Your Majesty, what's your plan?

348
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:36,342
Since Cui Yi has no son,

349
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:39,342
I'll get him an adopted son.

350
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:41,703
By then, the lineage of the Cui family

351
00:19:41,862 --> 00:19:43,223
will be preserved.

352
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,142
In the future,

353
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:48,542
General Cui will be under my command.

354
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:50,822
Your Majesty,

355
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,862
who do you wish to send to the Cui family
to preserve their lineage?

356
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,743
That's why I came here to find you.

357
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:00,743
I wish to select

358
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:02,023
one of your nephews

359
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:03,663
and send him to the Cui family.

360
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:06,703
Your Majesty,

361
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:09,822
I'm afraid that
it's inappropriate to do so.

362
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,023
What?

363
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:12,622
Are you not willing?

364
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:15,622
That's not it.

365
00:20:16,102 --> 00:20:17,582
But Your Majesty, think about this.

366
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:20,302
Cui Yi is known as General Pingliang,

367
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,142
the commander-in-chief of the Cui Army.

368
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:23,783
Back then,

369
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:25,463
he conquered Jieshuo with his army.

370
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:27,062
I've heard of

371
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,902
Great General Cui's noble name.

372
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:30,542
He's an influential figure.

373
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,542
And now, he's not willing
to leave Changzhou.

374
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:37,223
It's obvious that he's displeased
with the current ruler.

375
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:42,943
Your Majesty, now you're trying to select
an heir for him out of kindness.

376
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,703
But I'm afraid

377
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,382
he'll misunderstand you

378
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,382
and think that you're trying to
steal his assets

379
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:51,423
and the right to command his army.

380
00:20:52,263 --> 00:20:54,183
That's my intention all along.

381
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:55,983
Besides,

382
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:59,463
Cui Yi will never find out.

383
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,342
Cui Yi has been a general
for many years.

384
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,423
He was able to raise his daughter
like a son.

385
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,943
His daughter is intelligent as well.

386
00:21:09,423 --> 00:21:12,503
And now, he has announced
this news to the public.

387
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:15,582
Why would he try to select an heir now?

388
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:17,023
I'm sure

389
00:21:17,302 --> 00:21:19,102
he knows your intention, Your Majesty.

390
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:23,542
What should I do then?

391
00:21:29,102 --> 00:21:32,542
Don't tell me I need to take
Cui Yi's daughter

392
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:33,822
as my adopted daughter

393
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:36,102
and make her a princess?

394
00:21:36,223 --> 00:21:37,663
Once she becomes a princess,

395
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:39,862
I'll find her

396
00:21:39,983 --> 00:21:40,983
an obedient son-in-law.

397
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:42,410
Is that what I'm supposed to do?

398
00:21:43,142 --> 00:21:44,703
Will the Cui Army be under my command

399
00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:47,183
after doing so?

400
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:49,302
Since Cui Yi raised his daughter

401
00:21:49,463 --> 00:21:50,902
as a boy,

402
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:52,902
I'm afraid

403
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:54,223
she's no ordinary simpleton.

404
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,110
I'm afraid that she might not
want to be a princess.

405
00:21:57,223 --> 00:21:58,783
She doesn't want to be a princess?

406
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,463
What else does she want to be then?

407
00:22:01,663 --> 00:22:03,302
It's just my assumption.

408
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,663
Your Majesty,

409
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:07,783
why don't you send someone capable

410
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:10,382
to test the intention of Young Lady Cui

411
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:13,822
and see if she's willing
to be a princess?

412
00:22:21,263 --> 00:22:22,102
Father.

413
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:23,663
Have a seat.

414
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:29,142
Something huge happened

415
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:30,862
in the imperial court.

416
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:33,062
Cui Yi's son, Cui Lin,

417
00:22:33,822 --> 00:22:35,023
is actually a girl.

418
00:22:35,663 --> 00:22:36,542
What?

419
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:37,703
Cui Yi

420
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,102
only had a lone daughter.

421
00:22:39,582 --> 00:22:41,223
However, he deceived the imperial court

422
00:22:41,622 --> 00:22:43,183
and said that he had a son.

423
00:22:43,743 --> 00:22:45,062
That was Cui Lin.

424
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:47,223
After that, he got himself
an adopted son.

425
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:48,703
He allowed his adopted son

426
00:22:48,822 --> 00:22:50,703
to use the name Cui Lin.

427
00:22:50,943 --> 00:22:54,142
His daughter changed her surname
to He instead.

428
00:22:54,382 --> 00:22:56,783
She's pretty famous in the Cui Army.

429
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:58,703
They call her Lieutenant He.

430
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:00,862
So, Lieutenant He

431
00:23:01,023 --> 00:23:02,463
is Cui Yi's daughter.

432
00:23:04,223 --> 00:23:05,142
No wonder.

433
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:09,622
Father, do you remember?

434
00:23:09,943 --> 00:23:12,622
Before this, Lord Qin risked his life
to sneak into Xichang

435
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:14,743
and meet you in the fabric shop.

436
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,382
The person beside him

437
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:17,463
was Lieutenant He.

438
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,382
And, Lieutenant He was the one

439
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:20,862
who came up with the arrangements

440
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,062
for Lord Qin.

441
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:27,902
That lass is no ordinary simpleton.

442
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,062
She's witty and intelligent.

443
00:23:29,183 --> 00:23:30,503
She left a deep impression on me.

444
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:34,183
So, she's the daughter of Cui Yi.

445
00:23:35,902 --> 00:23:37,062
Wan'niang,

446
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:38,463
I know

447
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:40,102
you possess lofty ambitions.

448
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:41,783
But since Cui Lin

449
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:43,223
is Cui Yi's daughter,

450
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:44,463
I'm afraid Lord Qin

451
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:46,862
might court her.

452
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:53,263
Father,

453
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:55,423
will you help me then?

454
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:59,582
My daughter is an intelligent girl.

455
00:23:59,783 --> 00:24:01,023
As your father,

456
00:24:01,142 --> 00:24:03,342
I will do everything in my power
to help you out.

457
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:07,423
So what if she's the daughter of Cui Yi?

458
00:24:07,783 --> 00:24:08,743
Although her father

459
00:24:08,862 --> 00:24:10,663
is a great general
who commands a huge army,

460
00:24:11,062 --> 00:24:12,023
my father

461
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:13,703
is the leader of the civil officials.

462
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,950
Since ancient times,
rulers are only afraid

463
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:17,902
of frontier governors who possess

464
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,142
strong armies.

465
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,503
I've never heard of an example

466
00:24:21,703 --> 00:24:22,943
where rulers are afraid of

467
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:24,703
fragile civil officials.

468
00:24:26,302 --> 00:24:27,463
Excellent words.

469
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:28,743
I knew

470
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:30,023
my daughter

471
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:32,703
won't be inferior to Cui Yi's daughter.

472
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:55,423
Young Lady,

473
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:57,302
you look great now.

474
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:00,382
But I'm worried about something.

475
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,423
You always dress up as a man

476
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,743
when you serve the Cui Army.

477
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,542
Now, you're dressing
yourself like this.

478
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:08,062
I don't think they're used
to seeing you like this.

479
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:12,862
Father has already announced
to the world

480
00:25:13,663 --> 00:25:15,223
that I'm his lone daughter.

481
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:17,302
If that's the case,

482
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:19,263
I should show up

483
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:20,943
as the person I am.

484
00:25:22,342 --> 00:25:23,663
As Father's daughter,

485
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:26,663
I'll definitely make him proud.

486
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:30,300
Stand up and have a look.

487
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:33,023
You're so pretty.

488
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:34,463
It's because you have good taste.

489
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,900
It suits
your complexion perfectly.

490
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:39,743
Greetings, Great General.

491
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:42,023
Lord Qin, what do you need?

492
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,610
It's still related to Changzhou.

493
00:25:44,902 --> 00:25:47,503
Great General, I wish to discuss
the issue of Changzhou with you.

494
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:49,423
Lord Qin,

495
00:25:49,503 --> 00:25:50,822
you just saved my life.

496
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:55,023
So, are you coercing me
into repaying your favor now?

497
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,620
I dare not do so.

498
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:00,783
I wonder who was the one

499
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:02,302
who sent a letter to the Cui Army

500
00:26:02,902 --> 00:26:04,582
requesting our aid to save Pei Yuan?

501
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:06,463
Lord Qin, I'm sure you still remember.

502
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:08,760
Great General, you stood up to help us.

503
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,223
I'm eternally grateful to you.

504
00:26:10,943 --> 00:26:12,423
However, times have changed.

505
00:26:12,902 --> 00:26:14,302
You're
occupying Changzhou now.

506
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,450
Not only are you criticized
by the imperial court,

507
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,090
but you also have to
be wary of Sun Jing.

508
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:18,983
Moreover,

509
00:26:19,902 --> 00:26:21,302
Changzhou, Luoyang,

510
00:26:21,423 --> 00:26:22,743
Jianzhou, Bingzhou,

511
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:24,499
Pingliang, and Yingzhou

512
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,110
have quite a distance
between each other.

513
00:26:26,223 --> 00:26:28,463
I'm afraid it's disadvantageous
for the Cui Army

514
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:30,183
to remain here.

515
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:33,423
Don't tell me you're going to say

516
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:34,663
that since Changzhou

517
00:26:34,783 --> 00:26:35,783
is a hot potato

518
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:37,302
for me,

519
00:26:37,703 --> 00:26:38,743
I should return it to you?

520
00:26:39,023 --> 00:26:39,783
Great General,

521
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:41,743
what if I exchange Weiyang

522
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:43,983
for Luoyang and Changzhou?

523
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:46,743
Lord Qin, what do you mean by that?

524
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:48,983
Although Weiyang isn't
under my jurisdiction,

525
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:51,542
Weiyang is located
in the vicinity of Pingliang.

526
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,240
Both military and civil affairs there

527
00:26:53,302 --> 00:26:53,983
are handled by

528
00:26:54,102 --> 00:26:56,183
General Pingliang, which is me.

529
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:00,582
Do you intend to use my stuff

530
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,263
in exchange for my stuff?

531
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,142
And, you even exchange it
for two cities.

532
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,663
One can only own a city
with a rightful name.

533
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,010
Although Weiyang is
in the vicinity of Pingliang,

534
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,580
the imperial court has stationed troops
in Youzhou Prefecture.

535
00:27:11,862 --> 00:27:13,310
If the imperial court issues an edict

536
00:27:13,622 --> 00:27:15,263
and keeps you at Pingliang

537
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:16,423
and Weiyang,

538
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:19,102
you may be in charge of Pingliang

539
00:27:19,622 --> 00:27:21,822
and Weiyang officially.

540
00:27:22,302 --> 00:27:24,622
The Cui Army wouldn't need to worry
about their back too.

541
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:27,542
Great General, what do you think?

542
00:27:38,663 --> 00:27:40,102
Since that's the case,

543
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:44,463
as long as the imperial court
issues an edict

544
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:46,663
and allows me to take over Weiyang,

545
00:27:47,862 --> 00:27:49,542
I shall withdraw from Changzhou.

546
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:51,943
However, Luoyang

547
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:54,983
has to be under my control.

548
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,360
Great General,
you're straightforward.

549
00:28:01,943 --> 00:28:04,463
Although I'm being put on the spot here,

550
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,110
I will request an edict
from the imperial court immediately.

551
00:28:07,223 --> 00:28:09,400
I'll only mention Changzhou
without mentioning Luoyang.

552
00:28:09,703 --> 00:28:11,080
Great General, please don't worry.

553
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:13,142
All right.

554
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,102
Lord Qin,

555
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,600
since the issue with Changzhou
has been resolved,

556
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:21,062
you may return to the capital.

557
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:22,743
Great General, to be honest,

558
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,783
I have one more request.

559
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:27,223
What is it?

560
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:29,142
I wish to invite Young Lady Cui

561
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:32,770
to lead the Cui Army in heading to Tong Pass
and eradicate Sun Jing together with me.

562
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,062
You actually want my daughter
to lead my army

563
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,263
and join you in hunting Sun Jing down?

564
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:41,542
Lord Qin,

565
00:28:42,023 --> 00:28:43,023
don't you think

566
00:28:43,142 --> 00:28:45,183
you're being too ambitious here?

567
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:46,743
As long as Sun Jing is alive,

568
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,062
not only will he cause trouble
for the imperial court,

569
00:28:49,302 --> 00:28:51,622
but your rule will be affected too.

570
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:55,110
Great General, you deployed your troops
southward to save the country.

571
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,960
Now, you're staying at
Changzhou temporarily

572
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,110
and controlling Luoyang
by stationing your army there.

573
00:28:59,183 --> 00:29:01,142
The court officials blame
for your intention.

574
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:03,102
Great General, as long as you agree

575
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:04,622
to allow the Cui Army to join me

576
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,582
in eradicating Sun Jing
and reclaiming Tong Pass,

577
00:29:07,183 --> 00:29:08,503
most of the speculations

578
00:29:08,862 --> 00:29:10,342
in the imperial court will vanish.

579
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:11,783
And, the people

580
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,263
will praise you for your loyalty.

581
00:29:15,023 --> 00:29:16,582
What if I don't agree to it?

582
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,582
If so, I'm afraid the imperial court

583
00:29:19,142 --> 00:29:21,423
will order me to engage you in battle

584
00:29:21,503 --> 00:29:22,582
after I reclaim Tong Pass.

585
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:23,743
By then,

586
00:29:24,302 --> 00:29:26,423
I will have no excuses
to reject their request.

587
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:29,542
And, the imperial court will prioritize

588
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,582
reclaiming Dongdu.

589
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:34,503
Lord Qin, why don't you give it a try?

590
00:29:36,062 --> 00:29:36,663
I have not

591
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:39,062
engaged you in a battle yet.

592
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:41,342
I truly wish to see

593
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:43,943
your strategies and formations.

594
00:29:44,102 --> 00:29:45,463
Engaging the Cui Army in a battle

595
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,503
is something I want to prevent
at all costs.

596
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:49,542
Great General, you know this too.

597
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,783
Tong Pass is the key location
between the two capitals.

598
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,622
Besides Tong Pass,

599
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,410
there are no areas
exposing the two capitals.

600
00:29:54,423 --> 00:29:56,263
As long as you agree
to let the Cui Army

601
00:29:56,423 --> 00:29:57,943
join me in heading to Tong Pass,

602
00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:01,703
the imperial court will definitely
reduce their suspicion of you.

603
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:04,822
Great General, I hope
you can agree to my request.

604
00:30:11,663 --> 00:30:13,102
Since that's the case,

605
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,622
there's no need
to send my daughter there.

606
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:19,902
I'll head to Tong Pass together
with you.

607
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:20,983
Just as expected.

608
00:30:21,902 --> 00:30:23,703
When I discussed this issue with Ying,

609
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:25,183
she told me

610
00:30:25,622 --> 00:30:27,822
that you would definitely
say something like this.

611
00:30:28,023 --> 00:30:29,600
When I asked Ying
how I should respond,

612
00:30:30,463 --> 00:30:31,223
she told me

613
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:32,342
to tell you

614
00:30:33,743 --> 00:30:35,223
that she already agreed

615
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,382
to head there together with me.

616
00:30:38,263 --> 00:30:40,302
Since you two have already
made an agreement,

617
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,822
why are you asking me this?

618
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,302
So, Great General,
I'll take that as a yes then.

619
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:47,503
Thank you, Uncle Cui.

620
00:30:48,062 --> 00:30:49,342
Who are you calling Uncle Cui?

621
00:30:49,943 --> 00:30:50,503
Scram!

622
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:53,342
Yes!

623
00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:10,023
This time, although Lord Qin
is aiding us,

624
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:13,342
the Zhenxi Army still have their eyes on us
outside Changzhou City.

625
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:14,743
We have to be on our toes.

626
00:31:15,102 --> 00:31:17,382
He's the emperor's son
and came here under an imperial order.

627
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,770
How could we join hands
with him so easily?

628
00:31:21,902 --> 00:31:22,822
Ying,

629
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,542
there are plenty of other men
in the world.

630
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:26,423
Why must you

631
00:31:26,582 --> 00:31:28,062
fancy a person like him?

632
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:29,382
Father,

633
00:31:30,463 --> 00:31:32,263
he deserves my liking.

634
00:31:32,743 --> 00:31:35,102
The situation right now is obscure
and tough to figure out.

635
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,610
Although Sun Jing was defeated,
he still owns Tong Pass.

636
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,800
And, the three princes
are battling for the throne.

637
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,240
Lord Qin has rendered huge merit,
that makes him an obvious target.

638
00:31:42,263 --> 00:31:44,423
Although Lord Qin is a rare talent,

639
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:46,110
he's not the best candidate for you.

640
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:52,342
Ying, have you truly decided

641
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:54,342
to get yourself into this?

642
00:32:02,423 --> 00:32:03,342
Father,

643
00:32:04,142 --> 00:32:05,463
I like Li Ni.

644
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:08,062
He likes me too.

645
00:32:09,382 --> 00:32:10,463
Although

646
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:12,423
there are plenty of men in the world,

647
00:32:13,463 --> 00:32:15,302
he's the only man

648
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:17,983
that I like.

649
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:29,142
You're my only daughter.

650
00:32:30,142 --> 00:32:31,743
Since you've

651
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:33,902
made up your mind,

652
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:37,263
I won't tell you what to do.

653
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:43,142
Thank you, Father.

654
00:32:50,342 --> 00:32:51,382
Come.

655
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:52,783
- Cheers.
- Let's drink.

656
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,410
Young Lady is mighty
at both the pen and the sword.

657
00:32:55,663 --> 00:32:57,302
And, she's the daughter
of Great General.

658
00:32:57,783 --> 00:32:58,463
Say,

659
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:00,760
what kind of guy
do you think is good enough for her?

660
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:02,223
If I must say,

661
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,382
Lord Qin is pretty good.

662
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:05,703
Ever since he founded his army
to save the country,

663
00:33:05,862 --> 00:33:08,410
Lord Qin has conquered every battle
with his mighty Zhenxi Army.

664
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,770
Besides the others,
just the surprise attack at Tong Pass.

665
00:33:10,783 --> 00:33:12,622
He's truly a rare talent
unlike any other.

666
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,542
Although Lord Qin is great,
he's the son of the emperor.

667
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:16,703
Young Lady

668
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,703
should make someone marry into the family.

669
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:20,183
That's right.

670
00:33:20,342 --> 00:33:21,582
That's good.

671
00:33:21,703 --> 00:33:22,419
Come.

672
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,130
Did you hear that?

673
00:33:23,142 --> 00:33:25,663
They think that I'm the only man
who's good enough for you.

674
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:27,663
I only heard that they want me

675
00:33:27,783 --> 00:33:29,423
to make someone marry into my family.

676
00:33:29,663 --> 00:33:31,023
Your Highness, as a prince,

677
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,943
are you willing to marry into
the Cui family?

678
00:33:33,006 --> 00:33:36,975
♪Belongs only to you and me♪

679
00:33:37,703 --> 00:33:38,703
The prince,

680
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:39,342
Lord Qin,

681
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:41,183
I don't want to be both,
and I don't care.

682
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:46,542
Ying, let's return to Laolan Pass.

683
00:33:46,822 --> 00:33:48,062
We can get married there.

684
00:33:48,622 --> 00:33:49,862
We'll have eight children.

685
00:33:50,023 --> 00:33:50,920
Half with your surname,

686
00:33:50,943 --> 00:33:51,810
while half with mine.

687
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:53,880
There's no marrying
or marrying into involved.

688
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:54,600
What do you think?

689
00:33:54,983 --> 00:33:56,223
Just you wish.

690
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:58,223
Who wants to have
eight children with you?

691
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,000
Fine, we'll have four children.

692
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:01,342
We'll have at least four.

693
00:34:01,463 --> 00:34:02,622
Two will follow your surname

694
00:34:02,743 --> 00:34:03,783
while two will follow mine.

695
00:34:03,783 --> 00:34:04,200
Okay?

696
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:05,310
If you keep spouting nonsense,

697
00:34:05,382 --> 00:34:07,023
I'll rip your lips apart.

698
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:08,462
You want to rip my lips apart?

699
00:34:08,862 --> 00:34:11,022
Yeah.

700
00:34:11,743 --> 00:34:12,663

General Han,

706
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:37,862
it's been so long.

707
00:35:38,382 --> 00:35:40,783
We've been playing cat and mouse
for quite some time.

708
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:43,342
You always managed to escape.

709
00:35:43,703 --> 00:35:45,543
Luckily, we didn't track you down
at Huayang

710
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,143
on purpose.

711
00:35:47,263 --> 00:35:48,623
You thought that you were safe.

712
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,743
That's how we were able to
intercept you today.

713
00:35:54,063 --> 00:35:55,022
General Han,

714
00:35:55,502 --> 00:35:57,143
Grand Governor respects your loyalty.

715
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:00,623
As long as you hand over
the great imperial grandson,

716
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:02,462
you will be spared.

717
00:36:14,502 --> 00:36:17,302
Defend the great imperial grandson
at all costs!

718
00:36:30,103 --> 00:36:30,862
Take him down!

719
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:38,942
Attack!

720
00:37:03,143 --> 00:37:04,862
General Han, behind you!

721
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,263
General Han!

00:38:22,543 --> 00:38:24,063
Great Imperial Grandson!

741
00:38:26,543 --> 00:38:28,103
General Han!

742
00:38:29,703 --> 00:38:31,342
General Han!

743
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:44,822
General Han!

744
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:52,743
General Han!

745
00:38:54,223 --> 00:38:55,263
Great Imperial Grandson!

746
00:38:58,223 --> 00:39:00,783
General Han!

747
00:39:04,862 --> 00:39:07,982
General Han!

748
00:39:16,502 --> 00:39:17,743
General Han!

749
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:21,263
General Han!

750
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,240
- Grand Governor.
- Grand Governor.

751
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:55,382
Li Xuanze,

752
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,342
how dare you not greet
the Grand Governor?

753
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:05,143
You're a traitorous scum who has
betrayed your ruler!

754
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,103
- How dare you?
- Stop!

755
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:08,783
Don't scare the kid.

756
00:40:35,263 --> 00:40:37,143
Han Chang kept you hidden
for such a long time.

757
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:39,022
In the end,

758
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:40,942
he still failed to defend you.

759
00:40:45,942 --> 00:40:47,583
No matter how loyal a person is,

760
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:49,462
they cannot defy fate.

761
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,382
Your Highness.

762
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,462
Have you delivered the letter
meant for Lord Qin?

763
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,063
We delivered it
with the swiftest horse.

764
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,360
Your Highness, don't worry.

765
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,970
Lord Qin will definitely try to save
the great imperial grandson.

766
00:41:15,982 --> 00:41:18,380
Although Sun Jing has captured
the great imperial grandson,

767
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:19,543
I think

768
00:41:19,783 --> 00:41:20,822
he won't get rid of

769
00:41:21,022 --> 00:41:22,263
the great imperial grandson yet.

770
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,822
I just hope that someone
can save him before it's too late.

771
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,480
General Han said he would rescue
the great imperial grandson

772
00:41:27,502 --> 00:41:28,963
with the remaining forces he has.

773
00:41:28,963 --> 00:41:30,783
The great imperial grandson
is blessed by the heavens.

774
00:41:30,783 --> 00:41:32,063
He'll definitely be fine.

775
00:41:34,006 --> 00:41:34,820
(Chaoqian Hall)

776
00:41:34,822 --> 00:41:36,342
(Chaoqian Hall)
Your Majesty,

777
00:41:36,543 --> 00:41:37,703
why did you issue an edict

778
00:41:37,743 --> 00:41:39,103
to criticize Lord Qin?

779
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,822
I ordered him to head to Changzhou
to resolve my issue.

780
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:43,942
But him?

781
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:45,342
He forced me

782
00:41:45,942 --> 00:41:47,462
to appoint Cui Yi

783
00:41:47,543 --> 00:41:48,902
as General Weiyang.

784
00:41:49,183 --> 00:41:50,703
And, he even told me

785
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:53,302
that since Luoyang was already
taken over,

786
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,743
we should forget about it for now.

787
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,263
That's Dongdu!

788
00:41:58,623 --> 00:42:00,422
He's treating the imperial court

789
00:42:00,422 --> 00:42:01,663
like a marketplace!

790
00:42:02,263 --> 00:42:03,902
He even submitted a fold

791
00:42:04,302 --> 00:42:05,942
saying that he would reclaim Tong Pass

792
00:42:06,143 --> 00:42:07,982
together with the Cui Army

793
00:42:08,022 --> 00:42:09,410
after Changzhou
has been resolved.

794
00:42:10,502 --> 00:42:13,422
The Cui Army is very ambitious.

795
00:42:14,103 --> 00:42:15,103
What if they launch

796
00:42:16,502 --> 00:42:18,422
a two-pronged attack with Sun Jing?

797
00:42:18,422 --> 00:42:19,440
What should I do by then?

798
00:42:19,783 --> 00:42:20,462
Your Majesty,

799
00:42:21,063 --> 00:42:22,703
we already passed this proposal

800
00:42:22,703 --> 00:42:23,543
during our meeting.

801
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:25,022
Since Cui Yi

802
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:26,743
is already taking over Weiyang,

803
00:42:26,822 --> 00:42:28,263
why don't you just

804
00:42:28,263 --> 00:42:29,543
give him the title as well?

805
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,620
I heard that an imperial edict
containing criticism

806
00:42:50,862 --> 00:42:52,300
of you was delivered here, Lord Qin.

807
00:42:53,263 --> 00:42:54,022
I knew

808
00:42:54,183 --> 00:42:55,422
Father would criticize me.

809
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:57,783
But I never expected him
to do it so quickly.

810
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,280
Although you resolved
the conflict in Changzhou

811
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,810
without shedding a single drop of blood,

812
00:43:01,822 --> 00:43:02,982
you gave Father the title of

813
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:04,183
General Weiyang

814
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,910
and promised not
to mention Luoyang again.

815
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,850
You're giving your enemies
in the imperial court

816
00:43:08,223 --> 00:43:09,623
a chance to criticize you here.

817
00:43:10,183 --> 00:43:11,223
If I was your enemy,

818
00:43:11,462 --> 00:43:13,302
I would've criticized you too.

819
00:43:13,862 --> 00:43:14,703
You only did it

820
00:43:14,902 --> 00:43:16,663
because you rendered military merit

821
00:43:16,902 --> 00:43:19,822
and most of the generals in the imperial court
would side with you

822
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,510
as they were once
part of the Zhenxi Army.

823
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:24,982
If not, public criticism wouldn't be
the only thing you would face.

824
00:43:25,263 --> 00:43:27,663
They would strip you
of your title instead.

825
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:28,982
They can go ahead.

826
00:43:30,462 --> 00:43:31,382
I plan to return

827
00:43:31,982 --> 00:43:33,462
to Laolan Pass

828
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,063
after conquering Tong Pass.

829
00:43:35,623 --> 00:43:38,820
I would rather stay there
than to endure humiliation in the court.

830
00:43:39,143 --> 00:43:40,840
I'm afraid you cannot
return to Laolan Pass

831
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:42,543
after conquering Tong Pass.

832
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,022
That's hard to say.

833
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:48,263
Mister Shiqi,

834
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,143
Consort Xiao has
an emergency report.

835
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,470
She said Sun Jing had captured
the great imperial grandson.

836
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:53,982
What?

837
00:43:55,623 --> 00:43:57,422
Reporting in!

838
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,310
Emergency from Tong Pass!

839
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,739
Sun Jing has made a declaration
at Tong Pass

840
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,110
under the great imperial grandson's name.

841
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,210
The great imperial grandson?

842
00:44:05,263 --> 00:44:05,822
That's right.

843
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,110
Sun Jing located
the great imperial grandson.

844
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,820
And, he criticized you
in his declaration.

845
00:44:10,543 --> 00:44:11,302
He said...

846
00:44:11,623 --> 00:44:12,502
Speak.

847
00:44:13,342 --> 00:44:14,880
He criticized you
for being the fake emperor.

848
00:44:15,143 --> 00:44:16,410
He intends to get rid of you,

849
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:19,143
save the country
under the great imperial grandson's name,

850
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,820
and make the great
imperial grandson the emperor!

851
00:44:24,302 --> 00:44:24,942
Father,

852
00:44:25,422 --> 00:44:27,063
Sun Jing was already at his wits' end

853
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:28,783
ever since he was defeated.

854
00:44:29,022 --> 00:44:30,143
We don't know if he has

855
00:44:30,302 --> 00:44:32,360
the real great imperial grandson
with him or not.

856
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:33,382
In my opinion,

857
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,920
let's get a child and call him
the great imperial grandson.

858
00:44:35,942 --> 00:44:36,583
Who can tell

859
00:44:36,743 --> 00:44:38,462
the difference?

860
00:44:39,982 --> 00:44:40,942
Lord Xin,

861
00:44:42,342 --> 00:44:44,502
since Sun Jing dares
to make a declaration,

862
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,520
I assume he already verified
the child's identity.

863
00:44:46,543 --> 00:44:47,942
If we get a fake one,

864
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:50,623
we'll be allowing them
to get the goods on us.

865
00:44:50,783 --> 00:44:53,543
The plan will backfire on us instead.

866
00:44:54,382 --> 00:44:56,302
Does Sun Jing have any evidence

867
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,783
to verify the identity of the child?

868
00:44:58,143 --> 00:44:59,462
In his declaration, Sun Jing wrote

869
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:01,460
that the great imperial grandson
was carrying

870
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,263
the seal of
the late crown prince.

871
00:45:11,302 --> 00:45:11,982
Your Majesty,

872
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,840
Sun Jing is doubting the rule
with the great imperial grandson.

873
00:45:14,902 --> 00:45:16,623
He has crossed the line.

874
00:45:17,103 --> 00:45:19,783
Right now, no matter if the great
imperial grandson is real or not,

875
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,110
the imperial court should dispatch
troops to eliminate Sun Jing,

876
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,720
reclaim Tong Pass, and bring
back the great imperial grandson.

877
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:25,862
In my opinion,

878
00:45:25,942 --> 00:45:27,902
Lord Qin once reclaimed
Tong Pass before.

879
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,380
He has engaged Sun Jing
in battle on several occasions.

880
00:45:30,543 --> 00:45:32,783
And, he has volunteered
to eliminate Sun Jing.

881
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,710
So, it's most appropriate for
the imperial court

882
00:45:34,822 --> 00:45:37,502
to assign this task to Lord Qin.

883
00:45:42,462 --> 00:45:46,583
If so, I shall let Lord Qin
accomplish this task.

884
00:45:47,462 --> 00:45:49,862
He shall eliminate Sun Jing
and reclaim Tong Pass.

885
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:53,143
He loves going to war, right?

886
00:45:53,982 --> 00:45:56,263
He can have his fill this time.

887
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,783
(Tong Pass)
Sun Jing published the declaration

888
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,462
in order to buy time so that his army
in Baiyue can return in time.

889
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:03,543
In reality, Tong Pass's defense is weak.

890
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,223
I assume you already have a plan

891
00:46:05,223 --> 00:46:07,390
to attack them at their weakest
and reclaim Tong Pass.

892
00:46:09,302 --> 00:46:11,022
How did you know that?

893
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,800
Tong Pass is easy to defend
and hard to attack.

894
00:46:13,862 --> 00:46:15,382
However, you once reclaimed Tong Pass

895
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:16,422
by force.

896
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,623
After that, the Zhenxi Army was stationed
at Tong Pass for quite some time.

897
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:20,942
Judging from your personality,

898
00:46:21,063 --> 00:46:23,623
I'm sure you already
jotted down every single detail

899
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,743
in Tong Pass.

900
00:46:25,263 --> 00:46:25,942
That's right.

901
00:46:26,422 --> 00:46:27,382
I made

902
00:46:27,663 --> 00:46:29,223
a secret path in Tong Pass.

903
00:46:29,982 --> 00:46:30,942
Secret path?

904
00:46:33,822 --> 00:46:35,223
Is it the aqueduct?

905
00:46:36,982 --> 00:46:37,783
How did you know?

906
00:46:39,623 --> 00:46:40,862
The soil in Tong Pass is tough.

907
00:46:41,022 --> 00:46:41,902
It's difficult

908
00:46:42,063 --> 00:46:43,022
to dig a tunnel there.

909
00:46:43,382 --> 00:46:45,783
Therefore, I don't think
the secret path is something new.

910
00:46:45,982 --> 00:46:47,183
It was there initially.

911
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,540
You can use it
to your advantage.

912
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:50,623
I remember that the armory in Tong Pass

913
00:46:50,783 --> 00:46:52,502
was flooded after a flash flood

914
00:46:52,663 --> 00:46:53,862
during the Ruijing era.

915
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,020
After that, the Ministry of Revenue
allocated funds

916
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,862
to repair the drains.

917
00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:01,460
They were so expanded
that people can move around inside.

918
00:47:02,342 --> 00:47:05,422
You knew what the Ministry of Revenue
did during the Ruijing era?

919
00:47:06,063 --> 00:47:08,302
I loved to read with my father
when I was young.

920
00:47:08,623 --> 00:47:10,623
Besides military books,

921
00:47:10,822 --> 00:47:12,143
he also collected

922
00:47:12,302 --> 00:47:14,703
records of the reparation
of various passes and frontiers.

00:47:14,862 --> 00:47:16,302
They were my storybooks.

924
00:47:16,462 --> 00:47:17,302

925
00:47:19,623 --> 00:47:20,822
If so, tonight...

926
00:47:20,982 --> 00:47:21,703
Lord Qin, tonight,

927
00:47:21,862 --> 00:47:23,783
you're going to be a mouse in the drain.

928
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:24,982
I'll keep you company.

929
00:47:25,462 --> 00:47:27,623
I'll assist you outside of the city.
