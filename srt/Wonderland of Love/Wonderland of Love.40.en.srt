that you're all right.

It's more glad

that you're all right.

33
00:02:21,618 --> 00:02:23,297
We all thought you were really…

34
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:26,897
Mister Shiqi

35
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:27,938
was absolutely devastated.

36
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:33,697
I don't know what happened either.

37
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:36,297
When I slowly woke up,

38
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:38,737
it felt like

39
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:41,137
I had just had a very long dream.

40
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:42,697
I could faintly hear

41
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:44,338
sounds and movements outside,

42
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:46,538
but my body couldn't move.

43
00:02:47,897 --> 00:02:49,177
After a while,

44
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:51,137
my body could move

45
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,058
a little.

46
00:02:52,778 --> 00:02:54,297
I was anxious,

47
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:55,818
but I could only wait

48
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:56,897
until the blood circulated

49
00:02:57,818 --> 00:02:59,697
and my body could move completely.

50
00:03:00,058 --> 00:03:01,618
That's when I leaped

51
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:03,778
out of the coffin.

52
00:03:09,177 --> 00:03:10,177
Young Lady,

53
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:12,297
by your description,

54
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:14,177
you seemed to have taken the medicine

55
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:16,417
I made to fake your death.

56
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:23,857
I see.

57
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:27,498
Taozi,

58
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:30,058
did you also give Liu Chengfeng

59
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:31,977
that medicine?

60
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:37,697
He was still Young Master Cui
at the time,

61
00:03:37,977 --> 00:03:38,977
so

62
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:40,177
I gave him

63
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:41,218
the rest of it.

68
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,310
We've already covered
more than half of the journey.

69
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:47,657
In a few days,

70
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:51,178
we'll arrive.

71
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:54,178
I wonder if the crown princess

72
00:04:55,657 --> 00:04:56,858
will eventually know

73
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:58,178
of your passing.

74
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:03,738
But regardless of whether

75
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:07,938
she knows or not,

76
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:14,298
you must have left without any regrets.

82
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:46,178
Your Majesty,

83
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:48,657
after this incident,

84
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:51,378
it should be clear to you

85
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:53,337
that the crown prince

86
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,738
is filial to you.

87
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,298
The crown prince and the crown princess
are a united couple.

88
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:01,298
Therefore, the crown princess

89
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:02,337
must also be

90
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:03,818
a filial child.

91
00:06:05,457 --> 00:06:06,498
Indeed.

92
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,858
We owe a lot to the crown prince

93
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,337
and the crown princess this time.

94
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:15,537
It is truly fortunate for me

95
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:18,938
to have such a son.

96
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:24,178
Dear,

97
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,618
I plan to abdicate the throne

98
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:29,498
in favor of the crown prince.

99
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:35,697
He is capable.

100
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:38,897
He will surely become a good emperor.

101
00:06:42,337 --> 00:06:43,378
Dear,

102
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:45,457
after the abdication,

103
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:46,738
let's go

104
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:49,058
to Mount Li Imperial Abode

105
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:51,618
and live the rest of our days carefree.

106
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:52,378
Shall we?

107
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:53,418
Of course.

108
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:55,858
As long as Your Majesty is happy,

109
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:58,897
I am willing to accompany
Your Majesty anywhere,

110
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:01,378
be it Mount Li

111
00:07:02,217 --> 00:07:03,618
or any other place.

112
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:21,537
Go.

113
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:22,777
Go.

114
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:23,818
Go.

115
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:30,657
Great General.

116
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:36,017
Go on.

117
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:36,498
Go.

118
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:38,777
Greetings, Father.

119
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:41,378
Ni, come.

120
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,298
Come.

121
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,378
Come here.

122
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:46,978
Yes.

123
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:50,897
You try it.

124
00:07:53,217 --> 00:07:54,337
Hurry up.

125
00:08:00,777 --> 00:08:02,418
This is not how you use it.

126
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:03,258
Here.

127
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:04,777
Turn it around.

128
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:05,978
See?

129
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:07,577
Poke it with the tip,

130
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:08,618
and it will bite.

131
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:11,577
I didn't know

132
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:13,378
there was so much to learn about this.

133
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:16,978
I know how to have fun,

134
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,697
but I can't handle any serious matters.

135
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:35,937
You picked it up fast.

136
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,297
Let me tell you,

137
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,738
you take after me in that.

138
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:40,618
You have talent.

139
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:47,458
Bite it.

140
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,498
Bite.

141
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:50,137
Isn't this cheating,

142
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:50,777
Father?

143
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,137
How is this cheating?

144
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:55,537
This is a skill.

145
00:08:56,258 --> 00:08:57,777
It's just like war and battles.

146
00:08:57,897 --> 00:08:58,858
You need strategies

147
00:08:58,858 --> 00:08:59,657
and tactics.

148
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:01,258
Here.

149
00:09:01,618 --> 00:09:03,458
Bite.

150
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,297
Ni,

151
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:14,098
it makes me really happy

152
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:17,817
to see you smile.

153
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:26,657
Let's keep playing.

154
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:27,390
Let's see who wins.

155
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,057
Bite! Come on!

156
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:34,378
Come on.

157
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:36,297
Bite it.

158
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:37,777
Bite it.

159
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:38,657
Bite!

160
00:09:38,657 --> 00:09:39,937
Bite.

161
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:42,378
Bite.

162
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,698
Bite it.

163
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:44,698
Bite.

164
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:45,858
Bite.

165
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,098
Great General.

166
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:49,297
Bite.

167
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:52,218
I still remember

168
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:55,017
when you were two years old,

169
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:56,698
I took you

170
00:09:56,937 --> 00:09:58,657
and your two older brothers

171
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:00,177
into the palace

172
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:02,137
to meet the late emperor.

173
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:08,218
The steps here were too high,

174
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:12,057
and your legs were short,

175
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:15,017
so you couldn't climb up.

176
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,698
I wanted to carry you,

177
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:20,017
but you stubbornly refused.

178
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:22,098
I was so angry

179
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:24,098
I felt like giving you a good beating.

180
00:10:29,057 --> 00:10:30,218
I don't remember.

181
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:32,618
All I remember

182
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,777
is that you never held me
when I was little.

183
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:42,618
At that time,

184
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:44,578
I thought your temper and personality

185
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:46,498
were strange,

186
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,177
and I always felt
that you were not like me.

187
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:53,177
But now, it seems fortunate

188
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:55,777
that you did not take after me.

189
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:01,417
This kingdom,

190
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:04,137
this world,

191
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:07,338
I entrust them

192
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:09,657
to you.

193
00:11:17,618 --> 00:11:19,537
I was not a good emperor.

194
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:20,498
Actually…

195
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:24,858
Well, I wasn't a good father either.

196
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:29,378
But at least

197
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:32,817
I have a good son.

198
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:36,498
I trust

199
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:38,937
that you will be

200
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:42,137
a fine emperor.

201
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:47,657
Rest assured, Father.

202
00:11:48,978 --> 00:11:49,817
I will strive

203
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:50,978
to be a good emperor.

204
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:57,858
Ni,

205
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:00,817
there's one thing I want to remind you.

206
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:02,897
Just one thing.

207
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:05,858
Can you not

208
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:08,338
be so serious?

209
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:09,817
I hope

210
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:11,177
that after you become an emperor,

211
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:14,578
you can be happy every day.

212
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:22,817
What if

213
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:24,458
I don't want to be emperor?

214
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:29,098
As long as you're happy,

215
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:31,218
whether you're the emperor or not
doesn't matter.

216
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:32,738
But I believe you will find

217
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:35,338
a reliable person

218
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,738
to take on the role.

219
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:39,738
Yes,

220
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:41,657
I will surely find

221
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:42,657
a reliable person

222
00:12:43,017 --> 00:12:44,698
and entrust this world to them,

223
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:47,017
just as

224
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:49,537
you entrusted it to me today.

225
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,417
Look at you go again.

226
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:55,057
So serious.

227
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:56,937
Ni,

228
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:58,657
smile.

229
00:12:58,657 --> 00:12:59,498
Think.

230
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:01,897
You're going to be the emperor.

231
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:03,817
You have to put on
a serious face every day

232
00:13:03,937 --> 00:13:07,057
and pretend in front
of the court officials.

233
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:09,417
While you're not yet the emperor,

234
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:10,858
make the most of it,

235
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:11,937
have fun, smile,

236
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:12,817
enjoy yourself.

237
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:19,978
In the future,

238
00:13:23,897 --> 00:13:25,177
if you ever

239
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:28,858
feel tired,

240
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,297
come to Mount Li and find me.

241
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:34,017
No.

242
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:35,937
I'll be the Grand Emperor by then.

243
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,817
I'll play

244
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:41,417
cricket fighting with you

245
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:43,017
to help you relax.

246
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:47,578
That's more like it.

247
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:18,058
(Chaoqian Hall)

248
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:54,698
(Second year of Tiantai.)

249
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:57,417
(The emperor abdicated his throne
to Crown Prince Li Ni,)

250
00:14:57,738 --> 00:14:59,297
(and the dynasty changed to Xianglong.)

251
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:02,378
(Crown Princess Cui
was conferred the title of Empress.)

252
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:05,417
(For the crime of treason
committed by Prime Minister Gu,)

253
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:08,177
(the entire Gu clan
was exiled to Mount Ya.)

254
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:12,618
(Lady of Excellence, Gu Wan'niang,
was demoted to commoner)

255
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:14,338
(and expelled from Eastern Palace.)

256
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:19,137
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

257
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:20,270
(From that moment on,)

258
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:22,777
(the chaotic times of Dayu
were finally quelled.)

259
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:25,578
(Peace was upon the world,)

260
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,417
(and the era became known in history
as a period of revitalization.)

261
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:24,177
Shiqi.

262
00:16:25,498 --> 00:16:26,777
What are you doing?

263
00:16:27,657 --> 00:16:28,297
Nothing.

264
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,057
Drawing me again?

265
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:34,338
Let me see

266
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,858
if you've captured
my brilliance and valor in your work.

267
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:39,137
Look.

268
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:41,297
Doesn't the sword I painted for you

269
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:43,738
make you resemble a celestial fairy?

270
00:16:45,978 --> 00:16:46,937
Give me the brush.

271
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:49,230
What are you going to do?

272
00:16:50,378 --> 00:16:51,378
That day,

273
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,218
someone was crying their heart out.

274
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:55,417
I must add some tears

275
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:56,937
to your face.

276
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:57,978
No, you can't.

277
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,258
If our daughter

278
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:00,417
sees it in the future,

279
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,520
how will I ever live it down?

280
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:02,200
I won't allow it.

281
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:06,097
How about this?

282
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:07,978
Let's make a bet.

283
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:09,458
If you win,

284
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:11,017
I won't add any tears.

285
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:12,537
But if you lose,

286
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:13,898
you have to let me

287
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:15,057
add those tears

288
00:17:15,138 --> 00:17:16,337
to your painting.

289
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:17,297
All right.

290
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:19,017
What's the bet?

291
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:23,258
Close your eyes.

292
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:25,418
Listen to what I say.

293
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,458
If you open your eyes

294
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,617
after hearing me out,

295
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:29,898
you lose.

296
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:32,337
If you keep

297
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:33,577
your eyes closed,

298
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:35,218
then I lose.

299
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,138
Again?

300
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,178
I'm not opening my eyes

301
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:41,138
this time

302
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:42,337
no matter what.

303
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:43,418
Not even

304
00:17:43,418 --> 00:17:44,898
if you kiss me.

305
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,297
Go ahead.

306
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:50,138
Shiqi.

307
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:56,537
I'm pregnant.

308
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:08,537
Is that true?

309
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:11,617
Of course.

310
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:15,138
I'm going to be a father.

311
00:18:36,938 --> 00:18:37,938
Do you think

312
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,138
it's a boy or a girl?

313
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:42,738
What do you think?

314
00:18:45,537 --> 00:18:46,777
I like girls.

315
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:48,938
I've always liked girls.

316
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:51,458
I plan to abdicate the throne to Xuanze

317
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:54,258
and then take my daughter

318
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:56,057
back to Laolan Pass with me.

319
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,658
If it's a son,

320
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,337
we might have to wait
a couple more years.

321
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:02,057
Why?

322
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:03,658
Why?

323
00:19:04,097 --> 00:19:05,097
Think about it.

324
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,898
If I have a son,

325
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,537
I'll have to explain to the court,

326
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:09,337
why,

327
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:11,178
despite having a son,

328
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:13,017
I'm choosing Xuanze

329
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:14,738
as my heir.

330
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:16,458
Then, dealing with a few inflexible,

331
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,738
ancient-minded ministers,

332
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,898
we'll have to go
back and forth in debates.

333
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:22,057
It'll probably

334
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:23,617
take me about two years

335
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:24,498
to settle everything.

336
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:28,777
Shiqi,

337
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,577
you really

338
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,057
have everything planned out.

339
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:34,978
Of course.

340
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:36,577
When the time comes,

341
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,258
our family will return to Laolan Pass

342
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,458
to enjoy happy days,

343
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:40,738
all right?

344
00:19:44,297 --> 00:19:45,138
Let's sleep.

345
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:00,218
Is it good?

346
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:01,418
Yes.

347
00:20:03,938 --> 00:20:04,577
Ear,

348
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:08,938
our shop will be opening soon.

349
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:10,017
I hope our business

350
00:20:10,017 --> 00:20:11,458
will be as good as theirs.

351
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,498
With you managing it,
I'm sure business will boom.

352
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:15,178
We'll open

353
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:17,017
many more shops in the future.

354
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:18,337
Of course.

355
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:20,617
I'm the crown princess.

356
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:22,577
I'm the crown princess.

357
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:24,337
I'm the crown princess.

358
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:26,498
I'm the crown princess.

359
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:29,817
I'm the crown princess!

360
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:32,218
I'm the crown princess.

361
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:33,577
I'm the crown princess.

362
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,617
All of you

363
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:36,258
bow to me!

364
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:37,658
Kneel before me!

365
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:41,698
I'm the crown princess.

366
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:43,337
I'm the crown princess.

367
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:47,777
I'm the crown princess!

368
00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:50,458
I'm the crown princess.

369
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:52,297
I'm the crown princess.

370
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,377
I'm the crown princess.

371
00:21:05,537 --> 00:21:07,057
I'm the crown princess.

372
00:21:07,617 --> 00:21:09,138
I'm the crown princess.

373
00:21:10,577 --> 00:21:11,138
Let's go.

374
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:20,258
Since

375
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:22,097
his defeat at Huishui River

376
00:21:22,218 --> 00:21:23,537
by the Zhenxi Army,

377
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,258
Wuluo bound himself

378
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:26,097
and his son.

379
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,010
They surrendered,
making their way to Xichang,

380
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:32,178
offering a formal letter of submission
and pledging allegiance.

381
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:33,057
Very well.

382
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:35,418
In the decades to come,

383
00:21:36,057 --> 00:21:36,978
Jieshuo

384
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,898
shall not rise easily again.

385
00:21:42,658 --> 00:21:43,498
Ear.

386
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:50,857
Chang'er.

387
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:53,978
Yes, Your Majesty.

388
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:55,777
Where's your mind wandered off to?

389
00:21:58,178 --> 00:21:59,857
I was thinking,

390
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:01,978
how did you get Her Highness to agree

391
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:03,110
to marry you in the first place?

392
00:22:07,777 --> 00:22:08,617
Well…

393
00:22:10,777 --> 00:22:12,617
I can't go into details.

394
00:22:14,337 --> 00:22:15,178
But

395
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,337
I had a long conversation

396
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,857
with her overnight

397
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:21,138
and won her over with my sincerity.

398
00:22:22,698 --> 00:22:24,577
That's why she agreed to marry me.

399
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,258
Then, I'll talk to Taozi too.

400
00:22:27,617 --> 00:22:29,178
I can't help you with that.

401
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:30,938
I've said what needed to be said.

402
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:32,337
It's all about sincerity.

403
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,898
Sincerity, got it?

404
00:22:36,658 --> 00:22:38,178
Sincerity…

405
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:44,057
I'm here.

406
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:46,817
Slow down.

407
00:22:46,857 --> 00:22:47,698
You just recovered.

408
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:49,577
Well?

409
00:22:49,658 --> 00:22:51,057
How's Her Highness's appetite?

410
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,698
She's been much better these days.

411
00:22:54,297 --> 00:22:54,978
That's good.

412
00:23:02,938 --> 00:23:03,960
What's going on with you?

413
00:23:08,698 --> 00:23:10,738
Taozi, I have something to tell you.

414
00:23:11,938 --> 00:23:12,698
Go ahead.

415
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:16,777
Today, I asked Mister Shiqi

416
00:23:16,777 --> 00:23:18,120
how he got Her Highness to marry him.

417
00:23:18,138 --> 00:23:18,857
He said

418
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:19,978
I needed to be sincere.

419
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:21,978
But I'm not smart like him.

420
00:23:22,097 --> 00:23:23,537
I'm not capable like him.

421
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:24,378
After thinking about it,

422
00:23:24,378 --> 00:23:26,458
the only thing I can come up with
is to say to you.

423
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:29,218
Taozi,

424
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:30,817
marry me.

425
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:32,178
I will treat you well.

426
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:37,857
I know that doesn't sound very sincere…

427
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:42,418
But did you know?

428
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,017
When you were critically injured,

429
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:46,738
hanging on the edge of life,

430
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:49,738
I was really scared.

431
00:23:50,258 --> 00:23:51,057
I was afraid

432
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:52,377
I wouldn't be able to save you.

433
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:55,418
It felt as if

434
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:57,017
my heart was being cut by a knife.

435
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:01,377
It wasn't until
your injuries slowly healed

436
00:24:01,658 --> 00:24:02,857
that I could finally rest easy.

437
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,138
So,

438
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:09,458
I want, in the days to come,

439
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,658
to be

440
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:13,658
by your side,

441
00:24:14,178 --> 00:24:15,258
to protect you,

442
00:24:16,337 --> 00:24:17,498
and take care of you.

443
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:20,617
I want us

444
00:24:20,738 --> 00:24:22,337
to live peacefully and happily

445
00:24:22,857 --> 00:24:24,057
for the rest of our lives.

446
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,577
So, I want to say to you,

447
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:32,938
Taozi,

448
00:24:34,337 --> 00:24:35,377
marry me.

449
00:24:36,898 --> 00:24:38,258
I will treat you well.

450
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:51,537
All right.

451
00:24:54,978 --> 00:24:56,377
You said yes?

452
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:58,377
Yes.

453
00:24:58,817 --> 00:25:00,418
After you said so much

454
00:25:00,617 --> 00:25:02,097
with such sincerity,

455
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:03,458
of course, I agreed.

456
00:25:09,777 --> 00:25:10,698
Hold on.

457
00:25:11,297 --> 00:25:12,138
Aren't your ears

458
00:25:12,138 --> 00:25:13,498
usually sharp?

459
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,418
How come you couldn't hear me
when I was saying

460
00:25:15,418 --> 00:25:16,418
something so important?

461
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,178
Were you doing it on purpose?

462
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,178
Were you doing it on purpose?

463
00:25:19,178 --> 00:25:20,057
Was it on purpose?

464
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:20,617
Was it?

465
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:21,218
No.

466
00:25:21,857 --> 00:25:23,218
No, I was just too happy.

467
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:25,698
I was just too happy.

468
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:39,138
Let me down.

469
00:25:51,097 --> 00:25:52,218
I'm happy too.

470
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:57,777
Silly.

471
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,017
Well?

472
00:26:46,377 --> 00:26:47,418
Caught anything?

473
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:48,817
You have eyes, don't you?

474
00:26:48,978 --> 00:26:50,698
Not a single fish.

475
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:53,658
We could've just fished

476
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:55,418
at Taiye Pond,

477
00:26:55,537 --> 00:26:58,097
but you insisted on coming all the way
to Wonderland.

478
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,410
You don't understand.

479
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:00,537
Ying said

480
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:02,817
the water quality at Taiye Pond

481
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:04,577
is different from the other lakes.

482
00:27:04,577 --> 00:27:05,658
The fish from Taiye Pond

483
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:06,777
have an earthy smell,

484
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:08,857
so we have to fish here.

485
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:12,178
All right.

486
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:14,938
I'll get a few people to go down
and catch the fish with nets.

487
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:16,458
Who knows how long this will take?

488
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:17,038
That won't work.

489
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:18,138
The taste of the fish caught with nets

490
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:19,658
is different from the fish
caught by fishing.

491
00:27:19,658 --> 00:27:20,857
Ying can tell the difference.

492
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,978
If she tastes the fish caught with nets,
she'll throw up.

493
00:27:26,057 --> 00:27:27,938
I didn't expect there to be
so many things to consider.

494
00:27:30,418 --> 00:27:31,138
Got one!

495
00:27:31,138 --> 00:27:31,898
Come on! We got this.

496
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:32,418
Hurry!

497
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:33,178
Quickly!

498
00:27:39,178 --> 00:27:40,297
That's not my fault.

499
00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:45,857
So,

500
00:27:46,017 --> 00:27:47,138
was this fish

501
00:27:47,337 --> 00:27:48,537
fished or caught?

502
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:55,817
Slowly.

503
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:06,057
Ying,

504
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:07,258
do you think

505
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:08,537
our child

506
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:09,938
should be named

507
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:10,857
Dao or Zhen?

508
00:28:12,017 --> 00:28:13,297
Are you really

509
00:28:13,537 --> 00:28:15,178
going to give our child these names?

510
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:16,498
Of course.

511
00:28:16,537 --> 00:28:17,738
We agreed on it.

512
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:18,617
Can't be changed.

513
00:28:19,777 --> 00:28:20,617
Well, all right.

514
00:28:21,097 --> 00:28:22,777
If it's a boy,

515
00:28:22,777 --> 00:28:23,617
Dao.

516
00:28:23,817 --> 00:28:25,337
If it's a girl,

517
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:26,698
Zhen.

518
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:33,057
No.

519
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:34,138
That won't do.

520
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:36,738
Why not?

521
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:39,017
It's fine to name a son

522
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,017
whatever,

523
00:28:40,258 --> 00:28:41,938
even something less refined.

524
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:44,658
But if it's a daughter…

525
00:28:45,377 --> 00:28:46,017
Ying,

526
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,617
won't it sound unpleasant

527
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:48,817
to name our daughter Zhen?

528
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:49,978
A daughter's name

529
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,057
should be more delicate.

530
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,377
Otherwise, when she grows up,

531
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:53,698
she'll blame me, her father.

532
00:28:54,138 --> 00:28:55,297
It was your idea.

533
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:56,297
No changes.

534
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:57,537
A promise is a promise.

535
00:28:58,337 --> 00:28:59,617
Besides,

536
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,258
an emperor's word is final.

537
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,537
They can't be changed.

538
00:29:02,537 --> 00:29:03,658
No, Ying,

539
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,738
that really isn't suitable.

540
00:29:04,738 --> 00:29:06,178
Let's change it.

541
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:06,938
I'll think again.

542
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:07,898
Why not?

543
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:09,178
You're the one who wanted

544
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:10,097
to use this name.

545
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:11,017
I've changed my mind.

546
00:29:11,738 --> 00:29:12,898
Too late.

547
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:14,097
Can't we choose another name?

548
00:29:15,817 --> 00:29:16,377
Here.

549
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,258
What else did Xuanze say in the letter?

550
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:23,138
You eat.

551
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:23,938
I'll read it to you.

552
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:28,017
"Great General Cui taught me

553
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,178
how to use concealed weapons,

554
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:33,017
and made a carrier for poison needles
for me to carry with me.

555
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:34,377
In the evening,

556
00:29:34,377 --> 00:29:35,750
General Han tested my martial arts.

557
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:37,218
Even though

558
00:29:37,337 --> 00:29:38,857
I'm still weaker than him,

559
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,898
I took advantage
of his moment of distraction

560
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:44,097
and used a poisoned needle
to incapacitate him.

561
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,297
Great General Cui praised me

562
00:29:47,297 --> 00:29:49,577
for my swift adaptability."

563
00:29:49,738 --> 00:29:50,218
Oh, dear.

564
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:53,938
Xuanze is so young
and already so much like you.

565
00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:55,458
What will we do when he grows up?

566
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:57,337
So what if he is like me?

567
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,337
Is that a bad thing?

568
00:29:58,458 --> 00:29:59,898
No.

569
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:01,258
But my Ying

570
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,857
is unique, one of a kind

571
00:30:02,857 --> 00:30:04,218
in this world.

572
00:30:04,577 --> 00:30:06,377
I don't want anyone else to be like you.

573
00:30:06,498 --> 00:30:08,297
Well, what if I have

574
00:30:08,297 --> 00:30:09,337
a daughter

575
00:30:09,698 --> 00:30:10,537
who takes after me?

576
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:11,978
Of course, that's all right.

577
00:30:12,218 --> 00:30:13,698
Our son can take after you too,

578
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:15,258
because they'll be our children.

579
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:17,817
Sweet talker.

580
00:30:18,138 --> 00:30:19,418
It'll be bad news

581
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,698
if our son takes after you.

582
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:23,218
He'd probably end up
in all sorts of romantic entanglements.

583
00:30:24,097 --> 00:30:25,817
So, it's better if they take after you,

584
00:30:25,817 --> 00:30:26,978
not me.

585
00:30:30,698 --> 00:30:31,377
Ying?

586
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:33,738
Ying?

587
00:30:33,938 --> 00:30:34,898
Shiqi…

588
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:38,377
My stomach hurts.

589
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:41,297
Someone! Come quickly!

590
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:42,658
Ying…

591
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:47,218
Your Majesty,

592
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:48,817
you should take a break.

593
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:50,377
How can I rest?

594
00:30:50,777 --> 00:30:52,057
It's been a whole day,

595
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:54,537
and I feel like Ying's voice

596
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:56,178
is getting weaker.

597
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:58,097
Will something happen to her?

598
00:30:58,658 --> 00:30:59,498
No.

599
00:30:59,777 --> 00:31:02,458
Women have to go through this phase
during childbirth.

600
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:04,418
Taozi also said

601
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,670
everything was proceeding smoothly.

602
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:07,178
You need not worry too much.

603
00:31:08,138 --> 00:31:08,898
If that is true,

604
00:31:08,898 --> 00:31:10,390
shouldn't she have given birth by now?

605
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:12,297
Your Majesty,

606
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:13,617
Her Highness is blessed.

607
00:31:13,617 --> 00:31:14,817
She will be fine.

608
00:31:19,218 --> 00:31:20,458
I just want her to be safe,

609
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,057
that's all…

610
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,377
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

611
00:31:45,377 --> 00:31:47,458
Her Highness has given birth
to a little prince.

612
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:48,498
And the empress?

613
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,297
Her Highness is well.

614
00:31:51,258 --> 00:31:53,337
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

615
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,777
You've been through a lot.

616
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:18,258
This is our Dao.

617
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,418
Are we really naming him Dao?

618
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:24,658
Does that mean

619
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,138
our daughter will be Zhen?

620
00:33:21,178 --> 00:33:22,577
(Li Ni ruled for ten years)

621
00:33:22,577 --> 00:33:24,097
(and abdicated
the throne to Li Xuanze.)

622
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:25,337
(Thus began the dynasty of Shenghe.)

623
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,738
(Li Ni returned to Laolan Pass
with Cui Lin,)

624
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:30,218
(living a simple life,
and remaining ready for any challenges,)

625
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:33,218
(fulfilling his wish
to defend the border.)

626
00:33:34,698 --> 00:33:35,258
I'm back.

627
00:33:35,418 --> 00:33:36,097
Father!

628
00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:37,297
Father is home!

629
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,057
Come here.

630
00:33:38,537 --> 00:33:41,537
Father is home!

631
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:42,738
I brought home

632
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:43,377
a gazelle.

633
00:33:43,377 --> 00:33:43,638
Father.

634
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:44,817
Let's have roasted gazelle tonight.

635
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:47,138
- That's great!
- Gazelle for dinner!

636
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:48,377
- Roasted gazelle.
- Let's go.

637
00:33:48,377 --> 00:33:50,377
Mother! We're having roasted gazelle tonight!

638
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:52,377
Mother, we're eating gazelle!

639
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:53,738
Father hunted a gazelle.

640
00:33:53,738 --> 00:33:54,617
Happy?

641
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:55,898
- Yes.
- Yes.

642
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,698
Do you like gazelle?

643
00:33:56,698 --> 00:33:59,297
Yes.

644
00:34:01,698 --> 00:34:03,498
We love it.

645
00:34:03,498 --> 00:34:06,097
Roasted gazelle!

646
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,377
Put it over there.

647
00:34:40,738 --> 00:34:41,218
Here.

648
00:34:50,377 --> 00:34:51,218
What's wrong?

649
00:34:53,618 --> 00:34:55,098
The new emperor may be young,

650
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:56,560
but he is courageous and determined.

651
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:59,297
Now,
the people live in peace and prosperity.

652
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,258
Even those of us

653
00:35:00,258 --> 00:35:01,618
on the border can enjoy good days.

654
00:35:01,937 --> 00:35:03,098
It's truly wonderful.

655
00:35:19,777 --> 00:35:21,138
Uncles,

656
00:35:21,138 --> 00:35:23,777
Zhen and Dao are here to see you.

657
00:35:23,777 --> 00:35:26,337
We offer you liquor and meat.

658
00:35:26,578 --> 00:35:28,337
Please help yourselves.

659
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:30,297
There's plenty more.

660
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:33,337
Father brought back a huge gazelle.

661
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:38,550
(Tomb of sworn brother Bao Tianlai)

662
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:40,441
(Tomb of noble-hearted Huang Youyi)
(Tomb of noble-hearted Zhao Youde)

663
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:42,417
(Tomb of noble-hearted Zhang Youren)
(Tomb of noble-hearted Qian Youdao)

664
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:43,258
Father,

665
00:35:43,578 --> 00:35:44,698
you said

666
00:35:44,698 --> 00:35:46,658
Uncle Bao's roasted gazelle

667
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:48,897
was the best in the world.

668
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,337
Is there really someone

669
00:35:50,337 --> 00:35:51,977
who can roast it better than you?

670
00:35:54,618 --> 00:35:55,497
Of course.

671
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:57,857
My roasted gazelle

672
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,897
is not even one-tenth
as good as your Uncle Bao's.

673
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:01,538
It's a shame

674
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:02,457
you can't taste it.

675
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,670
How does Father's roasted gazelle taste?

676
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:05,618
Delicious.

677
00:36:08,675 --> 00:36:10,199
(Sworn brother Bao Tianlai)

678
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:11,778
(Tomb of noble-hearted Qian Youdao)

679
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,886
(Tomb of noble-hearted Zhang Youren)

680
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,363
(Tomb of noble-hearted Zhao Youde)

681
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:07,297
Mother jumped out of the boat

682
00:37:07,297 --> 00:37:08,977
with a sword.

683
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,937
She looks so valiant

684
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,897
and heroic.

685
00:37:13,058 --> 00:37:15,058
This isn't a boat, is it?

686
00:37:15,337 --> 00:37:17,178
Boats are pointy.

687
00:37:18,098 --> 00:37:19,578
Father is crying.

688
00:37:19,578 --> 00:37:20,977
Look at his tears.

689
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:22,738
That must be fake.

690
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:24,417
Father doesn't cry.

691
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:27,098
I've never seen him cry.

692
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,897
Zhen. Dao.

693
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:31,658
What are you hiding?

694
00:37:35,698 --> 00:37:36,897
Who brought this out?

695
00:37:37,218 --> 00:37:39,098
It's not Zhen's fault.

696
00:37:39,098 --> 00:37:41,897
I found it in the box.

697
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,178
Who really brought it out?

698
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:50,018
I did.

699
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,178
Don't blame Dao, Mother.

700
00:37:52,178 --> 00:37:54,138
I saw the beautiful drawing of Mother

701
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,497
in the book

702
00:37:55,497 --> 00:37:56,937
and couldn't resist

703
00:37:56,937 --> 00:37:58,777
taking it out to show Dao.

704
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:00,417
How do you know that the drawings

705
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:01,897
were of us?

706
00:38:02,058 --> 00:38:03,817
Mother told me that the first time

707
00:38:03,817 --> 00:38:05,698
you fought with her,

708
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:07,098
you lost.

709
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:10,417
I lied.

710
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:12,058
Your mother lied.

711
00:38:12,058 --> 00:38:13,417
I would never lose.

712
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,098
I let your mother win.

713
00:38:15,098 --> 00:38:16,178
I understand.

714
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:18,258
Just like how Dao lets me win.

715
00:38:22,777 --> 00:38:24,337
Just like how Dao lets you win.

716
00:38:24,538 --> 00:38:25,538
But in the future,

717
00:38:25,538 --> 00:38:27,000
there will be someone who lets Zhen win.

718
00:38:34,377 --> 00:38:36,817
Mother, where is this?

719
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:38,258
It's beautiful.

720
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:41,138
This is Wonderland.

721
00:38:41,138 --> 00:38:43,218
It's a very, very beautiful place.

722
00:38:43,218 --> 00:38:45,178
When you and Dao grow a bit older,

723
00:38:45,178 --> 00:38:47,738
we'll take you there,

724
00:38:47,738 --> 00:38:48,377
all right?

725
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:48,857
All right.

726
00:38:49,018 --> 00:38:49,777
Do you want to go?

727
00:38:49,937 --> 00:38:51,018
Yes.

728
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:53,337
The drawings in here

729
00:38:53,337 --> 00:38:55,138
are of your father and mother.

730
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:56,138
But

731
00:38:56,538 --> 00:38:57,098
Zhen,

732
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:57,937
Dao,

733
00:38:58,817 --> 00:38:59,777
in the future,

734
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:01,337
you'll also encounter

735
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:02,178
interesting people,

736
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,150
interesting experiences,

737
00:39:03,417 --> 00:39:04,897
and you'll need to spend

738
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:07,698
your lifetime

739
00:39:07,857 --> 00:39:09,098
painting your own stories.

740
00:39:09,258 --> 00:39:10,698
Then, I'll do my best

741
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:13,377
to make my story even more exciting

742
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:14,538
than Father and Mother's.

743
00:39:15,058 --> 00:39:16,018
It's a given, isn't it?

744
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:17,538
I'll definitely make mine
more exciting than Dao's.

745
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:18,817
Mine will be more exciting than yours!

746
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:21,618
- No, mine will!
- Mine will!

747
00:39:21,618 --> 00:39:22,058
Slow down.

748
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:22,817
Be careful not to fall.

749
00:39:22,817 --> 00:39:23,817
Mine will!

750
00:39:23,817 --> 00:39:24,777
Got you!

751
00:39:25,538 --> 00:39:26,377
It's me!

752
00:39:26,937 --> 00:39:27,897
Me!

753
00:39:30,658 --> 00:39:31,138
Me!

754
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:34,218
You can't catch me!
