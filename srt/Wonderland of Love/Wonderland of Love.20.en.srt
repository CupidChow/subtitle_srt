29
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:44,339
Do you think

30
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,499
you can change Lord Qin's mind?

31
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,180
Lord Qin

32
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,820
has a soft heart
despite his hard exterior.

33
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:53,458
Others look at him as someone
who fights and kills

34
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:54,899
on countless battlefields.

35
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,899
But actually, he has a soft

36
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,419
and kind heart.

37
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,100
With the right words,

38
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,300
I'm sure I can change his mind.

39
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,298
His Majesty has ordered Lord Qin
to reflect on his wrongdoings.

40
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,259
Master said that many have written
a letter of complaint

41
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,260
against Lord Qin, right?

42
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:14,659
When a tree is tall and strong,
it will be buffeted by wind.

43
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,819
Lord Qin

44
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,338
has made a great achievement this time.

45
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:19,460
So, others are envious of him.

46
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,499
Now, His Majesty is in a fit of anger.

47
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,339
If Lord Qin refuses to bend to him,

48
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,779
I'm afraid that it'll drive a wedge
between them.

49
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,939
And it'll badly affect
Lord Qin's future.

50
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:37,898
Greetings, Lord Qin.

51
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:38,980
Miss Gu.

52
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,298
I should've visited
Prime Minister Gu in person.

53
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,899
But I can't simply
leave my residence now.

54
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,778
Please apologise to him on my behalf

55
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:47,099
when you go back.

56
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,740
You are too courteous.

57
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,498
Actually, I'm not here today

58
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:52,058
on behalf of my father.

59
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:54,020
I'm here on my own volition today.

60
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,819
I have something

61
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,339
to give you.

62
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,260
You are too kind, Miss Gu.

63
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,139
I have everything I need here.

64
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,980
I shouldn't accept a gift from you.

65
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,619
This is embroidered by me.

66
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,740
I visited many old friends
in the capital.

67
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,738
And luckily, some of them

68
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,619
had seen your biological mother before.

69
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,540
So, I embroidered

70
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,498
this portrait of Madam Liu

71
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:25,779
according to their descriptions.

72
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,578
After I was done,

73
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,659
I showed it to those

74
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,619
who knew Madam Liu.

75
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,460
According to them, this portrait
looks exactly like her.

76
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,458
Lord Qin.

77
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,139
It took Miss Gu a long time

78
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,539
to look for those

79
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,298
who had seen Madam Liu before.

80
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,699
And she spent a long time asking them

81
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,260
to describe Madam Liu to her.

82
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,778
Then, she made a draft

83
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:42,939
and worked on this portrait

84
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,699
day and night.

85
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,379
Until her eyes were red.

86
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,980
Finally, she managed
to finish this portrait in time.

87
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,140
Your Highness.

88
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,618
It's indeed saddening

89
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,498
not to be able to grow up

90
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:03,219
under a mother's care.

91
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,860
But I'm sure that Madam Liu

92
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,498
will feel gratified if she knows

93
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,180
how valiant and capable you are.

94
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,300
Thank you, Miss Gu.

95
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,099
I'll accept

96
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,579
this portrait then.

97
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:23,019
You are an intelligent
and understanding man.

98
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,298
I'm sure you know

99
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:26,138
that Madam Liu would not want you

100
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,698
to quarrel with His Majesty

101
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,540
over her title.

102
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,618
Look, Your Highness.

103
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:37,738
I used gold and silver threads,

104
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:39,619
to embroider this portrait.

105
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,019
If you want to hang up her portrait

106
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,298
to be used for memorial purposes,

107
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:44,019
The color

108
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,220
won't fade from getting smoked
by the incense.

109
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,180
That's very thoughtful of you, Miss Gu.

110
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:54,220
I'm really grateful to you.

111
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:56,220
You are too kind.

112
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:58,378
I know

113
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:00,019
you can't have a guest here
for too long.

114
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,540
I'll get going now.

115
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,698
Young Lady.

116
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,579
I thought you wanted
to convince Lord Qin

117
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,259
to apologise to His Majesty.

118
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,178
Why didn't you say anything about it?

119
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:29,300
And you left in a hurry.

120
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,100
I was wrong.

121
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,899
Lord Qin is very serious about the title

122
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,420
of his mother.

123
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,819
Just now, from his expression,

124
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,859
if I tried to change his mind,

125
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,740
he would be unhappy.

126
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:46,300
Moreover,

127
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,780
he has accepted the portrait of Madam Liu.

128
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,420
Whenever he sees
the portrait after this,

129
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,740
he'll feel grateful to me.

130
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,740
Since I've achieved what I want,

131
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,860
I shouldn't outstay my welcome.

132
00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:59,738
Is he really going to give up

133
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,420
his title as Lord Qin?

134
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:04,619
Will His Majesty punish him again?

135
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,660
He is the chosen one.

136
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,059
Things will go well for him.

137
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,459
For someone like Lord Qin,

138
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,779
others

139
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,819
may be able to defeat him in this round,

140
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,259
but they'll never
be able to win the game.

141
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:27,780
You are back.

142
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,660
I'm back.

143
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:33,178
Stop looking at me.

144
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:34,579
She didn't reply to your letter.

145
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,699
She didn't even open your letter.

146
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,540
I'm not waiting for her reply.

147
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,818
But to be honest,

148
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,378
What Miss Cui said

149
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,180
makes sense.

150
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,058
She said that in this current situation,

151
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:52,899
you should treat it as if it's a war.

152
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,298
When should you attack

153
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:55,419
and when

154
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,899
should you stop and regroup?

155
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,698
Actually,

156
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,619
you know what you have to do.

157
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:04,860
What's that?

158
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,860
That's a portrait of my mother.

159
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,499
They say that this portrait
looks exactly like her.

160
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:18,059
I've never seen her before.

161
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,220
This portrait

162
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,180
is very well embroidered.

163
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:25,740
It's almost lifelike.

164
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,939
Yes.

165
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,320
It's from Miss Gu.

166
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,080
She said that she spent
a long time embroidering it.

167
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,780
It's from Miss Gu?

168
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:35,258
Looks like Miss Gu

169
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:36,939
really cares about you.

170
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,339
Shiqi.

171
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,899
Is she interested in you?

172
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,539
Me and her

173
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,100
are totally different people.

174
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:43,660
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

175
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:45,100
I am

176
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,819
only interested in Miss Cui.

177
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,019
Miss Cui

178
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,019
didn't even read your letter.

179
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,420
Has the Grand Governor gotten better?

180
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,119
The physician is neutralizing the toxin

181
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,720
with acupuncture paired
with secret medicine.

182
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,220
According to him, most of the toxin
has been neutralized.

183
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:19,220
This poison

184
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:21,499
is lethal and lasts for a long time.

185
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:26,780
Grand Governor.

186
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,619
Grand Governor.

187
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,900
Grand Governor.

188
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,620
(Qingyun Temple)
Back then, I promised Lord Qin

189
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,378
that if he vowed to protect
the great imperial grandson

190
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:43,099
and put him on the throne,

191
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:47,219
I would come up with a way
to poison Sun Jing.

192
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,179
I was even prepared

193
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,180
to die together with him.

194
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,900
But I never thought

195
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:56,500
that I would fail.

196
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,579
And he even escaped to Tong Pass.

197
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:02,540
I failed to keep up
the end of my bargain.

198
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:04,498
Your Highness.

199
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:06,140
You did your best.

200
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,900
Everything was in heaven's hands.

201
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,979
Lord Qin sent me a letter yesterday.

202
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:16,459
He wrote that although Sun Jing
was defeated for now,

203
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,780
the threat remained unbroken.

204
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,540
We still need to be cautious.

205
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,418
Write a letter to General Han

206
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:27,258
to ask him to keep
the great imperial grandson

207
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,420
hidden for now.

208
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:30,859
Yes, Your Highness.

209
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:44,780
Your Highness.

210
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,459
We have a letter from Consort Xiao.

211
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,459
How is my mother?

212
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,498
Lord Qin reclaimed Xichang.

213
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:54,299
But I didn't receive any letter
from my mother.

214
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,859
I was worried

215
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,459
that something had happened to her.

216
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,778
Don't worry.

217
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:00,300
Consort Xiao is alive and well.

218
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:01,579
She has

219
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,300
settled down in Qingyun Temple

220
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:04,378
outside of Xichang.

221
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:05,898
Now that the capital
has been reclaimed,

222
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:08,059
can we return to the city now?

223
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,099
Your Highness.

224
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,699
Consort Xiao sent us a letter

225
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,059
to ask us to bear with it
for a while longer.

226
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,339
Sun Jing has taken over Tong Pass.

227
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:25,020
We can trust

228
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:27,140
Lord Qin in the capital.

229
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,898
But Lord Xin and Lord Qi

230
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,699
are driven by wild ambitions.

231
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,699
Consort Xiao

232
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,140
has asked us
to be careful and stay hidden.

233
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,059
I'm afraid that there are still many

234
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,540
who want to hurt you.

235
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,699
I understand.

236
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,299
Lord Xin wants to lead
the Zhenxi Army to Changzhou?

237
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,459
Yes.

238
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,059
During the court meeting today,

239
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,898
my father asked me

240
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,258
to lead our army to Changzhou

241
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:55,258
to stop Sun Jing from summoning
the troops he sent to Baiyue.

242
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:57,099
And Lord Xin volunteered
to lead the army himself.

243
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,059
And some of the pedantic ministers said
that since the founding of this country,

244
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,440
the position of the commander-in-chief
has always been held by the lords.

245
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,339
So, they agreed

246
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,658
that it was best
to let Lord Xin lead the army.

247
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:08,420
That's ridiculous.

248
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,300
Have they forgotten how he lost Luoyang?

249
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:13,059
If he leads the army,

250
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,459
it's like sending the Zhenxi Army
on a suicide mission.

251
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,099
Not only that,

252
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,819
he dragged Lord Qi into it with him.

253
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,219
He said that Lord Qi could help him

254
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,500
with his wisdom.

255
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:22,579
In the end,

256
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,500
they almost managed
to convince His Majesty.

257
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,300
Has His Majesty given his decree?

258
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:27,699
He hasn't officially given his decree

259
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,859
to the Palace Secretariat.

260
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,538
But it's obvious

261
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:32,018
where His Majesty stands.

262
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:34,059
He's going to appoint Lord Qin
as the commander-in-chief,

263
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,378
Lord Qi as the great general

264
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:36,378
and me as the vanguard.

265
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,018
All three troops

266
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,939
of the Zhenxi Army
will head to Changzhou.

267
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:54,660
Lord Xin is trying to kill
two birds with one stone.

268
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,420
He wants to stay in Changzhou
to wait until his opponent is worn out.

269
00:11:58,419 --> 00:11:59,059
If he can destroy

270
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,819
Sun Jing's troops that sent to Baiyue,

271
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,300
he can earn himself a great merit.

272
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:03,380
Secondly,

273
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,579
he wants to take away the military power
of the Zhenxi Army.

274
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:09,300
That's what my father said too.

275
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:10,618
My father also said

276
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:12,498
that Lord Xin has been eyeing
the title of Crown Prince

277
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:13,819
for a while now.

278
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,418
But he has yet to achieve anything.

279
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:16,498
In terms of reputation,

280
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:18,498
he's no match for you.

281
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:20,459
That's why he can't wait

282
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:23,339
to go to Changzhou to win this victory.

283
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,179
The troops of Sun Jing sent to Baiyue

284
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,339
is made up of veterans who have
a lot of experience in battles.

285
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,380
They may be tired,

286
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:32,739
but it doesn't mean
that they can be easily defeated.

287
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,459
Lord Xin is flatulent and arrogant.
He doesn't know how to lead an army.

288
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,699
Lord Qi

289
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:40,819
is a little bit smart
but he's not courageous enough.

290
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:43,180
Not only they can't win

291
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:45,339
a battle together,

292
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,418
their incompetence

293
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:48,939
will only lead the army to death.

294
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,898
Bite it.

295
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,219
Come. Bite it.

296
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,020
- Bit it.
- Mine is going to lose.

297
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:57,660
Your Majesty.

298
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,099
What is it?

299
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,819
Go away.

300
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,780
Your Majesty.

301
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:04,778
Lord Qin has written a letter to you.

302
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:05,939
Please read it.

303
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:09,658
I asked him to reflect
on his wrongdoings, right?

304
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:10,258
Does he know

305
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:11,979
what he did wrong?

306
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,339
Why is he writing a letter to me?

307
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,378
I won't read it.

308
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,378
Take it away.

309
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:16,939
Father.

310
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,418
Maybe you should read it.

311
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:19,018
If Li Ni

312
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,498
makes any outrageous requests,

313
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,180
you can reject him.

314
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:39,046
(A Letter to the Emperor)

315
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:42,260
(I've been thinking
about it day and night.)

316
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,059
(And I haven't been able
to sleep fitfully.)

317
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:46,260
(I've gone against you)

318
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,939
(for the title of my mother.)

319
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,900
(She has passed away.)

320
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:53,059
(And as her son,)

321
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,819
(I respected and loved her
while she was alive)

322
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,739
(and I mourn her now that
she has passed away.)

323
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,939
(She'll forever live in my heart.)

324
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,140
(The other ministers took pity on me)

325
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:04,140
(and regarded my expostulation)

326
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:05,939
(as an act of filial piety.)

327
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,699
(However, the proper rite of etiquette)

328
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:12,720
(is to confer the title
of Lady of Bright Deportment to my mother.)

329
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:14,859
(I dare not go against it.)

330
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,660
(I'll respect the decision
that you've made.)

331
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:32,498
(I'll respect the decision
that you've made.)

332
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:34,020
I already wrote a letter to His Majesty

333
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,140
to confer the title
of Lady of Bright Deportment to my mother

334
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,699
to quell the ongoing discussion.

335
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:39,939
I'm sure His Majesty
will pass down his decree

336
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,699
within the next few years.

337
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:43,699
Your Highness.

338
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,219
When you go back,

339
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,660
please ask

340
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,579
Prime Minister Gu

341
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:50,939
to send the Ministry of Rites
to the imperial mausoleum

342
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,859
to handle the memorial ceremony
of the late empress.

343
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:54,660
Are you...

344
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,258
Only the child of the empress

345
00:14:58,259 --> 00:14:59,979
can lead this ceremony.

346
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,658
I'm sure Lord Xin will not want
to miss this chance to lead the ceremony

347
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:04,339
as the son of the empress.

348
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,939
To be honest,

349
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,658
I don't want to let Lord Xin and Lord Qi

350
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:09,180
lead the army to Changzhou.

351
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:10,859
I got it.

352
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,778
I will relay your message

353
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,140
to my father.

354
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:26,579
Father.

355
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,738
What did Li Ni write

356
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:30,459
in his letter?

357
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,699
He wrote that he didn't want
to make things difficult for me.

358
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,579
So, he requested

359
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,099
to confer the title
of Lady of Bright Deportment to his mother.

360
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,339
At first, he rather gave up
his title as Lord Qin

361
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,219
because of the title of his mother.

362
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,459
And he embarrassed you
during the court meeting.

363
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,179
Why would he suddenly

364
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,699
write a letter of apology to you?

365
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,500
That's why

366
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,780
it's necessary to set an example
out of him to warn the others.

367
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,979
Look.

368
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:58,179
He has realised his mistakes
after asking him

369
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,900
to reflect on his wrongdoings.

370
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,738
Li Ni may sound remorseful

371
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:04,498
in his letter.

372
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:05,739
But maybe

373
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,180
he still holds a grudge against you.

374
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,498
Since he has already admitted
his mistakes,

375
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:13,898
I think I should confer
the title of Worthy Consort

376
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,219
to his mother.

377
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,099
After all, you and Lai's mother

378
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,898
has the title of Empress.

379
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,699
Those ministers were right too.

380
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,819
I have only three sons.

381
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,138
But only his mother

382
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,819
is conferred the title
of Lady of Bright Deportment.

383
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,660
That's indeed inappropriate.

384
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,738
He wrote this letter of apology to you

385
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:35,658
at this time

386
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,459
just because he wants

387
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,380
to lead the army to Changzhou.

388
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:40,778
If you let him lead the army

389
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,418
as soon as he admits his mistakes,

390
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,898
he'll become even more overbearing.

391
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,618
If you do that,

392
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:49,819
he will neither fear
nor respect you in the future.

393
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,138
Don't worry.

394
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:53,780
Since asking him to reflect
on his mistakes is effective,

395
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:54,979
I'll let him

396
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,059
do that for a while longer.

397
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:01,780
Lieutenant He.

398
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,378
Lord Qin has been grounded

399
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:04,459
for so long.

400
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:05,099
Why are you

401
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,620
only visiting him now?

402
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:09,259
He wrote a letter to His Majesty

403
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,458
to confer the title
of Lady of Bright Deportment to his mother.

404
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,779
But after the Ministry of Rites
received the decree from His Majesty,

405
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,180
in the end, her mother is conferred
the title of Worthy Consort.

406
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,779
It is now a foregone conclusion.

407
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:23,539
Lord Qin has already given in.

408
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,938
Isn't that the end

409
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,539
of this matter?

410
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:30,380
It can settle a dispute.

411
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,140
But once heart is hurt,

412
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,060
it can't be healed that easily.

413
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,539
I have to pay him a visit.

414
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:45,762
(Lord Qin's Residence)

415
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:49,739
Lieutenant He.

416
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,499
It's not easy for us to sneak in.

417
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,138
But Lord Qin's Residence is huge.

418
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,820
Where will he be?

419
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:57,299
You have the whistle, right?

420
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,779
Hurry up and ask Ear to lead us the way.

421
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,180
You are right.

422
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,859
Taozi, Lieutenant He.

423
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,900
Why are you here?

424
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:18,859
Take her

425
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,898
to Lord Qin at once.

426
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,140
Okay. Come with me.

427
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:22,060
Let's go.

428
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,499
Bring me more liquor.

429
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:31,860
Bring me more liquor!

430
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,739
Just put it down.

431
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,779
You don't have to serve me.

432
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,219
Are you sure you don't want me
to pour you the liquor?

433
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,860
It's saddening to drink by yourself.

434
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,219
I'll drink with you.

435
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,060
Why are you here?

436
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,978
I'm here to see if you are enjoying

437
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:02,978
an extravagant life full of liquor

438
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:04,739
and beautiful ladies in your residence.

439
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,259
I'm not living an extravagant life.

440
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:11,380
But right now, I have

441
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,939
a beautiful lady by my side.

442
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,499
Shiqi.

443
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,779
Are you okay?

444
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
Not really.

445
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,340
My mother

446
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,459
died while giving birth to me.

447
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,100
Ever since

448
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,180
I came to this world,

449
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:51,978
I've never had the chance

450
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:53,140
to be filial to her.

451
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:55,939
She came from a humble origin.

452
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:58,259
She was just like a weed

453
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,860
in Lord Liang's Residence before this.

454
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:04,140
No one cared about her

455
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:05,820
and no one noticed her.

456
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:08,259
Even many years after her death,

457
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:11,739
she didn't even have a title.

458
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,380
On that court that day,

459
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:19,418
I wanted to fight for her to give her
a proper title even if it meant

460
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,059
I would lose my title as Lord Qin.

461
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,100
Even if...

462
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:25,580
Even if it was just an empty title.

463
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,019
But they refused to even give her

464
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:37,499
an empty title.

465
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,539
My father

466
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,620
refused to give her anything.

467
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:47,898
In the past, I knew

468
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:49,539
that my father didn't like me.

469
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,779
He blamed me for my mother's death.

470
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,819
I thought

471
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,898
that he actually cared a little bit

472
00:20:57,899 --> 00:20:59,340
about my mother.

473
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,019
But now, I realised

474
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:05,299
that he doesn't

475
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,620
care at all

476
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,699
about my mother's death.

477
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:13,539
He despises her humble origin.

478
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:15,299
She's no one to him.

479
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:16,979
Tell me.

480
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,779
Wasn't it pointless for my mother to die

481
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:22,499
giving birth to me?

482
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:31,539
She had suffered a lot

483
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,580
for me too.

484
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,099
According to the others,

485
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,060
she had taken so much medicine

486
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,459
that the residue could be piled up
as high as a small hill.

487
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,979
But when my mother was still alive,

488
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,820
she always told me

489
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,299
that the best thing

490
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,939
that she had done in this life

491
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:51,779
was giving birth to me.

492
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:55,088
Shiqi.

493
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:58,499
The saying about giving birth
to an evil child during an evil month

494
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,339
is utter nonsense

495
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,219
said by foolish people.

496
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:04,059
Your mother

497
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,939
had done so much to give life to you.

498
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:07,698
She wouldn't want

499
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:09,820
to see you blaming yourself like this.

500
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,739
She would want you

501
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,100
to live a free and easy life.

502
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,499
Free and easy.

503
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,580
Free and easy.

504
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:33,259
There's no such thing
as a free and easy life.

505
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,340
At first, I thought

506
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,259
that after reclaiming Xichang,

507
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,660
I could retire from this political war.

508
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:45,180
But now,

509
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:48,380
people are plotting

510
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:51,580
and conspiring

511
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,060
against each other in Xichang,

512
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,499
in this palace

513
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,459
and even in Lord Qin's Residence.

514
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,620
What about me?

515
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:10,100
I can't even achieve something so minor.

516
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,100
I can't even

517
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,420
get a proper title

518
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,380
for my mother.

519
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:29,978
I don't know

520
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:31,380
what else I can do.

521
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:35,939
I feel

522
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,580
so useless.

523
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,259
I feel like such a loser.

524
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,779
Actually, I'm really upset.

525
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,140
I feel so depressed about this.

526
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,620
I know.

527
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,060
Shiqi.

528
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,539
Actually,

529
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,699
I'm really envious of Great General Cui.

530
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:27,340
Why?

531
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,340
Because he can always be with you.

532
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,499
I'm here now, right?

533
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,539
But you are going to leave later.

534
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,420
Okay.

535
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:50,660
I promise you

536
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,820
that I won't leave later.

537
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,699
I won't leave tonight.

538
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:03,019
Really?

539
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:06,900
Yes.

540
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,341
Taozi!

541
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,659
You haven't seen me for so long,

542
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,219
why did you run off

543
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,020
earlier?

544
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:38,460
Because I...

545
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:40,700
Because I went to get you this.

546
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,581
What's this?

547
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:44,659
(Astragalus, angelica)
These are the herbs I gathered for you.

548
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,459
Look.

549
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,821
This is astragalus,

550
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,181
and then there's angelica,

551
00:25:48,821 --> 00:25:49,901
this is Chinese peony,

552
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:51,061
and these.

553
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:52,139
Some of these herbs

554
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,580
I bought at the medicine shop,

555
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:54,379
and some I dried myself

556
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,580
after picking them

557
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:56,740
on the mountain.

558
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,581
In fact,

559
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,020
every time I think of you,

560
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:03,861
I go to pick herbs.

561
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,500
Every time you miss me?

562
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,780
Let's see,

563
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,341
you've thought about me

564
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,740
one, two, four, six...

565
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:21,381
You've thought about me
more than 30 times.

566
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:27,141
Well,

567
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:29,700
next time, if you miss me,

568
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,500
you can come see me.

569
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:33,300
You can also write me a letter

570
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,260
like Lord Qin

571
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:36,740
and Lieutenant He do.

572
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:38,300
Really?

573
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,300
Of course.

574
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:44,101
So, Taozi,

575
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:47,061
have you missed me

576
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,700
all this while?

577
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,540
Guess.

578
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:59,580
I bet you have.

579
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:01,460
What makes you so sure?

580
00:27:02,061 --> 00:27:03,300
Because if you didn't miss me,

581
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:04,899
you wouldn't have asked me

582
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,740
to come see you,

583
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:08,979
and you wouldn't have asked me
to write you letters

584
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,460
like Mister Shiqi.

585
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:16,139
Right?

586
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,381
I knew it.

587
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,700
I guess you could say so.

00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,460
What time is it?

639
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:11,700
It's past noon.

640
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,141
I remember...

641
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,500
I remember I was drinking
in the pavilion last night,

642
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,300
and I got drunk.

643
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,861
And I had a beautiful dream.

644
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,940
What kind of dream?

645
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,181
A very,

646
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,300
very happy dream.

647
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,101
It felt so real.

648
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:44,780
You must have dreamt of Lieutenant He.

649
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:48,740
But there's no way she was here.

650
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,580
I think you've caught

651
00:31:50,581 --> 00:31:52,700
a serious case

652
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,341
of lovesickness.

653
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,540
You were drinking

654
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,780
by yourself last night.

655
00:31:57,781 --> 00:31:58,740
I wanted to drink with you,

656
00:31:58,741 --> 00:32:00,381
but you threw me out.

657
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,700
Right.

658
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,181
Lieutenant He, have some.

659
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:17,419
You eat it.

660
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,621
I don't have an appetite.

661
00:32:20,101 --> 00:32:21,421
Well, that's understandable.

662
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:23,500
You were up all night.

663
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,780
Shall we find an inn

664
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:26,699
in the town ahead

665
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,699
and rest for half a day

666
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,421
before continuing our journey?

667
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:30,780
No need.

668
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:31,820
I took a nap

669
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:33,020
last night.

670
00:32:35,861 --> 00:32:37,061
You've traveled

671
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,820
a long way,

672
00:32:38,821 --> 00:32:39,939
travelling day and night,

673
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,300
just to see Lord Qin,

674
00:32:41,341 --> 00:32:42,980
why didn't you stay longer?

675
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,419
Is it enough

676
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,260
just to talk to him

677
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:46,101
for a little bit?

678
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,740
As long as I see him,

679
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:52,141
I'm at ease.

680
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:54,581
If someone else finds out,

681
00:32:54,861 --> 00:32:56,621
there'll be a lot of complications.

682
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,700
I only wonder

683
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,861
how long it will take for him

684
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,700
to get over

685
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,101
his grief and guilt?

686
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:10,141
Either way, I still think

687
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,780
two lovers should always be

688
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,861
together forever.

689
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,181
Just talking for a while

690
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,500
is hardly enough.

691
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,459
I think someone

692
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,260
just wants to be with her Ear

693
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:24,581
for a long, long time.

694
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,661
Lieutenant He!

695
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,061
You don't say.

696
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,940
I've only been away from him for a while

697
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,661
and I miss him already.

698
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,421
What about you?

699
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:38,460
Do you miss Lord Qin?

700
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:43,300
Indeed,

701
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,621
not seeing each other for a day

702
00:33:47,021 --> 00:33:48,500
feels like months already.

703
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,780
That's right.

704
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,581
(Shiqi.)

705
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:09,780
(Shiqi.)

706
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,207
(Wolong)

707
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,541
Where have you been?

708
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,660
Taozi was here yesterday.

709
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:24,939
She said she wanted dried fruits,
so I bought some this morning.

710
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:26,810
I was just about to find someone
to deliver them to her.

711
00:34:27,701 --> 00:34:29,300
Taozi came yesterday?

712
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:29,899
Yes.

713
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,420
She came with Lieutenant He.

714
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:32,740
I wonder

715
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:33,981
where she is now

716
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:35,501

They left before dawn.

721
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,000
Lieutenant He said it wouldn't be good
if the imperial guardians saw them,

722
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,840
so they climbed over the wall
and left before sunrise.

723
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:57,181
I need to see her.

724
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:00,220

726
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,740
But His Majesty ordered you
to reflect in seclusion.

727

Isn't this defying his decree?

728
00:35:04,781 --> 00:35:05,499
So what if I am?

729
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,340

00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,941
before it turns dark.

747
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,939
This is an interesting place.

748
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,420
You give flowers with tea?

749
00:36:02,301 --> 00:36:03,380
Enjoy.

750
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,780
Lieutenant He, try it.

751
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,420
Smells great.

752
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,541
Why did you pour another cup of tea?

753
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:19,340
Are you still not coming out?

754
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:25,541
I'll make myself scarce.

755
00:36:29,661 --> 00:36:30,740
What are you doing here?

756
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:32,740
I came to see you.

757
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,420
Didn't you see enough last night?

758
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:39,660
I was too drunk

759
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:41,380
to see clearly last night.

760
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:42,740
You've had a long trip.

761
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,181
You came all this way to see me.

762
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:45,621
I appreciate it.

763
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:48,059
I'm happy to do it.

764
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,220
I don't find it an arduous task.

765
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,661
I'll be going to you

766
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:52,141
soon as well.

767
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,061
Aren't you worried

768
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,340
that your words will be misunderstood?

769
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,459
I thought you'd come with soldiers

770
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,740
to reclaim Luoyang.

771
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,019
My father has always wanted

772
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,099
to battle Lord Qin

773
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,820
on the battlefield.

774
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:05,620
Are you giving him

775
00:37:05,621 --> 00:37:06,780
the opportunity?

776
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,499
If he sends you as the vanguard,

777
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,820
then I'll most probably lose.

778
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,820
It might be a bit embarrassing

779
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,820
to be captured.

780
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:16,021
You must show me mercy.

781
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:18,700
Rest assured, Your Highness.

782
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:20,059
If you're truly in danger,

783
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,740
I will come to your aid.

784
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,021
Good.

785
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,260
I am grateful for your promise.

786
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,939
However, Lord Qin is truly

787
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,541
too valiant.

788
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:30,379
Please don't give me

789
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,380
such an opportunity.

790
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,260
I'll take your auspicious words.

791
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,499
Then

792
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,059
you'll always owe me a favour,

793
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,581
and you won't be able to repay it.

794
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:48,300
Li Ni is using a retreat as
a form of advancement.

795
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,860
He hypocritically submitted
a letter to Father,

796
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:52,379
expressing his wish
to have his birth mother

797
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,621
titled as  Lady of Bright Deportment.

798
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:54,939
However, Father, being benevolent,

799
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,181
bestowed the title of Worthy Consort
upon his mother.

800
00:37:57,741 --> 00:38:00,140
Li Ni isn't reflecting in seclusion.

801
00:38:00,141 --> 00:38:01,539
He's constantly scheming on how

802
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,501
to regain control of the Zhenxi Army!

803
00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:05,621
Jun,

804
00:38:05,781 --> 00:38:07,300
Father asked you to stay

805
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,099
and oversee the Mother's ceremony,

806
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,499
so he could only appoint you

807
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,419
as the commander-in-chief.

808
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,459
He let General Pei Yuan

809
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,220
lead the troops to Changzhou alone.

810
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:16,939
We need to be careful

811
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,101
of Li Ni's influence in Changzhou,

812
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:20,420
or even

813
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:22,740
taking over the Zhenxi Army.

814
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,860
Worry not.

815
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:28,539
As the commander-in-chief,

816
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,340
I won't let them have that chance.

817
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,621
On this mission to Changzhou, I only said
that the situation was critical.

818
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:35,059
I've instructed Pei Yuan

819
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,579
to lead 30% of the forces

820
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,820
and food supplies ahead.

821
00:38:37,821 --> 00:38:39,019
He must think

822
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,340
that there are
larger reinforcements coming.

823
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:44,340
He wishes.

824
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,660
Pei Yuan only follow Li Ni's orders,

825
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:48,300
doesn't he?

826
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:50,661
If this battle ends in a major defeat,

827
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,941
I'll see if Li Ni

828
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,461
can still protect him.

829
00:38:58,781 --> 00:38:59,780
Grand Governor,

830
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,400
you've recently recovered
from poisoning.

831
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,941
(Tong Pass)
You should rest.

832
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,499
Li Ni

833
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,101
is cunning.

834
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,939
I suspect he's planning to intercept

835
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,340
troops I sent to Baiyue which I'm recalling
in Changzhou.

836
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:16,380
News from the capital.

837
00:39:16,741 --> 00:39:17,700
Li Ni has been relieved

838
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:19,260
of his commander-in-chief position

839
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:20,700
and ordered to reflect in seclusion.

840
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:22,419
The court may dispatch
Lord Xin and Lord Qi

841
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,780
as commanders

842
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,021
to send troops southward.

843
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:30,260
A general's incompetence is a liability
to all three armies.

844
00:39:30,861 --> 00:39:31,899
With an incompetent ruler

845
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,181
like Lord Liang,

846
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,941
who imprisons Li Ni,

847
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:39,181
he's as good as cutting off his own arm.

848
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,420
Grand Governor!

849
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,220
Grand Governor, the ones sent to track
the great imperial grandson

850
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:46,140
have reported

851
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:48,099
that he seems to be hiding

852
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,780
in a village near Xichang.

853
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,541
Issue the order to capture
the great imperial grandson alive.

854
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:01,340
The others are to be executed
without mercy.

855
00:40:01,341 --> 00:40:01,981
Yes.

856
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:09,340
It's truly a timely opportunity.

857
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:10,939
Destiny is here,

858
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,541
and fortune favors me.

859
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:25,461
Pei Yuan

860
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,700
sent an urgent message,

861
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,220
stating that the expedition
against Baiyue has crossed

862
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,621
the Han River

863
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:36,380
and is heading straight for Changzhou.

864
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,620
He urges the court to provide
additional provisions for Changzhou

865
00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:42,981
and requests reinforcements
from the capital.

866
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:45,101
Father,

867
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:46,740
in my humble opinion,

868
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:49,260
the so-called expedition to Baiyue

869
00:40:49,261 --> 00:40:51,379
returning from afar must be exhausted.

870
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,979
Moreover, with the long march

871
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,660
and no food supplies on the way,

872
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,380
they are only a few
tens of thousands of people.

873
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,419
Pei Yuan, being from a military family

874
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,780
and leading troops for many years,

875
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,140
should be able

876
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:03,420
to handle the situation.

877
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:04,620
General Pei Yuan

878
00:41:04,621 --> 00:41:06,019
has requested aid from the court.

879
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,899
If the court ignores it,

880
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,899
it may upset the Pei family.

881
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Lai,

882
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,061
you are showing compassion like a woman.

883
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,979
The Pei family, powerful as they may be,

884
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,501
are still Father's subjects.

885
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,860
If we constantly appease them

886
00:41:18,861 --> 00:41:20,419
and grant their every request,

887
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,181
where does Father's authority stand?

888
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,780
But the court

889
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:26,541
has only allocated them
30% of military provisions.

890
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,941
It is indeed not much.

891
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,101
Father,

892
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,101
in the past,
when Li Ni led the Zhenxi Army,

893
00:41:35,141 --> 00:41:37,061
the court never provided food supplies.

894
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:39,900
Yet, the Zhenxi Army still marched

895
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,459
all the way from Laolan Pass,

896
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,380
reclaiming the two cities.

897
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,780
Now,

898
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:46,380
the Zhenxi Army has been deployed again

899
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,780
with 30% supplies.

900
00:41:49,261 --> 00:41:50,820
The so-called request for reinforcements

901
00:41:50,821 --> 00:41:51,780
is just an attempt

902
00:41:51,781 --> 00:41:53,099
to receive benefits
without contributing.

903
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,300
These are unspoken practices

904
00:41:54,301 --> 00:41:55,860
in the military.

905
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,780
Do not be deceived, Father.

906
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,099
You are the commander-in-chief.

907
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,820
How do you think

908
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,700
we should respond to Pei Yuan?

909
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:08,220
In my humble opinion,

910
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,981
the court must issue a command

911
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,941
instructing Pei Yuan not to delay

912
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:13,860
and immediately launch an attack
from Changzhou

913
00:42:13,861 --> 00:42:15,021
to annihilate

914
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:17,220
the Sun rebels leading
the expedition against Baiyue.

915
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,320
They're messing around
without any idea what they're doing!

916
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,960
Where are the reinforcements they promised
General Pei Yuan and the Zhenxi Army?

917
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,059
When it came time to march,

918
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,300
he was only given

919
00:42:28,301 --> 00:42:29,899
30% of the forces and food supplies.

920
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,820
Now, without providing provisions

921
00:42:31,821 --> 00:42:33,059
or reinforcements,

922
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,939
they even ordered us

923
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,740
to go out from Changzhou
to face the enemy!

924
00:42:35,741 --> 00:42:37,740
Isn't this just sending
our Zhenxi Army soldiers

925
00:42:37,741 --> 00:42:39,061
to their deaths?

926
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,501
Deliver this to Taozi.

927
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,220
We're already in this state,

928
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:45,501
and you're still writing to Lieutenant He?

929
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:47,539
The court refuses to send reinforcements

930
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,581
to support Changzhou.

931
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,600
Instead, they want Pei Yuan
to launch an attack.

932
00:42:50,741 --> 00:42:52,061
I can't leave the capital now.

933
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:54,300
The only option left is
to seek assistance from the Cui Army

934
00:42:54,301 --> 00:42:55,581
to support Changzhou.

935
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,541
I'll leave at once.

936
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,899
Mister Shiqi,

937
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,740
you want the Cui Army

938
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:03,260
to relieve Changzhou.

939
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:04,941
Is this going to work?

940
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,539
Well, I mentioned in the letter

941
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,300
that I'm trapped in Changzhou.

942
00:43:08,341 --> 00:43:10,021
She can't just abandon me, can she?

943
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,340
What are you looking at?

944
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,019
I'm looking

945
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,499
at the face of the world's

946
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,260
number one pretty boy.

947
00:43:26,261 --> 00:43:28,240
When the situation calls for it,
one must humble oneself.

948
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,260
A real man can adapt to circumstances.

949
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:33,099
If a letter

950
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,581
can save Changzhou,

951
00:43:35,261 --> 00:43:37,260
then you're certainly a pretty boy

952
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:39,581
with skills no one before has mastered
and no one after will.

953
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,300
I dare not accept such flattery.

954
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,661
Looking at this because you miss him?

955
00:43:56,781 --> 00:43:58,780
I don't think His Highness Lord Qin
did the right thing.

956
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,061
Why not?

957
00:44:01,261 --> 00:44:02,780
He must know

958
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:04,059
that you'll keep fiddling with it

959
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,820
whenever you have free time.

960
00:44:06,821 --> 00:44:08,019
Yet, he chooses to make the doll

961
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,981
out of straw.

962
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:10,180
What if it gets worn out

963
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:11,581
from all the handling
in just a few days?

964
00:44:11,701 --> 00:44:13,019
He should have carved one

965
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,780
out of wood.

966
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:16,141
That would have been more durable.

967
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,579
Xie Chang'er thought ahead.

968
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,979
He wouldn't have come up

969
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,520
with the idea of making you
a whistle otherwise.

970
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,061
After all, that never breaks.

971
00:44:24,181 --> 00:44:25,019
Looking at it this way,

972
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,181
Lord Qin was indeed

973
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,860
not thoughtful enough.

974
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,300
Lieutenant He!

975
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,820
Lieutenant He!

976
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:34,620
Speak of the devil

977
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:35,700
and he shall show up.

978
00:44:36,221 --> 00:44:37,560
An urgent letter from Mister Shiqi.

979
00:44:44,613 --> 00:44:46,035
(Changzhou is in great danger. There'll
be no reinforcements from the court.)

980
00:44:46,036 --> 00:44:47,777
(I can only ask you to save us
from the predicament.)

981
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,181
Your Majesty!

982
00:44:51,741 --> 00:44:52,419
Your Majesty!

983
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,459
Urgent report from Changzhou!

984
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,581
What's the situation?

985
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:56,140
General Pei Yuan launched an attack.

986
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,260
But after struggling for two days,

987
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,499
they were was outnumbered
and besieged by Sun rebels.

988
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,180
The Zhenxi Army was almost wiped out,

989
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:03,019
and General Pei Yuan
has been severely wounded.

990
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,501
What about Changzhou City?

991
00:45:04,821 --> 00:45:06,340
General Pingliang Cui Yi

992
00:45:06,341 --> 00:45:07,539
arrived with the Cui Army

993
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,220
and successfully eliminated
the Sun rebels.

994
00:45:09,221 --> 00:45:10,800
General Pei Yuan took the opportunity

995
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,410
to lead the remaining Zhenxi Army
across the river

996
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,160
and set up camp about a hundred li
from Changzhou.

997
00:45:14,621 --> 00:45:16,059
But...

998
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,780
Cui Yi and the Cui Army

999
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,140
entered Changzhou City.

1000
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:19,899
What?

1001
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,661
Cui Yi has taken Changzhou City?

1002
00:45:21,741 --> 00:45:22,700
Father,

1003
00:45:22,701 --> 00:45:24,459
Changzhou is a crucial
military stronghold.

1004
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,740
Whether it falls into Sun Jing's hands

1005
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:26,820
or Cui Yi's,

1006
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:29,021
it will be greatly disadvantageous for us.

1007
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,061
Father,

1008
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,579
Pei Yuan lost Changzhou City.

1009
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,101
He deserves severe punishment
for his crime!

1010
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,340
Jun,

1011
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,860
now is not the time
to discuss blame and punishments.

1012
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,220
Changzhou was lost
under Pei Yuan's command.

1013
00:45:39,221 --> 00:45:40,780
Why can't we hold him accountable?

1014
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,300
Father refused
General Pei Yuan's request

1015
00:45:43,301 --> 00:45:44,780
for reinforcements.

1016
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:46,499
Great General Pei Xian personally
came to the palace,

1017
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,099
and pleaded Father
to send reinforcements

1018
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,021
to the Zhenxi Army.

1019
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,900
But, Jun, you said

1020
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:54,019
General Pei Yuan was afraid of battle

1021
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,220
and intentionally avoiding it.

1022
00:45:55,221 --> 00:45:57,740
Then, three imperial edicts
were sent to Changzhou,

1023
00:45:57,741 --> 00:45:58,939
forcing him to engage in battle.

1024
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,099
Now that Changzhou is lost,

1025
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,019
if we try to blame

1026
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,419
General Pei Yuan for it,

1027
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,461
I'm afraid

1028
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,220
the Pei family will not stand for it.

1029
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,180
Do something!

1030
00:46:12,181 --> 00:46:13,459
That wretch Cui Yi!

1031
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,579
He seized Dongdu last time,

1032
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,939
and now he's taken Changzhou!

1033
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,220
If this continues,

1034
00:46:17,301 --> 00:46:19,300
what's the point of me being the Emperor?

1035
00:46:19,301 --> 00:46:21,021
How can I face the world?

1036
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:22,220
Father,

1037
00:46:22,221 --> 00:46:24,180
there's someone I'd like to recommend.

1038
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:24,899
If this person

1039
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,099
leads the troops,

1040
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,501
they can surely recapture Changzhou.

1041
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:29,059
Who?

1042
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,860
Li Ni.

1043
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,900
Absolutely not!

1044
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,180
Li Ni has been ordered
to reflect in seclusion.

1045
00:46:34,181 --> 00:46:35,300
How can he lead troops?

1046
00:46:35,301 --> 00:46:37,019
He has been skilled in warfare
since he was a child.

1047
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,539
He's fought with Sun Jing

1048
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,899
and the Cui Army
and has never lost a battle.

1049
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,499
Besides, he is the only one

1050
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,660
who has always had close ties

1051
00:46:43,661 --> 00:46:44,700
with the Pei family.

1052
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,939
If we let Ni lead the troops

1053
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,220
to Changzhou,

1054
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,499
he may be able to dispel the discontent
of the Pei family

1055
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,661
and revive the army's spirit.

1056
00:46:53,781 --> 00:46:55,499
Li Ni is arrogant and reckless.

1057
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,461
Should his previous insubordination

1058
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,220
be overlooked just so?

1059
00:46:59,661 --> 00:47:01,539
Who else can lead the troops

1060
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,941
in this situation?

1061
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,059
Will you personally

1062
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,260
lead the expedition, Jun?

1063
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:08,379
You are Father's eldest legitimate son.

1064
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,019
Even if Father approves,

1065
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,140
the court and the ministers

1066
00:47:11,141 --> 00:47:12,220
would never allow you

1067
00:47:12,221 --> 00:47:14,220
to expose yourself to such danger.

1068
00:47:15,781 --> 00:47:17,099
Enough.

1069
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,340
Lai makes a valid point.

1070
00:47:19,621 --> 00:47:20,981
Issue the decree.

1071
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,420
Lord Qin has reflected upon his actions.

1072
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,181
His punishment shall be lifted.

1073
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:30,541
He will lead the troops
to reinforce Changzhou at once.

1074
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:31,621
Yes.
