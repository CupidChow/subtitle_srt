00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:49,107

Bao

119
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:37,347
fought alongside me for years.

through

122
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:47,947
thick and thin

123
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:52,107
and he had been fine.

124
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:54,906
He always said,

125
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:58,107
"We're veterans,

126
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:00,067
God won't receive us."

127
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:04,587
God...

128
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:13,746
God won't receive us.

129
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:19,827

130
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,067
I know.

Shiqi.

132
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:29,707
When I joined the army at 13,

133
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,427
it was Bao who taught me

134
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,506
how to find water in the desert,

135
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:42,626
how to survive in desperate situations,

136
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,227
how to roast worms,

137
00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:52,947
and how to be a good scout.

138
00:12:54,427 --> 00:12:55,347
He used to say...

139
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:00,506
He used to say

140
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:04,707
I was a once-in-a-century talent.

141
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:07,906
He also used to say...

142
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:13,467
He said...

143
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,347
He said it's a pity

144
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:19,626
I'm in imperial family,

145
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:23,746
so I can't use all the skills

146
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:26,746
I've learned.

147
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:31,746
I said...

148
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:34,906
I said, "Why can't I use them?"

149
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:39,067
We've promised

150
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,746
to retire

151
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:46,146
at the age of 70.

152
00:13:50,386 --> 00:13:51,786
We've promised.

153
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,947
We've promised.

154
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:08,307
Shiqi.

155
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:15,467
I'm really sad.

156
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:18,986
They...

157
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:20,266
He...

158
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:24,587
Why are they all dead?

159
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:34,187
Shiqi,

160
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:36,146
enough,

161
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:38,266
stop talking.

162
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,506
I know everything

163
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:43,107
you're trying to say.

164
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,227
But you're really

165
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:49,266
badly injured this time.

166
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:52,026
Luckily, I was able

167
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:53,547
to see you in time.

168
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:56,107
Shiqi,

169
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,707
you've lost a lot of blood.

170
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:02,107
I was trying to stop the bleeding

171
00:15:02,307 --> 00:15:04,347
by holding on to you.

172
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:06,947
I refused to let go no matter how much

173
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:09,107
my father tried to persuade me

174
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:12,266
because I was afraid that if I let go,

175
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:15,666
you'd really die.

176
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:26,866
These days, I'm worried about

177
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,506
what I'll do

178
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:34,026
if you can't hang on any longer.

179
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:35,666
Luckily, you're fine.

180
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:37,986
Otherwise,

181
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:40,187
I'd be just as worried

182
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:43,547
as Young Lady, just wanting to

183
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:45,467
stay by your side every day.

184
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,067
But Bao and the others are dead.

185
00:16:58,427 --> 00:16:59,866
I regret it so much.

186
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:04,987
If I had run a little faster,

187
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:08,666
a little quicker,

188
00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:13,186
they wouldn't be dead.

189
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,587
They wouldn't be dead.

190
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:20,906
They wouldn't be dead!

191
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,186
Don't be like this.

192
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:23,027
Stop it.

193
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:25,307
Enough.

194
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:26,027
It's all my fault.

195
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:26,666
Enough.

196
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:29,547
It's not your fault.

197
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:31,507
It's not your fault.

198
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:32,680
Don't be like this.

199
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:36,107
You and Lord Qin

200
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:37,906
risked your lives

201
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:39,307
to save them.

202
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:45,226
It's really not your fault.

203
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:46,426
Really.

204
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:52,186
It's not your fault.

205
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:55,027
It's not your fault.

206
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:30,088
(Lord Qin's Residence)

207
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:18,666
Young Lady.

208
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:19,666
Young Lady.

209
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:23,386
Lord Qin has gone missing.

210
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:01,386
(Huang.)

211
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,547
We're not good at anything else,

212
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,507
but we're good at

213
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:06,547
causing a scene.

214
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:26,347
(Youde.)

215
00:22:28,706 --> 00:22:29,347
My buddy.

216
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:47,107
(Youren.)

217
00:22:48,226 --> 00:22:49,027
(Youdao.)

218
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:18,267
Here you go.

219
00:23:24,787 --> 00:23:25,587
(Mister Shiqi,)

220
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:28,666
we've discussed that when we're old,
we won't go to war anymore.

221
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:29,587
We'll all

222
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:31,747
go back to Sanlichong from Laolan Pass.

223
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,946
Come and visit us

224
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:34,146
when you're free.

225
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,650
- Come and visit us!
- Come and visit us!

226
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,226
Okay, promise!

227
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:39,747
- Promise!
- Promise!

228
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:41,426
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

You know

243
00:26:22,866 --> 00:26:25,067
I didn't believe in gods and goddesses

244
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,226
and I never made wishes.

245
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:33,466
But in those days,

246
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:38,267
when you were unconscious,

247
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:40,067
the imperial physician said

248
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,226
you were hurt too badly

249
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:44,547
and might not wake up again,

250
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:47,866
at that time,

251
00:26:50,866 --> 00:26:51,987
I wanted to go to

252
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,747
all the gods and goddesses in the world

253
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:56,666
and sincerely make a wish.

254
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,466
You once said

255
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:02,946
your nanny told you

256
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:06,666
that if you had a wish,

257
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:09,587
you could release a bamboo dragonfly.

258
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:13,666
When the bamboo dragonfly
falls to the ground,

259
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:17,426
your wish will come true.

260
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:23,747
I made these dragonflies

261
00:27:23,747 --> 00:27:27,747
when you were unconscious.

262
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:34,426
Shiqi,

263
00:27:35,426 --> 00:27:36,906
you once told me

264
00:27:38,307 --> 00:27:39,347
you'd do

265
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:42,507
anything stupid for me.

266
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:45,906
Me too.

267
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:48,547
I'd do

268
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:51,307
anything stupid

269
00:27:52,226 --> 00:27:53,666
for you.

270
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:02,386
I know you're sad.

271
00:28:04,747 --> 00:28:09,426
But we have to live well,

272
00:28:10,386 --> 00:28:11,426
live on,

273
00:28:12,946 --> 00:28:15,146
to know the reason for their deaths.

274
00:28:16,386 --> 00:28:17,666
Only by staying alive

275
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:19,827
is there hope

276
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:23,027
that we can save more people.

277
00:28:26,186 --> 00:28:27,107
So...

278
00:29:04,946 --> 00:29:06,866
Why does my whole body hurt?

279
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,426
His Majesty's body is fine,

280
00:29:08,507 --> 00:29:10,466
but his mind is troubled.

281
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,780
- We'll take our leave now.
- We'll take our leave now.

282
00:29:24,906 --> 00:29:26,186
I'm feeling sick.

283
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:29,347
I'm in pain.

284
00:29:29,426 --> 00:29:30,107
Your Majesty,

285
00:29:30,426 --> 00:29:32,426
the imperial physician
just checked your pulse

286
00:29:32,587 --> 00:29:34,186
and said you're fine.

287
00:29:34,347 --> 00:29:35,267
But

288
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:37,226
I still feel

289
00:29:37,307 --> 00:29:39,787
pain all over my body,

290
00:29:40,706 --> 00:29:42,626
and when I close my eyes,

291
00:29:42,987 --> 00:29:45,666
I feel like an assassin is coming out.

292
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:49,827
I couldn't sleep all night.

293
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,386
I had to keep the light on.

294
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:53,827
Your Majesty,

295
00:29:53,987 --> 00:29:56,347
you've suffered such a shock.

296
00:29:57,027 --> 00:29:58,466
If you were a normal person,

297
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,906
you'd be scared out of your wits.

298
00:29:59,987 --> 00:30:01,987
You're only slightly ill,

299
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,747
you've already achieved

300
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:05,466
a level of composure.

301
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:10,226
Prime Minister Gu's right.

302
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:11,626
But...

303
00:30:12,307 --> 00:30:15,507
But I'm in a lot of pain.

304
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:18,186
When will I

305
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:19,547
get better?

306
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:20,426
Your Majesty,

307
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:22,226
since you're not well,

308
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:25,027
you may make Lord Qin the crown prince,

309
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:27,547
and he'll oversee the political affairs.

310
00:30:29,186 --> 00:30:31,666
Lord Qin is badly injured, isn't he?

311
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:32,267
And...

312
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,827
And he's still recovering
from his wounds.

313
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:36,386
Your Majesty,

314
00:30:37,027 --> 00:30:38,226
Lord Qin is still young.

315
00:30:38,347 --> 00:30:39,827
Even if he's badly injured,

316
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:41,626
he'll be fine in a few days.

317
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,587
Your Majesty, your health is paramount.

318
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:45,347
If you don't get well soon,

319
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,146
it's a matter of great importance
to the country.

320
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:53,827
Lord Xin and Lord Qi were good kids.

321
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:57,392
I didn't expect them to be used
by Jieshuo people.

322
00:30:58,386 --> 00:31:01,307
I've heard that Jieshuo people
are good with poison.

323
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,067
They must have

324
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:06,267
drugged Lord Xin and Lord Qi,

325
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:08,267
that's why they

326
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:10,507
had completely changed.

327
00:31:10,987 --> 00:31:11,666
Your Majesty,

328
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,626
Lord Xin and Lord Qi had committed
the crime of assassinating the emperor.

329
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:15,787
They couldn't be pardoned.

330
00:31:15,866 --> 00:31:16,866
According to the law,

331
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:19,386
they deserved the capital punishment
for their heinous crimes.

332
00:31:19,787 --> 00:31:22,186
But you, Your Majesty,
have been kind enough

333
00:31:22,426 --> 00:31:24,067
to bury them

334
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:25,107
as princes

335
00:31:25,107 --> 00:31:26,626
and pardon their families.

336
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:27,507
Enough.

337
00:31:27,547 --> 00:31:28,466
I know.

338
00:31:29,507 --> 00:31:30,547
Your Majesty,

339
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,507
Great General Cui has returned
to the capital

340
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:33,946
with the captives of Jieshuo.

341
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,067
Why don't we ask Lord Qin to
offer the captives at the temple

342
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:37,666
on behalf of you, Your Majesty?

343
00:31:37,906 --> 00:31:39,226
I just don't want to see

344
00:31:39,226 --> 00:31:40,666
these Jieshuo people.

345
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:42,267
When I think of them,

346
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:47,267
I think of Lai.

347
00:31:51,507 --> 00:31:52,386
Well,

348
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:55,747
I'll order the Ministry of Rites

349
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:58,426
to prepare for
the crown prince coronation.

350
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,307
Your Majesty,

351
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,800
there's one more thing I'd like
to ask for your approval on.

352
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,067
After the victory at Baishui Pass,

353
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:05,827
the Cui Army withdrew to Yingzhou.

354
00:32:05,827 --> 00:32:07,027
We spent tens of thousands

355
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:08,466
on military expenses.

356
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,827
Look, the Ministry of War is really...

357
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,507
I have a bad headache.

358
00:32:16,706 --> 00:32:17,507
Well...

359
00:32:17,787 --> 00:32:18,987
This...

360
00:32:19,027 --> 00:32:20,866
Ask the crown prince

361
00:32:21,027 --> 00:32:22,267
about all these messy things.

362
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:23,507
But Your Majesty,

363
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:26,307
there's one more thing you must decide.

364
00:32:26,547 --> 00:32:29,347
The Cui Army saved your life.

365
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:31,146
How will you reward them?

366
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:33,827
How else can I reward them?

367
00:32:34,146 --> 00:32:35,466
Cui Lin

368
00:32:35,466 --> 00:32:37,626
will soon be made the crown princess.

369
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,226
And Cui Yi

370
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:42,107
is already a double great general.

371
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:44,866
How can I still promote him?

372
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:46,706
How else can I reward him?

373
00:32:46,946 --> 00:32:47,706
Your Majesty,

374
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,386
I was about to suggest

375
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:51,426
that Lord Qin could be the crown prince,

376
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:52,347
but Cui Lin

377
00:32:52,466 --> 00:32:54,466
must not be the crown princess.

378
00:32:57,666 --> 00:32:58,426
Isn't Cui Yi

379
00:32:58,426 --> 00:33:00,226
going to choose one of the princes

380
00:33:00,226 --> 00:33:01,747
to be his son-in-law?

381
00:33:01,906 --> 00:33:02,706
Your Majesty,

382
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:04,866
times have changed.

383
00:33:04,987 --> 00:33:05,747
Back then,

384
00:33:05,747 --> 00:33:06,666
Sun Jing had just died,

385
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:08,107
the country was still unsettled,

386
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:09,810
and you hadn't appointed
the crown prince.

387
00:33:09,827 --> 00:33:11,027
The Cui family was powerful

388
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:12,226
and occupied Luoyang,

389
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:14,490
so they could have followed
Sun Jing's footsteps at any time.

390
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:15,146
That's why

391
00:33:15,146 --> 00:33:16,547
he dared to request

392
00:33:16,547 --> 00:33:18,466
to choose a prince as his son-in-law.

393
00:33:18,466 --> 00:33:19,267
But Your Majesty,

394
00:33:19,426 --> 00:33:20,906
you never said yes.

395
00:33:20,906 --> 00:33:23,027
You just kept it vague.

396
00:33:25,747 --> 00:33:27,027
Prime Minister Gu's right.

397
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:29,386
I never promised him anything.

398
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:32,507
Does he think I have to comply with him

399
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:34,232
just because he wrote a request?

400
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:36,347
But Your Majesty,

401
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:38,267
I'm afraid there's
something wrong with that.

402
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:40,507
His Majesty knew what was going on.

403
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:42,267
That's why he kept it so vague that day.

404
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:43,146
What's wrong with it?

405
00:33:43,347 --> 00:33:44,186
Cui Lin

406
00:33:44,186 --> 00:33:46,426
must not be the crown princess.

407
00:33:46,706 --> 00:33:47,906
Generals are all domineering.

408
00:33:48,107 --> 00:33:49,946
Cui Yi is arrogant

409
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,067
and overbearing.

410
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:52,987
Besides, the entire Cui Army

411
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:54,507
is loyal to him.

412
00:33:54,626 --> 00:33:55,866
If he becomes a royalty,

413
00:33:55,987 --> 00:33:57,946
it'll be difficult
to keep him in check.

414
00:33:57,946 --> 00:33:59,666
Do you want to nurture

415
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:00,587
another Sun Jing?

416
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,386
Prime Minister Gu...

417
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:03,027
Prime Minister Gu's right.

418
00:34:03,146 --> 00:34:04,466
Cui Lin

419
00:34:04,787 --> 00:34:06,987
must not be the crown princess.

420
00:34:07,107 --> 00:34:08,146
But Your Majesty,

421
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:11,547
the crown prince
is deeply in love with Cui Lin.

422
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:12,306
The crown prince may...

423
00:34:12,306 --> 00:34:14,067
Li Ni hasn't become
the crown prince yet.

424
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:15,186
Besides,

425
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:16,867
even if he's the crown prince,

426
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:18,706
can he disrespect his father

427
00:34:18,826 --> 00:34:20,146
and disobey orders?

428
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:23,746
Even common people's marriages

429
00:34:24,346 --> 00:34:26,587
are decided by parents

430
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:28,186
and matchmakers.

431
00:34:29,626 --> 00:34:31,987
Since I'm the one who
makes him the crown prince,

432
00:34:32,107 --> 00:34:33,786
I have a say in the choice

433
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:37,947
of the crown princess, don't I?

434
00:34:40,226 --> 00:34:41,626
Your Majesty, please calm down.

435
00:34:42,587 --> 00:34:45,666
Great General Pei was just making a guess.

436
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,626
In fact, the crown prince may not

437
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:49,587
insist on marrying Cui Lin.

438
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:51,306
Your Majesty's right.

439
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,427
The crown prince

440
00:34:52,427 --> 00:34:54,706
should take Your Majesty's
concerns at heart,

441
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:55,786
consider the big picture

442
00:34:55,786 --> 00:34:56,947
for the sake of the people.

443
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:59,027
Doesn't the chosen crown prince

444
00:34:59,186 --> 00:35:03,346
have that kind of temperament?

445
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:24,146
Young Lady,

446
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:26,507
I can't see Lord Qin today.

447
00:35:27,107 --> 00:35:28,587
Yesterday when I went there,

448
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:29,706
General Pei Yuan said

449
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:31,306
that Lord Qin had woken up

450
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:32,547
and accepted the things

451
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,090
I sent on your behalf
in a polite manner.

452
00:35:34,107 --> 00:35:34,947
I thought

453
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:36,027
I could see

454
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:37,306
Lord Qin today,

455
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,786
but I didn't expect
that I couldn't even see General Pei Yuan.

456
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:41,107
They just sent a servant

457
00:35:41,107 --> 00:35:42,107
to put me off

458
00:35:42,346 --> 00:35:43,907
and refused to accept the things.

459
00:35:44,027 --> 00:35:46,110
They said there is no one
in charge in the residence.

460
00:35:46,507 --> 00:35:48,547
It doesn't matter.

461
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:51,146
Lord Qin has just woken up

462
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:52,387
from serious injuries,

463
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,720
so it's understandable that
he doesn't want to see outsiders.

464
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:57,666
How can I be considered an outsider?

465
00:35:58,027 --> 00:35:59,900
I used to accompany you
to Lord Qin's Residence

466
00:35:59,987 --> 00:36:01,907
when Nanny was still around.

467
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:03,987
Nobody ever treated us as outsiders.

468
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:05,186
Besides,

469
00:36:05,427 --> 00:36:08,867
Miss Cui has never been out
since she entered Lord Qin's Residence,

470
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:10,867
and she stays with him day and night.

471
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:13,346
How come we're outsiders now?

472
00:36:16,027 --> 00:36:17,947
Lord Qin is not the same as before.

473
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,810
We used to be able to go in
and out of Lord Qin's Residence

474
00:36:20,826 --> 00:36:22,266
because Lord Qin was grateful to me

475
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,146
for helping him to find his nanny.

476
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:26,706
Now that Nanny's gone,

477
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:30,027
it's normal
that we can't see him as we wish.

478
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:31,867
How come

479
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:33,706
Lord Qin isn't the same as before?

480
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:36,346
Lord Xin and Lord Qi
rebelled against the emperor.

481
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:39,706
Lord Qin was seriously injured
protecting His Majesty.

482
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:43,067
Of His Majesty's three sons,

483
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:44,907
only one remains.

484
00:36:45,826 --> 00:36:46,706
Do you think

485
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:49,507
Lord Qin can still be the same as before?

486
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:52,507
Young Lady, so you're going
to be the crown princess?

487
00:36:53,226 --> 00:36:53,987
Qiucui,

488
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:56,706
people can't get carried away
when they're overjoyed.

489
00:36:57,107 --> 00:36:59,387
For what you just said
by being carried away,

490
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,510
you ought to be punished with
10 strokes on your hand.

491
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:03,067
You must remember

492
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,370
not to make such boastful remarks
in the future.

493
00:37:06,427 --> 00:37:07,346
Yes.

494
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:36,746
Shiqi,

495
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:38,626
it's getting cold.

496
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:41,067
Let me make you a coat.

497
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,867
There are so many clothes in my residence.

498
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:49,387
You always said

499
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,306
I've never made you anything

500
00:37:52,427 --> 00:37:53,387
so

501
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:55,947
I want to make you one myself.

502
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:00,626
Come on.

503
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,027
Let me measure your size.

504
00:38:16,146 --> 00:38:17,346
Let me take a look.

505
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,107
You've lost weight lately.

506
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,186
How do you know I've lost weight

507
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,810
if you've never measured me before?

508
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,146
I've hugged you before,

509
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:56,867
so I know you've lost weight.

510
00:38:57,907 --> 00:38:59,587
You've never hugged me before.

511
00:39:00,587 --> 00:39:02,226
I'm the one who hugged you.

512
00:39:09,987 --> 00:39:11,387
I'm hugging you now.

513
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:28,746
Let me do a trick for you, okay?

514
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:32,346
Okay.

515
00:39:33,626 --> 00:39:34,306
Look.

516
00:39:37,346 --> 00:39:39,346
Tuck it in my hand.

517
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:40,146
Tuck.

518
00:39:40,507 --> 00:39:41,226
Tuck.

519
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:42,107
Tuck.

520
00:39:42,387 --> 00:39:43,467
It's all in there.

521
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:46,226
Blow on it.

522
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:52,427
Look.

523
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:58,266
Blow on it again.

524
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:01,467
Look.

525
00:40:02,706 --> 00:40:03,467
It's gone.

526
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:05,306
Look at

527
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:07,907
what's on your left sleeve.

528
00:40:17,786 --> 00:40:18,826
Nothing?

529
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:24,226
Feel your sleeve.

530
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:25,306
Right side.

531
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:26,907
