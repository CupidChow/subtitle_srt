29
00:01:43,698 --> 00:01:44,218
Taozi,

30
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,010
your idea is really unique,
like something out of the past.

31
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,817
It's like how ancient people used
to cook meat in a ding

32
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:51,457
and chrysanthemum

33
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,218
to remove the gaminess and greasiness.

34
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:54,578
Yes,

35
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:56,858
there's a fire under this pot.

36
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:59,138
When cooking the meat,
you must swish it like this.

37
00:01:59,257 --> 00:01:59,978
That way,

38
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:01,457
the meat won't get overcooked.

39
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:15,457
Young Lady,

40
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:17,138
you should eat more today.

41
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:18,777
Lately, you haven't been eating well,

42
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:20,098
and you've lost a lot of weight.

43
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:22,098
You should eat more too.

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,760
Come on.
The meat on this side is all cooked.

45
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:24,258
Eat up.

46
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:28,232
(Chengluan Hall)

47
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:33,098
Mister Shiqi,

48
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:34,017
it's too cold.

49
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:35,177
Why don't we go back?

50
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:37,457
I already told her

51
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,570
that I was going to have dinner
at Lady Gu's place,

52
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:41,017
and she acted like

53
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:42,138
she didn't care at all.

54
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:44,017
Do you think

55
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:46,258
I should wait a bit before going back?

56
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:48,538
Mister Shiqi,

57
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:49,818
I don't understand.

58
00:02:50,057 --> 00:02:51,177
You said Her Highness

59
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:52,538
seemed indifferent.

60
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:54,698
So why are you still

61
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:56,057
pacing back and forth here?

62
00:02:57,457 --> 00:02:59,378
I really don't understand
why Taozi likes you.

63
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:02,177
She says she likes

64
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:03,337
that I'm silly.

65
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:04,617
True.

66
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:05,658
She's right.

67
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,418
Different strokes for different folks.

68
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:08,177
A fool you are.

69
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:09,617
It's true that fools are lucky.

70
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:11,457
It's my good fortune

71
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:13,418
that Taozi likes me.

72
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:15,658
Mister Shiqi,

73
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,870
you're really not going back?

74
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:17,897
Not going back.

75
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:19,858
Well, if you're not going back,

76
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,080
then I'll head back first.

77
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,457
Taozi told me

78
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:24,737
she made a new dish today

79
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:26,138
and asked me to have it with her.

80
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:28,378
Go on.

81
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:30,497
Wait.

82
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:33,578
They all know

83
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:35,698
you went with me to see Lady Gu.

84
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:36,937
If you go back now,

85
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:37,937
they'll find out

86
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:39,457
I left Lady Gu's place early.

87
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:41,457
Then, I'll have been out in the cold

88
00:03:41,737 --> 00:03:43,578
for half the night for naught.

89
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:45,418
That's right.

90
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:46,538
Mister Shiqi,

91
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:47,737
you're thoughtful.

92
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:56,274
(Chengluan Hall)

93
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:04,497
Your Highness.

94
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:08,177
Go get me a pair of chopsticks.

95
00:04:09,497 --> 00:04:10,177
Don't go.

96
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:13,750
Weren't you supposed

97
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:14,897
to have dinner with Lady Gu?

98
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:15,777
Well?

99
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,218
Did Lady Gu let Your Highness

100
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,697
leave hungry?

101
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,338
This won't do.

102
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,057
Taozi,

103
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:25,098
summon Lady Gu.

104
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:26,778
I want to ask her

105
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:29,137
how she's taking care of His Highness.

106
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,137
Yes.

107
00:04:30,257 --> 00:04:30,898
No, don't go.

108
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:33,057
Taozi, leave.

109
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,090
Chang'er is waiting for you
in the side hall.

110
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:37,458
Yes.

111
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,137
Your Highness, what's the matter?

112
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:56,018
If Lady Gu hasn't attended
to Your Highness properly,

113
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:57,458
can't I ask about it?

114
00:04:57,858 --> 00:04:59,937
I also want to know why you're upset.

115
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,538
Is it because I had dinner

116
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:02,898
at Lady Gu's place,

117
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,778
or is it because I came back too late?

118
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,458
Upset?

119
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:07,898
Your Highness,

120
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:09,218
why would you think I'm upset?

121
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,418
If you're not upset,

122
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:12,257
why bother Lady Gu

123
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:13,697
and summon her to ask questions?

124
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,470
Your Highness, perhaps you've forgotten.

125
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:18,098
I am the crown princess.

126
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,697
If the lady isn't taking care

127
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,778
of Your Highness properly in Eastern Palace,

128
00:05:22,018 --> 00:05:24,298
it's only natural for the crown princess,
to inquire.

129
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:26,298
As the saying goes,

130
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,858
"Be a monk for a day,
strike the bell for a day."

131
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:30,057
Now that I am

132
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:31,898
the crown princess,

133
00:05:33,177 --> 00:05:34,858
I must fulfill my duties faithfully.

134
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,550
Your Highness, you were

135
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,310
reluctant to become
the crown prince before,

136
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:40,577
but now you're doing well, aren't you?

137
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:42,658
As the crown prince,

138
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,450
you planned the disbandment
of the Cui Army

139
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:45,858
for the imperial court,

140
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:49,858
turning my father

141
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:51,937
from a commander

142
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,057
into a feeble old man.

143
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,778
All to eliminate the imperial court's fears

144
00:05:57,937 --> 00:05:59,937
of an overpowered regional governor.

145
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:01,998
Ying,

146
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:07,177
I had no other choice.

147
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:09,978
You can go back now.

148
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:11,137
I need to rest.

149
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:12,697
Where will I go?

150
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:14,177
This is Chengluan Hall.

151
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,617
As you said,

152
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,870
"Be a monk for a day,
strike the bell for a day."

153
00:06:18,737 --> 00:06:19,858
You are the crown princess.

154
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:21,497
You should fulfill your duties.

155
00:06:22,898 --> 00:06:24,538
Your Highness, you have your own chambers.

156
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,617
You only spent a few nights
on the floor here

157
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:28,418
during our early marriage

158
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:29,617
just for show.

159
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:31,057
No need for that now.

160
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:32,610
Your Highness can't sleep well,

161
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:33,697
and neither can I.

162
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:37,377
Are you trying to drive me away?

163
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:39,898
Yes,

164
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:41,978
I am.

165
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:44,257
I won't.

166
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:47,737
I'm not going anywhere.

167
00:06:48,177 --> 00:06:49,400
I intend to sleep here tonight.

168
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:56,497
Your Highness

169
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:57,898
will leave one way or another.

170
00:06:58,177 --> 00:06:58,858
I don't want

171
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:00,177
another sleepless night.

172
00:07:19,737 --> 00:07:20,778
This again?

173
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,257

00:09:28,816 --> 00:09:33,147
♪No regrets in this lifetime♪

190
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:34,618
Your Highness is up.

191
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:38,697
Last night,

192
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:42,298
we…

193
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:45,577
Your Highness need not worry about it.

194
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:48,498
It was just a minor thing.

195
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:50,138
A minor thing?

196
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:57,898
Let me be frank with Your Highness.

197
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:01,378
There's really no need
to be concerned.

198
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:04,018
Once I become pregnant,

199
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:06,018
I'll kill you

200
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,870
and let my son ascend to the throne.

201
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:08,857
Then,

202
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:10,577
I'll be the empress dowager.

203
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:16,577
What?

204
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:18,177
Your Highness

205
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:19,898
feels deceived again?

206
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:23,857
But you didn't lose anything.

207
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:55,937
Your Highness.

208
00:11:00,498 --> 00:11:01,138
Your Highness?

209
00:11:04,057 --> 00:11:04,697
You're here.

210
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,457
You summoned me so early.

211
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:07,457
What's the matter?

212
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:12,138
How's the investigation
on Mu Xianhe coming along?

213
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:13,097
He's not hiding

214
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:14,177
his whereabouts.

215
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:15,298
But this man

216
00:11:15,378 --> 00:11:16,778
is careless and arrogant.

217
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,470
Whether it's high-ranking officials

218
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:19,778
or wealthy individuals,

219
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,990
he remains indifferent to all.

220
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:23,057
Looks like winning over Mu Xianhe

221
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,577
will not be

222
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:28,658
an easy task.

223
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:31,337
Young Lady.

224
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:33,738
Young Lady.

225
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,677
Young Lady…

226
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:39,658
Young Lady,

227
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:42,018
why are you dressed like this?

228
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:45,018
I figured since you mentioned

229
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:46,658
something about Jieshuo,

230
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:48,977
today would be
a good opportunity to look into it.

231
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:50,258
Yes.

232
00:11:50,937 --> 00:11:52,298
There's someone from Jieshuo

233
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,190
who disguises themselves
as a Western Liang merchant

234
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:55,977
who's been frequenting Xichang.

235
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:57,298
Rumor has it

236
00:11:57,418 --> 00:11:58,738
that they're a trusted aide

237
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,217
to Chief Wuluo, the leader of Jieshuo.

238
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:01,618
However,

239
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:03,258
this information is not confirmed.

240
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,258
We'll have to see this person ourselves.

241
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,217
Really?

242
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:15,817
No wonder Her Highness

243
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:16,977
got up so early

244
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:18,258
and did her own makeup today.

245
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:21,217
I saw it with my eyes
when I served tea to Her Highness.

246
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,230
Even though
she tries to cover it up with makeup,

247
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:25,217
there are marks on her neck.

248
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:27,817
Lady Gu from Liuxiang Hall

249
00:12:27,937 --> 00:12:29,457
is probably fuming.

250
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:31,418
She entered Eastern Palace first,

251
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:32,857
but His Highness

252
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,898
didn't even spare her a glance.

253
00:12:35,018 --> 00:12:37,018
One was forced onto His Highness,

254
00:12:37,138 --> 00:12:38,977
and the other is the one
His Highness loves.

255
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:40,378
How can they be the same?

256
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:41,977
The maids also said

257
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:44,658
"Lady Gu was given in marriage
by His Majesty.

258
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:46,057
Whereas the crown princess

259
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:48,298
was the one His Highness knelt

260
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:51,217
in front of Jingde Hall
in heavy rain for an entire day,

261
00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:53,057
even coughing up blood,

262
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:54,977
to earnestly plead for.

263
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:56,738
One was forced

264
00:12:57,138 --> 00:13:00,217
onto His Highness,

265
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:03,418
and the other is the one
His Highness loves.

266
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,298
How can they be the same?"

267
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:15,618
Young Lady, stop embroidering.

268
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:18,057
Even if you finish it,

269
00:13:18,217 --> 00:13:20,658
the crown princess won't permit you
to meet His Highness.

270
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:22,977
She's so domineering.

271
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:25,498
But His Highness favors her.

272
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,778
Enough.

273
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,577
Yes, Young Lady…

274
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:31,738
Lady Gu.

275
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:35,298
But you really should find a solution

276
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:37,177
as soon as possible.

277
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:38,138
Otherwise,

278
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:38,738
His Highness

279
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:40,138
may never come again.

280
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:41,177
I told you to be quiet.

281
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:42,538
Didn't you hear me?

282
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:47,018
Prime minister also sent a message,

283
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:48,298
he urges you to hurry as well.

284
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:55,180
Your Highness,

285
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:56,260
Mu Xianhe especially loves

286
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:57,898
the dishes from Fengying Pavilion.

287
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,310
When he has money, he comes every day,

288
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:01,080
and when he doesn't,
he comes every other day.

289
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:02,658
But the pavilion keeps a tab for him,

290
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,057
and he settles it when he has money.

291
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:04,817
Let's go.

292
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:06,177
We'll meet with this Mu Xianhe.

293
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:07,498
Sirs.

294
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:08,898
Please come inside.

295
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,738
(Fengying Pavilion)
The private room upstairs

296
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,817
(Fengying Pavilion)
has been prepared for you.

297
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:11,977
Hollow out the oranges,

298
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:14,138
fill them with crab meat,
roe, and crab paste,

299
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,097
seal them with the orange peel,
and steam for 15 minutes, then serve.

300
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,977
We have 350 grams worth
of the finest crabs today.

301
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:20,817
Perhaps

302
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:21,937
we'll start with four?

303
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:22,538
Sounds good.

304
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:25,177
This is a new way of eating crab.

305
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,560
The chef hasn't cooked
that way before.

306
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:27,817
Please forgive us

307
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:29,217
if it's not seasoned properly.

308
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,710
As long as the cooking time is right,

309
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:31,738
it'll be fine.

310
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:32,457
Go ahead.

311
00:14:32,457 --> 00:14:33,977
Right away.

312
00:14:38,697 --> 00:14:40,337
Crab in Orange.

313
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:41,498
How did you come across

314
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:42,738
this unusual way

315
00:14:43,057 --> 00:14:44,298
of eating crab?

316
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:45,977
I have no idea about these things.

317
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,057
You said Mu Xianhe

318
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,410
was a connoisseur of good food.

319
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:49,538
I remembered

320
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:51,457
that the late Crown Prince was also one.

321
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:52,778
So, I asked around

322
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:54,018
the chefs in Eastern Palace,

323
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,618
and learned some unconventional ways

324
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:56,778
of preparing food.

325
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:02,730
Young Lady,

326
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,370
that guy pretending to be a merchant

327
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,769
is dining here today.

328
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:09,130
(Fengying Pavilion)

329
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,410
(Fengying Pavilion)
Did you enjoy your meal?

330
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,289
Yes.

331
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:12,289
Do come often.

332
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:13,090
All right.

333
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:15,289
Dear guests, this way please.

334
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,889
We want a private room upstairs.

335
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,450
Very well. This way, please.

336
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:36,009
Crab in Orange.

337
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,090
Mister Mu.

338
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:46,617
This Crab in Orange smells wonderful.

339
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:50,000
(Mu Xianhe)

340
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,570
I was attracted by the delectable aroma.

341
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:53,970
Might I have the pleasure

342
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,889
of having a taste of the dish?

343
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,289
Just one bite.

344
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,929
Mister Mu, this is for the guests.

345
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:04,450
It's fine.

346
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:06,570
You must be Mister Mu.

347
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:08,450
It's fate that we meet.

348
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,250
I'll let you have a serving.

349
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,570
Don't mind if I do.

350
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:25,049
Exceptional!

351
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:26,889
Who do you think

352
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,210
came up with this thing?

353
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,289
Stuff fresh crab meat into oranges

354
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,769
and sprinkle orange zest

355
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,929
to eliminate the crab's fishiness.

356
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:37,370
Truly exceptional!

357
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:42,490
You two

358
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:43,850
must carry the surname Pei.

359
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:45,169
No.

360
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,289
Li.

361
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,169
No.

362
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,409
Gu.

363
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,730
Why do you assume so?

364
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,860
People coming up
with such a way of eating

365
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:03,610
must be from a wealthy and noble family.

366
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,610
That's why I guessed
your surname is Pei at first.

367
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,710
But when I thought about it,

368
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:09,209
the Pei family's a bunch of soldiers.

369
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,090
They probably don't know
much about the finer things.

370
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,920
So, I thought you might be
from the Li family.

371
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,130
But then I thought again,

372
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:17,729
the Li family members

373
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,770
are almost all dead,

374
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:19,689
and I haven't heard

375
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,110
of the new emperor
being all that particular about food.

376
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,649
So,

377
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,929
you're probably surnamed Gu.

378
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,929
I have an uncle who enjoys good food.

379
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,689
That's why he came up
with this way of enjoying crab.

380
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,290
Your uncle must have kept

381
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:42,130
a few good chefs,

382
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:43,050
right?

383
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,330
Unfortunately, he passed away early,

384
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:47,729
and most of the chefs

385
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:50,050
have been let go.

386
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,489
A pity indeed.

387
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,800
What about the rest of them?

388
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,929
How many are there left?

389
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:01,449
Only three or four left,

390
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,110
but three of them
are exceptionally skilled.

391
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,130
One is good at preparing fish,

392
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,370
another excels at making soups,

393
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:10,689
and the third is adept
at making preserved meat.

394
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,929
If one could attend a feast
at your residence,

395
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,889
it must be a divine experience.

396
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,249
Young Lady,

397
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:39,649
was that merchant

398
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,850
from Jieshuo?

399
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,090
That's Wuluo's cousin,

400
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,010
Wuyan.

401
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:46,209
Wuluo trusts this guy.

402
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,050
I met him when I was in Yingzhou.

403
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:49,850
Others may not know him,

404
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,649
but I do.

405
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:56,169
So what's he doing

406
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,409
sneaking into Xichang?

407
00:18:58,209 --> 00:18:59,810
Nothing good, no doubt.

408
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,130
Delicious.

409
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,249
This chef is really good.

410
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:09,249
Thank you both for your hospitality.

411
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,649
I will take my leave now.

412
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,130
Farewell.

413
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,540
You're just letting him go
just like that?

414
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:25,489
Don't worry.

415
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,969
He's a stubborn

416
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,889
and unruly one.

417
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,169
We have to find a way
to catch his attention,

418
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,409
and it has to be subtle.

419
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,050
That's the only way to impress him.

420
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,130
Casting a long line to catch a big fish.

421
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,409
Exactly.

422
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:42,209
We can't risk making him run away.

423
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:43,969
Where else would we find him?

424
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:48,929
Server.

425
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,449
Yes, sir?

426
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,090
Today's sea bass is excellent.

427
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:56,409
Save a live one for me.

428
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,209
I'll take it to go.

429
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,169
No need to prepare it.

430
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,969
Good eye, sir.

431
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,610
I'm not boasting, but to be frank,

432
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,060
you won't find a bass as good as
this sea bass from the south

433
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,130
that we serve in Fengying Pavilion
in all of Xichang,

434
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,810
no matter how much you pay.

435
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,130
I'll do that right away.

436
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:14,810
I don't recall

437
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,169
you being fond of fish.

438
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,330
Well, someone is.

439
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:20,689
I'm not like a certain someone

440
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,530
who only eats well

441
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:24,169
but never considers others.

442
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,689
I must say,

443
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,130
this was a very satisfying meal.

444
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,929
Indeed, the food outside is better.

445
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:35,810
That's right.

446
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:39,969
Pardon me.

447
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,209
Earlier, you mentioned

448
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,649
you wanted an extra sea bass

449
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:43,729
to bring home with you.

450
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:45,850
You don't have to prepare it.

451
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:47,090
We'll handle that ourselves.

452
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:47,330
Yes.

453
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:49,850
But, we only have one sea bass left,

454
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:52,090
and there's another guest
who really wants it too.

455
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,010
They ask

456
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,689
if you could let them have it

457
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,249
for double the price.

458
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:57,010
No.

459
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:58,610
I ordered first.

460
00:20:58,729 --> 00:20:59,489
It's mine.

461
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:00,249
What?

462
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,689
Not even if I pay extra?

463
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,610
She said she ordered it first.

464
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,810
She insisted.

465
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,570
How about this?

466
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,610
Take me to them.

467
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,610
I'll take to them myself.

468
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,409
All right.

469
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:14,649
Dear guests,

470
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,409
the other guest

471
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,770
is very sincere.

472
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:19,649
He has come in person.

473
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,889
Dear guests,

474
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,249
I understand it's not right to impose.

475
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,409
But

476
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,810
if you'll let me have the fish,

477
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:30,330
I'll pay for your meal

478
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:32,209
and throw in some extra.

479
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,130
My wife loves this fish.

480
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:35,969
If I don't return with the fish,

481
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,920
I'm afraid
she'll make me kneel on the abacus.

482
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:54,010
Am I that much of a glutton?

483
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,249
Abacus?

484
00:21:56,969 --> 00:21:58,370
Do we even have that?

485
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:06,330
After the disbandment of the Cui Army,

486
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,130
the garrison in Yingzhou
has been greatly reduced.

487
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,970
The remaining defense was taken over

488
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:13,050
by the guards of the imperial court.

489
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:16,409
This is a perfect opportunity

490
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:18,770
to attack Yingzhou.

491
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,649
Even Divine Arrow Team

492
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,370
was completely wiped out in Xichang.

493
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,879
(Jieshuo, Wuyan)
Li Ni even used this incident as a pretext

494
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,440
(Jieshuo, Wuyan)

495
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:28,370
to send envoys,
to question my elder brother,

496
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,610
an act my brother
deemed a great humiliation.

497
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:34,169
If we launch an attack on Yingzhou,

498
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:36,090
without the Cui Army,

499
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:38,489
chances are Li Ni
will personally lead the troops.

500
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:42,130
Kill Li Ni and use the Crown Prince to offset

501
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,409
Divine Arrow Team of Jieshuo,

502
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,249
isn't that a worthwhile deal?

503
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:52,169
Can you do it?

504
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,209
When I once said

505
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,290
I could disband the Cui Army,

506
00:22:56,649 --> 00:22:57,649
Chief Wuluo asked me

507
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,649
the same question.

508
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:02,409
I made it happen, didn't I?

509
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:09,570
Very well. I'll trust you one more time.

510
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:40,689
Lady Gu,

511
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,010
Madam had me

512
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:43,770
deliver this to you.

513
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:45,770
My mother?

514
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,530
Madam says to rest assured.

515
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:56,889
This is the best drug there is.

516
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,570
It won't show up in any tests.

517
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,290
There won't be any evidence left behind.

518
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:05,729
No.

519
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,449
His Highness is an astute
and meticulous person.

520
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,130
If I do this,

521
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:12,290
it will only make him
more repulsed by me.

522
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,449
Madam says

523
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,169
you need not worry.

524
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,950
Everyone at home,
including Prime Minister,

525
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:19,209
shares the same sentiment.

526
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,169
If you can't establish yourself firmly
in Eastern Palace,

527
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,729
all the efforts Prime Minister
has put in will be in vain.

528
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:26,530
Whether the future emperor

529
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,069
can address Prime Minister
as grandfather

530
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:29,249
depends entirely on you, Lady Gu.

531
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,920
This is as good as destroying
everything we've built so far.

532
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:34,330
If I say no, it's final.

533
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,169
Yes.

534
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:45,048
(Fengying Pavilion)

535
00:24:59,449 --> 00:25:01,489
A sumptuous piece of meat.

536
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,510
You say that your uncle's chef
is only good at making preserved meat.

537
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:10,409
I think that's too modest.

538
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:12,630
Making preserved meat isn't difficult.

539
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,570
The challenge lies
in balancing the five flavors.

540
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:16,850
That requires extraordinary talent.

541
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,470
It's rare to find someone
who truly appreciates it.

542
00:25:19,689 --> 00:25:21,910
I'm an ordinary man
who doesn't understand these things.

543
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:23,290
Since you speak highly of it,

544
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:24,330
then it must be good.

545
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,290
You're no ordinary man.

546
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:29,850
You're a military man.

547
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,610
Moreover, you're young and accomplished,

548
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:32,970
and hold a prestigious position.

549
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,209
How did you know?

550
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,810
There are callouses on your hegu point
on your left hand and your right thumb.

551
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,190
That means you handle a bow often.

552
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:47,330
You are skilled in archery.

553
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:48,850
Although you're dressed casually

554
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,810
and without a sword,

555
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,300
you maintain a sitting posture
that allows you to draw a sword swiftly.

556
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,610
That means you are vigilant

557
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,290
and one that is trained in martial arts.

558
00:25:56,449 --> 00:25:58,610
Why do you say
I am young and accomplished

559
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,100
and hold a prestigious position, then?

560
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,660
Even though both of you
are concealing your identities,

561
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,010
the Crab in Orange from last time

562
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,489
and this preserved meat

563
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:07,169
are definitely not dishes

564
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,689
that come from an ordinary household.

565
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:10,649
And look at him.

566
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,409
Even though he always sits below you

567
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,649
and only acts or speaks

568
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,090
after receiving signs from you,

569
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:18,010
his entire demeanor already reflects
someone from a prestigious family.

570
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:18,850
And you

571
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,130
are clearly of higher rank than him,

572
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,889
so you're young and accomplished

573
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,530
and hold a prestigious position?

574
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:30,570
Does your residence

575
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:33,570
have a lot of good food,

576
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:36,409
things that have never been
seen or heard of?

577
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:38,689
What if I say yes?

578
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,010
I knew something was amiss.

579
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,010
Why else would you deliberately
show them off?

580
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,969
You are perceptive

581
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,169
and sharp.

582
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,770
However, I mean no ill intention.

583
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,330
If you refuse,

584
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:57,130
take the preserved meat and leave.

585
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,729
I will not say another word.

586
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:05,449
Fine. Let me hear it.

587
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:06,889
What do you want me to do?

588
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,969
I can always leave

589
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,370
if it is beyond my abilities.

590
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:14,290
I've heard
you're skilled in performing magic,

591
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,010
capable of transforming

592
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,929
countless scenes like a deity.

593
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,409
I'd like to request you

594
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,729
to perform a magic trick.

595
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,290
I didn't expect you to be someone
seeking the art of sorcery as well.

596
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,889
To be honest,

597
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,910
there are no deities or sorcery
in this world.

598
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,209
The magic tricks I perform

599
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,649
rely on nothing more than exploiting

600
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,610
people's desires,
illusions to deceive the eyes.

601
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,510
If our words don't align,
there's little to say.

602
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,110
Despite your wealth and status,
you know little.

603
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:43,249
You should know better.

604
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,570
Is it wicked or righteous?

605
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,929
All depends on where you stand.

606
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:48,850
The emperor missed Lady Li so much

607
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,810
that he resorted
to summoning her spirit.

608
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,420
And we, on the other hand,

609
00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:57,729
are seeking your help

610
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,770
for an elder's ailment.

611
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,889
Who do you want me

612
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,010
to perform for?

613
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,249
An elder.

614
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:06,209
Man or woman?

615
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:06,889
Man.

616
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:07,649
Surname?

617
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,330
Cui.

618
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:12,050
What does

619
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:13,449
this old man Cui do?

620
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,249
He's a general.

621
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,409
Great General Pingliang Cui Yi?

622
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,010
Yes.

623
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:24,969
If I help you,

624
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,050
your residence's chef…

625
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,570
Will immediately go to your residence

626
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,010
and prepare a new dish every day

627
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:31,209
for a full three years.

628
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,090
All right.

629
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:35,570
Deal.

630
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:37,489
Cui Yi

631
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,169
is an honorable man.

632
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,010
I'm willing to perform a magic trick

633
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,290
to cure his ailment.

634
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,889
But

635
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:46,810
I have one final question.

636
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,290
Ask away.

637
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:50,169
Is

638
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:52,290
your surname Li?

639
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:54,649
What if it is,

640
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,130
what if it isn't?

641
00:28:58,449 --> 00:28:59,249
Fair enough.

642
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,330
I'll consider

643
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,689
that you're a Pei as well.

644
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,649
What's the matter?

645
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,810
I feel like Mister Shiqi
is hiding something from me.

646
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,729
Have you forgotten

647
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,489
how you comforted me last time?

648
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:21,889
Didn't we agree

649
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,489
that sometimes

650
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:24,530
we shouldn't pry

651
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:26,409
into their affairs too much?

652
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,530
But he goes out now
without taking me along.

653
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:31,110
Sometimes, he even goes out in a hurry
with General Pei Yuan.

654
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:35,330
Do you think
His Highness doesn't take you along

655
00:29:35,489 --> 00:29:36,370
or inform you

656
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,929
because he doesn't trust you?

657
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,050
No.

658
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:40,489
He absolutely trusts me.

659
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:41,770
Then, what's the problem?

660
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:43,370
You're right.

661
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,470
Besides,
I'm keeping something from him too.

662
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,249
What are you keeping from him?

663
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,010
What's this?

664
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,209
(Deed)
This is a shop in the West Market.

665
00:29:58,449 --> 00:30:00,010
I've examined the location thoroughly

666
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,340
and had a broker check it for me.

667
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,689
It's not big,

668
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,889
but it's strategically located

669
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:05,210
(Received by: Xie Chang'er)
with a lot of traffic.

670
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,819
(Received by: Xie Chang'er)
It's perfect for doing business.

671
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:08,249
You said

672
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:10,090
you wanted to open a shop.

673
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,969
So, I bought it for you.

674
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,729
This… This is amazing!

675
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,610
Wait.

676
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,689
Didn't you give me

677
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,929
all your money?

678
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,929
Where did you get the money
to buy this shop?

679
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:26,249
Mister Shiqi gave us

680
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:27,090
a generous amount

681
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:27,969
when he wedded.

682
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,449
I used that money to buy this shop.

683
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,969
You did all of this

684
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,850
without telling me!

685
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:40,649
Taozi.

686
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,610
You see,

687
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:45,969
His Highness and Her Highness

688
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:46,969
have wedded.

689
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,209
When will you marry me?

690
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,249
Well,

691
00:30:56,489 --> 00:30:57,929
I'll have to think about that.

692
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,770
How long will you need?

693
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,530
I'll have to think

694
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,489
about that too.

695
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:06,889
Can't you give me

696
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,130
a specific time?

697
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,090
What's the hurry?

698
00:31:10,249 --> 00:31:11,290
I told you.

699
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:12,570
I need time to think about it.

700
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:13,649
Taozi!

701
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:15,249
Taozi!

702
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:16,489
How much time do you need?

703
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,530
Taozi, can't you give me an answer now?

704
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:19,370
Of course not.

705
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:20,489
Taozi!

706
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,409
A toast to you, Your Highness.

707
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:57,770
This liquor is strong.

708
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,810
Don't drink it anymore.

709
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:01,249
Yes.

710
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,209
Your Highness, try this jellied lamb.

711
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,889
My mother sent this to me.

712
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,360
The preparation is different
from outside.

713
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,409
Please try it.

714
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:28,010
So, what did you tell Ear?

715
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,770
I told him

716
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:32,500
that I needed to think about

717
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,889
something so important.

718
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,570
Then he asked how long

719
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:39,770
I needed to think about it.

720
00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:41,489
I said

721
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,810
I had to think about that too.

722
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,689
Why are you laughing?

723
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:47,810
I'm just thinking,

724
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:49,209
wouldn't that make Ear so anxious

725
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,249
and scratching his head?

726
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,969
Not really,

727
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,209
but he does seem

728
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,969
a bit anxious these days.

729
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:58,850
It's like

730
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:00,489
he wants to ask if I've made up my mind

731
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,420
but is too embarrassed
to bring it up.

732
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:04,489
I mean,

733
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,929
it's only normal

734
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,729
to consider such an important matter
carefully, isn't it?

735
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:10,689
Yes, it's entirely normal.

736
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,610
Be sure to think it through thoroughly.

737
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,729
Thinking while eating.

738
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,330
Let him be anxious.

739
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,969
Your Highness, have another cup.

740
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,209
I'm afraid I can't handle your liquor.

741
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,780
Your Highness.

742
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:53,780
Your Highness?

743
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,780
I will never come again.

744
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,929
Your Highness?

745
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:57,010
Your Highness!

746
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,260
What's wrong, Your Highness?

747
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,950
Your Highness…

748
00:33:58,969 --> 00:33:59,489
Let go of me!

749
00:34:01,209 --> 00:34:01,929
Your Highness!

750
00:34:02,489 --> 00:34:03,290
Your Highness!

751
00:34:03,449 --> 00:34:04,489
Your Highness…

752
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,689
Qiucui!

753
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,169
Was it you?

754
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:10,530
Why were you listening in on us?

755
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:11,689
Lady Gu…

756
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:14,090
Madam made me do it.

757
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:15,090
I told Madam

758
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:16,970
you said we shouldn't use that drug,

759
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,809
she said you were being cowardly.

760
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,010
She ordered me

761
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,090
to put the drug in His Highness' cup.

762
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:23,369
If I disobey,

763
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,450
she'll sell off my entire family.

764
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,649
I…

765
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:28,130
Foolish!

766
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:29,729
Fools!

767
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:30,649
You…

768
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,450
You fools!

769
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,050
You've made me lose

770
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:37,329
my only hope.

771
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,130
Now,

772
00:34:40,689 --> 00:34:42,530
all is lost.

773
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,689
I've lost everything…

774
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,880
Your Highness, what are you doing?

775
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,530
What are you doing?

776
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:04,890
I'm going to punish you.

777
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:16,050
What are you doing?

778
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:51,769
What?

779
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:53,610
She did that?

780
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,649
With one careless move,

781
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:56,970
we've lost the entire game.

782
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,849
Now,

783
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:00,289
His Highness will never come

784
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,010
to my Liuxiang Hall again.

785
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:06,649
Your mother is foolish.

786
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,670
But you haven't been able
to win his heart after all this time.

787
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:11,689
That won't do.

788
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,249
With things as they are,

789
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,849
there is no place for me
in Eastern Palace anymore.

790
00:36:18,729 --> 00:36:19,530
Father,

791
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:21,289
have you got any ways

792
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:23,249
to salvage this?

793
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,930
The only solution now

794
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:34,050
is to eliminate the source of trouble.

795
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:36,050
What do you mean, Father?

796
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,450
Crown Princess's influence
is too strong.

797
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,490
Unfortunately, in this world,

798
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,110
when the moon is full, the tide rises,

799
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,780
and when the water is full,
it overflows.

800
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,970
If, by some unexpected event,

801
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,649
she were to die suddenly,

802
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,890
even though the crown prince
would be sad for a while,

803
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,809
there is nothing he can do to change it.

804
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,490
Good.

805
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:02,769
As long as this has nothing to do

806
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,490
with the Gu family,

807
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,369
then

808
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,130
let that crown princess
die "unexpectedly" as soon as possible.

809
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:01,570
Who are you?

810
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:55,490
