(Han Li's Residence)

Your disguise is pretty good.

31
00:02:15,197 --> 00:02:15,810
See you later.

32
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:22,836
Enough already.

33
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:23,956
Stop crying.

34
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:26,197
Okay now. Stop crying.

35
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:27,317
Why does he keep crying?

36
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:28,597
Good boy. Stop crying.

37
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:29,330
Stop crying.

38
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:29,877
Say,

39
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:31,916
this child was born
just a few days ago.

40
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:33,236
Why is he having diarrhea?

41
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:34,757
And, he's even having rashes.

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,180
Could it be
that the baby caught a cold

43
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,836
when we carried him
to see the guests during the baby shower?

44
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:41,437
Someone, get a physician.

45
00:02:41,557 --> 00:02:42,557
Stop crying.

46
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:43,317
Stop crying.

47
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:44,317
All right now.

48
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:45,676
Yes, I will go immediately.

49
00:02:45,836 --> 00:02:46,717
Okay now. Stop crying.

50
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:47,437
You'll be fine.

51
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:48,796
The physician will be here soon.

52
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,236
This is so frustrating.

53
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:51,197
Stop crying.

54
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:56,516
Stop crying.

55
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,796
Good boy.

56
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,557
Okay now. Stop crying.

57
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:00,140
I'm so worried.

58
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:00,877
Madam, he's here.

59
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:02,757
Physician, take a look at him!

60
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:04,116
Please examine him!

61
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:07,977
This...

62
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,870
(Han Li, Guardian of Bingzhou,
Sun Jing's Subordinate)

63
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:30,236
Such audacity!

64
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:31,877
How dare they sneak into

65
00:03:31,997 --> 00:03:33,116
my residence

66
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:35,277
and abduct my grandson
during the baby shower?

67
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,516
They even left a note behind

68
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,210
to give them the tiger tally
in exchange.

69
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:43,157
Master, please calm down.

70
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,110
Since they harbor ill intention,

71
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:47,236
we should deal with them cautiously.

72
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:49,477
Chengzhi,

73
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:51,277
who do you think

74
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:52,997
is bold enough

75
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:55,037
to attempt such an act?

76
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:00,396
The Zhenxi Army was
just defeated at Wangzhou.

77
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:02,236
(Lv Chengzhi, Han Li's Strategist)
They're very near to us.

78
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:04,796
Young Master Cui of the Cui Army

79
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,076
is also commanding his army
in the vicinity.

80
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:08,717
At this moment,

81
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,396
these two families have their eyes on

82
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:12,997
our Bingzhou.

83
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:16,956
The Zhenxi Army is crestfallen.

84
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:18,276
We don't need to worry.

85
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:23,357
But Young Master Cui,

86
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,716
he's a tough one to deal with.

87
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:27,437
And now,

88
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:29,197
they've abducted Little Master.

89
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:30,677
And they want us

90
00:04:30,997 --> 00:04:32,317
to put the tiger tally

91
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:33,877
at the forest outside of the city.

92
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,437
If not,

93
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:38,156
they'll harm Little Master.

94
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,117
Give them

95
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:47,357
the fake tiger tally.

96
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:49,317
Yes, Master.

97
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,580
We were lucky that you were pretending
to be pregnant

98
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:22,677
when we moved here.

99
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:24,516
If not,

100
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:26,516
people will definitely get suspicious of us

101
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,396
if they hear a baby's cries
all of a sudden.

102
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:36,596
No.

103
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,370
We should be thankful
that you weren't able to walk

104
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,630
when we were on the mountain path.

105
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:45,516
And, I told you
to pretend to be pregnant.

106
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:46,596
Say,

107
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:48,276
don't you think I have great foresight?

108
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,237
Your Highness,

109
00:05:50,396 --> 00:05:51,956
you're excellent at devising strategies

110
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,210
and have great foresight indeed.

111
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,156
Why is he crying again?

112
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:01,197
Your Highness,

113
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,970
it's time to change his diaper again.

114
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,076
Why is it me again?

115
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:07,076
Because you possess great foresight.

116
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,716
You're really tough to deal with,
you know?

117
00:06:15,437 --> 00:06:17,317
Come on, stop crying.

118
00:06:17,797 --> 00:06:18,156
Here.

119
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:20,557
Stop crying.

120
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,470
What's with the volume of poop?

121
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:27,677
Master!

122
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:28,557
How did it go?

123
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:29,156
Master,

124
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,910
I've already ordered
our men to guard the forest strictly.

125
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:33,677
But no one took the tiger tally

126
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:35,677
even though the sun is setting.

127
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,757
There was no one there?

128
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:37,956
That's right.

129
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,677
I came here to report the news to you

130
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,350
as I was afraid that
you might be worried.

131
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:42,877
Master,

132
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:45,117
do you think

133
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:46,797
they'll harm Little Master

134
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,636
if they fail to get the tiger tally?

135
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:53,634
(Han Residence)

136
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:10,156
You have to grow up well, okay?

137
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,840
If not, His Highness
would be helping you

138
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:13,557
to wash your diapers for nothing.

139
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,797
Let's go and set the place on fire.

140
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,960
You have to be careful later.

141
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,596
Make sure you don't
burn down this house.

142
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,276
Got it.

143
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,036
Let's go.

144
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:32,036
The house is on fire!

145
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:34,836
The house is on fire!

146
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:36,557
The house is on fire?

147
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:37,596
This is bad.

148
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,610
I'm afraid enemies have found out
that the tiger tally was fake.

149
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:42,677
So they come to take the real one.

150
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:44,490
Send our men to the southern courtyard.

151
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,270
Prepare enough water
to extinguish the fire.

152
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:20,757
Now, although we know
where the real tiger tally is,

153
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:24,197
we don't know how many traps
are inside.

154
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,750
We can't force our way through.

155
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,950
Let's head back and think of something.

156
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:29,017
Let's go.

157
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:29,537
Let's go.

158
00:08:32,756 --> 00:08:33,996
Master!

159
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,596
We didn't expect someone
to set the place on fire.

160
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,917
And, we didn't expect them
to send Little Master back to the house.

161
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:44,037
Luckily, the fire was extinguished.

162
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:47,876
Little Master is safe.

163
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:50,116
They're employing a dual strategy.

164
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:51,797
They're trying to lure us away.

165
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:55,236
They wish to steal the tiger tally

166
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:57,677
in the midst of the chaos.

167
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:01,876
It would be great

168
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:03,596
if they were here

169
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:04,956
to steal the tiger tally.

170
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,170
The tiger tally is
in the southern courtyard,

171
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,250
which is filled with traps.

172
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:09,917
They cannot get inside

173
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,476
unless they have at least 1,000 troops.

174
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:24,797
Although we know
where the tiger tally is,

175
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:27,557
security is very tight.

176
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:29,756
I'm afraid we can't steal it easily.

177
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:33,157
Since we cannot steal it,

178
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:36,517
let's acquire it with our wits.

179
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,116
You and I will pretend to be envoys
of the Zhenxi Army.

180
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:46,037
We can head there and
deal with Han Li.

181
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:47,277
What do you think?

182
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:48,517
That won't do.

183
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:52,716
The Zhenxi Army just retreated
from Wangzhou after suffering defeat.

184
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:55,116
Han Li will definitely not fall for this.

185
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:05,876
Why don't we

186
00:10:06,836 --> 00:10:08,637
pretend to be envoys
of the Cui Army?

187
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,397
We can tell Han Li

188
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,116
that we'll give them benefits as long as
they allow us to pass through Jianzhou.

189
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:15,716
Han Li is a greedy fellow.

190
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,956
And, the Cui Army has
a great reputation.

191
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,440
It's likely that he'll agree to it.

192
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,910
Your Highness, I couldn't tell that
you were this honest and sincere.

193
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,260
If Han Li sends someone
to retrieve the tiger tally to Jianzhou,

194
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:26,116
we can intercept them

195
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,277
and kill them
or swap the real deal with a fake.

196
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,910
We can acquire the tiger tally
in both ways.

197
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:31,500
If we acquire
the tiger tally successfully,

198
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:34,037
both the Zhenxi Army and the Cui Army
will own one prefecture.

199
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:35,557
I want Bingzhou.

200
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:38,716
Why don't we make a deal?

201
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:41,917
The first person to capture

202
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:43,356
or kill Han Li

203
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:44,996
will receive Bingzhou.

204
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:48,836
The first one to acquire the tiger tally
will receive Jianzhou.

205
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:55,277
What if I capture Han Li and acquire
the tiger tally at the same time?

206
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,710
You can have both Bingzhou and Jianzhou.

207
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:58,557
The Zhenxi Army keeps our promises.

208
00:10:58,917 --> 00:10:59,876
It's the same for you.

209
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:00,797
All right.

210
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:02,437
If the Zhenxi Army owns

211
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:03,836
both Bingzhou and Jianzhou,

212
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,740
Jianzhou is located on an important path
connecting the East and the North.

213
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:07,930
In the future, the Zhenxi Army

214
00:11:07,956 --> 00:11:09,356
cannot refuse the Cui Army's request

215
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:11,277
for using the path
to do business trades.

216
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:12,797
It's the same for you.

217
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:15,236
Let's make a deal then.

218
00:11:18,517 --> 00:11:19,037
Young Master,

219
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:20,637
Chen Xing sent us a letter.

220
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,910
He finally found a symbol
left behind by Lieutenant He

221
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:24,756
in a discreet place in Bingzhou.

222
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:25,596
Good.

223
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:26,917
Excellent.

224
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:27,917
Taozi,

225
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:30,836
head to Bingzhou,
rendezvous with Chen Xing,

226
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,510
and receive Lieutenant He together.

227
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:34,317
Bingzhou

228
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:35,956
is Han Li's foothold.

229
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:37,956
He's paranoid.

230
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:41,197
If I bring my army there,

231
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:43,157
I'm afraid he'll harm Lieutenant He.

232
00:11:44,397 --> 00:11:45,076
Lin.

233
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:46,446
(Cui Li, General of Cui Army)

234
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:53,517
Li, what are you doing here?

235
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:55,596
Lin,

236
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:57,596
you've been out here for several months.

237
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:58,756
As your brother,

238
00:11:58,836 --> 00:11:59,876
of course I miss you.

239
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:03,157
Coincidentally, Uncle sent me to Mount West
to complete a task.

240
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:04,677
I was thinking

241
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:06,437
that Mount West was close to your area.

242
00:12:06,797 --> 00:12:08,637
That's why I brought my attendants

243
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:09,756
to join you.

244
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,356
You and I can work together
to kill our foes.

245
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,277
I can also let Uncle know

246
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:17,797
that his nephew is capable of rendering
military merit too.

247
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:19,797
Li,

248
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:22,917
you're going against
military order here.

249
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:28,197
Lin, don't worry.

250
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:30,890
I've already sent out my men
to report this to Uncle.

251
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:31,596
I believe

252
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:32,836
that Uncle will agree to it.

253
00:12:33,116 --> 00:12:34,197
And, think about it.

254
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,437
How could the thousands of troops
head back alone?

255
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:38,996
What should I do
if something happens to them?

256
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,996
Since you've already
sent a report to Father,

257
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:47,476
you may camp and rest here.

258
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:54,317
You're keeping the main army here.

259
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:56,756
What's your plan?

260
00:12:57,397 --> 00:12:59,996
Li, since you came here
against military order,

261
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:02,317
you have to keep your men in check.

262
00:13:02,677 --> 00:13:04,620
You're not allowed to discuss
military affairs.

263
00:13:06,236 --> 00:13:07,236
If not,

264
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:11,076
you have to receive Father's punishment
for going against military order.

265
00:13:16,157 --> 00:13:17,956
That brat who's always sick,

266
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:20,397
how dare he be so rude to me?

267
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:22,157
That Cui Lin,

268
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:24,677
he was just born lucky.

269
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:26,637
If I were Uncle's son,

270
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:28,236
the entire Cui Army

271
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:29,677
would be under my command now.

272
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:32,157
San, calm down.

273
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:33,917
Cui Lin was born frail.

274
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,410
He has to take medicine all year long.

275
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:37,076
He won't live for long.

276
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:39,517
By then, Great General will have no heir.

277
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:42,076
You'll take over the Cui Army by then.

278
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:50,356
I've laid low for so many years.

279
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,116
Now, the situation is getting
more turbulent.

280
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,557
I'm too impatient to wait any longer.

281
00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:01,277
San, don't tell me you intend to...

282
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:06,476
I bowed my head and followed Cui Lin

283
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:08,917
so that I could play it by ear.

284
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:10,517
I will get rid of

285
00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:12,236
both Cui Lin

286
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,116
and Lieutenant He in one go.

287
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,596
So, you two are here

288
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:27,356
under Young Master Cui's order

289
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:30,917
to request permission for the Cui Army
to pass through Jianzhou?

290
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:32,197
Yes.

291
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:35,197
Lord Han, please let us pass.

292
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:38,557
This is

293
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:39,917
definitely negotiable.

294
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:43,677
However, Grand Governor Sun
of the capital

295
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:45,917
ordered me to guard the city.

296
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:48,596
If I allow you guys to pass,

297
00:14:49,157 --> 00:14:50,596
I'm afraid Grand Governor Sun

298
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,917
will punish me.

299
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:55,270
Since we're here
to request for using the path,

300
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:58,677
naturally, the Cui Army
will repay the favor, Lord Han.

301
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:02,876
Many merchants gather at
Bingzhou and Jianzhou.

302
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:04,596
They sell fabrics

303
00:15:04,716 --> 00:15:07,356
to the Cui Family
in Pingliang and Weiyang.

304
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:09,820
Lord Han, if you permit us
to use the path,

305
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:10,917
in the future,

306
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:14,277
we won't charge the merchants
in Bingzhou and Jianzhou any taxes.

307
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,076
Just by the tax money alone,

308
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:19,116
I assume you'll understand how much
it'll benefit you,

309
00:15:19,197 --> 00:15:20,317
Lord Han.

310
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,716
You two had a long trip.

311
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:28,437
And, it's getting late.

312
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:30,197
Why don't you two

313
00:15:30,317 --> 00:15:31,756
enjoy a drink or two with us

314
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,037
and rest in my residence?

315
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,110
Young Master and his army
are in the vicinity.

316
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,557
We cannot stay for long.

317
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,037
We need to head back
and report this to Young Master.

318
00:15:47,637 --> 00:15:48,437
All right.

319
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:51,076
Please have a seat.

320
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:55,277
Give us some time to discuss it.

321
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,320
(Wangzhou)

322
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:26,557
What are you doing?

323
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:28,157
Youde,

324
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:29,876
the Zhenxi Army does employ

325
00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:31,317
a strange battle tactic, huh?

326
00:16:31,517 --> 00:16:32,637
It's getting late.

327
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,157
But we're still outside of Wangzhou

328
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,110
to be mosquitoes' food.

329
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:37,860
Chang'er already told us not to come.

330
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,756
But you just insisted!

331
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:40,580
Since you're here,

332
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:41,797
you should follow his order.

333
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:45,917
But why exactly are we here?

334
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:54,037
One of the envoys

335
00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:56,157
is Lieutenant He of the Cui Army?

336
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:01,917
Do you mean that woman

337
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:04,716
is the famous wise lieutenant
serving Young Master Cui?

338
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,036
I have a subordinate
who distributes grain.

339
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:10,077
He knows the Cui Army.

340
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:12,677
Just now, I heard that the Cui Army

341
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:14,010
was sending their envoys here.

342
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:16,070
Thus, I ordered him
to observe in secret.

343
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:17,157
He has confirmed it.

344
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:21,637
That woman is Lieutenant He indeed.

345
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:23,677
No wonder.

346
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:25,877
I was wondering why

347
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:28,556
the Cui Army sent

348
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:29,956
a woman dressed as a man

349
00:17:30,077 --> 00:17:31,996
as one of the envoys.

350
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:36,157
So, it's Lieutenant He,

351
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:38,357
who's renowned for her intelligence.

352
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:41,637
I even heard

353
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:43,157
that Lieutenant He

354
00:17:43,316 --> 00:17:45,397
was Young Master Cui's right-hand aide.

355
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:47,996
She often devises strategies for him.

356
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,236
The other envoy

357
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,716
has a unique air around him too.

358
00:17:54,516 --> 00:17:57,796
He looked composed and experienced
at such a young age.

359
00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:02,877
I was having doubts about him too.

360
00:18:14,597 --> 00:18:16,157
Lord Han, what's with the courtesy?

361
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:20,476
Young Master Cui, you came here
on a secret trip.

362
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:23,796
I was truly surprised by your visit.

363
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:32,956
Lord Han, since you've

364
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:34,236
found out our identity,

365
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:37,597
let's be honest with each other.

366
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,197
Lord Han, you own both
Jianzhou and Bingzhou.

367
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:43,276
You have great foresight indeed.

368
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:47,077
Young Master Cui,
since you came here personally,

369
00:18:47,197 --> 00:18:48,316
I'm sure

370
00:18:48,476 --> 00:18:50,516
we can negotiate a deal
regarding the path

371
00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:51,597
you wish to use.

372
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,397
If so, let me thank you, Lord Han.

373
00:18:55,276 --> 00:18:55,956
Someone.

374
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:57,990
Yes, Master.

375
00:18:58,316 --> 00:18:59,197
Set up a banquet.

376
00:18:59,677 --> 00:19:02,397
I shall drink with Young Master Cui.

377
00:19:11,437 --> 00:19:12,117
Not bad at all!

378
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,110
- My first time fighting a war is so fun!
- That's right!

379
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:15,000
More fun than robbing.

380
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:15,796
That's right.

381
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:16,556
Precisely.

382
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:17,397
Being a soldier

383
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:18,837
is more fun than being a bandit.

384
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:19,917
Precisely.

385
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:24,180
(Zhenxi)

386
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,316
Zhenxi!

387
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:27,996
Zhenxi!

388
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:30,316
I'm back!

389
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:35,877
Guys!

390
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:38,476
Guys!

391
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:41,197
Follow my lead! We shall take back
Wangzhou together!

392
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,077
- Take back Wangzhou!
- Take back Wangzhou!

393
00:19:43,157 --> 00:19:44,877
Go!

394
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:46,837
Go!

395
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:18,437
Young Master Cui,

396
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,556
what do you think about the dance?

397
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,716
Ever since I left my hometown,

398
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:26,996
it's been battle after battle.

399
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,410
I haven't seen dance for long.

400
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:30,036
This moment

401
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:32,397
reminds me of the phrase
"peace and prosperity."

402
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:35,796
Young Master Cui, you flatter me.

403
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,900
Young Master Cui, you're humble yourself
in making acquaintances.

404
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:41,877
I'm very touched.

405
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:04,157
Young Master Cui, please have a seat.

406
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:07,677
There's something
I need to settle at the back.

407
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:11,276
I will be back in a second.

408
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:13,357
Lord Han, please.

409
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:30,476
Grand Governor Sun sent you
all the way here personally.

410
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,036
And, you also delivered
such precious treasures to us.

411
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:35,716
I'm at a loss for words right now.

412
00:21:35,716 --> 00:21:37,250
(Sun Jing's envoy)
Lord Han, Grand Governor said

413
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,597
that you led Bingzhou and Jianzhou

414
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:40,677
and defended them from
the rebels of Zhenxi.

415
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:41,796
It's a tough job.

416
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,917
That's why he instructed me

417
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,820
to deliver these items to you
from the capital.

418
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:47,716
All of these treasures were hand-picked by
Grand Governor himself

419
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:48,877
from the treasury

420
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:51,036
as your reward.

421
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:53,476
Thank you, Grand Governor.

422
00:21:53,637 --> 00:21:55,110
I don't deserve these rewards at all.

423
00:21:55,157 --> 00:21:57,036
I'm truly touched to the core.

424
00:21:57,597 --> 00:21:58,956
Lord Han, you're too modest here.

425
00:22:00,597 --> 00:22:01,917
I wonder if you have

426
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:03,756
the Grand Governor's handwritten order

427
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:04,956
or decree?

428
00:22:05,077 --> 00:22:07,556
Naturally.

429
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:09,956
Grand Governor sent me here
for two reasons.

430
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:10,756
First,

431
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:13,077
he knew that we were old acquaintances.

432
00:22:13,556 --> 00:22:15,677
We could catch up
with each other with my visit.

433
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:16,837
Second,

434
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:18,637
Grand Governor is worried about you.

435
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,716
The battlefield is a dangerous place.

436
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:23,677
He's worried about your safety.

437
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:25,996
That's why he ordered me

438
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:28,556
to bring these 12 Golden Guards here.

439
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,956
He ordered me to instruct them

440
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:33,716
to keep guard over you

441
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:34,996
from day to night.

442
00:22:35,357 --> 00:22:39,476
We have to ensure your safety.

443
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:44,556
Grand Governor is so thoughtful.

444
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,357
I cannot express my gratitude
with words.

445
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:48,996
I'm touched to the core.

446
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,077
I have no way to repay him.

447
00:22:50,397 --> 00:22:52,637
I can only lead my army

448
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:54,316
and battle against the Zhenxi Rebels

449
00:22:54,437 --> 00:22:55,917
with everything I have

450
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:57,117
to repay

451
00:22:57,236 --> 00:22:58,677
Grand Governor's kindness.

452
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:04,077
Grand Governor did so

453
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:05,316
to force you

454
00:23:05,437 --> 00:23:06,756
to turn against the two families.

455
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,556
If not,

456
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:09,796
he wouldn't send

457
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:12,197
the 12 Golden Guards here.

458
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,390
On the surface,
they're here to protect you.

459
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:17,716
But in reality, they're here
to coerce you into doing his bidding.

460
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:24,637
Ever since Sun Jing was appointed
as the Grand Governor,

461
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:27,077
he eradicated the Li Clan.

462
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:29,157
And, he even gave me

463
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:30,756
a covenant of sorts.

464
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:35,077
Back then, I was just trying

465
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:36,316
to brush him off.

466
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:40,236
I didn't expect him
to get ahead of himself.

467
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:40,917
Master,

468
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:43,716
members of the Cui Family
are still in the main hall.

469
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:45,476
Regarding this,

470
00:23:46,877 --> 00:23:47,837
we mustn't allow

471
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:49,756
Sun Jing's envoy to hear about this.

472
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:52,956
We can use the Cui Family

473
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:56,036
to our advantage.

474
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:00,117
Cui Yi only has one son.

475
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:02,877
And,

476
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,197
he came to my residence himself.

477
00:24:06,316 --> 00:24:09,677
If so, I won't stand on ceremony then.

478
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:33,077
Young Master,

479
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:34,357
you're drunk.

480
00:24:34,877 --> 00:24:35,996
I'm not.

481
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:39,637
Something's off.

482
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:43,316
Young Master,

483
00:24:43,877 --> 00:24:45,316
let me bring you back to your room.

484
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,570
Young Master Cui is drunk.

485
00:24:52,877 --> 00:24:54,437
Bring him to the guest room.

486
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,077
Young Master Cui, wait!

487
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:15,837
Young Master Cui,

488
00:25:16,756 --> 00:25:18,437
you should take things as they come.

489
00:25:19,077 --> 00:25:21,117
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

490
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:22,837
Don't you think you guys

491
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,996
are treating your guests
too kindly here?

492
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:28,837
Young Master, I can't fulfill my task

493
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:30,437
unless I keep you here.

494
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:32,716
I can only kill this woman

495
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:34,597
to give my master an account.

496
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:40,157
Fine.

497
00:25:40,837 --> 00:25:41,756
I will stay.

498
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:43,437
But you must let her go.

499
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:48,197
Young Master, don't worry.

500
00:25:48,796 --> 00:25:50,316
You're an important guest

501
00:25:50,476 --> 00:25:51,877
to Bingzhou.

502
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:53,956
I'm afraid the Cui Army will be worried

503
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:55,437
about your stay here.

504
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:57,236
Naturally, we'll release

505
00:25:57,236 --> 00:25:58,316
Lady He back

506
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,837
so that she can explain the situation
to General Cui.

507
00:26:01,236 --> 00:26:02,917
We don't want him to misunderstand us.

508
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,796
Young Master, just leave.

509
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:08,036
Just ignore such honorless liars.

510
00:26:22,236 --> 00:26:22,877
Good.

511
00:26:23,437 --> 00:26:25,877
Young Master Cui,
you're loyal and devoted indeed.

512
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,476
Seems like you do cherish
fair maidens.

513
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:39,597
Young Master, don't worry.

514
00:26:40,877 --> 00:26:42,437
The windows and roof

515
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:44,157
are reinforced with steel bars.

516
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:45,597
It's definitely safe.

517
00:26:45,796 --> 00:26:48,917
No assassins will get to you here.

518
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:50,796
A cell is a cell.

519
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:52,316
Stop trying to make it sound fancy.

520
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:56,276
What's wrong?

521
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:58,316
This place is splendid.

522
00:26:58,476 --> 00:27:00,796
Does it not suit your taste?

523
00:27:03,677 --> 00:27:04,236
Wait.

524
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:06,677
Bring us some warm water.

525
00:27:07,117 --> 00:27:09,236
Our young master is particular
about hygiene.

526
00:27:09,516 --> 00:27:11,316
I need to serve him
as he takes his bath.

527
00:27:17,556 --> 00:27:18,437
All right.

528
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,796
I'll order my men to bring
scented bath water.

529
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:22,236
Bring us thicker towels too

530
00:27:22,397 --> 00:27:24,077
so that Young Master won't catch a cold

531
00:27:24,197 --> 00:27:25,236
during his bath.

532
00:27:25,397 --> 00:27:26,796
If Young Master

533
00:27:27,077 --> 00:27:27,996
falls sick

534
00:27:28,117 --> 00:27:29,197
in Bingzhou,

535
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,796
the Cui Army

536
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:32,837
will lay waste to your territory.

537
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:38,316
I will

538
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:40,236
prepare them for you.

539
00:28:55,357 --> 00:28:57,357
Young Master, you can take your bath now.

540
00:28:57,476 --> 00:28:57,956
Okay.

541
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,760
Someone is on the rooftop.

542
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,556
What should we do?

543
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,900
The temperature is just right.

544
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,080
Why not take a bath together?

545
00:30:40,677 --> 00:30:41,077
Wait.

546
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:49,837
All right.

547
00:30:50,157 --> 00:30:51,397
We can talk now.

548
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,510
What are you laughing at?

549
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:57,316
I'm laughing

550
00:30:58,036 --> 00:30:59,556
because our first encounter

551
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,877
was just like this.

552
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:03,597
Yeah.

553
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:05,650
You had no idea
how fierce you were then.

554
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:06,877
You started a fight with me.

555
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:08,197
Nonsense.

556
00:31:08,476 --> 00:31:10,157
You started the fight first.

557
00:31:10,357 --> 00:31:11,236
Nonsense.

558
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,270
I wouldn't start a fight
if you didn't take my pearl?

559
00:31:13,437 --> 00:31:14,357
What pearl?

560
00:31:16,397 --> 00:31:17,476
You mean that lousy pouch?

561
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:19,077
I threw it away long ago.

562
00:31:19,996 --> 00:31:20,516
You!

563
00:31:23,597 --> 00:31:24,157
What's wrong?

564
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,036
Your Highness,

565
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,677
don't tell me

566
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:31,516
you're going to attack me now?

567
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,340
Let's get straight to business.

568
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:42,637
What's your plan?

569
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,877
What's my plan?

570
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:49,117
Of course I'm going to
come up with a way

571
00:31:49,236 --> 00:31:50,597
to return to the Cui Army.

572
00:31:50,756 --> 00:31:52,756
After that, I'll come back
to rescue you.

573
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:55,197
Are you serious?

574
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:57,837
Are you sure you will come back
and rescue me

575
00:31:58,117 --> 00:31:59,956
after returning to the Cui Army?

576
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,250
What are you doing?

577
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,070
What are you looking at?

578
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:12,197
Your Highness, your head alone

579
00:32:12,316 --> 00:32:13,917
is as valuable as countless cities.

580
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:15,556
How could I bear

581
00:32:15,677 --> 00:32:17,157
not to rescue you?

582
00:32:18,796 --> 00:32:20,157
You're so eloquent.

583
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:23,117
I love it.

584
00:32:24,397 --> 00:32:25,677
I love it so much.

585
00:32:36,357 --> 00:32:38,036
I never expected Young Master Cui

586
00:32:38,197 --> 00:32:39,996
to be so delicate while dealing with maidens.

587
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:40,837
Yes, Master.

588
00:32:40,996 --> 00:32:42,077
He actually enjoyed himself

589
00:32:42,516 --> 00:32:44,677
in the bathtub
with his subordinate, huh?

590
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,316
I've already ordered my men
to keep an eye on them.

591
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:48,877
However, that Lady He

592
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:50,597
is truly intelligent.

593
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,956
Not only did she block off the windows
with thick towels,

594
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:55,210
but also blocked off
the copper pipes under the floor,

595
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:57,117
for eavesdropping on them
with thick objects.

596
00:32:57,597 --> 00:32:58,996
I'm afraid our men

597
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:01,236
won't be able to acquire
any useful intel.

598
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:02,397
That doesn't matter.

599
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:05,956
I never expected Young Master Cui

600
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,956
to still have the mood

601
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:08,917
for a couple bath.

602
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:09,597
That's right.

603
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:10,917
That means

604
00:33:11,077 --> 00:33:12,437
he's extraordinary indeed.

605
00:33:13,437 --> 00:33:15,476
Although Cui Yi only has one son,

606
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:17,556
he alone can rival ten sons.

607
00:33:19,117 --> 00:33:20,077
This is interesting.

608
00:33:20,316 --> 00:33:21,476
This is interesting indeed.

609
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:41,276
What?

610
00:33:42,677 --> 00:33:43,756
I want to ask you something.

611
00:33:45,276 --> 00:33:46,236
What is it?

612
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:48,357
You haven't told me your name yet.

613
00:33:50,476 --> 00:33:52,036
You know that my surname is He, right?

614
00:33:55,716 --> 00:33:56,837
How does your young master

615
00:33:56,996 --> 00:33:58,197
address you usually?

616
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,197
What's with that question?

617
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:02,716
I don't want

618
00:34:02,837 --> 00:34:04,476
to give myself away in front of Han Li.

619
00:34:04,716 --> 00:34:06,516
I can't just call you Lady He, right?

620
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,620
If you're unwilling,

621
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,876
I'll give you a random nickname.

622
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:15,157
What kind of nickname can you give me?

623
00:34:15,517 --> 00:34:16,597
Judging from your character,

624
00:34:16,756 --> 00:34:17,957
I'm sure

625
00:34:18,077 --> 00:34:20,077
it's something dumb.

626
00:34:24,037 --> 00:34:24,916
Say,

627
00:34:25,316 --> 00:34:26,716
you do look pretty dumb.

628
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:32,276
You can call me Jin.

629
00:34:33,836 --> 00:34:35,637
You want to fool me
with a fake name again?

630
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:37,517
I won't call you that.

631
00:34:39,316 --> 00:34:40,560
Why don't I give you a nickname?

632
00:34:41,756 --> 00:34:42,436
Call you Hay.

633
00:34:43,316 --> 00:34:44,316
Or maybe Pillow.

634
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:53,117
Why are you calling me Hay?

635
00:34:53,517 --> 00:34:54,276
Or Pillow?

636
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:55,557
Guess it yourself.

637
00:34:57,756 --> 00:34:58,197
Hay?

638
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:00,236
Pillow?

639
00:35:05,117 --> 00:35:06,197
Are you mocking me?

640
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,037
I pretended to be pregnant twice.

641
00:35:08,197 --> 00:35:09,637
The first time, I stuffed hay.

642
00:35:09,796 --> 00:35:10,850
The second time, a pillow.

643
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:12,117
I dare not mock you.

644
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:15,077
You see, you know my background very well.

645
00:35:15,356 --> 00:35:16,716
I was just asking for your name,

646
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,820
yet you weren't willing to say.

647
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,890
I'm afraid that Han Li
might try to kill us.

648
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:21,410
Wouldn't it be a shame

649
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:22,677
if I died

650
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:23,436
without even

651
00:35:24,316 --> 00:35:25,517
knowing your name?

652
00:35:31,477 --> 00:35:32,517
You're so fierce.

653
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:39,916
My name is Ying.

654
00:35:43,157 --> 00:35:44,957
That's the name my mother gave me.

655
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:49,356
(Ying, huh?)

656
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:54,276
(Ying.)

657
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:01,157
What a nice name.

658
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,077
Check over there.

659
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,597
Do an inventory count.

660
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:37,517
Tie it tighter.

661
00:36:37,957 --> 00:36:38,490
There's more.

662
00:36:38,557 --> 00:36:39,316
Come.

663
00:36:39,876 --> 00:36:43,500
(Wangzhou)

664
00:36:44,756 --> 00:36:45,316
Boss!

665
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:46,316
Look!

666
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:47,756
Keep away your weapons.

667
00:36:48,077 --> 00:36:48,716
Guys.

668
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,500
We have new weapons.

669
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:50,876
Are you guys okay? Is anyone hurt?

670
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:51,716
We're fine!

671
00:36:51,957 --> 00:36:52,396
Give him.

672
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:56,197
General Pei Yuan,

673
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:57,876
I don't understand something.

674
00:36:58,037 --> 00:36:59,117
Can you explain it to me?

675
00:36:59,276 --> 00:37:00,677
You're too courteous. Ask away.

676
00:37:01,957 --> 00:37:03,197
Why did the Zhenxi Army

677
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:04,957
retreat from Wangzhou all of a sudden?

678
00:37:05,117 --> 00:37:06,557
And how did

679
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:07,957
we manage to take back Wangzhou

680
00:37:08,077 --> 00:37:09,677
under your lead?

681
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,236
I've discussed this

682
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:14,356
with Mister Shiqi before.

683
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:16,396
If our enemies have a huge force,

684
00:37:16,677 --> 00:37:17,396
we cannot defend

685
00:37:17,557 --> 00:37:18,436
Wangzhou by force.

686
00:37:18,756 --> 00:37:19,916
We can only pretend to retreat

687
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:21,197
and lay traps

688
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:22,157
in Wangzhou.

689
00:37:22,316 --> 00:37:25,077
After that, we'll poison their food
and drinking water.

690
00:37:25,236 --> 00:37:28,597
After that, we'll demoralize them
by spreading false rumors.

691
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:30,356
Lastly, we'll launch
a two-pronged attack

692
00:37:30,477 --> 00:37:31,716
and take back Wangzhou.

693
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,197
I see.

694
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:36,276
All is fair in war.

695
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:36,910
You have a point.

696
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:37,916
Chang'er, am I right?

697
00:37:38,677 --> 00:37:39,756
Let's enter the city then.

698
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,597
- Okay.
- Let's go.

699
00:37:41,517 --> 00:37:41,957
Let's go.

700
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:10,796
Your Highness,

701
00:38:10,957 --> 00:38:13,316
there's still no news
from General Yunchang.

702
00:38:13,637 --> 00:38:16,276
I wonder how he and Great Imperial Grandson
are doing right now?

703
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:22,236
No news is the best news for us.

704
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:24,836
Let's go and check on Jiang.

705
00:38:27,954 --> 00:38:29,962
(Jiang, Late Crown Prince's Concubine)

706
00:38:33,356 --> 00:38:34,276
Crown Princess.

707
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:37,396
Times have changed.

708
00:38:37,756 --> 00:38:39,716
You shouldn't address me in that manner.

709
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:42,756
Yes, Consort Xiao.

710
00:38:47,316 --> 00:38:48,436
How have you

711
00:38:49,236 --> 00:38:50,517
been doing lately?

712
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,117
I'm doing fine.

713
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:54,876
It's just

714
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:56,836
that I'm constantly worried.

715
00:38:57,396 --> 00:38:58,637
Do not worry.

716
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:01,396
I came here to tell you

717
00:39:01,997 --> 00:39:03,517
that I figured out a solution.

718
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,557
However, you'll have to wait
for a few days

719
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,110
before I can send you
out of the palace in secret.

720
00:39:09,396 --> 00:39:10,436
Your Highness,

721
00:39:10,637 --> 00:39:11,997
I will never forget your kindness.

722
00:39:12,157 --> 00:39:13,197
Hurry and get up.

723
00:39:15,477 --> 00:39:16,796
You're pregnant with

724
00:39:17,197 --> 00:39:18,557
Crown Prince's child.

725
00:39:19,037 --> 00:39:21,356
Naturally, I have to ensure your safety.

726
00:39:22,836 --> 00:39:23,517
Your Highness,

727
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,957
we shouldn't stay here any longer.

728
00:39:27,517 --> 00:39:28,396
I'll be going now.

729
00:39:28,957 --> 00:39:29,957
Find Madam Shen

730
00:39:30,197 --> 00:39:31,756
if anything happens.

731
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:33,276
Yes, Your Highness.

732
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:46,700
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

733
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:47,517
Taozi is back.

734
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,637
Young Master.

735
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,210
Do you have any news of Lieutenant He?

736
00:39:52,236 --> 00:39:52,557
Yes.

737
00:39:52,677 --> 00:39:54,997
Chen Xing and I found the latest symbol
she left behind.

738
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,900
She's in Han Li's Residence.

739
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:56,637
Han Li's Residence?

740
00:39:57,597 --> 00:39:59,316
Lieutenant He must have her own reasons.

741
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,916
I tried to infiltrate the place before.

742
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:02,276
But security was tight.

743
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,210
I didn't want to alert them.
That's why I left.

744
00:40:04,396 --> 00:40:05,396
I came back to report.

745
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,780
Chen Xing is staying in Bingzhou
to receive Lieutenant He.

746
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,957
According to a secret report,

747
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:10,836
Sun Jing's envoy
has reached Bingzhou too.

748
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,180
I heard that he was there
to deliver Han Li's reward.

749
00:40:13,197 --> 00:40:14,470
He brought two boxes of treasures

750
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,960
and 12 Golden Guards to his residence.

751
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:19,356
Han Li is so cunning.

752
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:21,597
He always tried to maintain balance

753
00:40:21,796 --> 00:40:23,197
by not offending any sides.

754
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:28,557
Taozi, take our flag, put on a disguise,
and infiltrate the city.

755
00:40:28,997 --> 00:40:30,276
Hand this to Chen Xing.

756
00:40:30,477 --> 00:40:31,916
Tell Chen Xing to see Han Li

757
00:40:32,037 --> 00:40:32,876
as the envoy of

758
00:40:33,037 --> 00:40:34,276
the Cui Army.

759
00:40:34,597 --> 00:40:35,276
Remember,

760
00:40:35,436 --> 00:40:36,597
you must act accordingly.

761
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:37,756
It's best

762
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,637
if you can use Sun Jing's envoy
to your advantage.

763
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:43,597
If Han Li still dares to detain her,

764
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,517
I'll ask him

765
00:40:46,037 --> 00:40:48,356
if he likes to witness
the strength of our army.

766
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,396
These flowers are freshly picked.

767
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:10,677
Master said you were a refined person.

768
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,356
He instructed me

769
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:14,077
to serve you with everything we have.

770
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:15,477
He ordered me

771
00:41:15,637 --> 00:41:16,836
to send you some flowers

772
00:41:16,997 --> 00:41:18,157
so that you can enjoy them.

773
00:41:18,716 --> 00:41:19,396
Thank you.

774
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:20,836
That was thoughtful of you.

775
00:41:21,597 --> 00:41:22,677
But why didn't your master

776
00:41:22,796 --> 00:41:23,997
keep his promise?

777
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:25,637
He said

778
00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:27,316
he would release her

779
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,916
if I surrendered myself.

780
00:41:29,796 --> 00:41:31,037
Why didn't he keep his promise?

781
00:41:33,396 --> 00:41:34,236
Young Master,

782
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:36,276
you misunderstood Master.

783
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:38,077
Master said

784
00:41:38,356 --> 00:41:39,557
you have a delicate body.

785
00:41:39,716 --> 00:41:41,517
Besides, the servants in our residence

786
00:41:41,677 --> 00:41:43,037
are boorish

787
00:41:43,236 --> 00:41:44,477
and clumsy.

788
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,310
We're afraid that
they might not serve you well.

789
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:49,356
Lady He

790
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:50,396
has been serving you

791
00:41:50,557 --> 00:41:52,077
all this while.

792
00:41:52,236 --> 00:41:53,597
By keeping her here,

793
00:41:54,276 --> 00:41:57,756
your needs will be taken care of.

794
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:00,316
You're so eloquent.

795
00:42:01,316 --> 00:42:02,597
Young Master, please go ahead.

796
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:06,236
I shall not disturb you.

797
00:42:28,677 --> 00:42:29,157
Don't move.

798
00:42:33,597 --> 00:42:34,677
You're pretty relaxed, huh?

799
00:42:35,356 --> 00:42:36,677
We're trapped here anyway.

800
00:42:36,836 --> 00:42:38,077
We have nothing to do here.

801
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,957
Why don't we play a game of chess?

802
00:42:41,197 --> 00:42:41,716
Sure.

803
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,077
It's only fun
if something is at stake here.

804
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,276
Something at stake, huh?

805
00:42:46,557 --> 00:42:47,276
What about this?

806
00:42:48,077 --> 00:42:49,077
If I win,

807
00:42:49,197 --> 00:42:50,716
you should give me your hairpin.

808
00:42:51,037 --> 00:42:51,957
Replace for my pearl.

809
00:42:52,396 --> 00:42:53,796
What if you lose?

810
00:42:53,957 --> 00:42:54,436
If I lose,

811
00:42:54,557 --> 00:42:55,916
you can give me
half of the food supplies.

812
00:42:59,436 --> 00:43:00,957
