(you're different from other women
in this world.)

(You've treated me differently
from everyone else since young too.)

00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:22,724
(you're aware of my deep affection, right?)

37
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:36,004
Young Master,
it's time to take your medicine.

38
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:40,764
Don't worry.

39
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,880
Taozi will definitely
find Lieutenant He.

40
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:45,764
Tomorrow, we'll continue heading southeast

41
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:46,963
and see

42
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:49,044
if we can catch up with Taozi.

43
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:50,164
Yes.

44
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:55,760
Young Master,
please take your medicine first.

45
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,861
(Guo's Residence)

46
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:08,204
Report!

47
00:03:10,683 --> 00:03:11,164
Report.

48
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,160
General Pei Yuan,

49
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,000
Guo Zhi's remaining force
has gathered reinforcements

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,960
and is now at our city gates.

51
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:16,280
What's the military strength?

52
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,040
Over ten thousand.

53
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:22,324
We're outnumbered.

54
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:24,600
We can't defend the city.

55
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:29,044
Abandon the city.

56
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:30,963
Abandon the city?

57
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:32,563
Absolutely not.

58
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:34,123
Shiqi told us

59
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:35,284
to defend the city.

60
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:36,604
If we flee without fighting,

61
00:03:36,764 --> 00:03:37,204
it's...

62
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:39,123
The enemy outnumbers us tenfold.

63
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:40,284
What can we do?

64
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:41,764
How can we fight?

65
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:43,960
Issue the order!

66
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:45,520
Abandon the city.

67
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:48,484
I have to make a quick exit again.

68
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:50,403
- I better go and pack up quickly.
- Bao.

69
00:03:54,963 --> 00:03:56,680
We still have to take care of something.

70
00:03:57,643 --> 00:04:01,044
Come on, we're abandoning the city.
Why must I do all the dirty work?

71
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,004
Everything is in the back room.

72
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:04,843
Get some more help and divide the tasks.

73
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:06,123
Be quick about it.

74
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:13,444
What are you waiting for?

75
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:14,803
Move it!

76
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:16,720
Where are you going?

77
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,524
Play with poison.

78
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:19,404
You can go in.

79
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,441
(Bingzhou)

80
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:21,284
What's this?

81
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,520
It's nothing.

82
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:23,563
Come on, hurry up.

83
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:25,323
Hey, you! Come here!

84
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:30,803
You, over there!

85
00:04:31,164 --> 00:04:31,563
Come here!

86
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:33,480
You can go.

87
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:35,844
All right.

88
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:37,440
Stop right there. Come here!

89
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:41,524
Sir.

90
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:43,440
I'm tasting to see
if they were poisoned.

91
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,123
You can go now.

92
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:50,440
You, stop right there.

93
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:52,003
Come over here.

94
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:52,883
Yes, I'm coming.

95
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:53,563
What's this?

96
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:55,003
All right.

97
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:55,924
You can go.

98
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:01,003
Stop!

99
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:02,964
I said, don't move.

100
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:04,404
Thank you.

101
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:12,284
Hello, young lady.

102
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:14,563
Where are you heading?

103
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:16,443
Are you tired from your journey?

104
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:18,763
We have an idea.

105
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:21,164
How about you raise your head

106
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:22,883
and let us see if you're pretty?

107
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:24,763
If you're pretty,

108
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:26,920
you no longer have to continue
your journey.

109
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:31,844
Dear,

110
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:33,203
I'm here.

111
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,284
My apologies, sir.

112
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:50,000
She doesn't know the protocol because
she doesn't leave the house often.

113
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:51,680
Here's some money for you
to enjoy some alcohol.

114
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,640
Please show some mercy.

115
00:05:55,763 --> 00:05:56,404
Go along now.

116
00:05:56,604 --> 00:05:57,443
Thank you.

117
00:05:58,284 --> 00:05:59,440
Let's have a drink tonight.

118
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,284
Yes, let's drink.

119
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,883
Don't think I have no idea

120
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:05,720
you're following me
just because of the military provision.

121
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:06,563
Well,

122
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:08,203
at least you're aware of it.

123
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:10,000
Get your hand off me.

124
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,253
(Tongxiang Inn)

125
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:27,844
Mister, give me a comfortable room.

126
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:29,123
All right.

127
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,596
(Does not extend credit)

128
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:34,323
We do not offer credit.

129
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:36,840
Stay in a comfortable room
for two days, right?

130
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:38,883
That would be 50 coins as the deposit.

131
00:06:39,404 --> 00:06:40,724
A deposit of 50 coins?

132
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:47,964
Mister,

133
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:49,964
can you make an exception

134
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:51,524
and let me stay today?

135
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,803
I promise to pay
for the room tomorrow, okay?

136
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:54,803
Ridiculous.

137
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:56,363
Don't stay if you don't have money.

138
00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:58,123
Look at you.

139
00:06:58,323 --> 00:07:00,040
You're dressed so shabbily
from head to toe.

140
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:00,563
I...

141
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:01,484
Go out.

142
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:02,123
Wait.

143
00:07:02,484 --> 00:07:03,484
Please make an exception.

144
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:05,123
Can't you see I'm pregnant?

145
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:06,284
- Get out.
- Mister.

146
00:07:06,924 --> 00:07:08,003
I have money.

147
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,360
There's a large group of people
coming this way.

148
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,363
Their horses are strong and fast.

149
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,840
We need to leave quickly.

150
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,883
It's so frustrating.

151
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:24,243
Guo Zhi, that scoundrel,

152
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:25,964
he's truly Sun Jing's accomplice.

153
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:27,683
They not only took over our fortress

154
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:30,800
but also chased us like rabbits,
making us run all over the mountains.

155
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:31,484
Right.

156
00:07:39,323 --> 00:07:40,084
What are you doing?

157
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:41,480
It's Young Master Cui.

158
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,924
Young Master Cui has found us.

159
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:44,560
Young Master Cui?

160
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,203
Who's that?

161
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:47,644
Sounds like a pretty boy.

162
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,763
Please come this way.

163
00:07:52,844 --> 00:07:54,744
If you need anything,
you can just let me know.

164
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:56,683
Please get some rest.

165
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,000
Stop acting already.
I'll start believing it if you keep going.

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,600
What? Are you going to prick me again
when I'm not noticing?

167
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:17,683
Don't worry.

168
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,203
If I had the chance,

169
00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:21,123
I'd surely prick you unconscious.

170
00:08:52,244 --> 00:08:53,044
Young Master.

171
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:54,963
Have you seen Lieutenant He?

172
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:56,164
We met at the fortress.

173
00:08:56,323 --> 00:08:57,323
She's safe and sound.

174
00:08:58,164 --> 00:08:58,764
But

175
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:00,083
to shake off Guo Zhi's men,

176
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:01,244
we split ways.

177
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:02,124
That's great news.

178
00:09:02,603 --> 00:09:04,360
Keep tracking Lieutenant He's
whereabouts.

179
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:05,164
Chen Xing,

180
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,164
I'll leave this matter to you.

181
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:08,960
Yes, Young Master.

182
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:09,524
See?

183
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:11,723
I told you he was a pretty boy.

184
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:18,963
Mister, what's wrong with her?

185
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:21,323
I can't detect a smooth pulse.

186
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:25,124
I'm afraid we're not able to save the baby.

187
00:09:25,284 --> 00:09:26,164
No matter.

188
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:29,284
That's not what I meant.

189
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,203
I mean the mother is more important.

190
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:34,083
Her pulse shows

191
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:36,483
that she has a bacterial infection.
Thus, the high fever.

192
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:39,044
It's likely due to an external injury
and lack of proper care.

193
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,404
Thankfully, she's quite robust.

194
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:43,160
That's why she could hold on this long.

195
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:44,284
Yes,

196
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:45,803
she injured her leg

197
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:47,044
on the mountain earlier.

198
00:09:47,884 --> 00:09:48,803
That must be the cause then.

199
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,044
I'll write a prescription.

200
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:51,800
Get the medicine
according to the prescription.

201
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,524
After that, buy some herbal pills

202
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:54,603
to grind with liquor.

203
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,483
Apply it to her wound,

204
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:58,203
and she'll recover quickly.

205
00:09:58,603 --> 00:09:59,244
Thank you.

206
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:11,320
Here you go.

207
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,920
Youde, let's have a little drink tonight.

208
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:13,803
Here you go.

209
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:16,203
Let us have some more.

210
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:16,723
Here you go.

211
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:17,924
No hurry.

212
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:19,563
The Cui Army has enough food.

213
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:21,520
If you're still hungry,
I'll go and get some more.

214
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:22,203
Thank you.

215
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:23,280
Here you go.

216
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:24,164
Thank you.

217
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:25,044
- Take it.
- Delicious.

218
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:25,963
Not bad.

219
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:29,683
Later,

220
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:31,323
I'll leave with Young Master Cui.

221
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:34,083
All right.

222
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:35,203
Eat up.

223
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:37,323
After we're done eating,

224
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:38,524
we'll set out together.

225
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:40,164
Set out?

226
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:41,803
Where are we going?

227
00:10:42,004 --> 00:10:43,603
Of course, to the Cui Army.

228
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,083
Our Cui Army

229
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:46,524
always takes care of our own.

230
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:48,843
Once you join the Cui Army,

231
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:50,764
you can have

232
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:52,164
these fine flatbreads everyday.

233
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:53,044
You mean...

234
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:53,963
- What?
- This...

235
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:55,723
Chang'er,

236
00:10:55,724 --> 00:10:57,240
I thought we were heading
to the Zhenxi Army.

237
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,080
Take your time eating.
After you're done, we can set out.

238
00:10:59,203 --> 00:11:00,803
Didn't that young lady say

239
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:02,603
she was the imperial grandson's concubine

240
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:04,004
and eloped with Shiqi

241
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,723
and that Taozi was her maidservant?

242
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:08,924
How is it that Taozi is a member
of the Cui Army?

243
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:10,603
You probably don't know this.

244
00:11:10,843 --> 00:11:12,323
She may be with the Cui Army.

245
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:14,244
But loyal to the Zhenxi Army.

246
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:15,803
Since Shiqi said she's one of us,

247
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:17,083
that means she's one of us.

248
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,563
Just eat it.

249
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:21,443
Miss Taozi,

250
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:22,803
take this flatbread back.

251
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:24,244
- We're not eating anymore.
- Yes.

252
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,284
We're not eating it.

253
00:11:25,404 --> 00:11:26,160
Take it back.

254
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,920
We're not eating it.

255
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,760
Give it back to her.

256
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,723
We're not eating anymore.

257
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:30,323
What's wrong with you?

258
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:31,924
Just eat it.

259
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:33,404
This flatbread is delicious.

260
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:34,443
Why aren't you eating it?

261
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:35,244
Why not?

262
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:36,124
That's right.

263
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,644
Just eat it.

264
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,244
After you finish eating,

265
00:11:40,004 --> 00:11:41,764
I'll take you to Wangzhou

266
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:43,124
to the Zhenxi Army.

267
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:44,843
Come on, eat up!

268
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:45,683
- All right!
- Sure!

269
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:46,644
Zhenxi Army!

270
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:47,640
We'll go to Zhenxi Army!

271
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,644
- Eat up.
- Eat up.

272
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:51,080
I can't believe
you would snatch them from me openly.

273
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:53,443
How ungrateful.

274
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:54,843
I wasn't.

275
00:11:55,963 --> 00:11:57,280
This flatbread is really delicious.

276
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,200
Do you want to try it?

277
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:27,364
If it weren't for the food supplies,

278
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:29,323
I wouldn't decoct medicine for you

279
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:31,563
or care if you live or die.

280
00:12:36,404 --> 00:12:37,203
Mother.

281
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:39,603
Mother.

282
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:41,924
Mother.

283
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:44,924
She even calls for her mother
when she's sick.

284
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,164
Mother. Mother.

285
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:10,963
Mother. Mother.

286
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:24,723
Go!

287
00:13:25,884 --> 00:13:27,124
I must survive.

288
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:28,284
Mother.

289
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:44,364
Go!

290
00:13:49,164 --> 00:13:50,164
Mother!

291
00:13:53,603 --> 00:13:55,284
You're such a cunning
and ruthless woman.

292
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:56,203
Mother.

293
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,080
Is calling for your mother
all you can do when you're sick?

294
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,644
Mother.

295
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:00,603
Mother.

296
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:01,483
Your medicine is ready.

297
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,044
Mother.

298
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,603
I'll survive.

299
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:08,364
I will survive.

300
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:16,323
Mother.

301
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:17,963
Mother.

302
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:20,963
Mother.

303
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,803
If it weren't for the food supplies,

304
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:41,080
I would have choked you to death.

305
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:27,723
What are you doing?

306
00:15:31,924 --> 00:15:32,723
Since you won't tell me

307
00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:33,924
where the military provision is

308
00:15:34,323 --> 00:15:35,644
and being a burden to me,

309
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:36,603
I think

310
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,364
I might as well just kill you.

311
00:15:43,284 --> 00:15:44,244
Kill me then.

312
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:44,404
Your leg is injured.

313
00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:47,124
Why did you climb up here?

314
00:17:08,124 --> 00:17:09,003
I'm sorry.

315
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,763
What are you apologizing for?

316
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:18,844
In fact,

317
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:20,884
after I knocked you out back then,

318
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,364
I got out of the cellar soon after.

319
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:27,963
I thought

320
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:29,844
they wouldn't kill the old couple.

321
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:33,763
I thought I could find an opportunity

322
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:34,723
to save them.

323
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:41,043
I considered myself smart and capable.

324
00:17:42,723 --> 00:17:44,084
But I never expected that in the end,

325
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:47,763
I still couldn't save them.

326
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:55,600
I saw the flowers you placed
in front of the old hunter couple's grave.

327
00:17:57,124 --> 00:17:58,480
(Also, the word "benefactor" you carved.)

328
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,314
(Benefactor)

329
00:18:01,884 --> 00:18:03,283
(I knew you would regret it.)

330
00:18:08,443 --> 00:18:09,804
(I've already buried them.)

331
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:14,364
I just regret that I couldn't save them.

332
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:19,283
When you were delirious,

333
00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:21,763
you kept calling for your mother.

334
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:25,924
When I was young,

335
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,884
I lived in a border fortress.

336
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:31,884
One day,

337
00:18:32,564 --> 00:18:34,404
all the men in the city

338
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:36,723
went out to fight.

339
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:42,243
Unexpectedly,

340
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:44,324
another group of enemies

341
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:46,084
came to attack the city.

342
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,043
At that time, my mother kept calling me,

343
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:51,400
telling me to escape
through the underground well

344
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:53,243
and save myself.

345
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:57,203
All the women left in the city

346
00:18:57,723 --> 00:18:59,124
fought bravely

347
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:01,364
until the last moment.

348
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:08,564
When I returned with my father,

349
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,084
we saw my mother

350
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:15,523
and all of the women's corpses

351
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:18,483
hanging on the city walls.

352
00:19:20,203 --> 00:19:21,483
Their blood

353
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:25,884
had stained the walls red.

354
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:27,884
I remember

355
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:30,084
the imperial court once

356
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,520
honored the wife of the military general
in Yingzhou as Heroic Lady.

357
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:35,084
When the city was captured,

358
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:39,604
she fought tirelessly without retreating
and sacrificed herself for the city.

359
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:41,644
So,

360
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:44,003
your mother

361
00:19:45,003 --> 00:19:46,644
was also one of those heroic women?

362
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:49,763
Yes.

363
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:52,404
Only one was recognized

364
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:54,443
in the official recognition.

365
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,443
But at that time,

366
00:19:58,723 --> 00:20:00,324
there were 129 military wives

367
00:20:00,844 --> 00:20:02,763
who defended the city.

368
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,804
Each one of them

369
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:08,483
was a mother.

370
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:10,683
Each one

371
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:13,924
was someone's daughter.

372
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:18,804
Yet, they willingly gave their lives

373
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:21,324
to save more people.

374
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:25,203
My father asked me

375
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:28,283
if I remembered

376
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:31,884
my mother's last words.

377
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:35,124
Ying, listen to me.

378
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:35,884
Your father

379
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:37,604
is rushing back here with his men.

380
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:39,124
After leaving, head west.

381
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:41,164
You'll surely run into your father.
Do you understand?

382
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:41,604
Go now.

383
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:41,963
Mother,

384
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,443
the enemies are already here.

385
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:46,043
You'll die if you stay.

386
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:48,804
My child,

387
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:50,483
it's my duty to defend the city.

388
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:51,483
You're still young.

389
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:53,844
So, it's your duty to survive,

390
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:54,483
do you understand?

391
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:57,844
Mother, I don't want to go.

392
00:20:57,884 --> 00:21:00,404
I want to be with you even if I'll die.

393
00:21:00,644 --> 00:21:01,844
My dear child.

394
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,443
We only have hope by staying alive.

395
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:06,844
You will only know why I die

396
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:09,564
if you stay alive.

397
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:11,523
I'm not leaving.

398
00:21:11,644 --> 00:21:12,884
When you grow up,

399
00:21:13,124 --> 00:21:15,604
only then you can help more people.

400
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:17,283
I hope one day

401
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:19,324
you can save

402
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:22,124
many people.

403
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:33,804
Go!

404
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:36,164
Go now!

405
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:38,243
No!

406
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,283
Go!

407
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:44,084
Mother told me

408
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:46,283
to stay alive.

409
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:48,844
Only when I'm alive

410
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,604
that I'll know why she died.

411
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:54,804
Only by staying alive,

412
00:21:55,804 --> 00:21:57,404
then can we see hope.

413
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:03,364
(I asked Mother to come with me.)

414
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,084
(But she said she can't leave.)

415
00:22:07,084 --> 00:22:08,483
(If they flee,)

416
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:10,963
(the enemies will capture
this important fortress.)

417
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:13,683
(When that happens,
they will kill countless people.)

418
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:16,443
(She can't leave.)

419
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:18,203
to save more people.

420
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:23,483
Was that the reason
you prick me unconscious

421
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,683
at the hunter's lodge?

422
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:29,963
Both you and I
bear great responsibilities.

423
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:32,644
Staying alive is the only hope

424
00:22:34,164 --> 00:22:35,924
for the loyalist army

425
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,203
to succeed in saving more people.

426
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:46,364
Stop drinking.

427
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:47,963
You're still on medication.

428
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:15,364
I can't believe this Xie Chang'er.

429
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:17,283
How dare he steal people from me.

430
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:18,723
The next time I see him,

431
00:23:19,003 --> 00:23:21,003
I'll make him suffer
from loose bowels for days.

432
00:23:21,124 --> 00:23:22,644
So he'll know how scary I am.

433
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:25,924
Chang'er,

434
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:29,283
I didn't expect Shiqi
is actually the imperial grandson.

435
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:31,364
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

436
00:23:35,243 --> 00:23:35,924
Mr. Zhao,

437
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:37,763
why did you hit yourself?

438
00:23:38,124 --> 00:23:39,400
I spoke without thinking in the past.

439
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:41,003
Shiqi is the imperial grandson,

440
00:23:41,124 --> 00:23:42,644
and also the commander
of the Zhenxi Army.

441
00:23:42,844 --> 00:23:43,840
This is great news!

442
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,164
Youde,

443
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:45,523
didn't we agree

444
00:23:45,644 --> 00:23:47,043
to go to the Zhenxi Army together?

445
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:47,924
At that time,

446
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:51,200
we'll follow General Pei Yuan and Shiqi
to fight the enemy and gain recognition.

447
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,483
Yes.

448
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:54,804
Great!

449
00:23:55,604 --> 00:23:56,604
We'll follow Shiqi

450
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:58,160
to fight the enemy and gain recognition!

451
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,523
Fight the enemy and gain recognition!

452
00:23:59,683 --> 00:24:01,003
Fight the enemy and gain recognition!

453
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:02,404
Fight the enemy and gain recognition!

454
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:04,324
Fight the enemy and gain recognition!

455
00:24:04,804 --> 00:24:05,324
Good!

456
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:06,523
From now on,

457
00:24:06,683 --> 00:24:07,844
we'll be comrades in arms,

458
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:08,884
like brothers!

459
00:24:10,003 --> 00:24:10,523
He's right.

460
00:24:11,844 --> 00:24:12,324
Come on.

461
00:24:13,683 --> 00:24:15,683
- Comrades in arms.
- Like brothers.

462
00:24:15,844 --> 00:24:17,844
- Comrades in arms.
- Like brothers.

463
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:20,203
- Comrades in arms!
- Like brothers!

464
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:22,644
- Comrades in arms!
- Like brothers!

465
00:24:22,657 --> 00:24:25,681
(Tongxiang Inn)

466
00:24:40,203 --> 00:24:41,243
Let's go, dear.

467
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:43,084
Slowly, I'll help you walk.

468
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:09,844
Use the chopsticks...

469
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:10,804
Don't fight!

470
00:25:10,924 --> 00:25:12,003
Stop fighting.

471
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,164
Let the children eat first.

472
00:25:15,763 --> 00:25:17,283
Mother. Mother. Mother.

473
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:18,320
Excuse me, sir.

474
00:25:19,723 --> 00:25:20,003
Yes?

475
00:25:20,124 --> 00:25:20,840
Slow down.

476
00:25:23,364 --> 00:25:24,243
What's going on?

477
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:25,960
I suppose you don't know about this.

478
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,604
As soon as the gate opened this morning,
a large number of people flooded in.

479
00:25:29,003 --> 00:25:30,644
They're saying that General Guo

480
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:31,884
had recaptured Wangzhou.

481
00:25:32,124 --> 00:25:32,924
The Zhenxi Army

482
00:25:33,043 --> 00:25:34,164
had suffered a defeat and fled.

483
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:36,164
General Guo sent troops to pursue them.

484
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:37,723
Many people were killed.

485
00:25:38,124 --> 00:25:40,003
He also said the spies

486
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,540
from the Zhenxi Army
shouldn't be spared.

487
00:25:42,283 --> 00:25:43,440
Just look at these common folks.

488
00:25:43,523 --> 00:25:44,763
Life sure is difficult for them.

489
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:49,763
Excuse me, sir.

490
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:50,644
Excuse me.

491
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:52,644
Can you tell me where are you coming from?

492
00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:53,683
What happened here?

493
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:55,963
As soon as Grand Governor Sun
issued his order,

494
00:25:56,203 --> 00:25:58,203
General Guo recaptured Wangzhou.

495
00:25:58,604 --> 00:25:59,804
He said all of us

496
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:01,483
are spies.

497
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:02,884
Just look.

498
00:26:03,003 --> 00:26:03,844
Do we look like

499
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:05,523
a group of spies?

500
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:07,443
All these fightings

501
00:26:07,604 --> 00:26:08,683
only bring misery

502
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:11,243
to the common people.

503
00:26:11,564 --> 00:26:12,963
General Guo has recaptured Wangzhou?

504
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:14,320
What about the Zhenxi Army?

505
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,243
Where did they go?

506
00:26:15,763 --> 00:26:17,283
They were all killed.

507
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,884
With their blood spilled
flowing like the river.

508
00:26:20,003 --> 00:26:22,480
- It's said several managed to escape.
- It's this scoundrel again.

509
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,600
General Guo is searching
for the spies all over the city.

510
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,443
You better leave too.

511
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:26,644
If you were caught

512
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:27,763
and mistaken as spies,

513
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:29,364
you'd lose your heads.

514
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:30,564
Just leave.

515
00:26:32,283 --> 00:26:32,963
Chang'er,

516
00:26:33,483 --> 00:26:34,963
what should we do next?

517
00:26:36,164 --> 00:26:37,003
No matter what,

518
00:26:37,564 --> 00:26:38,644
we must return to Wangzhou first.

519
00:26:41,604 --> 00:26:43,283
The Zhenxi Army
sounded pretty formidable.

520
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:44,644
How did they get defeated?

521
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,283
They may be formidable.

522
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,084
But General Guo's soldiers
outnumbered them.

523
00:26:48,203 --> 00:26:50,483
Don't forget that General Guo
has the support of Grand Governor Sun.

524
00:26:50,644 --> 00:26:51,723
I heard people say

525
00:26:51,884 --> 00:26:53,003
that Grand Governor Sun

526
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:54,763
is like a reincarnation of an evil star.

527
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:57,084
He not only killed
the Emperor's entire family,

528
00:26:57,243 --> 00:26:58,564
but he also massacred several cities.

529
00:26:58,683 --> 00:26:59,723
As soon as he occupied Wangzhou,

530
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,124
he killed countless people,

531
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:03,080
(Wolong Dried Fruits Store)
accusing them of being spies

532
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,960
from the Zhenxi Army.

533
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,523
They were clearly poor.

534
00:27:05,683 --> 00:27:06,763
What are your plans now?

535
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,483
What do you mean?

536
00:27:08,683 --> 00:27:10,364
You're following me
because of the food supply.

537
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:11,324
But now

538
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:12,283
we are in Bingzhou.

539
00:27:12,443 --> 00:27:14,124
The Zhenxi Army retreated from Wangzhou.

540
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:15,844
I don't believe you're following me

541
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:17,283
without another plan.

542
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,723
So, if I just keep following you,

543
00:27:20,124 --> 00:27:22,283
will the Cui Army split half
of the food supplies with me?

544
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:24,564
What do you think?

545
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:26,124
I'm not the type

546
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:27,924
who lets others suffer losses.

547
00:27:28,483 --> 00:27:29,564
If I want food supplies,

548
00:27:30,003 --> 00:27:31,804
I will have to trade something for it

549
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:33,723
to show my sincerity and honesty, right?

550
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:34,804
Oh my.

551
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:37,124
Your Highness,

552
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:38,364
you're the most sincere

553
00:27:39,003 --> 00:27:40,564
and honest person in the world.

554
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,884
My leg injury is already better.

555
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,440
I don't need
to keep taking medicine, right?

556
00:27:55,844 --> 00:27:57,480
Someone like you
is scared of taking medicine too?

557
00:27:58,404 --> 00:27:59,364
You better take it.

558
00:27:59,884 --> 00:28:00,924
If you don't recover well,

559
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:03,043
what if you hold me down
if we run into the enemies?

560
00:28:19,084 --> 00:28:20,124
That is more like it.

561
00:28:22,804 --> 00:28:23,683
Here's your reward.

562
00:28:24,443 --> 00:28:25,324
What's this?

563
00:28:28,963 --> 00:28:30,120
(Wolong)
Oh, preserved fruits.

564
00:28:30,804 --> 00:28:31,804
Today,

565
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:33,800
you can't take your eyes off them
in the street.

566
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,080
I thought you might like to have some.

567
00:28:35,164 --> 00:28:36,604
So, I bought a pack for you.

568
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:42,644
There's no free lunch in this world.

569
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:44,443
What do you want?

570
00:28:46,283 --> 00:28:47,924
Since you've eaten my preserved fruits,

571
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:50,364
do you want to join me

572
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:52,203
and seize Bingzhou?

573
00:28:54,564 --> 00:28:56,084
You want me to seize Bingzhou

574
00:28:57,203 --> 00:28:58,804
over a bag of preserved fruits?

575
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:01,443
Your Highness, don't you think
your idea is unrealistic?

576
00:29:05,084 --> 00:29:06,523
Bingzhou's City Lord, Han Li,

577
00:29:07,084 --> 00:29:08,283
is a devious and cunning man

578
00:29:08,364 --> 00:29:09,564
who plays both sides.

579
00:29:09,884 --> 00:29:10,564
He has long ignored

580
00:29:10,604 --> 00:29:11,564
the imperial orders.

581
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,640
He appears to get along,
but is actually estranged

582
00:29:13,644 --> 00:29:14,604
from the traitor Sun Jing.

583
00:29:15,483 --> 00:29:17,644
All that under Han Li's control
are Bingzhou and Jianzhou.

584
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:20,720
But these two cities are strategically located
in controlling both water and land routes.

585
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,124
Whether it's food supply
or troop movement,

586
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:23,924
they must pass through these two cities.

587
00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:24,723
So, not only

588
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:26,483
do you want to take Bingzhou,

589
00:29:26,844 --> 00:29:27,884
but you also intend

590
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:29,164
to conquer Jianzhou as well?

591
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:32,523
Jianzhou is only about two hundred li
from Bingzhou.

592
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,080
A fast horse ride
can get us there overnight.

593
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:35,683
The defending general in Jianzhou

594
00:29:35,844 --> 00:29:37,483
only recognizes the command badge,
not the person.

595
00:29:37,804 --> 00:29:38,364
So,

596
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:39,884
as long as we obtain
Han Li's tiger tally,

597
00:29:40,084 --> 00:29:41,523
we can take Jianzhou.

598
00:29:42,203 --> 00:29:43,404
Once we have control of Jianzhou,

599
00:29:43,523 --> 00:29:44,364
we'll recall the troops.

600
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:45,164
Then Bingzhou

601
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,443
will naturally fall into our hands.

602
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:47,924
Also,

603
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:49,164
I gathered some intel.

604
00:29:49,763 --> 00:29:51,800
Han Li recently welcomed
the birth of his first grandson.

605
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:53,480
So he'll be celebrating
the baby's birth soon.

606
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:57,443
It looks like

607
00:29:57,924 --> 00:29:59,564
we need to prepare a grand gift

608
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:01,404
to send to Han Li.

609
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:03,283
Since it's a grand gift,

610
00:30:03,364 --> 00:30:04,844
we should prepare it carefully.

611
00:30:04,884 --> 00:30:07,084
So we can win his favor.

612
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:12,084
So, this is the sincerity of you, huh?

613
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:14,483
You want to exchange Bingzhou
and Jianzhou

614
00:30:15,164 --> 00:30:16,844
for the Cui Army's food supplies?

615
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,124
It looks like

616
00:30:18,243 --> 00:30:19,443
your injury has recovered.

617
00:30:19,844 --> 00:30:20,404
Well, I guess

618
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:21,800
I don't need to be so sincere anymore.

619
00:30:22,283 --> 00:30:22,963
Starting tonight,

620
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,283
you'll sleep on the floor.

621
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:25,564
No further discussion.

622
00:30:26,164 --> 00:30:27,844
But my injury isn't fully healed yet.

623
00:30:27,924 --> 00:30:28,963
Who said my injury is healed?

624
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:30,283
I can finally sleep on a bed.

625
00:30:31,404 --> 00:30:33,560
There's not even a blanket on the floor.
How am I going to sleep?

626
00:30:35,203 --> 00:30:36,164
How could you!

627
00:30:47,203 --> 00:30:49,483
My leg injury clearly has healed.

628
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:51,600
But he insisted
that I should keep taking the medicine.

629
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:52,804
When I took the medicine,

630
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,523
he asked me to sleep on the floor.

631
00:30:54,924 --> 00:30:56,364
What's the meaning of this?

632
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:03,324
What's this?

633
00:31:03,683 --> 00:31:04,680
Open it up and take a look.

634
00:31:15,043 --> 00:31:15,960
What do you think?

635
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:17,120
It's pretty, right?

636
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,043
I spent a fortune on this.

637
00:31:19,723 --> 00:31:21,604
I have to help you scheme
against Bingzhou

638
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:23,884
over a bag of preserved fruits
you bought.

639
00:31:24,324 --> 00:31:26,124
You spent such a fortune

640
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:28,164
to buy me this outfit today.

641
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:30,364
It looks like

642
00:31:30,924 --> 00:31:32,523
you're planning something huge.

643
00:31:33,844 --> 00:31:35,723
Tomorrow is Bingzhou's market day,

644
00:31:36,243 --> 00:31:37,404
and we're going to the market.

645
00:31:38,084 --> 00:31:38,884
I'm not going.

646
00:31:39,763 --> 00:31:41,283
No, you won't refuse.

647
00:32:14,364 --> 00:32:15,283
Is this the outfit

648
00:32:15,404 --> 00:32:16,443
I got you yesterday?

649
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:18,680
Why does it look completely different
after you put it on?

650
00:32:18,963 --> 00:32:19,483
What do you know

651
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:21,003
about women's dressing?

652
00:32:21,364 --> 00:32:21,884
I especially

653
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:23,003
went to a clothing store

654
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:24,683
and exchanged it
for two better-fitting ones.

655
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:26,564
I also exchanged
the silk flower you bought

656
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:27,884
with something nicer

657
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:29,164
made from natural materials.

658
00:32:30,844 --> 00:32:32,483
You're dressing up so prettily

659
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:33,604
that it makes me feel

660
00:32:33,683 --> 00:32:35,203
a little nervous today.

661
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,604
Putting that fake belly on

662
00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:39,364
won't make me pretty
no matter how I dress up.

663
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:41,844
Of course, not.

664
00:32:42,164 --> 00:32:44,404
Even if every woman in the world
dresses this way,

665
00:32:44,523 --> 00:32:46,523
you'd still be the most beautiful one.

666
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:50,324
Your Highness, you sure know

667
00:32:50,443 --> 00:32:51,924
how to praise someone sincerely.

668
00:32:52,084 --> 00:32:52,523
I'm sure

669
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:54,644
you'll need

670
00:32:54,844 --> 00:32:56,043
a lot of my help today.

671
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:56,884
Of course.

672
00:32:57,283 --> 00:32:58,683
Since you'll be working hard,

673
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:00,164
so after you.

674
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:09,003
I just found out

675
00:33:09,483 --> 00:33:10,963
that Han Li's household
newly hired wet nurse

676
00:33:11,043 --> 00:33:12,324
has a sister-in-law,

677
00:33:12,483 --> 00:33:13,483
known as Madam Xu.

678
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:16,400
She often sets up a stall on market day,
selling soy milk and tofu.

679
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:17,963
She's a friendly and talkative person.

680
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:19,840
We'll act
according to the situation later.

681
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,120
There must be a way to get her to talk.

682
00:33:21,884 --> 00:33:22,763
In that case,

683
00:33:23,483 --> 00:33:24,564
go and buy a piece of fine cloth.

684
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:27,523
For what?

685
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:30,844
So,

686
00:33:32,683 --> 00:33:34,364
I have something
to talk to Madam Xu about.

687
00:33:34,844 --> 00:33:35,483
Silly.

688
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,203
Here is your soy milk.

689
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:45,084
Please enjoy.

690
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:45,604
Thank you.

691
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:46,203
Thank you.

692
00:33:52,644 --> 00:33:54,124
Your soy milk is delicious and thick,

693
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:55,124
really sweet.

694
00:33:55,364 --> 00:33:56,164
Of course.

695
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,963
Women from all around the area

696
00:33:58,084 --> 00:33:59,324
love drinking my soy milk.

697
00:33:59,763 --> 00:34:00,804
Indeed, it's delicious.

698
00:34:02,164 --> 00:34:02,963
Young lady,

699
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,763
did you buy this fine cloth
for your unborn child?

700
00:34:06,564 --> 00:34:07,364
Yes.

701
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:11,643
Do you not have a mother
or an older sister at home?

702
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,204
How did you know that?

703
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:17,924
If you had a mother or an older sister,

704
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:18,684
you would know

705
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:20,244
that this new cloth

706
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:21,804
can't be used for the baby's clothes.

707
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,523
It's best to alter them
from old clothing.

708
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:24,563
If you don't have any,

709
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:25,684
you'll have to wash and dry

710
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,443
this new cloth under the sun.

711
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:28,724
Then repeat the same process

712
00:34:28,804 --> 00:34:30,483
until all the starch from the cloth

713
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:31,684
is washed out so it's soft.

714
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,804
A baby's skin is so delicate.

715
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:35,804
If you use new cloth,
it'll surely chafe the baby's skin.

716
00:34:37,123 --> 00:34:38,123
Thank you very much.

717
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:39,684
If you didn't tell me,

718
00:34:39,804 --> 00:34:41,324
I wouldn't know any of this before.

719
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:42,720
I could have made a big mistake.

720
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,204
You don't need to thank me.

721
00:34:44,324 --> 00:34:46,244
I'm just glad you don't blame me
for being too talkative.

722
00:34:47,123 --> 00:34:48,844
The soy milk you make is delicious.

723
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:49,924
And you're so warm-hearted.

724
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:51,603
No wonder everyone nearby says

725
00:34:51,684 --> 00:34:53,764
you're a wonderful person.

726
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:56,083
Oh, my. You're flattering me.

727
00:34:58,643 --> 00:34:59,324
Dear,

728
00:34:59,804 --> 00:35:01,200
I'm craving for preserved fruits.

729
00:35:01,284 --> 00:35:02,844
Can you go and buy some for me?

730
00:35:03,324 --> 00:35:04,924
I'd like to rest here for a while.

731
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,404
In the meantime, I can ask

732
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:07,924
for Madam Xu's guidance

733
00:35:08,244 --> 00:35:09,764
about a lot of things.

734
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:12,003
All right, dear.

735
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:14,464
(Wolong Dried Fruits Store)

736
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:16,244
Take care.

737
00:35:35,324 --> 00:35:36,483
Here, have another bowl.

738
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:36,884
Dear.

739
00:35:36,963 --> 00:35:37,760
Enjoy your soy milk.

740
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,920
You like this shop's, right?

741
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,163
(Wolong)
Yes, this is the one.

742
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,643
Your husband sure is thoughtful

743
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:43,684
and caring.

744
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:46,280
Madam, here's the money
for the soy milk.

745
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,764
Thank you.

746
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:47,603
Come.

747
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:50,563
Madam Xu,

748
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:51,443
I should go home

749
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:52,643
after spending all morning here.

750
00:35:52,764 --> 00:35:54,324
Thank you for talking to me.

751
00:35:54,643 --> 00:35:56,123
Business is slow in the afternoon.

752
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:57,884
If you have time, please come again.

753
00:35:57,963 --> 00:35:59,204
I'll make tofu pudding for you.

754
00:35:59,884 --> 00:36:00,443
All right.

755
00:36:00,523 --> 00:36:01,760
We'll definitely come again.

756
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,724
All right, take care.

757
00:36:02,884 --> 00:36:03,680
We'll get going now.

758
00:36:07,404 --> 00:36:08,364
What did you find out?

759
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:11,884
I found out everything clearly
about this wet nurse in Han's Residence.

760
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,960
Her life history, likes, dislikes,
and preferences.

761
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,684
It's all within my grasp.

762
00:36:16,483 --> 00:36:17,443
Anything useful?

763
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:19,563
This wet nurse

764
00:36:19,684 --> 00:36:21,324
enjoys eating soft tofu,

765
00:36:21,404 --> 00:36:22,364
loves millet,

766
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:24,003
and likes to eat
a type of pickled vegetable.

767
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:26,324
The locals called it sweet basil.

768
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:29,123
So, what are you suggesting?

769
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:31,204
I know a bit about medicine.

770
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:33,204
When these foods are eaten together,

771
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,483
it's harmless for the adults.

772
00:36:34,804 --> 00:36:36,804
But if a baby consumes
her milk through breastfeeding,

773
00:36:36,924 --> 00:36:38,324
it'll cause stomach discomfort
and diarrhea.

774
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:39,324
In serious cases,

775
00:36:39,443 --> 00:36:41,163
it will cause rashes.

776
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:42,204
I indirectly inquired

777
00:36:42,324 --> 00:36:43,844
about it with Madam Xu.

778
00:36:43,924 --> 00:36:45,244
The wet nurse in Han's Residence

779
00:36:45,324 --> 00:36:46,844
gave birth to two children herself.

780
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:48,443
When her babies
were three to four days old,

781
00:36:48,603 --> 00:36:49,643
they did suffer such symptoms.

782
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:51,924
So...

783
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,123
So

784
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:54,244
those from Han's Residence

785
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:56,043
will definitely ask for a physician.

786
00:37:46,043 --> 00:37:46,563
A gift for you.
