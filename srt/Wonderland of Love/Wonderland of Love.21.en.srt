Mister Shiqi...

31
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,318
Bao.

32
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,039
What's the matter, Ear?

33
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,277
The people from the palace

34
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:56,919
have been waiting for almost an hour.

35
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,518
They keep urging me

36
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,639
to check if Mister Shiqi's up yet.

37
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,557
We told them, didn't we?

38
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:04,397
Lord Qin is sick.

39
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:05,557
He's terribly ill.

40
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,878
He's bedridden.

41
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:08,917
But...

42
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:09,720
Bao, you go.

43
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,480
Chang'er can't lie to save his life.

44
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,439
He'll slip up
if they keep asking questions.

45
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,639
Oh, my back! My back... It hurts!

46
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,278
I can't get up.

47
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,398
What will it take

48
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,199
to make it better, Bao?

49
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,118
I need

50
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:33,237
Fengying Pavillion's grilled meat.

51
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:34,438
But that's some pricey meat.

52
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,838
I can't afford it.

53
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:38,319
I heard it costs three strings of coins.

54
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:44,917
Can do.

55
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:45,917
Lord Qin,

56
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:48,038
I'll see to it
that those palace attendants

57
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,077
are sent on their way.

58
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:51,278
I won't let them disturb Your Highness.

59
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,958
Give me the umbrella.

00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:05,060
(Changzhou City)

61
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:08,219
(Recalling...)

62
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,879
Lieutenant He,

63
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:18,238
is this letter ready to be sent?

64
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:20,118
I thought...

65
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,838
You thought what?

66
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,879
I thought

67
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,518
you would explain to Lord Qin.

68
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:30,917
After all,

69
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,958
we have taken Changzhou,
haven't we?

70
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:36,158
Li Ni asked for my help,

71
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,678
and I should just help him?

72
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,878
I came for Changzhou City.

73
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,477
How else can we justify it

74
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:42,879
to our Cui Army soldiers?

75
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:44,759
Besides,

76
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:46,998
he made the Cui Army

77
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:49,159
come here with this letter.

78
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:50,797
Shouldn't I get

79
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,319
some compensation myself?

80
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,238
Grand Governor.

81
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:17,079
Do not spread word of this.

82
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,398
It could affect morale.

83
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,399
Yes.

84
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,598
It's just

85
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,638
that the poison is so vicious,

86
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,117
we should find out

87
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:26,758
who is behind this.

88
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:30,998
No need.

89
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:33,038
I fear leaving such a threat

90
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,599
by your side, Grand Governor.

91
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:37,479
The 100,000 troops
which conquered Baiyue

92
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,558
suffered losses during the journey,

93
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,758
and only

94
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,558
60,000 returned.

95
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,917
I didn't expect

96
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:45,398
to lose them

97
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,159
in Changzhou again.

98
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,718
That old Cui Yi is truly

99
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:52,599
a formidable enemy.

100
00:04:53,678 --> 00:04:54,758
Grand Governor,

101
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,278
Cui Yi has taken Changzhou.

102
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,159
We may stand a chance

103
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:00,839
if he clashes with the court.

104
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:09,278
Only Li Ni can confront Cui Yi

105
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,118
in the court.

106
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,557
I suspect
that Cui Yi's southern campaign

107
00:05:14,558 --> 00:05:16,758
was most likely Li Ni's idea.

108
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,838
To think that a day would come

109
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,677
where I, Sun Jing,

110
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:22,719
find myself in such a state.

111
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,877
For now,

112
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:27,360
we can only hold Tong Pass

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,719
and capture the great imperial grandson,
Li Xuanze, as soon as possible,

114
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,399
to break the deadlock.

115
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,518
For days,

116
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,678
Li Ni has refused
to obey the imperial edict!

117
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,797
This rebellious son!

118
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,917
He's trying to infuriate me to death!

119
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:43,518
A few more days,

120
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,557
and the Cui family's forces

121
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:46,638
will reach Xichang!

122
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,279
Father,

123
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:52,437
the Cui family has taken over Changzhou.

124
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:56,558
They could take over Danzhou and Luzhou
anytime they want if they willed.

125
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:58,118
We are in a critical state.

126
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,758
Yet, Li Ni refuses to obey orders

127
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,880
and consider the bigger picture,
he deserves to be punished.

128
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,798
Punishment again!

129
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,359
That's all you know!

130
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:07,477
If I punished Lord Qin,  would you
go to command the troops in his stead?

131
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:08,919
Can you do it?

132
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:11,719
Jun.

133
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,318
Jun!

134
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,117
Don't take Father's words to heart.

135
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:17,278
He only reprimanded you

136
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,039
because he loves you deeply.

137
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,838
That Ni as well.
He usually understands the big picture.

138
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,598
Why has he suddenly

139
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:24,839
become so temperamental?

140
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,238
Can't you see it?

141
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:31,038
Li Ni is doing this deliberately.

142
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:31,718
He's using this

143
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,519
to make Father angry with me.

144
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,878
Jun,

145
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,279
a few days ago,
I went to Ni's residence,

146
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,237
hoping to mediate.

147
00:06:39,238 --> 00:06:40,117
If I could persuade Ni,

148
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:42,519
the matter would be resolved.

149
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:45,917
But Ni showed me no tact.

150
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:46,437
I advise you

151
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,519
not to touch this matter again.

152
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:50,678
You'll only humiliate yourself.

153
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:52,519
Jun...

154
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:12,678
Father.

155
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,279
Why did you return?

156
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,438
Father,

157
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,718
I figure Ni might have something in mind

158
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:24,558
when he refused to lead the troops.

159
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:27,039
Something in mind?

160
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,159
Elaborate.

161
00:07:32,678 --> 00:07:35,238
The war in Changzhou is tense.

162
00:07:35,878 --> 00:07:37,557
I think it's better
if you give into his demands

163
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,238
if he has any, Father.

164
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,038
Then ask him

165
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,519
what is it that he wants.

166
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,677
I can't ask him directly.

167
00:07:44,678 --> 00:07:45,758
If I do,

168
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,758
Ni will definitely evade the question.

169
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,238
Nonsense!

170
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,278
I'm his father!

171
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,599
Why can't I ask him?

172
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:55,917
Rest assured, Father.

173
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:57,638
I will do my best to find out

174
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,758
and persuade Ni to lead the troops.

175
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,638
It's good that you understand me, Lai.

176
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,079
Your brother is reckless.

177
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,758
I can't count on him.

178
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,838
(On the banks
of the Han River near Changzhou,)

179
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,359
(the fish are plump and delicious.)

180
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:25,117
(Boatmen catch fresh fish
and sell them in the city,)

181
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:26,878
(grilled to perfection.)

182
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,038
(Recalling the jests from our travels,)

183
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,437
(I can't help but smile.)

184
00:08:30,438 --> 00:08:31,838
(I look forward to the day you come,)

185
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,758
(so we can enjoy
the grilled fish together.)

186
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:35,559
Mister Shiqi!

187
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,079
Mister Shiqi!

188
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,319
Mister Shiqi.

189
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,839
You reek of alcohol.

190
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,837
Mister Shiqi,

191
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:48,278
you were right.

192
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,677
Guards of Lord Qi's Residence

193
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:51,837
did invite me to drink with them.

194
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:52,559
How did it go?

195
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,238
We drank three jars of good liquor.

196
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,398
Per your instructions,

197
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,158
I boasted with them for quite a while,

198
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,518
and slipped that statement

199
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,719
in the midst of the banter.

200
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,638
Let's see if Li Lai catches on.

201
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,638
Mister Shiqi,

202
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,878
where are you going?

203
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,797
Fishing.

204
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:15,878
Fishing?

205
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:17,040
One needs to brush up

206
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,100
on one's fishing skills first
before one can grill fish.

207
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,797
Why is the floor all wet?

208
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:28,638
Mind your step, Lord Qi.

209
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,758
It's fine.

210
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:31,599
Ni.

211
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,278
Ni.

212
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,038
Lai!

213
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,238
What brings you here?

214
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,557
I've come to visit you.

215
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:38,038
Are you feeling better?

216
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,238
Oh, to be honest with you,

217
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:43,158
the imperial physician said
my vitality is greatly depleted.

218
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:44,638
He advised me

219
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,077
to sit quietly by the water

220
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:47,998
to absorb
the essence of heaven and earth.

221
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:49,317
But, you know,

222
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:50,837
Father ordered me
to reflect in seclusion

223
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:51,918
and not leave my residence.

224
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:52,797
So,

225
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:54,278
I came up with an idea.

226
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:55,358
Look,

227
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,917
I'm sitting

228
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:58,278
by the water now,

229
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:00,679
though this pond is a bit small.

230
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:01,518
I had them

231
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,439
sprinkle water all around this area.

232
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,717
It's a clever idea.

233
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:09,359
It kills two birds with one stone.

234
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:13,079
Well, I'm just trying to recover
from my illness as soon as possible.

235
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:15,158
Ni,

236
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,479
I'm here today for another reason.

237
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,158
I've persuaded Father

238
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,038
to return the Zhenxi Army to you.

239
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:23,797
How can that be?

240
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:26,038
Under the heavens, there is no land
that is not the emperor's,

241
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,338
and within the land, there is
no subject that is not his vassal.

242
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:30,797
The Zhenxi Army is the military power
of the court.

243
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,479
How can you say it is mine?

244
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,079
Ni,

245
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:40,758
Changzhou

246
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,317
has been occupied by Cui Yi,

247
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:44,638
Sun Jing is entrenched in Tong Pass,

248
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:48,319
and Xichang is in imminent danger.

249
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:50,677
Jun acted recklessly,

250
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:52,599
and Father has already reprimanded him.

251
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:55,717
Father has decreed in his edict

252
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:56,717
that you should resume

253
00:10:56,718 --> 00:10:58,837
the role of commander-in-chief,

254
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:00,317
taking charge of Zhenxi Army affairs,

255
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:02,559
and immediately lead troops
to reinforce Changzhou.

256
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,638
If you still refuse to reconcile,

257
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,158
then I can only apologize to you

258
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,559
on Father's behalf.

259
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:10,758
Lai.

260
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,679
You doing this will paint me

261
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:16,158
as disloyal and unfilial.

262
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:17,437
Father just wants you

263
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:19,398
to accept the imperial decree.

264
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,998
If I accept the decree,

265
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,998
provisions and troops
must not be withheld.

266
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:27,998
Of course.

267
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:38,518
Although my health is deteriorating,

268
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,038
with your sincere request

269
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,679
and Father's earnest expectation,

270
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:46,319
I'll reluctantly

271
00:11:46,558 --> 00:11:48,559
accept it.

272
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:53,518
You understand the greater good.

273
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,038
Lieutenant He.

274
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,518
Lieutenant He,

275
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:05,278
Lord Qin really is coming.

276
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:06,518
(The Art of War)
Let him come.

277
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:08,717
You mentioned

278
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:10,278
inviting him for grilled fish.

279
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:11,437
He's quite something.

280
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:12,478
Without saying a word,

281
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:15,077
he led troops straight to Changzhou.

282
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:16,837
So what if he does?

283
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:18,359
Can't he just bring his troops

284
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,038
and enjoy grilled fish with us?

285
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,599
That's not what I meant.

286
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:27,038
Lieutenant He,

287
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,998
do you think

288
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:29,278
we've fallen into his trap?

289
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,199
Look,

290
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:32,559
he first wrote to us

291
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:33,917
and instructed us

292
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:36,319
to help General Pei Yuan

293
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,278
and annihilate

294
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,118
Sun Jing's army which conquered Baiyue.

295
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:41,998
But in the blink of an eye,

296
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:43,437
he's leading his troops

297
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:44,799
straight to Changzhou.

298
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:49,158
If Li Ni is really capable,

299
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:51,079
he should recapture

300
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,398
Changzhou City.

301
00:12:54,718 --> 00:12:55,878
Take a look.

302
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,717
We've gathered quite a bit.

303
00:12:57,718 --> 00:12:59,359
With what we collected last time,

304
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,758
I figure

305
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,197
we should have at least 20 taels.

306
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,398
That's great!

307
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,918
We can finally redeem Madam Qin and Xi
from the theater troupe.

308
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:08,480
That's why they say

309
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,957
it's better to be a dog
in times of peace

310
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,439
than a person in chaotic times.

311
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,957
How many people do you think

312
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,597
couldn't survive the chaos of war?

313
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:16,720
Take Madam Qin, for example.

314
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,697
After performing for years,
she still ended up in debt.

315
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,278
The troupe owner forced her
into prostitution

316
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,238
and even tried to sell
her daughter to a brothel.

317
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:25,077
If it weren't for us,

318
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:25,837
she and her daughter

319
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,360
might have been forced
to drown themselves.

320
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:29,317
Saving people is a righteous act.

321
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:30,957
Why did we rise up

322
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,118
from Mingdai Mountain,

323
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:33,437
join Zhenxi Army,

324
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,839
and follow Mister Shiqi into battle?

325
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,957
Isn't it to bring peace

326
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,280
and allow more poor people

327
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,880
to live a better life
after the chaos settles?

328
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,599
Isn't that right?

329
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,278
Youde is right.

330
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,077
Youde is right.

331
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,158
Youde is right.

332
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,278
Let me think

333
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,317
and come up with another way
to make some money.

334
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:48,918
If we help, we help to the end.

335
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,317
We must find a good place

336
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:52,437
for Madam Qin and Xi to settle.

337
00:13:52,438 --> 00:13:53,837
- Yes.
- That's right.

338
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:54,797
Bottoms up!

339
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:56,599
Bottoms up!

340
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:04,998
Young Master.

341
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,719
I heard that Lord Qin
has taken command of Zhenxi Army again

342
00:14:07,838 --> 00:14:09,199
and is coming to reclaim Changzhou.

343
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,500
(Jieshuo Grassland)

344
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,199
Chief Wuluo.

345
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:40,878
It seems

346
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,917
that your body has fully recovered.

347
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:43,599
Yes.

348
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,038
(Jieshuo, Wuluo)
I promised to save you,

349
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,479
and now it's your turn

350
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,799
to fulfill what you promised me.

351
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,998
You used your clan's
life-extending method

352
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,679
to save my life,

353
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,597
making my previously ailing body

354
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:02,679
healthy like an ordinary person's.

355
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,758
I can still draw my bow

356
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,079
and shoot like a warrior,

357
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:08,998
but I cannot hand over

358
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:12,038
Cui Army's defense map of Yingzhou to you.

359
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,038
Nor can I join you

360
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,559
in attacking Yingzhou.

361
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:23,839
Are you planning
to go back on your word?

362
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:27,518
Keep in mind

363
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,359
that you have taken
the life-extending medicine.

364
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:32,717
If I stop giving you

365
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:35,079
the medicine on time,

366
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:36,837
your bones will break,

367
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:40,559
and you will die.

368
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,719
You said this before.

369
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,479
Eagles soar in the wilderness

370
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,599
because they have found prey.

371
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,479
Even the bison shivers

372
00:15:55,558 --> 00:15:57,959
when the eagles spread their wings
in the mountains.

373
00:15:59,838 --> 00:16:02,199
I know the tricks and schemes
of those of the Central Plains.

374
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:04,398
I also know

375
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,679
how to make them
turn against each other.

376
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:12,118
If you are willing to trust me,

377
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:14,319
send a team to infiltrate

378
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,878
the Central Plains with me.

379
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,398
I will ensure that you'll see the returns

380
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,359
for saving my life.

381
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,878
As soon as Lord Qin leaves Xichang,

382
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,918
we will have the opening to attack.

383
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:32,479
He's in the open,

384
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:33,998
I'm in the shadows.

385
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,118
There's plenty of time

386
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,998
to plan.

387
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,559
Lord Qin has arrived near Changzhou.

388
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,719
We have a chance to strike now.

389
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,799
Ying,

390
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:48,998
this time,

391
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:51,238
I will do whatever it takes

392
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:53,679
to get you back to my side.

393
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,238
Great General.

394
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,918
Time for your medicine.

395
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:12,637
I've been drinking this medicine
for more than ten years,

396
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:14,878
and I don't know when it'll end.

397
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,117
Good medicine tastes bitter
but is beneficial to health.

398
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:19,317
Your old injuries

399
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:20,958
always flare up on rainy days,

400
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,918
that's why

401
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,599
you mustn't stop taking this medicine.

402
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,878
Come on, drink it.

403
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:27,317
It's good for your health.

404
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:28,357
Yes, I know.

405
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:30,359
You're the only one
who can order me around.

406
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,357
I heard that the emperor has ordered Li Ni

407
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:38,918
to lead troops to Changzhou.

408
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:42,880
Changzhou is easy to defend
and difficult to attack.

409
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,319
Even if he comes, so what?

410
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,999
Is Father afraid of him?

411
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,597
Let me make this clear first.

412
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:51,599
I won't be showing any mercy

413
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,640
in this confrontation with Lord Qin
on the battlefield.

414
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,518
You mustn't hold back at all, Father.

415
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:57,478
Li Ni is young and arrogant.

416
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,758
We must show him

417
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,519
my father's might.

418
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:02,239
Of course.

419
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,397
(Changzhou)

420
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:05,039
Here you go.

421
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:06,317
Please take this.

422
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,478
Take care.

423
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:08,478
Lieutenant He.

424
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:09,730
This rose lychee cherry blossom pastry

425
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,120
(Tang Confectionery)
from Tang Confectionery looks really pretty.

426
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,640
Look,

427
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,759
it's like a flower,

428
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,158
and it has a pretty name too.

429
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:17,758
Oh,

430
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,117
you little glutton.

431
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:20,359
It tastes great.

432
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:23,718
Wait for me.

433
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:24,958
Don't walk so fast.

434
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,638
Young Master?

435
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,158
Young Master?

436
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:16,918
Young Master?

437
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:36,438
Who are you?

438
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:39,279
Why did you impersonate Young Master
and lure me here?

439
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:55,559
Don't hurt her!

440
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,040
Lieutenant He, are you all right?

441
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:11,039
Oh no! Be careful!

442
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:12,478
They're using poison!

443
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,157
What are your plans

444
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:17,438
in Changzhou?

445
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,878
Are you actually planning

446
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,637
to lead the army
to charge straight through

447
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,599
and fight to the death
with the Cui Army?

448
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,478
Of course not.

449
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:28,958
I have another plan to obtain Changzhou.

450
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,678
Make the Cui Army
withdraw from Changzhou

451
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,918
without drawing swords?

452
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:37,357
Lieutenant He

453
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:39,239
never lets herself suffer any losses.

454
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,317
You wrote a letter

455
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:42,157
asking her to save General Pei Yuan.

456
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,117
Well, she did.

457
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,397
But she also occupied Changzhou
in the process.

458
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:48,559
That's so calculative of her.

459
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,678
Mister Shiqi,

460
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,319
you're definitely going

461
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,557
to be a henpecked husband.

462
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:57,079
You can't outsmart her.

463
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:58,918
Can we get down to business?

464
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,599
Isn't this business?

465
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,079
General, a carrier pigeon
has delivered a message.

466
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:08,478
How did this pigeon find you?

467
00:21:09,258 --> 00:21:10,860
Training it
must have been quite difficult.

468
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,877
There's nothing too difficult

469
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:14,198
for someone determined.

470
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,157
Do you think pigeon meat

471
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:18,079
tastes good?

472
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,438
I'm just a rough guy.

473
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,157
I'm satisfied with the grilled meat

474
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,278
from Fengying Pavilion.

475
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,039
Last time, you said your back hurt,

476
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,918
and I gave you some money, didn't I?

477
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:29,998
Well, I had some expenses

478
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,279
before leaving the capital.

479
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:33,638
Bao,

480
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:36,039
try to save up when you can.

481
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:38,120
When the day comes
that we don't have to fight anymore,

482
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,039
you can return home, buy some land,

483
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:41,720
and get yourself a wife.
Wouldn't that be nice?

484
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:45,518
We'll cross the bridge
when we get to it.

485
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,478
When it is time

486
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:48,198
to remove my armor and retire,

487
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:50,438
I will save up to buy some land

488
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,478
and get a wife, of course.

489
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,278
But for now,

490
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,797
Mister Shiqi,

491
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:57,797
do you think

492
00:21:57,798 --> 00:21:59,599
pigeon meat tastes good?

493
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,839
Thanks.

494
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,519
Off you go!

495
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,798
(Someone tried to kill Lieutenant He
and she has been poisoned.)

496
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,079
Young Master,

497
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,799
stop drinking.

498
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:39,320
Drinking in the middle of the night
is harmful to your health.

499
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:47,398
I wonder if Ying's poison

500
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:51,878
has been cured.

501
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,678
Young Master,

502
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,118
we won't be able to force Li Ni out

503
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,077
if we don't use this method.

504
00:22:58,078 --> 00:22:59,998
If the Lieutenant He blames you,

505
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:02,079
just say it was my idea.

506
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:03,158
No.

507
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:06,678
She won't blame me.

508
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:13,319
Ying is about to marry me.

509
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:16,519
How could she blame me?

510
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,198
Is the dessert soup ready already?

511
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:49,039
Why is it you?

512
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:51,918
Why couldn't it be me?

513
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,918
You've acquired Changzhou.

514
00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:55,397
Shouldn't I sneak in late at night

515
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:56,117
and kidnap you

516
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:57,559
in exchange for Changzhou?

517
00:23:57,878 --> 00:23:59,839
If Your Highness wanted to kidnap me,

518
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,878
why did you bring the dessert soup?

519
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,357
I have to coax you

520
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,998
into coming with me.

521
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:06,518
I came alone.

522
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,138
If you made a fuss,
and I failed to kidnap you,

523
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:10,519
and ended up getting captured myself,
wouldn't that be a great loss?

524
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,478
You think you can get me to comply
with just a bowl of dessert soup?

525
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:14,718
Besides,

526
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,837
you didn't

527
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:17,157
make this.

528
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:18,597
Taozi did.

529
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:20,638
I don't see your sincerity at all.

530
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:22,718
Aren't you afraid

531
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:24,117
I'll call them to come in

532
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:25,397
and tie you up

533
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:26,918
and hand you over to my father?

534
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:28,038
Do whatever you want.

535
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,837
It's just as well that I'm here to discuss
the matter of Changzhou

536
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:32,079
with Great General Cui.

537
00:24:34,078 --> 00:24:35,958
Now, drink your medicine.

538
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:38,198
I got quite the scare
when I received Taozi's message

539
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,397
from the carrier pigeon.

540
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:40,718
I rushed here immediately.

541
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,758
Here.

542
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,478
It must be bitter.

543
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:45,319
I'll taste it for you.

544
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:49,077
Why did you just drink it?

545
00:24:49,078 --> 00:24:50,357
This is the antidote to the poison.

546
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:51,760
It's all about
fighting poison with poison.

547
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
There's a high chance
that the antidote is poisonous too.

548
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,557
How could you drink it so carelessly?

549
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:57,397
I didn't know.

550
00:24:57,398 --> 00:24:59,438
Why didn't you tell me it was poisonous?

551
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:01,759
Oh, dear.

552
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,958
Are you all right?

553
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:06,077
Shiqi!

554
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:07,238
I feel awful...

555
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,438
Shiqi!

556
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,077
Are you all right, Shiqi?

557
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:12,239
What's wrong?

558
00:25:13,158 --> 00:25:14,359
Shiqi!

559
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:17,478
Shiqi! Wake up!

560
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:19,638
Shiqi!

561
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,157
Well?

562
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:33,198
It's not bitter, right?

563
00:25:33,878 --> 00:25:35,397
How dare you trick me!

564
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:36,438
I would never.

565
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:38,338
I'm just helping you taste
how bitter this medicine is.

566
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:39,398
It's not bitter, isn't it?

567
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,518
Don't believe me?

568
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,718
Try again.

569
00:25:50,838 --> 00:25:51,998
Hurry and leave.

570
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:53,198
Too late.

571
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:54,999
Surround the perimeter!

572
00:26:13,158 --> 00:26:14,958
Lord Qin,

573
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,397
you dare to sneak into Changzhou at night

574
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:19,839
and trespass into my residence.

575
00:26:22,358 --> 00:26:23,638
It's been several months.

576
00:26:24,078 --> 00:26:25,678
Great General Cui, have you been well?

577
00:26:26,158 --> 00:26:27,398
Lieutenant He,

578
00:26:28,018 --> 00:26:31,317
this man sneaked into General's Residence
in the middle of the night

579
00:26:31,318 --> 00:26:32,958
to coerce you into revealing information

580
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,039
to take over Changzhou, is that correct?

581
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,317
No, Great General...

582
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:37,077
Men.

583
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:40,039
Take this intruder away.

584
00:26:40,638 --> 00:26:41,718
Great General!

585
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,117
It's not what you think it is!

586
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:44,239
No!

587
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:45,559
Lieutenant He.

588
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:51,118
Breaking into the General's Residence

589
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:53,198
with the intention
of stealing military secrets.

590
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:54,918
You know how it is to be dealt with

591
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,958
according to the regulations
of the Cui Army.

592
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:00,599
For the next few days,

593
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,438
you shall be restricted
to your quarters as well,

594
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:07,319
to prevent you from releasing him.

595
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:45,079
Taozi!

596
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:46,718
Why are you here?

597
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:48,038
What's happening outside?

598
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,998
Great General threw Lord Qin
into the water dungeon.

599
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:51,077
When I heard,

600
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:52,557
I tried to get information,

601
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:53,958
but I was found out.

602
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:54,918
Great General sent his men

603
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:56,317
to bring me back.

604
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:57,518
He also told me

605
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,758
that neither you nor I

606
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,557
are allowed to step out of this room.

607
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:01,637
Otherwise,

608
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,438
we will be dealt with
according to military law.

609
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,438
Li Ni claims to be

610
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:08,958
the best scout in the Zhenxi Army.

611
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,878
(Yet, he got caught by Father)

612
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:11,718
(just like that)

613
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:12,958
(for trying to sneak in to see me.)

614
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,279
(What should we do now?)

615
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:17,157
(If he's the best scout,)

616
00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:18,278
he shouldn't leave himself

617
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,999
without a way out, right?

618
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,438
What way out?

619
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,759
Where's your whistle?

620
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:26,557
Right, if Lord Qin is here,

621
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:27,758
Ear is likely here too.

622
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,478
I'll use the whistle to call him.

623
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,438
Lieutenant He,

624
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:55,877
it's already daylight,

625
00:28:55,878 --> 00:28:57,478
but Ear hasn't come.

626
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:59,918
Lord Qin wouldn't come alone, would he?

627
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,079
He wouldn't.

628
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,878
Xie Chang'er must be here too.

629
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,597
Lieutenant He. Taozi.

630
00:29:11,598 --> 00:29:12,799
Breakfast.

631
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:25,638
Taozi!

632
00:29:28,078 --> 00:29:29,278
What took you so long?

633
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,518
I've almost worn out my whistle.

634
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,918
I thought you wouldn't come.

635
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:32,718
I knew

636
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:33,797
you would find a way

637
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:34,758
to see us.

638
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:35,918
I came late.

639
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,357
Security here is tight.

640
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,597
It took me a lot of effort

641
00:29:38,598 --> 00:29:40,519
to knock out one person and get in.

642
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:41,837
I'm sorry.

643
00:29:41,838 --> 00:29:43,118
I'll forgive you this time.

644
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,279
Where's Mister Shiqi?

645
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:47,397
Lord Qin has been locked
in the water dungeon.

646
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:49,058
Lieutenant He and I
are under house arrest too.

647
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:50,759
That's why we needed your help.

648
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,557
No wonder I waited outside all night

649
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:53,758
and didn't see him.

650
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,597
He's now locked in the water dungeon.

651
00:29:55,598 --> 00:29:56,557
You have to help me

652
00:29:56,558 --> 00:29:57,918
to get him out.

653
00:29:58,318 --> 00:29:59,999
But how can I help?

654
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:03,278
Your outfit

655
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,878
will come in handy.

656
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:17,478
I can't believe

657
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:19,518
the higher-ups would send breakfast
to a spy like you.

658
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:20,518
If you ask me,

659
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,239
they should've let you starve.

660
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:38,478
It's tougher than a rock.

661
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,359
Will you worry about me,

662
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,359
knowing I'm locked up here?

663
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,637
Are you taking your medicine

664
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:01,438
on time?

665
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,877
Your father is so strict.

666
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:07,079
Maybe

667
00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:08,718
when I get out of here,

668
00:31:08,838 --> 00:31:10,438
we should elope.

669
00:31:10,598 --> 00:31:11,759
What do you say?

670
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:15,878
Let's do that.

671
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,718
You're here.

672
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:31,278
You were thrown into the dungeon
because of me.

673
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,958
Of course, I had to come and see you.

674
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:34,837
Did you say yes

675
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:36,158
to my proposal?

676
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,839
What proposal?

677
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:39,878
To elope.

678
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,359
And what if I change my mind?

679
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,718
This time,

680
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:45,998
I'm not letting you go,

681
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:47,718
no matter what.

682
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:52,357
All right.

683
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:52,877
Since I see

684
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,278
you're lively and well,

685
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,758
I don't have to worry anymore.

686
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,117
You just stay here

687
00:31:57,118 --> 00:31:58,278
in the cell.

688
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,797
When my father calms down,

689
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:01,599
he'll let you out.

690
00:32:04,078 --> 00:32:05,359
Are you really leaving?

691
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:06,759
You're not kidding?

692
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,039
You're really leaving?

693
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:10,438
Soldier!

694
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,998
Who was that?

695
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:19,157
I don't recognize them.

696
00:32:19,158 --> 00:32:20,397
It's the general's personal guard.

697
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:21,999
Of course, we wouldn't recognize them.

698
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:25,239
The general's personal guard
at such a young age?

699
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,319
She actually left.

700
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,998
Why did you come back?

701
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:52,077
How can I save you without the key?

702
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:54,519
I knew you wouldn't abandon me.

703
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:00,198
Come on.

704
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,637
We have to hurry.

705
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:05,238
Father wouldn't let me leave my room.

706
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:06,557
I had to sneak out.

707
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:07,837
I can't be out for long.

708
00:33:07,838 --> 00:33:08,519
Le's go.

709
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:12,557
The keys for those weren't kept here.

710
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,837
My father probably has them on him.

711
00:33:14,838 --> 00:33:16,678
Besides, it'll be easier to get out

712
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:18,158
with these shackles.

713
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:19,039
Come on.

714
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:20,559
Let's go.

715
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,678
You're something indeed, Lord Qin.

716
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:54,958
You dare to coerce my lieutenant

717
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,998
to help you escape?

718
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:58,239
Great General Cui,

719
00:33:58,479 --> 00:33:59,878
I came for the matter of Changzhou.

720
00:34:00,358 --> 00:34:01,397
I should have visited you

721
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:02,518
openly and courteously,

722
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,077
but I was afraid you might misunderstand

723
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:05,599
if I came with soldiers,

724
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,317
so I entered the residence alone.

725
00:34:07,318 --> 00:34:09,077
You have a silver tongue.

726
00:34:09,078 --> 00:34:10,199
Great General,

727
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:12,077
Ying hasn't slept all night.

728
00:34:12,078 --> 00:34:13,557
Let her go back to her room and rest.

729
00:34:13,558 --> 00:34:16,159
Whether you want to kill
or interrogate me, I'll comply.

730
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,438
Don't worry.

731
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:21,078
Great General Cui is valiant and honorable.

732
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:23,038
He would never kill recklessly.

733
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:24,719
He won't kill me.

734
00:34:26,078 --> 00:34:27,878
Don't try to flatter me.

735
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,878
Don't think
that putting me on a pedestal

736
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:31,359
will save you from being killed.

737
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,199
You wouldn't do that.

738
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:37,518
Go.

739
00:34:52,118 --> 00:34:53,839
You have affections for my daughter.

740
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,199
Yes.

741
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:57,878
Great General,

742
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,759
I have admired Miss Cui for a long time.

743
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:02,839
I ask for your blessing.

744
00:35:06,758 --> 00:35:08,998
If you truly love Ying,

745
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:12,759
I am not unwilling to make way for you.

746
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:14,958
Really?

747
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:17,199
But you have to promise me one thing.

748
00:35:17,578 --> 00:35:19,680
As long as it doesn't go against
loyalty and righteousness,

749
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,839
I, Li Ni, will go through anything for you.

750
00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:29,639
I want you to give up on Changzhou,

751
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:31,759
marry into the Cui family,

752
00:35:32,078 --> 00:35:33,958
and take over the Cui Army.

753
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:36,478
In return, I will betroth Ying to you.

754
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:39,598
Great General,

755
00:35:40,158 --> 00:35:41,398
I cannot do that.

756
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:43,839
Are you worried
that marrying into the Cui family

757
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:45,637
will tarnish your reputation?

758
00:35:45,638 --> 00:35:46,157
Great General,

759
00:35:46,158 --> 00:35:47,799
why ask when you already know?

760
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:49,998
The emperor guides his subjects,
and the father guides his sons.

761
00:35:50,118 --> 00:35:51,799
As the son of His Majesty,

762
00:35:52,198 --> 00:35:54,119
if I were to marry into the Cui family,

763
00:35:54,178 --> 00:35:55,958
I would be betraying
both His Majesty and my father.

764
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:58,359
Moreover, the Cui family
having me marry into their family

765
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:01,360
would be seen as an insult
to His Majesty by the entire court.

766
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,160
If the ruler is humiliated,
the subjects should die.

767
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,478
The court would demand

768
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:06,838
for the destruction of the Cui Army,

769
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:07,597
plunging the nation

770
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,438
into prolonged warfare once again.

771
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:11,117
That would be disloyal to my country

772
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:12,277
and unfilial to my father.

773
00:36:12,278 --> 00:36:14,078
I cannot comply.

774
00:36:19,078 --> 00:36:21,398
You're quick to refuse.

775
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,757
In that case,
there's nothing more to say.

776
00:36:23,758 --> 00:36:25,038
Back to the water dungeon for you.

777
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:26,918
Great General,
I don't want to go back there.

778
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:28,478
That's not for you to decide.

779
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,478
Great General,

780
00:36:29,558 --> 00:36:31,639
Ying's poison hasn't been fully removed.

781
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:32,757
I want to stay

782
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:34,237
and take care of her.

783
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:35,518
Once she recovers,

784
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:37,359
you can deal with me as you please.

785
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:41,119
Very well.

786
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,799
It's commendable

787
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:46,478
that you can think this way.

788
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:48,239
Does this mean

789
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:49,719
you agree, Great General?

790
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:53,318
However, for trespassing into my residence

791
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:55,077
and attempting to escape,

792
00:36:55,078 --> 00:36:57,518
according to the military laws
of the Cui Army,

793
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,239
you must be whipped.

794
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:01,679
Only then can I release you
from the dungeon.

795
00:37:02,718 --> 00:37:04,038
Lord Qin,

796
00:37:04,198 --> 00:37:07,239
the water dungeon or the whip.

797
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,799
The choice is yours.

798
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:12,239
I will receive the whip.

799
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:13,878
Good,

800
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:15,319
straightforward.

801
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:17,239
Men.

802
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,358
Bring the whip.

803
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:18,918
Yes.

804
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:19,839
Great General,

805
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:22,637
Ying's room isn't far from here.

806
00:37:22,638 --> 00:37:24,199
I don't want to disturb her.

807
00:37:24,638 --> 00:37:26,199
Let's move outside.

808
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,119
All right.

809
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:34,279
You should have been imprisoned
for 30 days,

810
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:36,757
but today I'll give you 30 lashes
to substitute.

811
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:38,038
How does that sound?

812
00:37:38,198 --> 00:37:40,597
I only ask that you avoid my face.

813
00:37:40,598 --> 00:37:42,359
I do not wish to make Ying worry.

814
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:45,918
All right.

815
00:37:46,078 --> 00:37:47,438
As you wish.

816
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,757
Avoid his face.

817
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:49,558
Yes.

boy.

828
00:39:09,758 --> 00:39:11,119
Great General,

829
00:39:12,158 --> 00:39:14,119
please give me a set of clothes.

830
00:39:14,758 --> 00:39:16,558
I don't want Ying to notice.

831
00:39:18,598 --> 00:39:19,639
Very well.

832
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:21,759

Ying,

you're up.

840
00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:06,159
Father didn't lock you up again?

841
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,998
I moved him with my sincerity.

842
00:40:09,278 --> 00:40:10,639
Sincerity?

843
00:40:11,238 --> 00:40:12,318
I told him

844
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,958
I didn't want Changzhou anymore.

845
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:14,998
He was so pleased

846
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:16,038
that he spared me

847
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,318
and let me accompany you.

848
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:18,918
Nonsense.

849
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:21,239
If you really said that,

850
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:24,398
my father would've said this.

851
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:27,197
"Do you think you can capture Changzhou
just because you have the Zhenxi Army?

852
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:29,598
Without a battle,
how do you know the outcome?"

853
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:30,438
You mimic

854
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:32,359
your father well.

855
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:34,398
Come on.

856
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:36,277
Tell me what you told my father.

857
00:40:36,278 --> 00:40:38,679
I never imagined
he would let you come into my room.

858
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,077
I told him

859
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:47,677
that you like me,

860
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,637
and if you can't see me,

861
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:51,277
you won't be able to eat,

862
00:40:51,278 --> 00:40:52,799
and you won't take your medicine.

863
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:54,637
For the sake of your well-being,

864
00:40:54,638 --> 00:40:55,557
it's best to let me in

865
00:40:55,558 --> 00:40:56,958
to accompany you.

866
00:40:57,118 --> 00:40:59,558
Your Father, reluctantly,

867
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:01,998
relented in the end.

868
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:03,717
I knew it.

869
00:41:03,718 --> 00:41:06,759
You must have used me against my father.

870
00:41:08,678 --> 00:41:09,679
What's wrong?

871
00:41:10,278 --> 00:41:10,838
Nothing.

872
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:11,918
Are you injured?

873
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:12,839
No.

874
00:41:13,278 --> 00:41:14,639
Let me see.

875
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,637
Are you hurt?

876
00:41:17,638 --> 00:41:18,799
No.

877
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:20,958
Something's not right. Undress.

878
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:21,998
How can a woman

879
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:23,157
make a man undress?

880
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:23,637
If you don't,

881
00:41:23,638 --> 00:41:25,318
I'll have someone tie you up.
I'll do it myself.

882
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,639
No, I won't let you.

883
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:27,600
Are you hungry?

884
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,878
I'll make you something to eat.

885
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:30,279
Remove your clothes!

886
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:58,239
How many lashes did Father give you?

887
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:01,078
30.

888
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:02,798
You're Lord Qin!

889
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:04,197
Couldn't you have pulled rank

890
00:42:04,198 --> 00:42:05,478
and stop him?

891
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,597
Tell him that he is still a subject.

892
00:42:07,598 --> 00:42:08,757
You claim to be

893
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:10,478
Zhenxi Army's best scout.

894
00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:12,878
Why don't you use your skills to escape?

895
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:14,157
As if they would actually

896
00:42:14,158 --> 00:42:15,878
chase you all the way
to the Zhenxi Army camp.

897
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:17,398
There, there, Ying.

898
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,557
Don't cry.

899
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:19,998
Don't be upset.

900
00:42:20,678 --> 00:42:22,119
I'm not.

901
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:25,398
So you say,
but your face is all red from anger.

902
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:28,078
How can you be so dumb?

903
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:31,199
Ying,

904
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:33,518
think about it.

905
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,157
If we have a daughter,

906
00:42:35,158 --> 00:42:36,878
delicate and pampered,

907
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:38,918
the apple of our eye,

908
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:40,038
and suddenly one day,

909
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,839
a brat dares to barge into her room,

910
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:43,478
climb onto her bed,

911
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:45,239
and kiss her,

912
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:47,438
I would rip him into pieces

913
00:42:47,558 --> 00:42:50,159
if I found out.

914
00:42:50,278 --> 00:42:51,518
30 lashes

915
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:52,838
would already be letting him off easy.

916
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:54,878
Who would have a daughter with you?

917
00:42:55,118 --> 00:42:56,359
A son is fine too.

918
00:42:56,718 --> 00:42:58,159
We can have a son instead.

919
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,359
Anyway,

920
00:42:59,399 --> 00:43:00,798
don't be upset over this,

921
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:02,958
and don't blame Mister Cui.

922
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:05,998
Great General Cui.

923
00:43:07,638 --> 00:43:09,038
Where's Taozi?

924
00:43:09,278 --> 00:43:10,318
The medicine is ready.

925
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,358
I'll go get it for you.

926
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,998
I need to get the medicine from her.

927
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:14,277
But your medicine's already ready?

928
00:43:14,278 --> 00:43:15,597
The salve for your injuries.

929
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:17,077
Your wounds are already in that state.

930
00:43:17,078 --> 00:43:20,319
If we don't apply the medicine today,
it will surely fester by tomorrow.

931
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:25,799
Then I'll go get it.

932
00:43:26,198 --> 00:43:27,677
But when I bring it back,

933
00:43:27,678 --> 00:43:29,199
will you help me apply it?

934
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:30,717
Suit yourself.
