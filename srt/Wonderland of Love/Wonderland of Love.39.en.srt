00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:07,196

99
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:08,477
the chance of success

100
00:08:08,677 --> 00:08:10,037
is less than ten percent.

101
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:11,477

102
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:12,277
Perhaps

103
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:14,157
she's gone for good.

104
00:08:19,277 --> 00:08:20,117

00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:23,277

107
00:08:26,117 --> 00:08:28,037

Lady Gu.

112
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,276
What's wrong with you?

113
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:15,117
The crown princess passed away.

114
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:18,317
But it was already
late at night yesterday,

115
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:19,516
the gate was shut.

116
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:22,077
I couldn't deliver the news sooner.

117
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:26,957
The crown princess passed away?

118
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:28,597
What happened?

119
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:30,396
I don't know.

120
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:32,156
His Highness was

121
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:33,597
carrying her.

122
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:36,117
Several imperial physicians
have examined her.

123
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:38,396
They said we had lost her.

124
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:40,437
But His Highness

125
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:41,597
refused to believe it.

126
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:43,276
He...

127
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:45,117
He even readied a carriage

128
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:47,557
and took off with the crown princess.

129
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:49,437
This is ridiculous!

130
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:51,876
His Highness

131
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,477
is heartbroken.

132
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:55,437
Hence, the rash decision.

133
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:56,837
Your Majesty,

134
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:58,357
we should send someone after him.

135
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:00,837
I sent someone to learn more yesterday.

136
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:03,156
But he openly disobeyed my order.

137
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:05,317
He refused to come to me.

138
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:08,396
He hasn't returned to
Eastern Palace as of now.

139
00:10:09,117 --> 00:10:10,117
I fear...

140
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:11,837
I fear His Highness might be...

141
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:15,317
Lady Gu,

142
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:17,717
don't worry.

143
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:19,717
No harm will come to

144
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:21,197
the crown prince.

145
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:22,636
Don't worry.

146
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:24,597
After the funeral concludes,

147
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:27,077
I will order the crown prince

148
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,916
to confer you
the title of crown princess.

149
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:33,676
All right.

150
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:36,276
You can leave now.

151
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:40,636
I take my leave now.

152
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:55,557
How dare you?

153
00:10:58,197 --> 00:10:59,437
How dare you?

154
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:00,477
You kept a matter

155
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:01,077
this serious

156
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,357
a secret for one whole night!

157
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:04,036
You asked me to never come to you again.

158
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:04,916
Besides,

159
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:06,276
there was a curfew last night.

160
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,756
A manhunt was conducted in the city.

161
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:10,077
Imperial Army searched
every inch of the city.

162
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,357
I know I shouldn't have come here,

163
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:14,237
but this is urgent.

164
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:15,357
I took the risk

165
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:16,876
and came to inform you.

166
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:18,876
What about Shu
who Liu Chengfeng mentioned?

167
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:21,276
According to my scout,

168
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:22,796
he went to Eastern Palace.

169
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,117
Oh no.

170
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:29,036
If the crown prince

171
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:32,396
ever learns about this...

172
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:34,996
The murder of the crown princess

173
00:11:35,357 --> 00:11:37,837
can warrant
the execution of the entire clan.

174
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:41,437
Forget about killing me for now.

175
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:42,557
The Jieshuo people

176
00:11:42,557 --> 00:11:44,477
are now hiding in the city.

177
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:46,676
Killing me won't do you any good.

178
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,437
Why would I want to kill you?

179
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:53,717
Don't worry.

180
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:57,156
Fortunately for us, His Majesty
is prejudiced against the crown prince.

181
00:11:57,636 --> 00:11:58,717
I have other plans.

182
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,357
So,

183
00:12:10,117 --> 00:12:11,516
Liu Chengfeng acquired letters

184
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:13,670
proving Prime Minister Gu had been
conspiring with Sun Jing.

185
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,340
He used it
to blackmail Prime Minister Gu.

186
00:12:17,357 --> 00:12:18,957
Prime Minister Gu made the arrangement

187
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:21,477
to have Jia Li and Liu Chengfeng

188
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,516
frame Cui Yi, saying Cui Yi
had been working with Jieshuo.

189
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:25,957
Hence,

190
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:27,717
the Cui Army was disbanded.

191
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:30,197
Yes.

192
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:34,916
Back at Tong Pass,

193
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:37,837
I noticed

194
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:40,010
Sun Jing had been contacting
someone from the imperial court.

195
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:42,957
But, I couldn't learn who it was.

196
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:45,876
(Sun Jing left in a hurry.)

197
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:46,717
(He set)

198
00:12:46,717 --> 00:12:48,117
(the study ablaze.)

199
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:50,036
(My men and I recovered these)

200
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:50,876
(from the rubbles)

201
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:52,036
(after the fire.)

202
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:54,996
I never thought

203
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,636
it'd be Prime Minister Gu.

204
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:00,197
I testified against him

205
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:04,357
by telling Your Highness the whole truth

206
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,276
because...

207
00:13:06,957 --> 00:13:08,597
Young Master is dead.

208
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:11,036
This is the only way

209
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:12,197
I can avenge him.

210
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:15,557
But Jieshuo broke their promise.

211
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:17,516
You can march against them.

212
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:19,317
I only ask

213
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:23,210
that Young Master's remains
can be delivered to me.

214
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,477
I want to give him a proper burial.

215
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:30,957
You two committed unforgivable sins.

216
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:33,156
I know.

217
00:13:34,437 --> 00:13:36,117
But Young Master
has treated me well.

218
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,510
I couldn't repay his kindness.

219
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,636
And now, he's dead.

220
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:47,916
All I can do

221
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,077
is give him a proper funeral.

222
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:55,916
You may take Liu Chengfeng's body

223
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:57,396
with you.

224
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:05,837
Much thanks, Your Highness.

225
00:14:08,837 --> 00:14:09,557
Your Highness.

226
00:14:11,437 --> 00:14:13,036
I heard the crown princess was injured.

227
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,156
How is her condition

228
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:16,197
at the moment?

229
00:14:16,837 --> 00:14:18,077
Why do you ask?

230
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:26,276
On the grassland of Jieshuo

231
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:29,676
is a lake.

232
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:33,676
Blue flowers cover the lakeside.

233
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:36,437
It's like a paradise on earth.

234
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,876
You and Lieutenant He can live there.

235
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:43,276
You can lead a peaceful life there.

236
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:46,437
When spring arrives

237
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:48,957
and the flowers bloom,

238
00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:52,357
you will know

239
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:56,036
that I'm there to visit you.

240
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:07,437
(I want to bury Young Master there)

241
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:09,756
(before I take my life.)

242
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:12,717
If Lieutenant He ever asks...

243
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:17,396
No.

244
00:15:19,197 --> 00:15:20,957
Your Highness need not tell her.

245
00:15:21,597 --> 00:15:22,276
Please,

246
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:23,916
do not mention Young Master's death.

247
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,117
Let the crown princess

248
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:28,876
think that Young Master is alive.

249
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:42,557
You mean,

250
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:47,197
the crown prince meant
to start an uprising?

251
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:48,036
Your Majesty,

252
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:49,796
after I returned last night,

253
00:15:49,796 --> 00:15:51,437
I couldn't fall asleep.

254
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,916
After much pondering,

255
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,557
I still found the crown prince's action

256
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:55,957
suspicious.

257
00:15:56,117 --> 00:15:57,876
I was worried about your safety.

258
00:15:57,876 --> 00:16:00,110
So, I requested an audience
with Your Majesty this morning.

259
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:01,317
It's better to be safe

260
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:03,317
than sorry.

261
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:08,437
He is the only son I have left.

262
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:10,117
I never thought

263
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:13,437
he'd be so blinded
as to rebel against me.

264
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:14,717
Your Majesty.

265
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:16,317
Our priority

266
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:18,876
should be regaining command
over the imperial army.

267
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:21,036
As long as Your Majesty
commands the army,

268
00:16:21,036 --> 00:16:22,876
the crown prince
cannot act as he pleases,

269
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:24,437
even if he is disloyal.

270
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:25,796
However, the Imperial Army

271
00:16:25,796 --> 00:16:26,916
was handpicked from

272
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,317
the Zhenxi Army.

273
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:30,156
They all obey the crown prince.

274
00:16:30,237 --> 00:16:32,036
Your Majesty takes
orders from heaven itself.

275
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:33,237
You are the ruler.

276
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:34,477
No one in the Imperial Army

277
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:35,796
would dare disobey

278
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:36,756
your command.

279
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:40,717
Will this plan work?

280
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:41,796
Our top priority

281
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,317
is to send someone

282
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:44,996
to the crown prince

283
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:47,077
and demand that
he hand over the command.

284
00:16:47,636 --> 00:16:48,996
After we've regained the command,

285
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:50,837
we will use someone trustworthy

286
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:52,437
to take over the Imperial Army

287
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:53,916
with the command seal and your decree.

288
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:56,437
The officials must not learn about this.

289
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:58,310
Someone could be working
with the crown prince.

290
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:00,557
Merits outweigh blood relations.

291
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,437
Minister of War Guo Changlin,

292
00:17:02,477 --> 00:17:03,676
is my second son-in-law.

293
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:04,716
I assure you

294
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:06,396
his loyalty to
Your Majesty is unwavering.

295
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:07,757
He is trustworthy.

296
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,236
What if the crown prince

297
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:12,757
refuses to hand over the command seal?

298
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:14,997
If that is the case,

299
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:16,916
that won't be disobedience.

300
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,117
It's proof of his treason.

301
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:21,357
But,

302
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,077
what if the crown prince

303
00:17:23,716 --> 00:17:25,357
leads an assault on the palace?

304
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:26,117
Your Majesty,

305
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:27,317
don't worry.

306
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:29,636
I still have some personal
troops and guards.

307
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,476
They are loyal and reliable.

308
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,916
Your Majesty may allow them to serve

309
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:33,997
as your bodyguards.

310
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:34,776
On the other hand,

311
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,557
one of the leaders of the
Imperial Army's six divisions,

312
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:37,277
Cai Zhao,

313
00:17:37,277 --> 00:17:38,757
knew the former emperor.

314
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:39,837
He's loyal and reliable.

315
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:41,716
He has no connection
with the Zhenxi Army.

316
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:42,716
We can employ his help.

317
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,396
That seems like a sound plan.

318
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:48,557
Your Majesty.

319
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,436
Once the Imperial Army
has been reclaimed,

320
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:50,876
Your Majesty,

321
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:52,557
you need to make another decree.

322
00:17:52,757 --> 00:17:54,357
Depose the crown prince.

323
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:55,916
Without his title,

324
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,557
even if he seeks to usurp the throne,

325
00:17:57,557 --> 00:17:58,636
he will still lose

326
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:00,037
a lot of followers.

327
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:06,916
That makes sense.

328
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:11,077
Prime Minister Gu.

329
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:14,037
You are fully in charge

330
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:16,317
of this plan.

331
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:18,636
Yes, Your Majesty.

332
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:21,357
Attendant Yuan came to deliver a decree.

333
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:23,277
You must hand over

334
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:24,037
the command seal.

335
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:25,837
Will you?

336
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:27,557
Good.

337
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:30,236
Your Highness.

338
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:32,716
Are you really giving them

339
00:18:33,716 --> 00:18:34,716
the command seal?

340
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:36,597
I mean,

341
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,597
it's good to know Taozi is still alive.

342
00:18:40,757 --> 00:18:42,277
Ying would be so happy

343
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:44,196
to hear that.

344
00:18:47,396 --> 00:18:48,517
The imperial physician says

345
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:53,077
Taozi is somewhat alive,

346
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:55,357
but...

347
00:18:58,277 --> 00:19:00,037
The hope of saving her is slim.

348
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:03,436
I fear...

349
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:06,757
I fear

350
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:08,117
that we can never save her.

351
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:11,636
During the rebellion of the two lords,

352
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:14,797
I was heavily wounded.

353
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:22,077
I was in a critical condition.

354
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:26,156
Ying was never

355
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:27,436
an avid believer of Buddhism.

356
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,317
But she told me back then

357
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,037
she would

358
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,436
pray to all the Buddha statues

359
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:36,277
in the world

360
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:39,436
just for me to pull through safely.

361
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:41,956
(You know,)

362
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:44,997
(I never was a religious person.)

363
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:47,317
(I never made wishes.)

364
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:51,757
(But in those days,)

365
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:55,196
I prayed to all the Buddha statues

366
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:56,357
in this land.

367
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,317
I made wishes so ardently.

368
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,156
I wish

369
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:06,797
I could pray to

370
00:20:06,797 --> 00:20:08,557
all the Buddha statues in the world.

371
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:13,117
But...

372
00:20:15,077 --> 00:20:16,277
But I wasn't even left

373
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:17,557
with a glimmer of hope.

374
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,436
I couldn't even see her

375
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:27,037
one last time before she passed on.

376
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,956
She was dying,

377
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:36,916
but I wasn't there for her.

378
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:42,436
I wonder

379
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:46,676
if she was afraid

380
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:48,797
or in pain.

381
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:03,837
Therefore,

382
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,037
as long as Taozi is still breathing,

383
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,396
there is hope.

384
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:33,916
I will not hand over

385
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:35,757
the command seal.

386
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,876
Prime Minister Gu
replaced the Imperial Army

387
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:43,156
in order to hold His Majesty hostage
and usurp the throne.

388
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:46,357
As long as I'm alive,

389
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:49,037
he will never get what he wants.

His Highness has lost his mind!

Slap yourself.

418
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,757
His Highness hasn't lost his mind.

419
00:24:59,156 --> 00:25:00,436
It's you who's lost it.

420
00:25:04,676 --> 00:25:05,557
So,

421
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:07,037
what happened?

422
00:25:09,117 --> 00:25:10,117
His Highness

423
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,597
is carrying the crown princess'
coffin to the palace

424
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:13,757
to see His Majesty.

425
00:25:13,757 --> 00:25:14,476
What?

426
00:25:14,636 --> 00:25:16,436
Please,
talk some sense into His Highness.

427
00:25:19,557 --> 00:25:20,396
It seems

428
00:25:21,277 --> 00:25:23,077
sadness has taken over his sanity.

429
00:25:31,826 --> 00:25:35,936
(Chengluan Hall)

430
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:56,876
Step aside.

431
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:00,636
I understand
Your Highness is heartbroken.

432
00:26:00,797 --> 00:26:01,476
But what do you

433
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,636
seek to achieve by bringing

434
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:03,757
her coffin here?

435
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:05,196
To question your father?

436
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:06,716
To curse His Majesty?

437
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,357
Her Highness died from a sickness.

438
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:09,357
It was a tragedy.

439
00:26:09,357 --> 00:26:10,396
Your sadness doesn't

440
00:26:10,396 --> 00:26:11,797
justify such ruthless action.

441
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:13,837
A tragedy?

442
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:15,317
Gu Wan'niang.

443
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:18,236
Even now, you still pretend.

444
00:26:19,797 --> 00:26:21,517
You know better than anyone

445
00:26:24,037 --> 00:26:25,557
why the crown princess died.

446
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:31,117
I have no idea.

447
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:41,916
My condolences, Your Highness.

448
00:26:42,156 --> 00:26:43,236
Seeing you like this

449
00:26:43,357 --> 00:26:44,876
really pains me.

450
00:26:45,196 --> 00:26:46,997
But I don't know anything.

451
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,317
- I...
- Lady Gu.

452
00:26:58,037 --> 00:26:59,876
I knew you wanted her to die.

453
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:02,396
You and your father
both wanted her dead.

454
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:04,037
But listen,

455
00:27:05,236 --> 00:27:06,876
even if she was dead,

456
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:09,196
you'd never take her place.

457
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,837
I, Li Ni, will only ever love

458
00:27:12,236 --> 00:27:13,716
Cui Lin.

459
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:15,476
When she was alive,

460
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:18,236
she was my only wife.

461
00:27:19,357 --> 00:27:20,476
In death,

462
00:27:21,396 --> 00:27:23,557
she will be
the only wife I'll ever have.

463
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:25,956
No one can replace her.

464
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:28,797
You can't.

465
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,557
Not anyone else in this world.

466
00:27:33,476 --> 00:27:34,436
Your Highness...

467
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:37,876
I never even dreamed
on taking her place.

468
00:27:38,597 --> 00:27:39,997
I only ever want to love you.

469
00:27:39,997 --> 00:27:41,357
Is that a sin?

470
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:42,077
Scram.

471
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:43,956
From now on,

472
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:45,670
you're no longer my lady
in Eastern Palace.

473
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:48,876
Do not let me see you again

474
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:51,357
unless you want to die.

475
00:28:00,196 --> 00:28:01,037
Lady Gu!

476
00:28:01,476 --> 00:28:02,436
Lady Gu!

477
00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:19,876
Your Majesty.

478
00:28:21,557 --> 00:28:23,037
Your Majesty, don't worry.

479
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:25,557
These elite soldiers are
from my personal troops.

480
00:28:25,557 --> 00:28:26,710
Each can take on ten soldiers.

481
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:28,037
If His Highness

482
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:30,357
does intend to rebel,

483
00:28:30,557 --> 00:28:31,357
I will gladly

484
00:28:31,357 --> 00:28:32,676
sacrifice myself

485
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:34,236
to keep Your Majesty safe.

486
00:28:34,557 --> 00:28:36,317
Besides, we have Cai Zhao

487
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:38,396
and his troops guarding the gate.

488
00:28:42,476 --> 00:28:43,156
Your Majesty.

489
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:45,837
Your Majesty!

490
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:47,517
The crown prince

491
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,876
entered the palace while carrying

492
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:49,916
the crown princess' coffin.

493
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:55,597
What does he want now?

494
00:28:56,876 --> 00:28:57,676
Your Majesty.

495
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:59,797
The crown prince refused to hand over

496
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:00,837
the command seal.

497
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:01,716
He clearly

498
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:03,077
seeks to harm Your Majesty.

499
00:29:03,357 --> 00:29:04,997
Your Majesty, you may send the order

500
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:06,956
to Cai Zhao to have the crown prince

501
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:08,517
killed on sight

502
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:09,716
should he charge in.

503
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:11,396
Your Majesty, you must not do that!

504
00:29:11,676 --> 00:29:13,236
You must not do that!

505
00:29:14,797 --> 00:29:16,317
He is your only son.

506
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,636
The crown prince hasn't
committed any grave sins.

507
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,037
Please assemble the officials
to discuss this thoroughly.

508
00:29:24,357 --> 00:29:25,117
Your Majesty.

509
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:27,436
The motive of this order

510
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:29,956
isn't to take the crown prince's life.

511
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:31,236
Simply order Cai Zhao

512
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,357
to read him the decree

513
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:33,997
at the palace gate.

514
00:29:34,117 --> 00:29:35,117
If the crown prince

515
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:37,317
hands over the command seal

516
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:38,956
instead of charging in,

517
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:40,236
it's still not too late.

518
00:29:40,357 --> 00:29:42,636
Then, all is well.

519
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,676
If the crown prince

520
00:29:44,676 --> 00:29:46,436
refuses to hand over the command seal

521
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:47,557
and insists on coming in,

522
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:49,476
that is a clear sign of treason.

523
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:50,876
He wants to commit patricide.

524
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:51,916
His followers

525
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,277
will certainly harm Your Majesty.

526
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:54,710
Your Majesty, please give the order now.

527
00:29:55,236 --> 00:29:56,557
Your Majesty, don't!

528
00:29:57,156 --> 00:29:58,350
Do as Prime Minister Gu says.

529
00:29:58,636 --> 00:29:59,436
Deliver the order.

530
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:00,277
Yes.

531
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,317
- Deliver the order.
- Yes.

532
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:17,285
(Taiyi Gate)

533
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,983
(Juntian Gate)

534
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:41,196
Your Highness!

535
00:30:41,997 --> 00:30:43,396
We have an order from His Majesty.

536
00:30:43,517 --> 00:30:45,797
Crown Prince Li Ni
must not enter the palace!

537
00:30:45,956 --> 00:30:47,236
Should he disobey,

538
00:30:47,357 --> 00:30:50,156
we are allowed to kill on sight.

539
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:12,837
Your Majesty!

540
00:31:13,077 --> 00:31:13,916
Your Majesty!

541
00:31:14,357 --> 00:31:15,077
Your Majesty!

542
00:31:15,317 --> 00:31:16,196
Bad news!

543
00:31:16,557 --> 00:31:17,716
The crown prince

544
00:31:17,716 --> 00:31:19,597
killed General Cai Zhao with an arrow!

545
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,396
Protect His Majesty!

546
00:32:23,476 --> 00:32:24,557
Your Highness.

547
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:26,357
You come in carrying a sword.

548
00:32:26,357 --> 00:32:28,290
Do you seek to usurp the throne
and kill His Majesty?

549
00:32:31,277 --> 00:32:32,757
You conspired with Jieshuo

550
00:32:33,236 --> 00:32:34,476
and held my father hostage.

551
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:37,436
I thought you were a scholarly leader,

552
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:39,196
that you were a righteous person.

553
00:32:39,636 --> 00:32:40,236
But you had

554
00:32:40,236 --> 00:32:41,636
conspired with Sun Jing longer ago.

555
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:43,476
You are the worst traitor

556
00:32:43,476 --> 00:32:44,757
in the imperial court.

557
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,037
Lies!

558
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:48,636
You want to kill His Majesty,

559
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:50,117
so you slander me, a loyal official!

560
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:53,317
Your Majesty, please give the order

561
00:32:53,317 --> 00:32:54,517
to seize the crown prince.

562
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:04,236
Your Majesty, please give the order!

563
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:08,797
Li...

564
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:10,236
I'm warning you.

565
00:33:10,317 --> 00:33:12,236
Drop the sword.

566
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:14,357
Surrender yourself.

567
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:15,876
Then, I will look past your mistake.

568
00:33:15,997 --> 00:33:16,916
Your Majesty.

569
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:18,916
Have you not come to your senses?

570
00:33:19,837 --> 00:33:20,476
This man

571
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:22,676
was conspiring with Sun Jing.

572
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:25,236
His loyalty and imprisonment

573
00:33:25,757 --> 00:33:26,837
were nothing but an act

574
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:28,156
to deceive you.

575
00:33:28,396 --> 00:33:29,277
And then,

576
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,277
he conspired with Jieshuo

577
00:33:31,797 --> 00:33:33,277
and framed Great General Cui.

578
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:35,876
He instigated
the disbanding of the Cui Army.

579
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,476
He would go as far as
murdering the crown princess.

580
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:39,997
Do you not see

581
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:41,797
what he's been doing?

582
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:45,077
Your Majesty, please give the order

583
00:33:45,196 --> 00:33:46,476
to seize the crown prince.

584
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:51,396
Your Majesty.

585
00:33:55,997 --> 00:33:56,837
Seize him!

586
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:10,796
Father!

587
00:34:14,836 --> 00:34:16,156
These people are from Jieshuo.

588
00:34:16,756 --> 00:34:18,356
Prime Minister Gu brought them in.

589
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,477
Look at this mark!

590
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:20,836
Do you not see it now?

591
00:34:27,557 --> 00:34:28,676
Li Ni, stop now!

592
00:34:28,676 --> 00:34:29,517
Drop the sword!

593
00:34:29,796 --> 00:34:30,917
Let His Majesty go!

594
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:32,557
Let him go!

595
00:34:32,557 --> 00:34:33,276
You told me

596
00:34:33,276 --> 00:34:34,597
it'd be a flawless plan.

597
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:36,796
What's going on now?

598
00:34:39,316 --> 00:34:40,836
Prime Minister Gu?

599
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:41,836
These...

600
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:43,796
These people

601
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:45,997
are from Jieshuo!

602
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:49,117
Drop the sword.

603
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:50,437
Ready the horses.

604
00:34:50,597 --> 00:34:52,397
No authority must stop us along the way.

605
00:34:52,517 --> 00:34:53,997
Ensure our safety.

606
00:34:54,836 --> 00:34:55,917
If you so much as

607
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:57,037
leave a scratch on my father,

608
00:34:57,997 --> 00:34:59,636
I will raze Jieshuo to the ground.

609
00:35:01,236 --> 00:35:02,877
Ni, forget about me.

610
00:35:02,877 --> 00:35:04,636
Run for your life.

611
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,676
At this point,

612
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:07,517
as your saying goes,

613
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:09,236
you wouldn't want to force my hand.

614
00:35:09,236 --> 00:35:11,397
This is your father.

615
00:35:11,597 --> 00:35:13,117
You will kill me either way.

616
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,236
If I can take him with me

617
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:15,517
before I die,

618
00:35:15,716 --> 00:35:16,836
it's still worth it.

619
00:35:17,196 --> 00:35:19,077
Unless you want him dead,

620
00:35:19,196 --> 00:35:20,316
let us go!

621
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,796
Ready the horses and carriages.

622
00:35:22,196 --> 00:35:23,356
I am leaving

623
00:35:23,356 --> 00:35:24,276
with your father

624
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,276

No!

00:35:28,316 --> 00:35:29,236

627
00:35:29,316 --> 00:35:31,397
Get the horses and carriages ready.

628
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:32,636
