(Tong Pass)

30
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:04,898
Grand Governor.

31
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:06,458
Have you sent them away?

32
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:08,456
Madam of Wei was reluctant

33
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:09,578
to get in the carriage.

34
00:02:09,617 --> 00:02:10,937
She was sobbing.

35
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:13,056
She said she wanted to stay in Tong Pass

36
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:14,217
together with you.

37
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:15,616
I consoled her and told her

38
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:17,057
to take care of Young Master.

39
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:18,857
We'll bring them back

40
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:20,178
once the battle is over.

41
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:23,137
This time, the Zhenxi Army

42
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:25,018
is joining hands with the Cui Army.

43
00:02:25,217 --> 00:02:28,178
This battle concerns our survival.

44
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,217
Even if we survive the battle,

45
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,336
I'm afraid

46
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:34,257
we won't return here again.

47
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:53,353
(West Gate)

48
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:00,611
(West Gate)

49
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:03,738
Chang'er.

50
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:15,898
Mister Shiqi!

51
00:03:27,777 --> 00:03:30,497
One, two, three!

52
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:08,677
(Tong Pass)

53
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:21,898
Grand Governor!

54
00:04:21,977 --> 00:04:23,137
The Zhenxi Army and the Cui Army

55
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,258
have entered the city!

56
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:25,898
Let us escort you.

57
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:27,217
We still stand a chance

58
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:28,458
as long as you're alive.

59
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:31,898
To where?

60
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:34,777
Where else can we go?

61
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,818
We were defeated and left Xichang,

62
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:39,417
then arrived at Tong Pass.

63
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:41,657
Now, you want me to leave Tong Pass?

64
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:43,776
Where else can I go?

65
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:44,937
Grand Governor,

66
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:46,856
the Zhenxi Army is joining hands
with the Cui Army.

67
00:04:46,857 --> 00:04:48,360
They have the number advantage.

68
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,380
If we took advantage of
Tong Pass's strategic structure,

69
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,860
we could still defend
ourselves from them.

70
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,656
But now, we don't know

71
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:54,338
how the Zhenxi Army managed
to enter the city.

72
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:55,938
There's no way to defend the city.

73
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:57,336
Grand Governor,

74
00:04:57,337 --> 00:04:58,417
you should leave

75
00:04:58,537 --> 00:05:01,338
while the situation is chaotic
and the sky is dark.

76
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:07,536
Back then, during the Battle of Hanhai,

77
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:09,898
the Khan had ten times
more soldiers than us.

78
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:12,257
I led my army and fended them off,

79
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,898
my battle armor stained with blood.

80
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:15,938
I almost lost my arm.

81
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:18,258
Even so, I still achieved
a huge victory.

82
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:21,297
The tens of thousands of soldiers
under me

83
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,498
are fighting our enemies right now.

84
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:25,818
How can I abandon them?

85
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:28,777
I'm not leaving.

86
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,138
Bring the great imperial grandson here.

87
00:05:32,618 --> 00:05:33,458
Yes, Grand Governor.

88
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:08,857
Sun Jing,

89
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:10,537
since it has come to this,

90
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:12,378
you better put down your weapon
and surrender.

91
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:17,938
Go!

92
00:06:27,618 --> 00:06:29,297
Tong Pass has fallen.

93
00:06:30,018 --> 00:06:31,297
Your defeat is certain.

94
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,777
I won't kill you as long as

95
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:35,737
you release the great imperial grandson.

96
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:36,697
Back then, your father

97
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:38,737
was begging me to spare him.

98
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:41,578
He would have no way
to become the fake emperor

99
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,817
if he didn't

100
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,818
fake his death and ran away.

101
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:48,177
Now, I have
the great imperial grandson with me.

102
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:50,378
I'm the official ruler here!

103
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,377
You think I'll give you
the great imperial grandson

104
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,417
just because you're telling me to?

105
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:56,537
What do you want then?

106
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:00,057
I want you and your troops

107
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:01,777
to withdraw from Tong Pass immediately.

108
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:04,257
Tell the fake emperor to write an edict.

109
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,537
Announce to the world

110
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:07,177
that he stole the throne

111
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:09,657
and that he'd return the throne
to the great imperial grandson.

112
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,818
Judging from the situation,

113
00:07:14,698 --> 00:07:15,377
I don't think

114
00:07:15,378 --> 00:07:16,977
you have the right
to negotiate a deal with me.

115
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:19,632
Come.

116
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:20,591
(West Gate)

117
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:21,857
Li Ni,

118
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:24,096
this child is the only descendant

119
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:26,018
left behind by the late crown prince.

120
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:27,817
To the Li family,

121
00:07:27,818 --> 00:07:29,537
he's the official imperial descendant.

122
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:31,698
How will you explain yourself

123
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,377
to the people if he's killed today?

124
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:36,258
How can the fake emperor,
which is your father,

125
00:07:36,578 --> 00:07:39,498
explain himself to the people?

126
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:41,416
Forget about me!

127
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,697
Kill this crook

128
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:44,257
and restore peace to the world!

129
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,536
Kill him!

130
00:07:45,537 --> 00:07:46,578
Sun Jing!

131
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:48,657
You were once a hero.

132
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:50,456
Now, you're using a child

133
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:51,698
as your shield?

134
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:54,336
You're such a laughingstock!

135
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:56,258
There's no need to provoke me.

136
00:07:56,897 --> 00:07:58,818
If you don't withdraw your troops,

137
00:07:59,457 --> 00:08:01,096
don't blame me for showing him no mercy.

138
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:02,458
Stop!

139
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:10,018
I'm willing to use my life

140
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,187
in exchange for
the great imperial grandson's life.

141
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,776
- Mister Shiqi!
- Mister Shiqi!

142
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:15,777
Mister Shiqi! You mustn't do it!

143
00:08:17,138 --> 00:08:18,336
- Mister Shiqi!
- Mister Shiqi!

144
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:19,257
Forget about me!

145
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:20,057
- No!
- Mister Shiqi!

146
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:22,378
Kill Sun Jing
and restore peace to the world!

147
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:34,217
Mister Shiqi!

148
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:35,696
- No!
- Come back!

149
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:37,178
- Mister Shiqi!
- Mister Shiqi!

150
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:39,778
- Mister Shiqi!
- Stop it!

151
00:08:41,378 --> 00:08:42,538
Fine.

152
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:44,938
Lord Qin, since you have
such a resolute resolve,

153
00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:47,778
I will keep my promise.

154
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,617
Lord Qin,

155
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:51,658
take your own life now.

156
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,217
- Mister Shiqi! Don't do it!
- Mister Shiqi.

157
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:53,776
Mister Shiqi!

158
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:55,237
- Mister Shiqi! Don't do it!
- Mister Shiqi.

159
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:56,418
- Mister Shiqi!
- Let's kill him!

160
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:07,778
Li Ni, don't do it!

161
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:20,497
Li Ni, don't do it!

162
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:30,497
No!

163
00:09:30,498 --> 00:09:32,458
Mister Shiqi, don't do it!

164
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:55,658
Lord Qin,

165
00:09:55,937 --> 00:09:58,217
that child beside Sun Jing
isn't the real great imperial grandson.

166
00:09:58,218 --> 00:09:59,857
The child I brought here

167
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:01,176
is the real great imperial grandson.

168
00:10:01,177 --> 00:10:02,257
What did you say?

169
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:05,977
Li Ni,

170
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,416
it's fine that you're not willing
to save the great imperial grandson.

171
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,818
There's no need to employ
such a devious ploy.

172
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:12,816
You wish to use
a fake great imperial grandson

173
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:14,176
as a stand-in

174
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:15,857
so that you can kill the real deal, huh?

175
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:19,257
Grand Governor,

176
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:21,737
you said the child I brought here
was the fake great imperial grandson.

177
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:23,337
If so, how can you prove

178
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:26,058
that the child you captured
is the real great imperial grandson?

179
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:29,457
He possesses

180
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,418
the seal of the late crown prince.

181
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:33,617
I seized both him and the seal

182
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:36,178
from Han Chang's hand.

183
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,056
If you guys are still
doubting his validity,

184
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:40,058
there's no point in talking.

185
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:42,137
I'll just chop him down.

186
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:43,897
- Stop!
- Put down your sword!

187
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:45,778
Do it, Grand Governor.

188
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:47,600
Has it never occurred to you

189
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,767
why Han Chang, General Yunchang,
a loyal subject of the late prince,

190
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:52,176
never tracked you down

191
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:53,857
and gathered his forces

192
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:55,776
to save the great imperial grandson

193
00:10:55,777 --> 00:10:57,816
after you captured him?

194
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,977
As for the seal of
the late crown prince,

195
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:01,337
have you never wondered why

196
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:02,576
General Yunchang

197
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:03,776
left it with the child?

198
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:05,097
Do you think he doesn't know

199
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,719
that you'll be able to verify
the child's identity

200
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:09,298
once you find the seal on him?

201
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,658
That's a possibility.

202
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:14,338
Soldiers!

203
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:15,936
Those who kill Sun Jing
will receive a promotion

204
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:17,176
and a bounty of 10,000 gold taels!

205
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,857
Attack!

206
00:11:22,177 --> 00:11:23,377
Attack!

207
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:25,257
Leave with the great imperial grandson.

208
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:26,698
He's still useful to us.

209
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,558
Great Imperial Grandson!

210
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:43,117
Great Imperial Grandson!

211
00:11:58,137 --> 00:11:58,937
Great Imperial Grandson!

212
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:00,617
General Han!

213
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:03,617
Everything's fine.

214
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:05,176
I'm here to save you.

215
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:05,977
Let's go.

216
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:18,538
Sun Jing,

217
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:21,017
has it ever occurred to you
that this day might arrive

218
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:23,458
ever since you raised an army
to slay the emperor?

219
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:28,977
Lord Qin,

220
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:30,576
we should just kill

221
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:32,058
a traitor like him.

222
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:47,818
I was heroic all my life.

223
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:50,938
You guys would never be a match for me

224
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,857
regardless of your numbers

225
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,977
had I not been poisoned!

226
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,257
Ignorant brat.

227
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,818
Don't think that you can
chop my head off.

228
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,938
I will never let you get your way!

229
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:45,097
This pair of jade pendants

230
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:46,778
is exquisite indeed.

231
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:51,178
Each of us owns one half.

232
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,938
I will always carry it with me.

233
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:57,418
It will always stay with me.

234
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:01,137
We will always be together.

235
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:22,818
(During the first year
of Tiantai's reign,)

236
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:25,017
(Sun Jing suffered
a defeat at Tong Pass.)

237
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:26,538
(He took his own life.)

238
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,017
(His wife, Madam of Wei,)

239
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:29,977
(and his eldest son,)

240
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:32,177
(were captured during their escape.)

241
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:35,457
(Thus, Sun Jing's rebellion)

242
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,538
(came to an end.)

243
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:42,538
Be careful.

244
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:43,937
Drag it over there.

245
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:46,058
Come.

246
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:48,056
How is it?

247
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:48,977
Come.

248
00:17:48,978 --> 00:17:49,937
Slowly.

249
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:51,296
- Let's head over there.
- Keep this.

250
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:52,258
Put this over there.

251
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:53,376
Slowly.

252
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:54,177
Let's go.

253
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:55,017
I'll help you.

254
00:17:55,018 --> 00:17:56,058
There's more over there.

255
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:57,697
Come.

256
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:58,978
Lieutenant He!

257
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:00,017
What's wrong?

258
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:00,897
Someone abducted

259
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:02,717
the great imperial grandson
in the midst of the chaos.

260
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:03,697
Send someone after them!

261
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:04,457
Yes, Lieutenant He.

262
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,258
What about Lord Qin?

263
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:08,257
I'll break the news to him.

264
00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:08,897
Go now.

265
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:09,778
All right.

266
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:12,538
Ying,

267
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:14,177
great job.

268
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:14,797
We managed to find

269
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:16,536
the real great imperial grandson
all thanks to you.

270
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:17,616
Now, Sun Jing is dead.

271
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:19,336
Our mission will be accomplished

272
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:20,657
once we send him
back to the court.

273
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:22,576
Shiqi,

274
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:23,616
I need to be honest with you

275
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:25,298
regarding one thing.

276
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,617
The great imperial grandson
I brought here was a fake.

277
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:30,776
The real great imperial grandson

278
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,217
was the child whom
Sun Jing had abducted.

279
00:18:32,218 --> 00:18:33,776
Initially, I've arranged for my men

280
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:34,977
to find an opportunity and rescue him

281
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:36,697
during the chaos.

282
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:37,897
However, someone

283
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:39,056
was one step ahead of us.

284
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:40,336
We have to think of a way

285
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:42,097
to get the real
great imperial grandson back.

286
00:18:46,857 --> 00:18:48,097
Shiqi!

287
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:49,657
Up.

288
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:50,778
Let's go.

289
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:52,576
Let's go.

290
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:54,298
Do an inventory count.

291
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:55,616
Put your back into it.

292
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:57,218
Carry it over here. Come.

293
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:03,857
Mister Shiqi, we lost them.

294
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:07,120
These people rescued
the great imperial grandson during the chaos.

295
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,096
And, they were highly skilled.

296
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:10,177
It's likely that it was General Han
and his subordinates.

297
00:19:10,178 --> 00:19:11,616
I think the great imperial grandson is safe.

298
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,937
How can we be sure that
it was General Han and his subordinates?

299
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:15,937
What if he was abducted by some outlaws?

300
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:17,620
You knew I promised Consort Xiao

301
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,217
that I would save
the great imperial grandson.

302
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:20,856
However, you brought a fake here

303
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:21,737
to deceive Sun Jing.

304
00:19:21,738 --> 00:19:22,740
Has it ever occurred to you

305
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,680
that he might also harm
the real great imperial grandson

306
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,560
even when he falls for it?

307
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,616
Naturally.

308
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:27,776
So, you did so even though

309
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:28,937
you knew it was a huge risk.

310
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:32,160
I've run through the situation repeatedly
plenty of time.

311
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,200
I was 80% sure
that Sun Jing would fall for it

312
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,800
and we could save
the great imperial grandson.

313
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,058
80%?

314
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:38,857
What about the other 20%?

315
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:42,816
It would be best if we could save

316
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:44,417
the great imperial grandson.

317
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,576
However, if something did go wrong,

318
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:48,017
it would be my fault.

319
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:49,257
It has nothing to do with you.

320
00:19:49,258 --> 00:19:51,136
What do you mean by

321
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:52,376
it would be your fault

322
00:19:52,377 --> 00:19:53,657
and it has nothing to do with me?

323
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:57,538
Shiqi,

324
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:59,937
must you make me state the obvious?

325
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:02,058
Don't you understand well enough?

326
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:04,657
If you did bring the great imperial grandson
back to the capital,

327
00:20:04,658 --> 00:20:06,096
don't you think it'll stir up

328
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:07,056
another storm

329
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:08,657
within the court?

330
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:11,400
I know what you're thinking.

331
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,600
You want His Majesty to appoint

332
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,296
the great imperial grandson
as the crown prince.

333
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,616
But have you ever thought of this?

334
00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:18,017
The world has just settled down
and people haven't settled down yet.

335
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:20,497
Do you think the entire court
will feel the same way as you?

336
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:21,536
Do you think the court

337
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:23,778
can afford to let this happen again?

338
00:20:29,498 --> 00:20:31,778
Since you understood
the situation so much,

339
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:34,377
why didn't you discuss the plan
with me in advance?

340
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:36,258
It's because you knew

341
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:38,457
that I would never agree to it, right?

342
00:20:40,297 --> 00:20:41,296
That's right.

343
00:20:41,297 --> 00:20:43,296
Your Highness,
you're mighty and intelligent.

344
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:45,257
I shouldn't have interfered
had I known this would happen.

345
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:46,497
I should've let you take your own life

346
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:48,298
and let the people praise you
for being a martyr.

347
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:50,897
I would definitely pay my respect to you
and burn an incense stick

348
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:52,218
when I pass by your tomb in the future.

349
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:23,336
Lieutenant He,

350
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:25,617
it was all my fault.

351
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:27,657
I failed to protect
the great imperial grandson.

352
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:30,617
It has nothing to do with you.

353
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:33,816
Although I told you

354
00:21:33,817 --> 00:21:35,417
to rescue the great imperial grandson,

355
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:37,338
I never expected someone else

356
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:39,818
to be lurking beside us.

357
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:41,498
It's likely

358
00:21:42,297 --> 00:21:43,217
that it was General Han

359
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,538
and his subordinates.

360
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,937
You're no match for them.

361
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,338
How's your wound?

362
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,018
I'm fine.

363
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:58,377
But I heard from Ear

364
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,536
that Lord Qin threw a fit in public

365
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:02,137
and argued with you.

366
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:07,617
Don't mention him in front of me.

367
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:15,136
Sun Jing left in a hurry.

368
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:16,257
He burned down

369
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:17,617
his study room.

370
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:18,776
Most of the books here

371
00:22:18,777 --> 00:22:20,058
are gone.

372
00:22:20,178 --> 00:22:21,737
These are all my men and I managed

373
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:23,978
to find under the rubble.

374
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:26,376
I finally understand now.

375
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:29,056
Someone from the court was actually
colluding with Sun Jing in secret.

376
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,857
They assisted him from time to time.

377
00:22:30,898 --> 00:22:33,257
However, there's no signature
on the letters.

378
00:22:33,258 --> 00:22:35,578
And, they used secret codes
for the letter.

379
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:36,576
We can't locate

380
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:38,097
the culprit as of now.

381
00:22:38,698 --> 00:22:39,576
Shiqi,

382
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:41,296
we have to be careful

383
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:43,177
after returning to Xichang.

384
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:46,018
You're right.

385
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:49,056
Li Ni has reclaimed Tong Pass.

386
00:22:49,057 --> 00:22:50,616
He sent his men
to deliver an urgent report back.

387
00:22:50,617 --> 00:22:53,056
He even brought back
the corpse of Sun Jing.

388
00:22:53,057 --> 00:22:55,616
All these officials are saying

389
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:58,298
that he has rendered
yet another huge merit.

390
00:22:58,498 --> 00:22:59,576
Even my eldest brother

391
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,776
is no match for him.

392
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:03,697
I suppose Li Ni would be

393
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:06,417
the crown prince in future.

394
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:08,538
There's a foreigner

395
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:10,977
who seeks an audience with you,
Your Highness.

396
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:13,218
He kept sending his men here.

397
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:14,657
I met him as I was fed up

398
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:15,856
with his requests.

399
00:23:15,857 --> 00:23:16,616
He said

400
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:18,018
he has a wonderful plan

401
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:20,137
to assist you in ascending the throne,
Your Highness.

402
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:23,816
His surname is Liu.

403
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:25,657
He was once Cui Yi's adopted son.

404
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:27,257
After speaking to him,

405
00:23:27,258 --> 00:23:29,776
I realized that he was devious.

406
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:31,617
And, he had a unique background.

407
00:23:32,018 --> 00:23:34,738
He's definitely the sworn enemy
of the Cui family.

408
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:36,097
He might be of use to us.

409
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,657
Young Master Liu,
I've long heard of your name.

410
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:47,058
Your Highness, you must be joking.

411
00:23:47,137 --> 00:23:48,778
How could you have heard of my name?

412
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:51,737
Now,

413
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:53,376
I'm just a lone wanderer.

414
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:55,257
Since you're a lone wanderer,

415
00:23:55,258 --> 00:23:57,136
how can you serve me then?

416
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:59,296
Lord Qin has reclaimed Tong Pass

417
00:23:59,297 --> 00:24:00,857
and defeated Sun Jing.

418
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:03,097
He has rendered such a huge merit.

419
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:04,457
Once he returns to the capital,

420
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:05,697
he'll be in the lead when it comes to

421
00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:07,136
the title of the crown prince.

422
00:24:07,137 --> 00:24:09,417
Your Highness, as his elder brother,

423
00:24:10,857 --> 00:24:13,336
don't you think that you're
in a dangerous position?

424
00:24:13,337 --> 00:24:15,497
My eldest brother is still here.

425
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:16,776
Li Ni has to wait for his turn

426
00:24:16,777 --> 00:24:18,257
to get appointed.

427
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:19,056
If Li Ni

428
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,536
marries the only daughter of Cui Yi,

429
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:21,616
both the Cui Army

430
00:24:21,617 --> 00:24:23,096
and the Zhenxi Army

431
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:25,298
will be under Li Ni's command.

432
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:26,897
By then,

433
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,296
even His Majesty

434
00:24:28,297 --> 00:24:30,258
can't do anything about Lord Qin.

435
00:24:30,577 --> 00:24:33,417
Forget about being the crown prince.

436
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:34,977
I'm afraid

437
00:24:34,978 --> 00:24:37,338
you won't even have the right
to demand the position

438
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,538
of a carefree lord.

439
00:24:41,377 --> 00:24:43,697
Li Ni is marrying
the only daughter of Cui Yi?

440
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:45,737
They were in a relationship long ago.

441
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:47,498
Your Highness,

442
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:48,657
why do you think

443
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:50,177
Lord Qin can send the Cui Army

444
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:50,897
to save Pei Yuan

445
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:52,816
with just a single letter?

446
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:54,657
Why Lord Qin promised

447
00:24:54,658 --> 00:24:56,417
to appoint Cui Yi as General Weiyang

448
00:24:56,418 --> 00:24:58,578
that made him withdraw from Changzhou?

449
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:00,217
Why Zhenxi Army

450
00:25:00,218 --> 00:25:01,296
can join hands with the Cui Army

451
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:03,417
and reclaim Tong Pass together?

452
00:25:06,097 --> 00:25:07,657
I see.

453
00:25:09,577 --> 00:25:12,097
Your Highness, I'm sure
you already thought of a way.

454
00:25:12,418 --> 00:25:13,336
Do you wish

455
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:14,937
to send your men

456
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:16,737
to intercept and kill Lord Qin

457
00:25:16,738 --> 00:25:18,218
on his way back?

458
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:20,697
But Your Highness, can you ensure

459
00:25:20,698 --> 00:25:22,897
that you'll be able

460
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:25,298
to assassinate Lord Qin

461
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:27,457
under such tight security?

462
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:32,018
Young Master Liu,
what plan do you have in mind then?

463
00:25:33,817 --> 00:25:35,978
Your Highness, why don't you
give him a surprise

464
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:38,538
and start by targeting Cui Lin?

465
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:41,738
Attacking his heart is paramount
to your cause.

466
00:25:41,777 --> 00:25:43,617
Once he's flustered,

467
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:45,778
he'll reveal his flaws.

468
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,218
By then,

469
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:50,457
you can use the opportunity

470
00:25:50,537 --> 00:25:52,258
to get rid of Lord Qin.

471
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:56,457
That's a good plan.

472
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,376
But it's difficult

473
00:25:58,377 --> 00:25:59,977
to implement.

474
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:01,457
Your Highness, don't worry.

475
00:26:01,658 --> 00:26:03,457
Since I've come up
with this plan for you,

476
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,977
I will surely lead my men

477
00:26:05,978 --> 00:26:08,937
to serve you.

478
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:10,536
How should I reward you

479
00:26:10,537 --> 00:26:13,097
after the deed is done then?

480
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:16,457
Your Highness, serving you

481
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,536
is my wish.

482
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,097
I don't expect any rewards.

483
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:21,977
I just hope

484
00:26:21,978 --> 00:26:25,097
that you can allocate
some of your forces to me.

485
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:32,457
It's been a few days.

486
00:26:32,978 --> 00:26:35,056
Lord Qin is inside Tong Pass

487
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:37,097
while we're outside.

488
00:26:37,337 --> 00:26:39,258
Logically speaking,

489
00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:40,617
it's not that far away.

490
00:26:48,057 --> 00:26:50,457
Lord Qin is something else.

491
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,336
It's fine that he's not here personally.

492
00:26:52,337 --> 00:26:54,177
But he didn't even send his men here.

493
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:56,177
Lieutenant He,

494
00:26:56,178 --> 00:26:57,376
say,

495
00:26:57,377 --> 00:26:58,257
do you think Lord Qin

496
00:26:58,258 --> 00:26:59,897
is truly mad at you this time?

497
00:27:02,297 --> 00:27:04,137
Why are you so worried about him?

498
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:05,977
Whether Lord Qin is mad or not

499
00:27:05,978 --> 00:27:07,578
has nothing to do with me.

500
00:27:08,698 --> 00:27:10,058
You see,

501
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,257
you were on good terms with

502
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:15,136
Lord Qin before this.

503
00:27:15,137 --> 00:27:17,177
You guys only argued

504
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:18,816
because of the issue

505
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:20,376
with the great imperial grandson.

506
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:22,058
Taozi, what's wrong with you today?

507
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:24,097
You weren't this long-winded usually.

508
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:27,616
I was just thinking

509
00:27:27,617 --> 00:27:30,298
that Lord Qin might be sick.

510
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:32,576
The weather has been
ever-changing lately.

511
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:33,978
It changes all the time.

512
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:35,697
I heard

513
00:27:35,698 --> 00:27:38,137
that many people inside the pass
have fallen sick.

514
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:39,937
Even Ear

515
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:41,816
caught a cold.

516
00:27:41,817 --> 00:27:43,657
If you feel sorry for Ear,

517
00:27:43,658 --> 00:27:45,177
you can deliver medicine
to him personally.

518
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:46,897
No.

519
00:27:46,938 --> 00:27:48,536
I won't go.

520
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:49,457
Lieutenant He,

521
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:51,977
I will ignore Ear

522
00:27:51,978 --> 00:27:53,056
for as long as you ignore

523
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:54,258
Lord Qin.

524
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,338
I will never talk to him.

525
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:20,697
Ear.

526
00:28:22,738 --> 00:28:23,778
Taozi!

527
00:28:24,498 --> 00:28:25,897
Taozi, you're finally here.

528
00:28:25,898 --> 00:28:26,978
What did Lieutenant He say?

529
00:28:27,978 --> 00:28:29,616
She's still behaving the same.

530
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:31,417
I spent a long time talking to her.

531
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,096
But she wasn't even

532
00:28:32,097 --> 00:28:33,697
willing to mention Lord Qin.

533
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:35,056
What should we do then?

534
00:28:35,057 --> 00:28:35,977
When I came here,

535
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:37,578
Bao and the rest instructed me

536
00:28:37,777 --> 00:28:38,580
to request your help

537
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,457
in helping Lieutenant He and
Mister Shiqi to reconcile.

538
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,056
You had no idea.

539
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:43,097
Mister Shiqi is still very mad.

540
00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:45,056
He drags us out of bed
to train with him before dawn.

541
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,417
He just had to drag us along.

542
00:28:46,418 --> 00:28:48,257
It was either a sword or spear training.

543
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:49,338
If not,

544
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:50,856
it was military formations.

545
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:52,338
We can't take it any longer.

546
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,697
It's pointless to tell me that.

547
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:57,177
I'm running out of ideas

548
00:28:57,178 --> 00:28:58,257
to convince

549
00:28:58,258 --> 00:28:59,498
Young Lady as well.

550
00:29:01,537 --> 00:29:02,296
Why don't you

551
00:29:02,297 --> 00:29:03,177
tell Lord Qin

552
00:29:03,178 --> 00:29:03,937
to feign illness?

553
00:29:03,938 --> 00:29:04,737
This way,

554
00:29:04,738 --> 00:29:05,977
I can tell Young Lady

555
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,498
to visit Lord Qin.

556
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:10,776
Lord Qin wouldn't drag us out of bed
to train with him before dawn

557
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:12,457
if he was willing to do so.

558
00:29:15,258 --> 00:29:17,097
What should we do then?

559
00:29:21,617 --> 00:29:22,538
Bao!

560
00:29:23,018 --> 00:29:24,018
Bao!

561
00:29:28,978 --> 00:29:29,776
How is it?

562
00:29:29,777 --> 00:29:31,338
What did Taozi say?

563
00:29:31,577 --> 00:29:33,457
Taozi gave me an idea.

564
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:34,697
However,

565
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,457
I think it's inappropriate.

566
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,776
If he's not willing to feign illness,

567
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,697
let's make him

568
00:29:39,698 --> 00:29:41,778
sick for real then.

569
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:46,017
Feed him with this.

570
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,417
He'll fall sick after consuming this.

571
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,056
By then, I'll tell Young Lady

572
00:29:49,057 --> 00:29:49,856
that Lord Qin is sick

573
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:51,258
and tell her to visit him.

574
00:29:52,377 --> 00:29:53,697
I don't think this is appropriate.

575
00:29:53,698 --> 00:29:55,217
How is this inappropriate?

576
00:29:55,218 --> 00:29:56,897
I think it's appropriate.

577
00:29:56,898 --> 00:29:57,497
Bao!

578
00:29:57,498 --> 00:29:58,536
Ear,

579
00:29:58,537 --> 00:29:59,737
you had no idea.

580
00:29:59,738 --> 00:30:01,417
Mister Shiqi dragged me
to do his rounds with him

581
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:02,697
around the camp until midnight.

582
00:30:02,698 --> 00:30:03,937
This morning,

583
00:30:03,938 --> 00:30:05,136
he woke me up

584
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,776
and told me to train with him.

585
00:30:06,777 --> 00:30:09,280
I had enough of this.

586
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,257
If you don't feed him with this,
I'll feed him with this.

587
00:30:11,258 --> 00:30:12,096
Bao.

588
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:13,096
This won't do. What if...

589
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:14,257
There's nothing to fear.

590
00:30:14,258 --> 00:30:15,737
If he doesn't fall sick,

591
00:30:15,738 --> 00:30:17,136
I'll lose my mind.

592
00:30:17,137 --> 00:30:18,616
He should fall sick
and rest for a few days.

593
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,457
If not, I'll surely lose my mind.

594
00:30:21,057 --> 00:30:22,897
Bao!

595
00:30:39,258 --> 00:30:40,897
Let me make a mark here.

596
00:30:41,857 --> 00:30:43,776
The one with the mark
has the drug in it.

597
00:30:43,777 --> 00:30:45,737
The ones without it are fine.

598
00:30:45,738 --> 00:30:48,218
The one with the mark has the drug in it
and the ones without it are fine.

599
00:30:49,377 --> 00:30:50,778
Mister Shiqi!

600
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,177
Mister Shiqi.

601
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:53,217
You've trained for some time.

602
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,336
I'm sure you're starving.

603
00:30:54,337 --> 00:30:55,897
These are fresh from the kitchen.

604
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:57,498
Come and have some.

605
00:31:00,018 --> 00:31:01,697
Why would the kitchen
make such fine desserts?

606
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:03,497
Sun Jing's cook

607
00:31:03,498 --> 00:31:04,616
is still alive.

608
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:05,576
I told him to make this.

609
00:31:05,577 --> 00:31:06,897
You should try his cooking.

610
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:08,417
Look at them.

611
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:10,657
They look exquisite and delicious.

612
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:11,738
Try it.

613
00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:15,697
Look.

614
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:18,778
Delicious.

615
00:31:24,297 --> 00:31:25,298
Delicious.

616
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,298
It's delicious, right?

617
00:31:28,978 --> 00:31:30,018
It's delicious.

618
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:38,778
I told you so.

619
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,018
Bao, what's wrong?

620
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,417
Are you unwell?

621
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:15,417
It's delicious.

622
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:17,737
We're brothers!

623
00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:19,697
How dare you trick me?

624
00:32:23,097 --> 00:32:24,778
Bao,

625
00:32:25,178 --> 00:32:26,816
you see, I was a scout myself.

626
00:32:26,817 --> 00:32:28,457
Poisoning one's food
is the most basic maneuver.

627
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:29,616
How dare you

628
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:30,776
try that in front of me?

629
00:32:30,777 --> 00:32:32,497
You drag me from my bed
to train with you.

630
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:34,217
I never slept for more
than four hours per day.

631
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:36,056
I had to do sword or spear training
with you every day!

632
00:32:36,057 --> 00:32:37,697
And now, you even swapped

633
00:32:37,698 --> 00:32:40,218
the drugged dessert and made me eat it?

634
00:32:41,297 --> 00:32:42,937
I'm going to sever my ties with you.

635
00:32:42,938 --> 00:32:44,697
I'm going to sever my ties with you!

636
00:32:57,137 --> 00:32:58,137
Young Master,

637
00:32:58,297 --> 00:33:00,097
are you sure you want to do this
to Lieutenant He?

638
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:02,716
The Jieshuo people were only willing
to give us one portion of this poison.

639
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:04,616
It's said that this was
one of their most precious poison.

640
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:06,857
Once one consumes it, they won't exhibit
any symptoms of poisoning.

641
00:33:07,097 --> 00:33:08,816
One will only exhibit
symptoms of serious illness.

642
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:09,657
Even the best physician

643
00:33:09,658 --> 00:33:10,778
cannot tell.

644
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:13,056
One will die in a few days

645
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,018
without the antidote.

646
00:33:16,898 --> 00:33:18,778
If Ying remains fine,

647
00:33:19,057 --> 00:33:20,657
Li Ni will stay calm.

648
00:33:20,658 --> 00:33:21,977
If Li Ni stays calm,

649
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:23,978
there's no way we can kill Li Ni.

650
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:26,338
There's no way we can abduct Ying too.

651
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:30,018
Go now.

652
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:31,857
Be careful.

653
00:33:32,658 --> 00:33:33,617
Yes, Young Master.

654
00:34:00,978 --> 00:34:02,697
Young Lady, what's wrong?

655
00:34:03,658 --> 00:34:04,697
Let me examine you.

656
00:34:06,057 --> 00:34:08,018
I felt unwell when I woke up
this morning.

657
00:34:10,097 --> 00:34:12,017
Now, I have a severe headache.

658
00:34:13,537 --> 00:34:14,497
It's so hot.

659
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:15,818
I'm sure you have a fever.

660
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:18,017
So,

661
00:34:18,577 --> 00:34:20,098
it's just a fever.

662
00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:40,256
Bao, why have your skills
deteriorated so much?

663
00:34:40,257 --> 00:34:41,696
I was never your match in the past.

664
00:34:41,697 --> 00:34:42,377
Besides,

665
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:43,800
I already had diarrhea for several days.

666
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,720
I'm already weak enough.

667
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,098
Even so, you're not going easy on me.

668
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:50,338
You!

669
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:52,297
You even hit me for real!

670
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:52,736
You...

671
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:55,098
Mister Shiqi!

672
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:56,536
What is it?

673
00:34:56,537 --> 00:34:57,576
Taozi is here.

674
00:34:57,577 --> 00:34:58,817
She said it was an emergency.

675
00:34:58,818 --> 00:34:59,577
I won't see her.

676
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:01,176
But Mister Shiqi, it's emergency.

677
00:35:01,177 --> 00:35:02,377
From her?

678
00:35:02,378 --> 00:35:03,656
If it's related to the military,

679
00:35:03,657 --> 00:35:04,457
tell her to write a fold

680
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:05,656
and send it to our camp.

681
00:35:05,657 --> 00:35:07,056
Lord Qin, as our ally,

682
00:35:07,057 --> 00:35:08,337
are you going to leave us in the lurch?

683
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:09,417
Let me go!

684
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:14,216
Lord Qin.

685
00:35:14,217 --> 00:35:15,338
What's the matter?

686
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:17,337
Lieutenan He is sick.

687
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:18,818
She's seriously ill.

688
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,680
If she's ill, you should seek a physician.

689
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,656
Why are you looking for me?

690
00:35:21,657 --> 00:35:23,096
I've been reading her pulse since young.

691
00:35:23,097 --> 00:35:24,778
I knew what her constitution was like.

692
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:25,777
This time,

693
00:35:25,778 --> 00:35:27,337
her condition is truly peculiar.

694
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:29,176
First, she had a high fever.

695
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:30,937
It didn't work no matter

696
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:32,897
what I did.

697
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:34,178
Today,

698
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:35,216
Lieutenant He

699
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,537
has already fallen into a coma.

700
00:35:36,697 --> 00:35:37,616
Your Highness,

701
00:35:37,617 --> 00:35:39,056
please go and check on her.

702
00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:40,216
This is the first time

703
00:35:40,217 --> 00:35:41,778
I've seen such a strange condition.

704
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:43,440
So, even you can't treat her?

705
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,817
All the more you should
seek a physician.

706
00:35:44,818 --> 00:35:45,857
You!

707
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:48,616
Lord Qin, you're truly ruthless.

708
00:35:48,617 --> 00:35:49,777
Let's forget about other things.

709
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:50,857
The Cui Army

710
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:52,536
is the ally of the Zhenxi Army, right?

711
00:35:52,537 --> 00:35:54,017
You can't just treat her like this

712
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,738
even if you only see us as your ally!

713
00:35:56,938 --> 00:35:58,377
You're truly ruthless!

714
00:35:58,378 --> 00:35:59,298
Mister Shiqi...

715
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:00,738
Taozi!

716
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:02,098
Taozi!

717
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:05,897
Hey.

718
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:07,698
Why are you being so ruthless?

719
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:12,256
Stop pretending.

720
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:14,096
You think I have no idea
what you guys are up to?

721
00:36:14,097 --> 00:36:15,656
At first, you wanted to make me sick.

722
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:16,817
It didn't work.

723
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:18,216
So now, you're making her sick.

724
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:18,777
Am I right?

725
00:36:18,778 --> 00:36:20,937
This time, it has nothing to do with me.

726
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:22,658
I swear.

727
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,937
(I should still check on her.)

728
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,098
(What if she's truly sick?)

729
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,297
Young Lady,

730
00:37:23,298 --> 00:37:24,736
you must hang in there.

731
00:37:24,737 --> 00:37:26,777
I've already ordered our men
to notify Great General

732
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,136
at the fastest speed they can.

733
00:37:28,137 --> 00:37:28,616
He...

734
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:30,618
He'll surely rush here soon.

735
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:32,618
Young Lady, you must hang in there!

736
00:37:47,137 --> 00:37:48,497
Mister Shiqi.

737
00:37:48,737 --> 00:37:50,057
It's me.

738
00:37:56,978 --> 00:38:01,258
The moon and stars are
shining brightly tonight.

739
00:38:01,818 --> 00:38:02,937
Mister Shiqi, let's go.

740
00:38:02,938 --> 00:38:04,258
Let's go and do our rounds.

741
00:38:04,898 --> 00:38:06,977
I thought you were complaining
that you didn't get enough sleep.

742
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:09,050
You had all kinds of excuses
when I told you to do your rounds.

743
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,138
So, why are you so proactive today?

744
00:38:11,818 --> 00:38:13,857
Tonight is different.

745
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:16,176
I'm fully energized.

746
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:17,817
I'll join you in doing your rounds

747
00:38:17,818 --> 00:38:20,057
so that you won't go ahead
and do something else.

748
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:23,098
What do you mean by something else?

749
00:38:24,657 --> 00:38:27,056
It's best if you're not up to something.

750
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:28,577
Let's go.

751
00:38:29,778 --> 00:38:32,160
I'll keep you company the whole night

752
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,178
until they do a roll call in the morning.

753
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:36,616
Come on.

754
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:37,937
Let's go.

755
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:38,977
Tonight,

756
00:38:38,978 --> 00:38:40,696
we'll patrol

757
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:43,017
every corner of the camp.

758
00:38:47,378 --> 00:38:48,698
Young Lady!

759
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,818
Young Lady!

760
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:52,977
Taozi.

761
00:38:54,217 --> 00:38:55,857
Taozi, the medicine is ready.

762
00:38:55,858 --> 00:38:56,817
I bought these herbs

763
00:38:56,818 --> 00:38:57,817
from the apothecaries nearby

764
00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:58,696
as per your instruction.

765
00:38:58,697 --> 00:39:00,056
I brewed them personally

766
00:39:00,057 --> 00:39:00,777
on the stove.

767
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:02,138
The timing was just right.

768
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,096
Young Lady.

769
00:39:03,097 --> 00:39:04,577
Your medicine is here, Young Lady.

770
00:39:05,537 --> 00:39:06,778
Give me the medicine.

771
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:10,577
Young Lady, your medicine is here.

772
00:39:10,737 --> 00:39:12,178
You'll be fine after consuming it.

773
00:39:18,498 --> 00:39:19,297
Young Lady...

774
00:39:19,298 --> 00:39:20,497
Young Lady, I'm begging you.

775
00:39:20,498 --> 00:39:21,736
Please open your mouth.

776
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,977
You'll be fine after
taking the medicine.

777
00:39:28,057 --> 00:39:28,977
Young Lady,

778
00:39:28,978 --> 00:39:30,656
I'm at my wits' end now.

779
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:32,937
Young Lady, please take a sip.

780
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:44,778
Young Lady.

781
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:48,377
Taozi,

782
00:39:48,378 --> 00:39:50,017
I'll bring Mister Shiqi here.

783
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:50,736
I'll drag him here

784
00:39:50,737 --> 00:39:52,057
if I have to.

785
00:39:52,177 --> 00:39:53,537
Don't!

786
00:39:53,978 --> 00:39:55,656
He's a heartless person.

787
00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:57,457
Why are you trying to bring him here?

788
00:39:58,418 --> 00:39:59,040
That's not it.

789
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,337
I'm sure he has no idea
that Lieutenant He is in this condition.

790
00:40:01,338 --> 00:40:03,098
Mister Shiqi isn't someone like that.

791
00:40:11,418 --> 00:40:12,897
Watch over Young Lady for me.

792
00:40:12,898 --> 00:40:14,337
I'll notify the troops

793
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:15,738
to increase security.

794
00:40:16,378 --> 00:40:18,056
She's seriously ill right now.

795
00:40:18,057 --> 00:40:20,056
We mustn't let outsiders
take advantage of this situation.

796
00:40:20,057 --> 00:40:20,897
Okay.

797
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:23,338
By the way,

798
00:40:23,577 --> 00:40:24,897
you should leave

799
00:40:24,898 --> 00:40:26,258
when I come back

800
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,338
so that you'll be present
for the roll call.

801
00:40:28,498 --> 00:40:29,176
No.

802
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,136
I'll keep you company here.

803
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:31,778
You're from the Zhenxi Army.

804
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:33,616
I'm worried

805
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:35,056
that Great General might execute you

806
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,098
when he sees Young Lady
in this condition.

807
00:40:47,217 --> 00:40:48,338
Young Master.

808
00:40:49,938 --> 00:40:51,017
How is it?

809
00:40:51,978 --> 00:40:53,658
Lord Qin still hasn't shown himself yet.

810
00:40:57,257 --> 00:40:59,138
This is truly unexpected.

811
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,096
Li Ni

812
00:41:01,097 --> 00:41:02,937
is truly heartless.

813
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:06,457
I knew Ying was wrong about him.

814
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:08,377
Young Master,

815
00:41:08,658 --> 00:41:10,838
it's been three days since Lieutenant He
was struck with the poison.

816
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,857
If she doesn't get the antidote today,

817
00:41:12,858 --> 00:41:13,800
her health will be affected

818
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,698
even if we feed her with
the antidote the next morning.

819
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:21,818
Let's wait a little longer.

820
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:33,536
Mister Shiqi,

821
00:41:33,537 --> 00:41:34,616
don't go yet.

822
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,937
It's only one o'clock.

823
00:41:35,938 --> 00:41:37,616
Why are you heading back already?

824
00:41:37,617 --> 00:41:39,736
We're already done with our patrol.
Why should we stay here?

825
00:41:39,737 --> 00:41:40,857
Let's patrol the camp again.

826
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:41,817
Didn't I tell you already?

827
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:43,136
I'll keep you company until dawn.

828
00:41:43,137 --> 00:41:44,117
I have something else to do.

829
00:41:44,117 --> 00:41:45,497
What do you mean?

830
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:48,256
I haven't read the letters

831
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:49,497
I received from the capital.

832
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:52,096
You can read them tomorrow.

833
00:41:52,097 --> 00:41:53,337
It's not like it's an emergency.

834
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:54,417
I'm heading to sleep.

835
00:41:55,257 --> 00:41:58,297
Did you forget what you said to me
a few nights before?

836
00:41:58,298 --> 00:41:59,457
Not sleepy.

837
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,377
We're not sleepy at all.

838
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:03,937
You're doing this on purpose, right?

839
00:42:06,097 --> 00:42:07,777
You got it right this time.

840
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:09,497
I'm doing this on purpose.

841
00:42:09,498 --> 00:42:10,977
Fine. Let's continue then.

842
00:42:10,978 --> 00:42:11,536
Come on then.

843
00:42:11,537 --> 00:42:12,356
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

844
00:42:12,356 --> 00:42:13,017
Let's go.

845
00:42:17,378 --> 00:42:18,937
Now, you can't stop me.

846
00:42:28,577 --> 00:42:30,537
Young Master, it's almost dawn.

847
00:42:31,378 --> 00:42:33,258
I never expected

848
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:36,017
Ying to entrust herself to such a scum

849
00:42:37,298 --> 00:42:39,338
when she's that intelligent.

850
00:42:39,537 --> 00:42:41,857
The Cui Army has tightened their security.

851
00:42:42,298 --> 00:42:43,817
I'm afraid it'll be difficult for me

852
00:42:43,818 --> 00:42:45,616
to enter the camp if we wait until dawn.

853
00:42:45,617 --> 00:42:46,337
The antidote...

854
00:42:46,338 --> 00:42:47,298
Go now.

855
00:42:47,418 --> 00:42:49,417
Give Ying the antidote.

856
00:42:49,737 --> 00:42:50,778
Yes, Young Master.

857
00:43:02,978 --> 00:43:03,857
Taozi.

858
00:43:09,577 --> 00:43:11,218
Lord Qin, what are you doing here?

859
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,417
Was Lieutenant He

860
00:43:12,418 --> 00:43:13,696
truly sick?

861
00:43:13,697 --> 00:43:15,256
Lieutenant He is fine.

862
00:43:15,257 --> 00:43:16,457
You don't need to worry about her.

863
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:17,937
Was she truly sick?

864
00:43:17,938 --> 00:43:19,377
Of course not.

865
00:43:20,617 --> 00:43:21,997
Your Highness, please mind your conduct.

866
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:23,497
This is the Cui Army's camp.

867
00:43:23,498 --> 00:43:24,977
If you keep this up,

868
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:27,017
I will have to chase you out.

869
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:29,536
Taozi,

870
00:43:29,537 --> 00:43:31,017
who are you speaking with?

871
00:43:31,018 --> 00:43:32,057
Young Lady!

872
00:43:32,938 --> 00:43:33,897
Young Lady!

873
00:43:33,898 --> 00:43:35,098
Be careful.

874
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:36,577
Come.

875
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,818
Let me examine you.

876
00:43:42,177 --> 00:43:43,618
I'm fine.

877
00:43:46,378 --> 00:43:48,098
I'm sure you were worried about me.

878
00:43:48,657 --> 00:43:50,618
I was.

879
00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:55,897
Ying,

880
00:43:57,057 --> 00:43:58,497
were you truly sick?

881
00:44:00,898 --> 00:44:02,096
Are you unwell?

882
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,537
Do you feel better now?

883
00:44:07,137 --> 00:44:08,897
Lord Qin, please mind your conduct.

884
00:44:09,818 --> 00:44:11,377
It's just a minor illness.

885
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:14,457
You don't need to worry about me.

886
00:44:18,257 --> 00:44:19,338
Taozi,

887
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:23,178
you should leave for now.

888
00:44:23,298 --> 00:44:24,818
I need to speak with

889
00:44:25,298 --> 00:44:26,696
Lord Qin in private.

890
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:27,817
Young Lady,

891
00:44:27,818 --> 00:44:29,096
you just regained consciousness.

892
00:44:29,097 --> 00:44:30,618
Let me keep you company.

893
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,457
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

894
00:44:35,018 --> 00:44:36,057
Go now.

895
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:53,457
Ying.

896
00:45:00,338 --> 00:45:02,738
You hate me for deceiving you.

897
00:45:04,217 --> 00:45:05,738
I've been thinking about it

898
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,338
for the past few days.

899
00:45:10,018 --> 00:45:12,017
Even if I were to be
in the same situation again,

900
00:45:12,657 --> 00:45:14,377
I would do the same.

901
00:45:16,177 --> 00:45:18,298
I never regretted my decision.

902
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,818
It's because I thought

903
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,897
that it wasn't worth it
for you to exchange your life

904
00:45:23,898 --> 00:45:25,497
for the great imperial grandson's,

905
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:30,537
no matter if it's the real or fake one.

906
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,298
You're sick.

907
00:45:35,418 --> 00:45:37,138
Let's drop the topic.

908
00:45:41,617 --> 00:45:42,937
When I had a high fever

909
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:44,778
and was lethargic,

910
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:48,738
I hoped that you would visit me.

911
00:45:50,697 --> 00:45:52,618
People are frail

912
00:45:53,057 --> 00:45:54,818
when they're sick.

913
00:45:57,177 --> 00:45:58,977
I lost my mother since young.

914
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:02,138
I don't have many kin.

915
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:06,138
Right now, you're my closest kin

916
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,138
besides my father.

917
00:46:14,257 --> 00:46:16,057
Back then,

918
00:46:16,577 --> 00:46:20,857
I thought that I was
still more important

919
00:46:21,978 --> 00:46:30,298
than other things or people
in your heart if you visited me.

920
00:46:31,978 --> 00:46:33,377
If you did come and visit me,

921
00:46:33,378 --> 00:46:34,777
even if I was angry,

922
00:46:34,778 --> 00:46:37,818
I could explain myself to you.

923
00:46:38,057 --> 00:46:41,738
This way, you'll understand
my intention next time.

924
00:46:48,177 --> 00:46:49,738
But you didn't come.

925
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:53,017
I know.

926
00:46:54,617 --> 00:46:56,417
You still hate me for that.

927
00:46:56,498 --> 00:46:58,057
I don't hate you.

928
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:01,497
In my heart, you're more important

929
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:04,658
than anyone else.

930
00:47:07,298 --> 00:47:08,696
Your Highness,

931
00:47:08,697 --> 00:47:10,377
please stop lying to yourself.

932
00:47:16,018 --> 00:47:17,216
If so, let me tell you

933
00:47:17,217 --> 00:47:18,537
my heartfelt words too.

934
00:47:21,097 --> 00:47:22,537
Listen.

935
00:47:23,577 --> 00:47:24,977
I don't care about

936
00:47:24,978 --> 00:47:26,417
being Lord Qin

937
00:47:26,697 --> 00:47:28,096
or the commander-in-chief.

938
00:47:28,097 --> 00:47:30,777
I only wish to fulfill
Consort Xiao's request

939
00:47:30,778 --> 00:47:34,377
and return to Laolan Pass

940
00:47:34,778 --> 00:47:36,577
as we enjoy our days there.

941
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:40,818
Shiqi,

942
00:47:41,217 --> 00:47:43,338
there's no way you can return
to Laolan Pass now.

943
00:47:44,097 --> 00:47:45,337
Your father

944
00:47:45,338 --> 00:47:47,298
is the current emperor.

945
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,897
Sun Jing is dead.
The rule has been established.

946
00:47:49,898 --> 00:47:51,417
Your brothers

947
00:47:51,418 --> 00:47:53,417
only have eyes for power and wealth.

948
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:54,897
Are you sure you can hand

949
00:47:54,898 --> 00:47:56,656
the empire to them?

950
00:47:56,657 --> 00:47:57,857
I told you before.

951
00:47:58,498 --> 00:48:00,298
After saving
the great imperial grandson,

952
00:48:00,537 --> 00:48:01,880
I will try my best
to persuade His Majesty

953
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,817
to appoint the great imperial grandson
as the crown prince.

954
00:48:03,818 --> 00:48:05,696
Do you know how old he is?

955
00:48:05,697 --> 00:48:07,216
He's still young.

956
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,316
How can you identify his traits
and strengths at such a young age?

957
00:48:09,316 --> 00:48:10,417
What if he ends up becoming

958
00:48:10,418 --> 00:48:11,616
a mediocre person when he grows up?

959
00:48:11,617 --> 00:48:13,337
How can he rule the world by then?

960
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:15,680
The great imperial grandson is
the descendant of the imperial lineage.

961
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,057
He should succeed the throne.

962
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:19,537
Moreover, he's talented,

963
00:48:19,737 --> 00:48:21,537
and he has countless talented subjects

964
00:48:21,657 --> 00:48:22,977
who can assist him.

965
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:24,760
He'll definitely become a great ruler
in the future.

966
00:48:25,057 --> 00:48:26,857
Do you think those two brothers of yours

967
00:48:26,858 --> 00:48:28,977
will let him live until adulthood?

968
00:48:28,978 --> 00:48:30,577
In the end,

969
00:48:30,858 --> 00:48:31,616
you think I should

970
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,977
fight for the throne?

971
00:48:32,978 --> 00:48:34,098
That's right.

972
00:48:35,097 --> 00:48:36,696
It's because I think you're
the best candidate

973
00:48:36,697 --> 00:48:38,857
to be the ruler of the world.

974
00:48:40,737 --> 00:48:43,658
You have a benevolent heart.
You care about the world.

975
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:45,738
You sympathize with the people.

976
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:48,618
You've rendered countless military merit
and are good at leading an army.

977
00:48:48,697 --> 00:48:50,656
You reclaimed
both of the nation's capitals.

978
00:48:50,657 --> 00:48:52,977
You quelled the rebellion too.

979
00:48:52,978 --> 00:48:54,457
If you're appointed as the crown prince,

980
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:55,377
no one in the court

981
00:48:55,378 --> 00:48:56,817
will object to it.

982
00:48:56,818 --> 00:48:58,136
The people can lead good lives

983
00:48:58,137 --> 00:49:00,098
when there's no dispute in the court.

984
00:49:01,537 --> 00:49:02,857
Shiqi,

985
00:49:03,018 --> 00:49:05,738
you will be a great ruler.

986
00:49:05,898 --> 00:49:08,216
If you do succeed the throne in the future,

987
00:49:08,217 --> 00:49:10,096
the world will be at peace

988
00:49:10,097 --> 00:49:12,098
for at least several decades to come.

989
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,497
To each his own.

990
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:19,017
Some want to rule over the world.

991
00:49:21,617 --> 00:49:23,977
However, I just want to keep my promise.

992
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,057
I only want to return to Laolan Pass

993
00:49:27,338 --> 00:49:29,138
and defend the border with you

994
00:49:29,938 --> 00:49:32,136
once peace has been restored
to the world.

995
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:34,397
What if I'm not willing
to return to Laolan Pass with you?
