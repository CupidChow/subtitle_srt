Grand Governor
has the upper hand again.

(Grand Governor for Suppressing Rebels,
Sun Jing)

32
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:13,021
It seems like
you're going to lose today.

33
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:15,262
(Former Crown Princess, Xiao Clan)
Not necessarily.

34
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:29,382
Consort Xiao wins another round!

35
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:31,181
Not bad.

36
00:02:31,822 --> 00:02:33,141
Let's play another round.

37
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:33,461
Sure.

38
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,382
Grand Governor.

39
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:11,822
We lost the food supplies

40
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:13,542
and the city.

41
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:16,062
I didn't expect
Guo Zhi to be this useless.

42
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:20,301
Seventeenth Imperial Grandson,
Li Ni makes us see

43
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:21,942
the Li family's descendants

44
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:23,102
in a different light.

45
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:26,342
Forgive me

46
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:28,502
for soiling your ball, Grand Governor.

47
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:29,581
Get Lord Liang here!

48
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:31,141
Yes.

49
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:34,301
Summon Lord Liang!

50
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:46,421
Greetings, Grand Governor.

51
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:48,901
Help Lord Liang get up.

52
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:56,791
(Lord Liang)

53
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,141
You have a noble title.

54
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,542
And I'm just a governor.

55
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:01,382
Why do you always bow so deeply

56
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,262
when you see me?

57
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,701
Crown... Crown Princess?

58
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:13,822
Greetings, Crown Princess.

59
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,502
The late Crown Prince was incompetent

60
00:04:17,862 --> 00:04:19,822
and took his own life a long time ago.

61
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:22,461
I'm no longer Crown Princess.

62
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:25,461
So please don't address me
as such anymore, Lord Liang.

63
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:26,942
Of course,

64
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:28,581
Consort Xiao.

65
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,781
Now, tell us about your son.

66
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:33,341
At the request of Grand Governor,

67
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:35,822
I have three sons.

68
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:37,182
The eldest is Li...

69
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:39,541
Who wants to hear
all this trivial matter?

70
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,062
Tell me about Li Ni.

71
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:44,382
It's just that...

72
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:48,262
What... Li Ni...

73
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:50,302
What about him?

74
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,910
Lord Liang, are you aware of your crime?

75
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:54,581
Two months ago,

76
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,219
Pei Xian and others proclaimed Li Ni

77
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,160
as the so-called marshal

78
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:59,141
(Sun Jing's Strategist, Xin Fu)
to suppress the rebellion.

79
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,661
The young and inexperienced Li Ni

80
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:03,422
was declared the marshal
by Pei Xian, the rebellious general.

81
00:05:03,982 --> 00:05:04,742
Lord Liang,

82
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:06,382
are you secretly

83
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:07,661
coveting the throne?

84
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:08,302
What?

85
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:10,862
My son acted disrespectfully.

86
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:12,661
My son has acted disrespectfully.

87
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:13,461
I...

88
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,141
I truly didn't know

89
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:15,822
that Li Ni

90
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,021
could do something like this.

91
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:19,781
I had no idea at all.

92
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:21,622
Please understand, Grand Governor.

93
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:22,422
Enough.

94
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:26,262
It's just Pei Xian's deceitful trick
to manipulate people.

95
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:28,502
Just tell us honestly

96
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,062
what your son

97
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:31,382
likes and dislikes

98
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:32,461
since young.

99
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,461
What's his personality and temper?

100
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,742
My son

101
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:44,302
is truly an ill-fated child.

102
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,581
(He...)

103
00:05:47,822 --> 00:05:49,101
(When Li Ni was born,)

104
00:05:49,302 --> 00:05:51,622
(he already caused the death
of his birth mother.)

105
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:52,660
(Lord Liang's Residence)

106
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:54,661
(Lord Liang's Residence)
(Since young, he was unruly)

107
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:55,822
(and inept in skills.)

108
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,742
(As his father,)

109
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:00,182
(I was also negligent
in disciplining him.)

110
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,341
Give it back!

111
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,062
Servant's child!

112
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:04,742
Your mother is the most lowly servant!

113
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,240
Give it back!

114
00:06:05,302 --> 00:06:07,262
Someday, you'll bring harm to all of us!

115
00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:07,742
Give it back!

116
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,021
Give it back!

117
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:13,901
(As he grew older,)

118
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:15,581
(he became even more idle,)

119
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,320
(getting into fights
and causing trouble.)

120
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,502
Today,

121
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:19,870
you must give me an explanation!

122
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:20,410
Otherwise...

123
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:22,382
What are you all doing?

124
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:24,341
You brat!

125
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:25,062
Get up!

126
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:27,141
(My son)

127
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:28,341
(is truly unruly)

128
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:29,862
(and utterly ridiculous.)

129
00:06:29,862 --> 00:06:32,141
Absolutely ridiculous!

130
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:34,062
Because of his behavior,

131
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,341
Father...

132
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,101
I mean

133
00:06:36,502 --> 00:06:38,302
the late Emperor was furious

134
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,822
and banished him to the Zhenxi Army.

135
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:43,101
But I never expected him

136
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:45,581
to be so audacious

137
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:48,382
and even daring to call himself a marshal

138
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:51,062
and oppose you, Grand Governor.

139
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,701
He's truly a bad seed.

140
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:55,982
Li Ni is still very young.

141
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:58,221
Yet he managed to use this scheme
to seize Wangzhou.

142
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:59,502
He's truly unfilial.

143
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,862
Very unfilial.

144
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:03,382
How could someone like you

145
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:05,302
have such a talented son

146
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:07,182
like Li Ni?

147
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:20,862
Take him away.

148
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:21,622
Yes.

149
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:32,660
(Guo Residence)

150
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,021
This time we gained an advantage

151
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:35,221
by capturing Wangzhou.

152
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:37,862
But Guo Zhi's main army is still intact.

153
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:39,701
Moreover, Bingzhou and Jianzhou

154
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:41,461
are in the hands of Han Li.

155
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:43,742
I'm afraid Sun Jing will deploy Han Li

156
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,810
to attack us from both sides
together with Guo Zhi.

157
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:48,141
Then let's first take Wangzhou

158
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:49,700
and eye on Bingzhou after that.

159
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:50,862
Guess

160
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,182
what the Cui family is doing right now.

161
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:54,581
The Cui family?

162
00:07:57,581 --> 00:07:59,460
We managed to seize such a gain
like Wangzhou

163
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:00,901
right under their noses.

164
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:03,341
Cui Yi's only son led the troops.

165
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:06,021
But he returned empty-handed
after making a big move.

166
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:07,742
He must be furious.

167
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:09,742
Are you saying...

168
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:11,850
Guo Zhi's army
is stranded outside the city

169
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:14,221
with no provisions or fortifications.

170
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:16,141
If I were from the Cui family,

171
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:19,182
I would definitely send someone
to negotiate with Guo Zhi,

172
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:22,062
collaborate on a joint attack

173
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:24,062
to take Wangzhou,

174
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:25,781
and push me out of the game.

175
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:28,822
(Cui Family Army's Young Marshal, Cui Lin)
I won't allow you to go.

176
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:29,341
Young Master,

177
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:31,622
envoys are not to be killed
during battles.

178
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,970
As an envoy from the Cui Army,

179
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:34,262
Guo Zhi won't do anything to me

180
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:35,502
if I go.

181
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:39,541
Ying,

182
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,502
I don't want you to take risks.

183
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:43,061
Young Master,

184
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:44,342
guess

185
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,102
what the people in the Zhenxi Army

186
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:47,301
are doing at this moment?

187
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,021
If I were one of them,

188
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:52,342
knowing that the Cui Army
took the food supplies

189
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:54,661
and that Guo Zhi is stranded
outside the city

190
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,742
without provisions or fortifications,

191
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:59,262
I'd think about
going to Guo Zhi's camp for negotiations,

192
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:00,421
offering him incentives,

193
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:01,941
and discussing a joint attack

194
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:04,821
against us to regain the food supplies.

195
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:06,702
So we'll make the move first.

196
00:09:06,821 --> 00:09:07,862
Oh, no.

197
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,610
We'll negotiate with Guo Zhi openly
while having another plan in secret.

198
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:12,661
I'll leave the city
and negotiate with Guo Zhi.

199
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:14,702
When I reach Guo Zhi's camp,

200
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,141
the Cui family will surely consider

201
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,421
whether it's more advantageous
to be my enemy

202
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,421
or to ally with me

203
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:23,342
and deal with Guo Zhi.

204
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:24,941
How do you know

205
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:27,541
the Cui family will send someone
to negotiate with Guo Zhi?

206
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:29,301
Ever since the turmoil started,

207
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:30,702
Cui Yi has been ambitiously

208
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,061
sending his troops southward.

209
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:33,622
He's clearly a shrewd

210
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,781
and opportunistic person.

211
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:38,661
Do you think he'll let
this significant opportunity slip by?

212
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:42,380
My plan is to negotiate with Guo Zhi openly
while having another plan in secret.

213
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,262
When I arrive at Guo Zhi's camp,

214
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:45,702
I believe the Zhenxi Army

215
00:09:45,862 --> 00:09:47,462
will also send an important figure.

216
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:48,421
I assume

217
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:49,421
it'll be that Pei

218
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:50,502
who'll go in person.

219
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:52,141
Once I secure Guo Zhi's territory,

220
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,710
I can have a discussion
with the Zhenxi Army's representative.

221
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:55,970
But based on what you've said,

222
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:57,702
aren't they pretty troublesome?

223
00:09:58,102 --> 00:10:00,021
That's why I plan
to use Guo Zhi's territory.

224
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:01,622
To show sincerity,

225
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,570
they'll likely bring
few trusted soldiers.

226
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:04,742
At that time,

227
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,342
with Guo Zhi's large army
surrounding,

228
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:08,301
it would be hard for them

229
00:10:08,502 --> 00:10:09,821
to pull any tricks.

230
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:11,510
But I still think it's too dangerous.

231
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:12,941
You should stay in the city

232
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:14,941
while I go out to negotiate
with Guo Zhi.

233
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:17,941
Of course, you will go,
General Pei Yuan.

234
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:21,982
I will write a letter
and stamp it with a seal

235
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,210
belonging to the marshal
who's suppressing rebellions

236
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,141
as to show our sincerity.

237
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:28,582
Are you going to carve one out

238
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:29,982
using a radish again?

239
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:32,862
Well, Guo Zhi and the Cui family

240
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:34,582
have never seen

241
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:36,582
my official seal.

242
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:42,360
(Guo Zhi's Military Camp)

243
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:58,010
So you're Lieutenant He
from the Cui family's army.

244
00:10:58,102 --> 00:10:59,141
It's nice

245
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:00,821
to meet you.

246
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:04,582
So you're General Pei Yuan
of the Zhenxi Army.

247
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:06,262
Your father, General Pei

248
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,770
has guarded the border
for many years.

249
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:09,061
His achievements are well-known.

250
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:11,661
I've long heard about you.

251
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:14,901
You're both outstanding young talents.

252
00:11:15,222 --> 00:11:17,661
Today, I truly have my eyes opened wide.

253
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:20,661
General Pei Yuan is here
to negotiate in person

254
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,941
and Young Master Cui
sent Lieutenant He here

255
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:24,181
to negotiate.

256
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:26,781
I'm truly honored, both humbled

257
00:11:26,982 --> 00:11:28,262
and anxious.

258
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:31,502
I fear not living up
to General Pei Yuan's kind intentions

259
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,821
while also dreading
displeasing Young Master Cui.

260
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:38,781
It's quite a dilemma for me.

261
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:42,622
General Guo, you're too kind.

262
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:45,350
You're being too polite, General Guo.

263
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:48,102
How about this?

264
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:50,102
We'll each send one representative

265
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:51,301
for a horse race.

266
00:11:51,982 --> 00:11:53,582
If my guy wins,

267
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:54,870
each of you must agree

268
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:56,622
to one condition from me.

269
00:11:57,061 --> 00:11:58,901
If either of your men wins,

270
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:01,421
I'll negotiate with them first.

271
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:05,222
What do you think?

272
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:11,382
That sounds fair enough.

273
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:13,622
Since General Pei Yuan
is generous about it,

274
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:16,021
I have no objections.

275
00:12:16,622 --> 00:12:17,102
Great!

276
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,021
You're both straightforward people.

277
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:20,070
This way, please.

278
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:26,582
General Guo.

279
00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:28,061
Give it your all.

280
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:28,661
Yes.

281
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:29,742
Chang'er,

282
00:12:30,742 --> 00:12:31,622
be careful.

283
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:32,742
Yes.

284
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,941
Your horse is quite remarkable.

285
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:37,661
So is your horse.

286
00:12:38,262 --> 00:12:39,622
You're too kind, General Pei Yuan.

287
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:41,661
General Pei Yuan,

288
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,502
who do you think
will be the winner?

289
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:44,862
We haven't competed yet.

290
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:46,462
So who can predict the outcome?

291
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,222
General Pei Yuan,

292
00:13:27,342 --> 00:13:29,421
were you acquainted
with Lieutenant He before this?

293
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:30,781
No.

294
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,742
Your father suffered severe injuries
at Huya Pass years ago.

295
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,110
His old wounds would act up

296
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:36,421
during rainy weather,

297
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:37,862
causing great pain.

298
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:40,582
I wonder if he's been better
in recent years.

299
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,941
Thanks for your concern.

300
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,340
My father sustained multiple injuries.

301
00:13:45,502 --> 00:13:47,622
The arrow wound under the ribs
was life-threatening.

302
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,110
Although he's been in the army
for many years,

303
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,770
he has taken good care of himself.

304
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:52,810
So he has improved a lot.

305
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,821
I'm glad to hear that.

306
00:13:58,102 --> 00:13:59,222
Any weapons!

307
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:00,821
Stop at the finishing line!

308
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:02,541
No life-threatening attack!

309
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,110
After capturing the flag,

310
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,021
the first to return here

311
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:07,941
and place the small flag in this hole

312
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,102
is the winner!

313
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:12,862
Move out!

314
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,941
Lieutenant He's bodyguards
are indeed skilled.

315
00:14:57,102 --> 00:14:58,141
It seems

316
00:14:58,301 --> 00:14:59,982
Lieutenant He will win this round.

317
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,982
Not necessarily.

318
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:03,061
He is Young Master Cui's
personal guard.

319
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,342
Young Master sent me here

320
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:06,421
and specially sent him
to help me.

321
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:07,342
Besides,

322
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:08,702
the game isn't over yet.

323
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:10,582
How can we decide
who is the winner?

324
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,141
Buddy!

325
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:21,862
Get up!

326
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:22,622
Buddy!

327
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:24,661
Get up!

328
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:25,502
Open your eyes!

329
00:16:26,462 --> 00:16:27,862
Buddy!

330
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:30,982
Buddy.

331
00:16:31,102 --> 00:16:31,462
Comrade.

332
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:32,661
Buddy!

333
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:36,102
Buddy.

334
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:36,781
Comrade!

335
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:37,462
Buddy!

336
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:40,342
I slipped.

337
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:44,702
With the skills of that man,

338
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,462
he could have easily avoided the arrow.

339
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:48,622
He was too eager to win.

340
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:50,622
That's why he didn't dodge.

341
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,181
He is loyal and brave.

342
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,462
He has my admiration.

343
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,102
General, you've won this race.

344
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,600
According to our agreement,

345
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:57,661
the Cui Army and I

346
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,742
will fulfill one condition for you.

347
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:01,821
Please speak your mind, General Guo.

348
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:07,462
It's already late now.

349
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,821
We have to give our comrade a burial.

350
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:12,781
I'm overwhelmed by grief right now.

351
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:14,310
So please both of you

352
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,982
to stay in the camp tonight

353
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:17,621
and discuss things tomorrow.

354
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,861
As you command, General Guo.

355
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,381
Please accept our condolences.

356
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:25,462
General Guo,

357
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:26,861
today,

358
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:28,422
we may have lost a comrade

359
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:29,422
in the army.

360
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:30,942
But we still won.

361
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:32,742
What do you think

362
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,422
would be good conditions

363
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,341
to ask from both of them tomorrow?

364
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:39,301
Pei Yuan actually saved Lieutenant He

365
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:40,821
in a critical moment.

366
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:41,781
Clearly,

367
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:44,101
both sides prioritize friendship
over enmity.

368
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:46,341
If they have other plans,

369
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:47,422
I'm afraid

370
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:49,262
the conditions they will agree on

371
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:51,021
might be traps.

372
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:54,982
Today,

373
00:17:55,061 --> 00:17:56,742
I must get rid of these two.

374
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:58,341
Presenting their heads

375
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:00,142
in front of the Grand Governor

376
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:02,502
will make up for the loss

377
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:04,821
of the city and food supplies.

378
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:06,541
General, are you saying...

379
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,781
Didn't Physician Fan

380
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:13,662
make a lot of special pastries?

381
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:15,541
Go and get two portions.

382
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,621
Find two clever people

383
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:19,861
and deliver one portion to each.

384
00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:23,861
This brave soldier was truly

385
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:25,301
a rare and loyal man.

386
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,142
No wonder General Guo thought highly of him

387
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:28,541
and personally held a funeral.

388
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:29,982
The members of the Cui Army

389
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,350
must be regretting their mistake.

390
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,870
Because of their slip-up,
General Guo lost one of his men.

391
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:36,742
Tomorrow's negotiation
will put them at a disadvantage.

392
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:38,422
Of course not.

393
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,581
They never planned to negotiate
with Guo Zhi at first.

394
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:43,581
Lieutenant He is cunning.

395
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:44,982
She won't suffer losses.

396
00:18:45,662 --> 00:18:47,061
So what should we do now?

397
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,422
Of course,

398
00:18:50,621 --> 00:18:52,621
we should go and meet Lieutenant He.

399
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:12,262
Oh, no.

400
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:21,381
In the middle of the night,

401
00:19:21,502 --> 00:19:22,262
are you here

402
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:23,341
especially to see me

403
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:24,942
because you had a nice bath

404
00:19:25,502 --> 00:19:26,861
in the well that day?

405
00:19:27,662 --> 00:19:28,781
I'll never forget

406
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:30,222
your "well" intention.

407
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:32,142
I always remember

408
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:33,502
your kindness.

409
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:36,142
Do you think I don't know

410
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:37,821
that you're always thinking

411
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:39,462
of throwing me back into that well

412
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:40,581
to take revenge?

413
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:41,262
Am I right?

414
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:42,381
No problem.

415
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,370
I'll wait for that.

416
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:50,821
I'm getting this back.

417
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:51,581
Thank you.

418
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,301
You're such

419
00:19:54,982 --> 00:19:56,182
an impolite woman.

420
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,010
What about my pearl
you took away?

421
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,341
Why didn't you return it as well?

422
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:01,061
When you took my thing,

423
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:02,581
I used my skills to take it back.

424
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:04,061
So when I take your thing,

425
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:05,262
you can also use

426
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,381
your skills to retrieve it.

427
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:09,142
Lieutenant He.

428
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:25,581
What can I do for you at this hour?

429
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:26,942
Lieutenant He,

430
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,301
General Guo said

431
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,182
he intended to host a banquet
for you tonight.

432
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,410
But it was delayed by the accident.

433
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,890
The conditions in the camp are simple.

434
00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:33,861
Sorry for the bad treat.

435
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:36,502
So General asked me
to bring this pastry to ease your hunger.

436
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:38,021
General Guo is thoughtful.

437
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:38,621
Thank you.

438
00:20:59,821 --> 00:21:00,262
Oh, no.

439
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:09,502
Why is a young lady like you

440
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,502
meddling in military affairs

441
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,262
instead of doing embroideries at home?

442
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:14,902
You could have just come.

443
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:16,702
But you keep plotting against me.

444
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:18,821
Tell me.

445
00:21:19,142 --> 00:21:21,502
Should I carry you
and throw you into the well

446
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,490
or let you have a taste
of this crossbow's power?

447
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:27,742
Want to say something?

448
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:29,381
Then speak.

449
00:21:32,581 --> 00:21:33,101
You can't?

450
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,820
Because of the walnuts
in your mouth?

451
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:38,662
I can let you speak.

452
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:39,861
But let's make a deal.

453
00:21:40,422 --> 00:21:41,462
If you scream

454
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,210
after I remove the walnuts
from your mouth,

455
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,541
I'll let you experience
the power of your crossbow.

456
00:22:10,702 --> 00:22:12,381
You even have a booby trap
in your mouth.

457
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:27,222
Is the needle poisonous?

458
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:28,710
If you don't behave,

459
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,061
I'll prick you with this needle.

460
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:37,502
There are a lot of needles.

461
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:41,381
Such a delicate item.

462
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:42,502
Mine now.

463
00:22:43,182 --> 00:22:44,702
Why are you glaring at me?
Not happy?

464
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:45,621
I'll prick you, then.

465
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:48,902
Just you wait.

466
00:22:54,702 --> 00:22:55,581
I want both of you

467
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:57,182
to lead a small team of soldiers

468
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:58,341
and go scout out

469
00:22:58,462 --> 00:22:59,781
their situation.

470
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,930
If they've eaten the pastries
and fallen unconscious,

471
00:23:01,942 --> 00:23:03,341
that would be perfect.

472
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:04,810
If they haven't been poisoned yet,

473
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:05,982
act immediately.

474
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:07,082
- Yes, General.
- Yes, General.

You must have ulterior motives.

Since that's the case,

481
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:27,742

Any decision you can make,

488
00:23:39,142 --> 00:23:40,422
I can make them too.

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,710
and lead the army to attack Wangzhou.

563
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,142
Deliver my orders.

564
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:04,182
Relocate the camp

565
00:30:04,462 --> 00:30:06,381
and search for Lieutenant He!

566
00:30:06,702 --> 00:30:07,301
Young Master,

567
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:08,381
Lieutenant He said

568
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:10,070
Wangzhou is vulnerable at the moment

569
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:10,861
without a leader

570
00:30:10,982 --> 00:30:12,142
and this is our chance.

571
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,040
Shall we lead the army
to attack Wangzhou

572
00:30:14,061 --> 00:30:15,301
as originally planned?

573
00:30:15,462 --> 00:30:17,982
If something bad happens
to Lieutenant He

574
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:19,662
because of attacking Wangzhou,

575
00:30:19,742 --> 00:30:21,422
I'll forever regret it!

576
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:23,621
Young Master,

577
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,621
since Lieutenant He made such a plan,

578
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,061
there must be some chance.

579
00:30:27,462 --> 00:30:28,702
I suppose she'll be all right.

580
00:30:29,341 --> 00:30:29,821
Shu,

581
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:31,502
stop trying to dissuade me.

582
00:30:31,942 --> 00:30:32,662
Deliver my order

583
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,061
and relocate the camp now!

584
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:37,061
Yes.

585
00:30:41,821 --> 00:30:43,262
Don't rush. Take your time eating.

586
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:49,702
It's all right, General Pei Yuan.

587
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,142
I'm already full.

588
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:52,541
Mister Shiqi repeatedly said

589
00:30:52,702 --> 00:30:54,662
to stop the Cui Army and Guo Zhi

590
00:30:54,781 --> 00:30:56,110
from attacking Wangzhou in chaos.

591
00:30:56,702 --> 00:30:58,341
I'll leave to reinforce Mister Shiqi.

592
00:30:58,422 --> 00:30:58,821
All right.

593
00:30:59,222 --> 00:31:00,142
When you see him,

594
00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:00,982
tell him

595
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:01,781
not to worry.

596
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:03,301
I'll find a way

597
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:04,381
to protect Wangzhou.

598
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:04,861
All right.

599
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:37,942
Weren't you chasing in that direction?

600
00:31:38,422 --> 00:31:39,920
I don't forget my grudges that easily.

601
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,870
I always settle scores.

602
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:41,942
Jerk!

603
00:31:42,061 --> 00:31:43,462
When you pushed me into the well,

604
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:44,942
I didn't even insult you.

605
00:31:46,902 --> 00:31:47,621
Help!

606
00:31:49,462 --> 00:31:51,061
Enough, you little trickster.

607
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,781
Have you forgotten
we first met underwater?

608
00:31:53,982 --> 00:31:55,621
I remember you're good at swimming.

609
00:31:56,021 --> 00:31:57,502
My leg is cramped.

610
00:31:58,341 --> 00:31:58,781
Help!

611
00:31:58,902 --> 00:31:59,781
Someone like you

612
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:01,222
should learn some lessons.

613
00:32:01,341 --> 00:32:02,142
Help!

614
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:10,621
Little trickster.

615
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:18,101
If you don't come out,

616
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:20,341
I'm going to leave
with your horse for real.

617
00:32:22,702 --> 00:32:23,621
I'm leaving for real!

618
00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:51,142
Wake up.

619
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,301
Called me a little trickster, huh?

620
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:09,781
You even kicked me into the river.

621
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:12,262
If I don't make you jump
into the cold river water,

622
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,260
it would be in vain
to call me a little trickster.

623
00:33:20,502 --> 00:33:20,982
Oh, well.

624
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:23,222
Since you jumped into the river
to save me,

625
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:24,742
I'll help you once more

626
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:27,821
to prevent those pursuers
from hacking you .

627
00:35:01,062 --> 00:35:02,301
Snowy, run!

628
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:26,262
Snowy, leave now.

629
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:28,941
Go back and get someone here.

630
00:36:20,582 --> 00:36:21,901
I'm starving.

631
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:23,341
Without any food with me.

632
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:24,381
What a mistake.

633
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:30,742
Do you eat rabbit meat?

634
00:36:32,421 --> 00:36:33,702
It's you?

635
00:36:33,821 --> 00:36:35,421
Yes, it is me.

636
00:36:37,702 --> 00:36:38,981
Your tranquilizer on that needle

637
00:36:39,102 --> 00:36:40,022
was quite potent.

638
00:36:40,182 --> 00:36:41,821
I slept until evening.

639
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:43,301
When I woke up,

640
00:36:43,421 --> 00:36:44,421
the horse was gone

641
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,821
and you also ran off.

642
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:50,582
I walked over four hours until there.

643
00:36:51,341 --> 00:36:52,182
Heaven sure is fair

644
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:53,662
to let me run into you here.

645
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:54,941
I knew

646
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,262
it was a cunning person like you

647
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,901
who could come up with such a trap.

648
00:36:58,022 --> 00:36:59,501
You're very good at framing me.

649
00:36:59,702 --> 00:37:01,981
It's clearly a trap the hunter
uses to trap bears.

650
00:37:02,142 --> 00:37:03,582
See how deep the pit hole is?

651
00:37:03,702 --> 00:37:05,290
Anyone would know it's not a day's work.

652
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:07,341
I'm sure you saw a beehive earlier.

653
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:08,662
So what if I did?

654
00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:09,781
That's it, then.

655
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,301
There are many bears in the mountains.

656
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:13,222
Bear pelts, gallbladders, and paws

657
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:14,461
are valuable

658
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:15,821
and can be sold at a high price.

659
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:17,222
But hunting bears is hard work.

660
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:17,861
But bears

661
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:19,182
love honey.

662
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:20,341
So hunters usually

663
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:21,702
set such traps

664
00:37:21,821 --> 00:37:23,022
near beehives.

665
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:24,901
But this hunter would never expect

666
00:37:25,022 --> 00:37:26,520
that he would catch a little trickster

667
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:28,142
instead of a bear.

668
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:35,022
This is delicious.

669
00:37:36,742 --> 00:37:38,142
What if we make a deal?

670
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:39,262
I'll let you

671
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:40,662
have this rabbit leg.

672
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:42,421
And you will return the food supplies.

673
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:44,501
What do you mean by returning it to you?

674
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:46,981
I earned those supplies
from my careful planning.

675
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:48,542
It's so delicious.

676
00:37:54,461 --> 00:37:55,262
Very tasty.

677
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:57,142
What if I make a deal with you?

678
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,182
A rabbit

679
00:37:58,301 --> 00:37:59,582
has four legs.

680
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:00,981
You're not letting me

681
00:38:01,102 --> 00:38:02,341
have all four, are you?

682
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:08,702
Lieutenant He,

683
00:38:09,102 --> 00:38:11,381
you've gone a whole day and night
without food.

684
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:13,662
When I was roasting this rabbit earlier,

685
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:16,901
the sizzling meat was dripping with oil.

686
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:18,781
Do you know how fragrant it was?

687
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:21,341
Listen.

688
00:38:21,662 --> 00:38:23,222
If you hand over
the supplies to me,

689
00:38:23,341 --> 00:38:23,920
I'll treat you

690
00:38:24,381 --> 00:38:26,062
to some rabbit meat.

691
00:38:33,821 --> 00:38:34,461
Fine.

692
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:36,142
Since you want to make a deal,

693
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:37,781
you need to show some sincerity.

694
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,142
Help me get out of this hole.

695
00:38:39,301 --> 00:38:40,981
Then I'll share half of the food supplies.

696
00:38:41,102 --> 00:38:43,702
But I'll give you
that half of the food supplies

697
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,182
only after you've safely escorted me

698
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,360
to the camp of the Cui Army.

699
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:48,941
You little trickster.

700
00:38:49,222 --> 00:38:50,781
Do you really take me for a fool, huh?

701
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,222
Tell me how many
of those little bamboo tubes

702
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:54,582
and poisonous needles.

703
00:38:54,742 --> 00:38:56,182
Why? Are you scared?

704
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,062
In that case, don't bother rescuing me.

705
00:38:58,182 --> 00:38:58,821
Just leave.

706
00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:00,981
Let me die here alone.

707
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:02,421
You have no food supplies.

708
00:39:02,702 --> 00:39:04,182
When our Young Master

709
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:05,461
hears of my death,

710
00:39:05,582 --> 00:39:06,622
he'll be furious

711
00:39:07,381 --> 00:39:08,981
and avenge my death.

712
00:39:09,262 --> 00:39:09,702
Fine.

713
00:39:10,702 --> 00:39:11,702
In that case,

714
00:39:12,022 --> 00:39:13,301
I'll come down and accompany you.

715
00:39:15,662 --> 00:39:16,381
Are you mad?

716
00:39:16,662 --> 00:39:17,702
If I'm the only one here,

717
00:39:17,821 --> 00:39:18,781
you could get me out.

718
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:19,901
Now, you're in here.

719
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:21,240
How are we going to get back up?

720
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:22,341
Thanks to you,

721
00:39:22,781 --> 00:39:23,821
I've been in a well,

722
00:39:23,941 --> 00:39:24,910
and I've been in a river.

723
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:26,301
We're so fated.

724
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,240
You were in the trap,

725
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:29,102
how can I not go through thick and thin?

726
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:30,981
Frivolous and dissolute man.

727
00:39:36,062 --> 00:39:37,901
You've insulted me twice today.

728
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,501
I'm a vengeful person.

729
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:40,381
I was going

730
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:41,582
to give you two rabbit legs,

731
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:43,510
but for each insult,
you get one leg less.

732
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:44,542
You've insulted me twice.

733
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:45,861
So you won't have any.

734
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:47,102
You can only watch me eat.

735
00:39:56,222 --> 00:39:56,821
How delicious.

736
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:08,421
I'm the kind of person

737
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,182
who remembers gratitude and grudges.

738
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,182
You may have drugged me with a needle.

739
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:14,222
But before you left,

740
00:40:14,341 --> 00:40:15,901
you kindly covered me with grass.

741
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:17,461
Tit for tat.

742
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:22,461
Come on.

743
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:31,381
How about my cooking skills?

744
00:40:33,062 --> 00:40:34,182
Not bad.

745
00:40:35,062 --> 00:40:36,781
Can you be honest with me

746
00:40:36,941 --> 00:40:38,702
and tell me
how we're getting out of here?

747
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:41,582
How did you know

748
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:43,062
I know how to get out of here?

749
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:46,310
Although we haven't known
for long,

750
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:48,742
you're crafty and sly.

751
00:40:48,901 --> 00:40:50,901
You wouldn't put yourself
in a hopeless situation.

752
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:52,501
Since you can come down here,

753
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:53,981
you must have a way to get out.

754
00:40:55,222 --> 00:40:56,901
You think pretty highly of me.

755
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:58,182
Since you've said that.

756
00:40:58,301 --> 00:40:59,262
To be honest with you.

757
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:00,461
Tonight,

758
00:41:00,702 --> 00:41:01,981
I don't plan to get out of here.

759
00:41:03,102 --> 00:41:03,662
What?

760
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:06,781
It's already late and dark out.

761
00:41:07,142 --> 00:41:08,461
In this dense forest,

762
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,102
we don't know what fierce beasts
are out there besides bears.

763
00:41:11,222 --> 00:41:12,901
If a tiger or panther shows up suddenly,

764
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:14,461
it would be a disaster, wouldn't it?

765
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,920
I know you're carrying
some medicated powder

766
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,970
chasing away snakes and insects.

767
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:20,582
But those fierce creatures aren't afraid.

768
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:22,222
So

769
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:23,102
just listen to me

770
00:41:23,222 --> 00:41:24,662
and spend the night here tonight.

771
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:25,542
Tomorrow morning,

772
00:41:25,622 --> 00:41:27,501
I will take Lieutenant He with me

773
00:41:27,622 --> 00:41:29,702
to the Cui Army to exchange
for food supplies.

774
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:33,062
Using such shameless tricks

775
00:41:33,222 --> 00:41:34,702
and acting so self-righteous.

776
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:36,142
I thought we were the same.

777
00:41:45,662 --> 00:41:46,410
Someone is coming.

778
00:41:46,702 --> 00:41:47,781
You said

779
00:41:48,102 --> 00:41:50,262
wild beasts are running rampant
in this deep forest.

780
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:51,301
There won't be people.

781
00:41:55,022 --> 00:41:56,262
- Quickly.
- Hurry.

782
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:56,810
We caught!

783
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:57,501
Come on!

784
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,110
Must be valuable.

785
00:41:58,262 --> 00:41:58,702
Exactly.

786
00:41:58,821 --> 00:41:59,182
Come on!

787
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:01,861
I'm sure it's a good one.

788
00:42:01,981 --> 00:42:02,781
Listen to me.

789
00:42:03,102 --> 00:42:03,702
Look. Let me see.

790
00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:04,821
What's this? Let me see.

791
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:06,981
I can't see it clearly.

792
00:42:07,222 --> 00:42:07,622
Why?

793
00:42:07,622 --> 00:42:08,341
There are people down.

794
00:42:08,461 --> 00:42:09,341
There are two of them.

795
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:10,142
