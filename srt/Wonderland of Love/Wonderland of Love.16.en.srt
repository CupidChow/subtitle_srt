=Episode 16=

29
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:45,847
Li Ni didn't enter Luoyang City
with his troops.

30
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,870
Instead, they set up camp.

31
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:48,168
Why do you think they did so?

32
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:49,889
According to the fold

33
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,169
that Li Ni had sent to Father,

34
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,010
it was inconvenient
for the army to enter the city.

35
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:53,820
He set up camp outside

36
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,520
so that it's easier to conduct
military operations.

37
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:58,860
It's obvious that he suffered defeat
and wasn't willing to enter the city.

38
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:01,169
He still dared to submit a fold
to Father

39
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:03,449
saying that he wanted
to reclaim Xichang.

40
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:04,929
Jun,

41
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:06,968
Young Master Cui is dead.

42
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,128
Cui Yi must be enraged by now.

43
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,620
It's good that he's outside the city.

44
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:11,249
If not,

45
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:12,809
Luoyang City will be implicated

46
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:14,288
when the Cui Army arrives.

47
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,378
(To Uncle)

48
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:36,209
Father, since His Highness
had sent you a letter,

49
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:37,489
I assume he found a way

50
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:39,128
to conquer Xichang.

51
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:41,809
In the letter, Li Ni hoped

52
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:43,128
that I could

53
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,249
contact the old subjects
of the previous rule

54
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:47,888
and spread the news of
Sun Jing's failed conquest

55
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:49,049
in Baiyue.

56
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,489
He wanted the people to think

57
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,008
that Sun Jing suffered a major defeat.

58
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:53,929
It's best if it causes
a hike in food prices.

59
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:56,649
This way, people's hearts
will be shaken.

60
00:02:57,529 --> 00:02:58,209
Father,

61
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:00,929
what do you think His Highness is up to?

62
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:03,888
He's crafty and adaptable to change.

63
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:05,769
I can't tell either.

64
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:07,249
However,

65
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:09,769
it seems that he intends to
cause chaos in the city.

66
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:11,609
He'll get his opportunity

67
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,209

81
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:42,929

You want to play chess?

96
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:31,809
I can get you a new set.

97
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,208
Why are you going through
all this effort just to make them yourself?

98
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:41,688
Young Master loved playing chess.

99
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:46,088
I once promised him

100
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:48,568
that I would make him

101
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:51,809
a set of chess pieces.

102
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:53,489
Ying,

103
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:55,039
Father finally promised us

104
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,720
that we could lead an army
and leave Yingzhou.

105
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:58,768
Opportunities slip away quickly.

106
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:00,809
We mustn't miss out on this opportunity.

107
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:01,768
Really?

108
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:03,328
Ying,

109
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:04,489
I know.

110
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:06,448
This is what you always desired.

111
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:08,249
Ever since Sun Jing started a revolt,

112
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:10,208
you wanted to

113
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:11,249
vie for the world

114
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:12,369
and dominate the realm.

115
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:13,609
Young Master,

116
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:15,088
you do know me well.

117
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:16,809
Ying, your goal

118
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,768
is my goal.

119
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:21,448
As long as there's something
you wish to achieve,

120
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:23,809
I'll definitely do my best

121
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,729
to help you achieve it.

122
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,369
(Thank you, Young Master.)

123
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:29,888
(Since I've fulfilled
my end of the bargain,)

124
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,809
(you should remember)

125
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,208
your end of the bargain too.

126
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:34,448
Of course I do.

127
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:35,609
Young Master,

128
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,980
you wanted
a set of chess pieces.

129
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,010
Young Master, don't worry.

130
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,680
I'll definitely make you an entire set

131
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:41,128
when I have free time

132
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:41,929
out there.

133
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,768
That's unnecessary.

134
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:45,568
I just need you
to select the jade pieces personally.

135
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,609
It's the same when I tell
the jade craftsman

136
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,609
to make it for me.

137
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:49,609
That won't do.

138
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,088
I must make them myself.

139
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:52,448
They represent my sincerity.

140
00:07:58,448 --> 00:07:59,729
But now,

141
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:04,128
I'm afraid I have no chance

142
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:05,888
to give it to him myself.

143
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,289
For my sake,

144
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,110
Young Master took the shot
and fell into the river.

145
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:24,929
I can't even recover his body.

146
00:08:25,568 --> 00:08:26,648
Now,

147
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:28,208
I can only erect a tomb for him

148
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,088
and make him a set of chess pieces

149
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:31,409
as a burial gift.

150
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:33,408
What?

151
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,928
Can't I even do that now?

152
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:45,048
Must you say such hurtful words?

153
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:47,648
Hurtful?

154
00:08:48,609 --> 00:08:50,128
Young Master died for my sake.

155
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:54,849
Shouldn't I grieve his loss?

156
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:58,969
Shouldn't I be upset that he's gone?

157
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:05,489
So, you're still blaming me
for not saving your young master, right?

158
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:06,209
That's right!

159
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:09,048
So, you're heartbroken,

160
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,800
and you wish that you could
die with him, right?

161
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:12,408
That's right!

162
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:15,408
Li Ni,

163
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:17,008
listen up.

164
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:19,089
I was lying to you all along.

165
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,329
I fell for

166
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:24,648
Young Master long ago.

167
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:30,408
I was lying to you from the start.

168
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:34,249
I was the one who duped you

169
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:36,689
into heading to Xichang.

170
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:39,128
As for the incident in Tong Pass,

171
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:40,369
I plotted that

172
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:41,969
with Young Master long ago.

173
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:44,288
I did so to trick you.

174
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:47,969
I wanted to trick you
so that you would suffer a major defeat.

175
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:55,768
But now, Young Master is dead.

176
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:57,569
I've lost all hope.

177
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:59,168
I don't want to deceive you anymore!

178
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:00,768
Come on.

179
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:02,888
Just kill me!

180
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:16,768
You truly know

181
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:18,569
how to break my heart.

182
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:21,249
That's why you said that to me.

183
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:25,449
I know I maligned you

184
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,209
and broke your heart.

185
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,369
That's why you're saying that
to break my heart.

186
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:31,808
Am I right?

187
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:38,048
I'm heartbroken?

188
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:41,609
Why should I be heartbroken?

189
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:43,729
I was lying to you all along.

190
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:45,449
Why should I be heartbroken?

191
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:52,768
I was lying to you.

192
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:00,808
I never fancied you.

193
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,648
Everything was fake.

194
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:05,489
But my feelings for you are true.

195
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:11,808
I don't care if you fancy
your young master or not.

196
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:14,648
I have genuine feelings for you.

197
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:18,449
When I first met you,

198
00:11:18,648 --> 00:11:19,928
you kicked me into the well.

199
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:21,969
Back then, I thought

200
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,369
that I must get back

201
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:26,648
at the person

202
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:28,209
who kicked me into the well.

203
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,128
But after that, we met again.

204
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,900
Initially, I could seek revenge against you.

205
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:37,928
But I didn't do so.

206
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:40,288
I hesitated.

207
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:43,408
I didn't know why either.

208
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:50,569
When we were in Taiqing Palace,

209
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,528
I made a bet with you.

210
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:57,329
In the end, I lost to you.

211
00:11:58,609 --> 00:11:59,489
But in my heart...

212
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:03,048
In my heart,

213
00:12:05,128 --> 00:12:06,570
there was an indescribable happiness.

214
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:09,569
It's because I finally know

215
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:12,329
that you fancy me too.

216
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:15,528
You had feelings for me too.

217
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,449
So, when you said
that you were lying to me,

218
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,180
that you didn't fancy me,

219
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,689
that everything in the past was fake,

220
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,969
I would never believe in them.

221
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:30,689
It's because

222
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,410
your feelings for me are true.

223
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:49,928
No matter how angry you are at me,

224
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:52,609
don't take it out on your body.

225
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:55,648
You're injured.

226
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,320
Remember to take your medicine.

227
00:12:58,408 --> 00:12:59,689
Don't skip your meals.

228
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:49,648
Why isn't it sprouting yet?

229
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,770
Could it be that
the weather is too cold?

230
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:53,648
Taozi!

231
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:55,008
Long time no see.

232
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:56,168
We've finally met again.

233
00:13:59,168 --> 00:13:59,648
Taozi.

234
00:14:02,849 --> 00:14:04,369
Taozi, why are you ignoring me again?

235
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:07,569
Let me help you out.

236
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:15,408
Taozi?

237
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:16,449
Taozi?

238
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:33,840
(Milk Candy)
Seems like that mouse was here again.

239
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:39,249
You throw a tantrum

240
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:40,928
whenever he's here.

241
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,500
One's liver suffers whenever
one throws a tantrum.

242
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:45,048
I'm worried that your injury

243
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:46,569
might never heal, you know?

244
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:50,528
Since you feel terrible,

245
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:53,209
why don't you have some milk candy?

246
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:00,928
That mouse is something else.

247
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,609
He knew that you would be furious

248
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:03,689
when you see him.

249
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,609
How dare he deliver the candy here?

250
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:12,849
Why don't you take your medicine?

251
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,569
What's wrong with your hands?

252
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,008
It's nothing. It's just some scratches.

253
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,729
Why did you do that?

254
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,999
Even if Young Master
is no longer with us now,

255
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,810
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken
when he sees you

256
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,689
in this state from above.

257
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:43,928
Here.

258
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:50,489
Did you

259
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:53,249
argue with Li Ni just now?

260
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:57,128
That's right.

261
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:00,209
I told him off.

262
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:03,329
I said something mean to him.

263
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:07,048
But I didn't expect him

264
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:10,249
to...

265
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:14,209
What is it?

266
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:19,089
It's nothing.

267
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:21,489
Lieutenant He,

268
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:23,609
I know you're still angry

269
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:24,689
that Li Ni didn't trust you.

270
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:27,400
You're angry that he did nothing
when we were in danger.

271
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:30,390
You feel heartbroken and guilty

272
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:33,449
about Young Master's death.

273
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:35,089
But you can't just

274
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:36,249
keep this up.

275
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,489
You have to take care of your health too,

276
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:39,648
am I right?

277
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:47,729
I got it. Don't worry about me.

278
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:50,408
We're stuck here.

279
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,408
I'm sure Great General Cui Yi

280
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:53,928
is worried about us.

281
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:02,048
We have to think of a way

282
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:04,089
to escape to Yingzhou.

283
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:07,969
Lieutenant He,

284
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:09,449
why don't we

285
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:11,568
start with Li Ni?

286
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,520
Take advantage of him
to escape to Yingzhou.

287
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:12,929
The little mouse wants
to steal some lamp oil.

288
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,729
He failed. Thus, he tried
to steal some honey.

289
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:25,848
You only took your medicine

290
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,008
without taking dinner.

291
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:29,370
If you keep this up,
your health will be affected.

292
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:31,568
I brought you a bottle of honey.

293
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,768
I made you a flatbread too.

294
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:34,449
Why don't you have some?

295
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,848
Your Highness, thanks for your concern.

296
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:41,528
But I'm not hungry.

297
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:46,129
Even if you're mad at me,

298
00:18:46,368 --> 00:18:47,649
you can't just starve yourself.

299
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,608
Your Highness, why are you so concerned
about a prisoner like me?

300
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:54,568
It's late now.

301
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,110
I'm a woman while you're a man.

302
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,249
It's inappropriate for you to be here.

303
00:18:58,528 --> 00:18:59,689
You should leave.

304
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:02,489
I just want you

305
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,008
to stay here for a few more days.

306
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:05,608
You're not a prisoner.

307
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:12,409
Your Highness, you don't need
to make up such a grand excuse.

308
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:15,008
Young Master is dead.

309
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:16,808
I'm just a woman.

310
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:18,288
You can't use me

311
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:19,368
to coerce the Cui Army

312
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,969
to do your bidding.

313
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:23,288
Since you said I wasn't a prisoner,

314
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:25,048
why aren't you willing to release me?

315
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:26,729
It's because you're injured.

316
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:28,729
I would've died anyway

317
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:31,008
had you arrived one second later.

318
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:34,008
There's no need for you
to be concerned about my injury.

319
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,368
Even if you're not doing it for me,

320
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,048
you should do it for Taozi's sake.

321
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:46,249
She's anxious about

322
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:48,088
your condition every day.

323
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:50,929
You're not taking your medicine nor meals.

324
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:53,400
If this continues,
your health will be affected.

325
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:54,409
Don't try to blackmail me

326
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:56,088
with the people beside me.

327
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,008
Taozi and I are like sisters.

328
00:19:58,568 --> 00:20:00,088
We know each other's conditions

329
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:01,889
the best.

330
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,608
It has nothing to do with you.

331
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:12,409
Since you're still mad at me,

332
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:14,008
I'll leave first.

333
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:16,449
Don't sleep with anger, okay?

334
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,420
It's bad for your health.

335
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:05,889
Taozi!

336
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:07,729
Taozi.

337
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:09,929
Let me carry it for you.

338
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:12,649
Taozi,

339
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:14,969
are you still angry at me?

340
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:17,209
Can you please talk to me?

341
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,100
Taozi, are you going to gather herbs?

342
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,169
Let me tag along.

343
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:26,929
Taozi.

344
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:30,368
His Majesty conferred me
the title of Lord Qin,

345
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,288
appointed me as Commander-in-Chief,

346
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,620
and ordered me to reclaim Xichang?

347
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,300
The imperial edict
arrived here last night.

348
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,000
Not only did he confer
the title of Lord Qin to you,

349
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:40,288
but he also conferred the titles
of Lord Qi and Lord Xin

350
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,209
to Lord Kuaiji and
Lord Linzi respectively.

351
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:47,409
They're putting me on open fire here.

352
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:49,729
If I fail to reclaim Xichang,

353
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:52,368
I'll be punished, huh?

354
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:53,889
Shiqi,

355
00:22:54,328 --> 00:22:55,568
why don't you refuse it?

356
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:56,249
Refuse what?

357
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,010
Since His Majesty already
issued an edict,

358
00:22:58,768 --> 00:22:59,969
I'll be Lord Qin then.

359
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:00,768
Now,

360
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:02,449
as the Commander-in-Chief,

361
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,209
I can dispatch the loyalists

362
00:23:04,768 --> 00:23:06,608
officially

363
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:08,209
to reclaim Xichang.

364
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:11,689
This time, I'll leave the city to you guys.

365
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:13,449
Don't worry, Mister Shiqi.

366
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,328
We'll definitely follow
your instructions

367
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:16,729
and flip Xichang

368
00:23:17,008 --> 00:23:18,209
upside down.

369
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:19,249
Precisely.

370
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:21,528
We might not be good at other things,

371
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:23,328
but flipping places upside down

372
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:24,449
is our expertise.

373
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,000
It's a shame that
I haven't fully recovered yet.

374
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:28,260
I can't join you guys this time.

375
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:29,288
I'll go ahead

376
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,729
and do your share for you.

377
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,568
There's an undercurrent surging.

378
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,020
We can't tell friends from foes.

379
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:37,088
You guys must be careful.

380
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:38,489
Must act cautiously.

381
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:41,088
And, you must ensure your own safety.

382
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:42,689
Don't worry.

383
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:44,288
Once we take down Xichang,

384
00:23:44,608 --> 00:23:46,249
we'll come back and drink with you.

385
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:46,808
Let's drink!

386
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,980
We'll conquer Xichang
and drink together when we're back!

387
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:49,810
Let's drink together!

388
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:50,288
Let's go.

389
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:51,929
Prime Minister Gu,

390
00:23:52,368 --> 00:23:54,249
wild rumors
have been spreading in the city.

391
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:55,929
There's a hike in food prices,

392
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,088
and the people are panicking.

393
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,409
They say that the army
Grand Governor

394
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:00,249
had sent to conquer Baiyue
suffered a major defeat.

395
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:01,409
They were also saying

396
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,060
that Li Ni, the son of the fake emperor,
was conferred the title of Lord Qin.

397
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:05,729
And now, he's going to attack Xichang.

398
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:07,729
People say that he was born

399
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,169
to jinx Grand Governor.

400
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:12,209
What else did you hear?

401
00:24:13,008 --> 00:24:14,768
They even said Lord Qin
sent his spies here

402
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:16,088
to poison the well water.

403
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:17,110
People are panicking.

404
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:18,580
They dare not consume
well water anymore.

405
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:19,328
Some even said

406
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:20,768
that the granary was empty.

407
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:22,088
There was no food inside.

408
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:22,969
They said

409
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:24,368
the army that was sent to Baiyue

410
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:25,649
had already taken all of them.

411
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:27,169
Once...

412
00:24:27,328 --> 00:24:28,729
Once Lord Qin surrounds our city,

413
00:24:28,848 --> 00:24:29,969
the people in the city

414
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:31,969
will starve to death.

415
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:34,169
All right. I understand. You may leave.

416
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:36,929
Order our servants to guard the door.
Don't let anyone out.

417
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,729
Yes, Prime Minister.

418
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:44,808
Do you understand now?

419
00:24:46,328 --> 00:24:48,020
Is Lord Qin trying
to cause a ruckus here?

420
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:48,848
That's right.

421
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:51,409
Lord Qin wants to sow discord
among the people.

422
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:55,048
Now, let's see what the person
inside the palace will do

423
00:24:55,608 --> 00:24:57,048
to deal with this situation.

424
00:24:57,528 --> 00:25:00,088
Capture all those
who were spreading the rumors

425
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:00,768
and kill them.

426
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:01,848
Grand Governor,

427
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,920
I'm afraid the rumor-spreaders
have an ulterior motive.

428
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,180
That's why we have to kill them.

429
00:25:06,808 --> 00:25:07,889
Not only will I kill them,

430
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,500
but I'll also exterminate
their families and clans.

431
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:13,129
I'll see

432
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:14,449
who's daring enough

433
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:16,129
to do something like this after this.

434
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,608
Yes, Grand Governor.

435
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:34,929
Why are you so early today?

436
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:51,088
You didn't like to
use rouge in the past.

437
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,209
What's with the sudden fondness?

438
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,368
Maybe it was because of

439
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:00,169
the white hair

440
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:02,568
I saw in the mirror that day.

441
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:16,209
Jing,

442
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:18,048
are you troubled by court affairs?

443
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,088
You don't need to tell me about them.

444
00:26:20,969 --> 00:26:22,489
Let's go and take a walk.

445
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:28,129
Ever since I took up arms,

446
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:29,729
I always thought

447
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:31,288
that the world

448
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,649
could be conquered easily.

449
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:34,729
I never expected

450
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:36,848
Li Ni to lead the Zhenxi Army

451
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:38,608
all the way here.

452
00:26:39,328 --> 00:26:40,689
He's targeting Xichang now.

453
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:43,808
Tong Pass is the gate
to the two capitals.

454
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:45,489
As long as we own Tong Pass,

455
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:48,048
it's useless even if

456
00:26:48,368 --> 00:26:49,889
Li Ni owns Luoyang.

457
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:53,568
Cui Yi is devious and cunning.

458
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:55,969
If he joins hands with Li Ni,

459
00:26:56,889 --> 00:26:58,969
it'll be tough for us.

460
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:00,929
That won't happen.

461
00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:03,368
Cui Yi has an ulterior motive.

462
00:27:03,768 --> 00:27:06,209
If not, he wouldn't have sent his army
out of Yingzhou.

463
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,528
Li Ni is the son of the fake emperor.

464
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:10,489
They harbor different motives.

465
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,489
They won't join hands that easily.

466
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:20,209
I shouldn't have told you about that.

467
00:27:21,288 --> 00:27:22,889
Come, let's play some polo.

468
00:27:23,848 --> 00:27:24,409
Okay.

469
00:28:32,088 --> 00:28:33,889
What? You plan

470
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,460
to ignore me for the rest of your life?

471
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:37,808
Lord Qin, you're overthinking it.

472
00:28:38,288 --> 00:28:40,729
You were just conferred
the title of Lord Qin.

473
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,608
There are plenty of people
who wish to gain your favor.

474
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,489
Your Highness, you don't need
to care about me.

475
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,670
In the past, you call me
the imperial grandson.

476
00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:52,129
Now, you call me Your Highness.

477
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,848
Aren't you willing

478
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:55,889
to call me Shiqi again?

479
00:29:02,689 --> 00:29:04,249
This place is the best.

480
00:29:18,768 --> 00:29:20,169
When I was young,

481
00:29:20,848 --> 00:29:22,409
my nanny said

482
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,768
that I should make a bamboo dragonfly

483
00:29:26,328 --> 00:29:27,848
whenever I have a wish.

484
00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:31,528
My wish will be granted

485
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:34,048
when it falls to the ground.

486
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:37,528
Back then,

487
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:40,368
I wanted to see my mother very badly.

488
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:43,008
Everyone had a mother, except for me.

489
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:44,568
Thus,

490
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:46,929
I made plenty of bamboo dragonflies.

491
00:29:47,608 --> 00:29:50,100
I scaled to the top of the wall
and released them one by one.

492
00:29:51,048 --> 00:29:53,409
When I was done,

493
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:57,328
I found out that my nanny was saying that
just to coax me.

494
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:00,288
That wish of mine

495
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:03,008
could never be fulfilled

496
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,840
no matter how many
bamboo dragonflies I made.

497
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:09,368
People say

498
00:30:09,568 --> 00:30:10,608
that one wouldn't repeat

499
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:12,568
their silly mistakes again.

500
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,368
Even so, I still made plenty of
bamboo dragonflies.

501
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:20,008
Because it's you.

502
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:22,608
For you,

503
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,929
I'm willing to do all the silly things
in the world.

504
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:36,209
Ying,

505
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,608
can you please forgive me?

506
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:42,969
I promise,

507
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,489
from now on,

508
00:30:46,368 --> 00:30:48,008
I won't misunderstand your intention.

509
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:55,780
If so, you should stop trapping me here.

510
00:30:57,129 --> 00:30:59,649
Release me and Taozi back to Yingzhou.

511
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,568
I can't allow that.

512
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:09,129
If so,

513
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:10,848
I have nothing to say to you.

514
00:31:32,528 --> 00:31:35,129
You're still in the mood to fish, huh?

515
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:37,489
What's wrong?

516
00:31:37,608 --> 00:31:38,969
Is Cui Yi's main army here?

517
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:40,889
Not yet.

518
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:42,969
They're taking their sweet time.

519
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:47,528
Shiqi,

520
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:49,409
don't you think

521
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,768
Cui Yi has an ulterior motive?

522
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:53,169
The situation in Xichang
is ever-changing.

523
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,008
If he doesn't hurry up,

524
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:56,449
I'm afraid we'll miss out

525
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:57,729
on this opportunity.

526
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,489
I coerced him into doing this.

527
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,768
Of course he's unhappy to do so.

528
00:32:01,288 --> 00:32:01,808
Besides,

529
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:03,649
he has the number advantage.

530
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,600
But he has to try his best
to conquer the city.

531
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,300
Do you think he'll be willing to hurry
when he's in that situation?

532
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:11,008
I just received news.

533
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,449
Great General is already...

534
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:29,088
This is a rare opportunity indeed.

535
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:30,929
Maybe we can

536
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,768
use this chance to escape.

537
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,568
Lieutenant He, I knew you could

538
00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:37,088
think of a great idea.

539
00:32:38,328 --> 00:32:40,929
However, we need to plan this out.

540
00:32:41,608 --> 00:32:43,808
Li Ni is very intelligent.

541
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:45,969
It's difficult for us to escape

542
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:49,008
without a thorough plan.

543
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:54,048
Where's Li Ni?

544
00:32:55,008 --> 00:32:57,209
Ear has been following me all day long.

545
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:58,409
He kept yapping

546
00:32:58,568 --> 00:32:59,929
because I ignored him.

547
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:02,209
He said that Li Ni was
fishing by the lake

548
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:03,969
this afternoon.

549
00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:04,808
He even asked me

550
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,300
if I wanted to have some fresh fish.

551
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:09,129
He was fishing?

552
00:33:17,088 --> 00:33:17,969
Who's there?

553
00:33:18,528 --> 00:33:20,008
Your Highness, it's me.

554
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:20,808
Taozi.

555
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,008
Please come in.

556
00:33:25,288 --> 00:33:26,729
Your Highness, General Pei Yuan.

557
00:33:27,328 --> 00:33:27,929
Your Highness,

558
00:33:28,288 --> 00:33:30,169
Lieutenant He
was taking medicine every day.

559
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:31,568
She didn't take much food either.

560
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:32,808
She has lost a lot of weight.

561
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:34,568
You knew that too.

562
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:36,449
After she took her medicine,

563
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,710
she suddenly said
she wanted to have fish ball soup.

564
00:33:38,848 --> 00:33:40,568
I asked the kitchen about it.

565
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:43,528
But they said the marketplace
was closed today.

566
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,368
They only bought some vegetables.

567
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:46,370
Coincidentally,

568
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:47,328
I saw some fish

569
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:48,889
in the bucket.

570
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:50,768
But they said

571
00:33:51,288 --> 00:33:52,528
those were the fish

572
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:53,889
you caught by the lake today.

573
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:55,910
I dare not use them
without your permission.

574
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:58,568
That's why I came here
to ask for your permission.

575
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,839
Finally she has an appetite,

576
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,980
I'll make the fish ball soup.

577
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:02,409
No need for that.

578
00:34:02,528 --> 00:34:03,129
I can make it.

579
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:03,729
It's fine.

580
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,129
It takes skills to make fish balls.

581
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:05,729
Let me do it.

582
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:07,328
If that's the case,

583
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:08,928
Your Highness, please go ahead.

584
00:34:17,448 --> 00:34:18,928
Taozi, you're back.

585
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:20,368
Yeah, I'm back.

586
00:34:23,368 --> 00:34:24,488
Try it while it's hot.

587
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,870
It'll smell fishy when it gets cold.

588
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:47,928
Is it nice?

589
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:51,408
It's pretty fresh.

590
00:34:54,689 --> 00:34:55,368
You should

591
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:57,569
rest and recuperate.

592
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:00,009
Even if you're mad at me,

593
00:35:00,729 --> 00:35:02,209
you have to cherish your body.

594
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:08,689
In the future,

595
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:10,328
just tell me what you want

596
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:11,689
and what you wish to eat.

597
00:35:12,169 --> 00:35:13,408
I'll get them for you.

598
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,900
Aren't you afraid that
I'll use this chance

599
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:22,848
to relay a message back home

600
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:25,488
and escape from this place?

601
00:35:27,488 --> 00:35:28,768
Even if you do escape from here,

602
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:30,009
I can intercept you

603
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,288
and bring you back.

604
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:33,009
If you don't believe me,

605
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,689
feel free to give it a try.

606
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:39,529
The army Sun Jing had sent to Baiyue

607
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,729
didn't really suffer a defeat.

608
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,620
Only his army in Yingzhou
suffered a defeat.

609
00:35:43,448 --> 00:35:45,649
I'm afraid Sun Jing will recall

610
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,808
his army in Baiyue.

611
00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:48,848
And, he owns Tong Pass.

612
00:35:49,488 --> 00:35:51,169
You're caught in a pincer attack.

613
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:52,649
Unless

614
00:35:52,768 --> 00:35:53,768
you can conquer Xichang

615
00:35:53,928 --> 00:35:55,209
before the army in Baiyue

616
00:35:55,368 --> 00:35:56,768
comes back.

617
00:35:57,448 --> 00:35:58,569
However, I'm afraid

618
00:35:58,729 --> 00:35:59,808
the Zhenxi Army

619
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,320
is incapable of such a feat
at the moment.

620
00:36:07,408 --> 00:36:08,448
Excellent point.

621
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:09,888
However,

622
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,968
I still won't release you.

623
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:20,368
Your Highness, you do know me well, huh?

624
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:24,609
You know me well too.

625
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:28,169
We're the same.

626
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,990
Taozi, have you managed to
buy everything you need?

627
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:39,129
That incident was so long ago.

628
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,209
Can you please talk to me?

629
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,288
I'll do anything for you

630
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:42,529
as long as you talk to me.

631
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,609
Don't you know why I'm ignoring you?

632
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:46,169
Back then, you were just observing us

633
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,820
when Lieutenant He and I
were under pursuit.

634
00:36:47,848 --> 00:36:48,968
You guys ignored us.

635
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:50,448
You're just like Lord Qin.

636
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:52,089
You guys are heartless, indifferent,

637
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,808
and cold-hearted!

638
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:53,529
That's not it.

639
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,448
I was anxious too.

640
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:56,990
I wanted to rush down
and save you.

641
00:36:57,569 --> 00:36:59,488
But it was a military order. I...

642
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:01,689
I had no choice.

643
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:02,808
Besides,

644
00:37:02,968 --> 00:37:04,249
the soldiers of the Zhenxi Army

645
00:37:04,368 --> 00:37:05,808
never go against military orders.

646
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:06,729
Your excuses.

647
00:37:06,888 --> 00:37:08,009
I'm not making up excuses.

648
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:10,129
That day,

649
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,529
Mister Shiqi knew what he was doing.

650
00:37:12,768 --> 00:37:14,368
He had his bow drawn.

651
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,888
He wouldn't just stand there
and see you hurt.

652
00:37:18,848 --> 00:37:19,328
Taozi.

653
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,570
What exactly do you want me to do
before you'll forgive me?

654
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:23,009
Why don't I gather herbs with you

655
00:37:23,169 --> 00:37:24,689
or buy something nice for you?

656
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,110
Do you want to have pig ears?

657
00:37:26,169 --> 00:37:28,488
I'll do anything you like
as long as you stop ignoring me.

658
00:37:28,888 --> 00:37:29,729
Really?

659
00:37:30,169 --> 00:37:31,529
Anything?

660
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:37,488
Except for releasing you
and Lieutenant He.

661
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:42,689
You have good hearing, right?

662
00:37:43,848 --> 00:37:44,848
Don't tell me

663
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:46,249
you want to have my ears?

664
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,049
Nonsense.

665
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:48,928
Who wants to have your stupid ears?

666
00:37:50,848 --> 00:37:51,649
I just

667
00:37:52,368 --> 00:37:53,089
want you

668
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,129
to make a whistle for me.

669
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:55,649
A whistle?

670
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:59,649
I want you to make a whistle
that only you can hear.

671
00:37:59,848 --> 00:38:00,609
If I need your help

672
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,529
for any emergencies,

673
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:02,968
I'll blow the whistle.

674
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:05,089
That sounds difficult.

675
00:38:06,768 --> 00:38:07,448
But don't worry.

676
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,670
I can definitely make it for you.

677
00:38:11,129 --> 00:38:12,089
That's more like it.

678
00:38:12,968 --> 00:38:15,569
So, Taozi, you'll stop ignoring me, right?

679
00:38:15,848 --> 00:38:17,049
You are not angry at me, right?

680
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:18,288
That depends on my mood.

681
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,770
Mister Shiqi went to see
Lieutenant He just now.

682
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:31,328
She shut the door on him again.

683
00:38:33,368 --> 00:38:34,448
He deserved it.

684
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:37,848
Miss Taozi,

685
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:39,288
actually, Mister Shiqi

686
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:40,768
is very nice to Lieutenant He.

687
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:42,448
Why don't you speak up

688
00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:43,649
for him in front of her

689
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:44,768
and try to appease her?

690
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:45,928
If he was

691
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:47,328
truly nice to Lieutenant He,

692
00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:50,209
he wouldn't just use these random herbs
to brew her medicine.

693
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:53,129
Even now, Lieutenant He hasn't recovered
from her injuries.

694
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:55,368
Look. What are these?

695
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:57,169
Miss Taozi, don't be angry.

696
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:58,768
Well, give me the prescription.

697
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,500
I'll buy the herbs.

698
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:00,609
If I can't buy them nearby,

699
00:39:00,768 --> 00:39:02,928
I'll buy them in Xichang or Luoyang, OK?

700
00:39:04,488 --> 00:39:05,569
You said so yourself.

701
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:07,249
Fine.

702
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:09,408
I'll get you the prescription right now.

703
00:39:09,569 --> 00:39:10,129
Okay.

704
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:13,328
Keep fanning it. Don't stop.

705
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,810
Where are you going?

706
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,520
Lieutenant He hasn't recovered
from her injuries.

707
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,408
The herbs here are limited.

708
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,049
So Miss Taozi
gave me a prescription.

709
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,328
She told me to buy these herbs.

710
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,768
By the way, Taozi also said

711
00:39:31,848 --> 00:39:33,070
that she would speak up for you

712
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:34,488
in front of Lieutenant He

713
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:36,209
as long as I buy all of these herbs.

714
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:41,529
Dragon bone,

715
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,928
Forsythia suspensa,

716
00:39:44,129 --> 00:39:45,609
Aesculus hippocastanum,

717
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:48,009
pumice, ephedra,

718
00:39:48,328 --> 00:39:49,448
and Fritillaria pallidiflora?

719
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:51,808
That's a lot of herbs.

720
00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:53,408
And, she even designated the stores.

721
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,249
The stores are far away
from each other too.

722
00:39:55,888 --> 00:39:56,569
Taozi said

723
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:58,609
she knew which store sold the best herbs.

724
00:39:59,169 --> 00:39:59,729
If I try

725
00:39:59,848 --> 00:40:00,649
to brush her off,

726
00:40:00,808 --> 00:40:02,649
she won't let me off when she finds out.

727
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:04,529
Good job.

728
00:40:04,928 --> 00:40:05,569
I'll go now.

729
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:09,968
Taozi didn't tell you

730
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,968
to buy them one by one, right?

731
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,009
Isn't it faster

732
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:12,649
if you get help?

733
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:14,839
This is a request from Miss Taozi.

734
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,390
How could I tell other people to do it?

735
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:18,009
Besides, it's just a few stores.

736
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:19,870
I travel fast.
It won't take up much time.

737
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:21,310
I'll be leaving now.

738
00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:36,009
(Huichun Apothecary)
Huichen Apothecary? I finally found it.

739
00:40:37,808 --> 00:40:38,249
Shopkeeper,

740
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:39,209
I want to buy this.

741
00:40:39,368 --> 00:40:39,848
Aesculus hippocastanum.

742
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:42,358
(Huichun Apothecary)
(Aesculus hippocastanum)

743
00:40:49,368 --> 00:40:50,110
Here are your herbs.

744
00:40:50,169 --> 00:40:50,768
Thank you.

745
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:55,110
Here's the money. Keep the change.

746
00:40:55,968 --> 00:40:56,768
Take care.

747
00:41:07,888 --> 00:41:08,488
Miss Taozi!

748
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:09,968
Miss Taozi!

749
00:41:10,488 --> 00:41:11,380
I bought all the herbs.

750
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:12,808
That quickly?

751
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:15,569
Did you skive and skip some of them?

752
00:41:15,768 --> 00:41:16,609
I didn't!

753
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:17,780
I bought them one by one

754
00:41:17,888 --> 00:41:19,009
according to your list.

755
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:20,448
Let me see.

756
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,620
What do you think?

757
00:41:31,729 --> 00:41:32,848
Miss Taozi,

758
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:33,928
can you please

759
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:35,169
speak up for Mister Shiqi

760
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:36,729
in front of Lieutenant He then?

761
00:41:37,169 --> 00:41:37,768
Fine.

762
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,928
I'll do it on account of these herbs.

763
00:41:42,488 --> 00:41:43,808
Let me check them again.

764
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:44,288
Go ahead.

765
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:52,209
Ying.

766
00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:56,089
The weather is pretty good today.

767
00:41:56,328 --> 00:41:57,488
I got you some osmanthus.

768
00:42:00,368 --> 00:42:01,089
Ying?

769
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:04,089
Ying?

770
00:42:11,408 --> 00:42:12,928
I'll leave it at your doorstep then.

Lieutenant He,

784
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,249
we have fresh flowers again today.

785
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,888
I'll swap yesterday's bouquet
for this one.

786
00:44:14,928 --> 00:44:17,448
Lieutenant He,
you should stop being mad.

787
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:20,129
I think Lord Qin...

788
00:44:20,488 --> 00:44:20,968
No.

789
00:44:21,209 --> 00:44:23,368
I mean he's apologizing to you
sincerely this time.

790
00:44:23,808 --> 00:44:24,888
Didn't he say

791
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:26,649
that he wasn't supposed to trust you?

792
00:44:27,808 --> 00:44:29,129
Actually, Cui Li was the one

793
00:44:29,328 --> 00:44:31,089
behind Young Master's passing.

794
00:44:31,529 --> 00:44:32,808
It's not his fault.

795
00:44:33,808 --> 00:44:34,848
Strange.

796
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:36,488
Why are you

797
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:38,249
speaking up for him today?

798
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:39,928
Lieutenant He,

799
00:44:40,249 --> 00:44:42,209
I'm doing this for your sake.

800
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:44,089
I think Lord Qin

801
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:46,129
is truly nice to you.

802
00:44:46,368 --> 00:44:48,768
He even sent his men
to buy herbs from various stores.

803
00:44:49,288 --> 00:44:51,209
He still wants to keep you company here

804
00:44:51,328 --> 00:44:52,768
even if you show him a long face

805
00:44:52,928 --> 00:44:54,009
every day.

806
00:44:57,848 --> 00:44:58,729
Actually,

807
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,729
I know that he's sincere
in apologizing to me too.

808
00:45:01,888 --> 00:45:03,529
I should stop being mad at him.

809
00:45:04,328 --> 00:45:05,649
I wouldn't be this angry

810
00:45:05,928 --> 00:45:07,689
if someone else did this.

811
00:45:08,649 --> 00:45:09,488
But...

812
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:13,490
To me, he's different from

813
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:16,209
other people.

814
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:21,729
I see.

815
00:45:22,649 --> 00:45:24,129
I was wondering why.

816
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,700
I'll get angry if you keep that up.

817
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:28,689
It's my fault.

818
00:45:28,848 --> 00:45:29,569
Don't be angry.

819
00:45:30,129 --> 00:45:31,400
I'll change your flowers for you.

820
00:45:33,368 --> 00:45:33,928
Great General.

821
00:45:36,049 --> 00:45:36,968
We've received news.

822
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:38,827
(Xichang)

823
00:45:38,848 --> 00:45:39,408
Mister Shiqi!

824
00:45:39,689 --> 00:45:40,288
Mister Shiqi!

825
00:45:41,328 --> 00:45:42,089
Mister Shiqi!

826
00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:45,328
Mister Shiqi, I have good news.

827
00:45:45,768 --> 00:45:46,448
What is it?

828
00:45:47,768 --> 00:45:48,368
Taozi said

829
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:49,649
she finally convinced

830
00:45:49,808 --> 00:45:50,808
Lieutenant He to see you

831
00:45:50,968 --> 00:45:52,569
after all the effort she has put in.

832
00:45:52,968 --> 00:45:55,169
Tonight, they'll hold a banquet
beside the lotus pond.

833
00:45:55,368 --> 00:45:57,408
By then, Taozi will act accordingly

834
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,010
and give you two
a chance to speak in private.

835
00:45:59,928 --> 00:46:01,328
By the way, Taozi also said

836
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:02,249
that all women

837
00:46:02,408 --> 00:46:03,529
are soft-hearted.

838
00:46:03,689 --> 00:46:05,209
By then, you need to apologize to her

839
00:46:05,368 --> 00:46:06,089
sincerely.

840
00:46:06,288 --> 00:46:07,009
This way,

841
00:46:07,169 --> 00:46:08,368
Lieutenant He can be appeased.

842
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:13,288
Thank Miss Taozi for me.

843
00:46:14,049 --> 00:46:14,488
