Come on.

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,518
You haven't recovered yet.

31
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:18,600
So, don't drink liquor.

32
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,880
It feels like a world away

33
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,279
when I think

34
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,440
about those days in Taiqing Palace.

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,440
It sure is.

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,920
Ying,

37
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,880
are you still angry with me?

38
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,319
What are you trying to do?

39
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,640
They're fighting.

40
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,119
It's just a lover's quarrel.

41
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,720
They'll make up after the fight.

42
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,798
Besides,

43
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,078
even if they fight,

44
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,798
will your Mister Shiqi

45
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,079
really lose?

46
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,918
Don't bother them.

47
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,839
Let's go.

48
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,119
Where to?

49
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,160
I'm a bit hungry.

50
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:35,839
How about we go and have some snacks

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,159
at Tang Confectionery?

52
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,238
I've always heard

53
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:38,879
their snacks

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,478
are famous in Dongdu.

55
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,478
They must be delicious.

56
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,319
I want to go and try.

57
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,600
Come, I'll take you there.

58
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,079
What are you doing?

59
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,999
Are your fingers better?

60
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,119
The chess pieces are ready.

61
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,639
My fingers will heal on their own.

62
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,239
You crafted a whole set of chess pieces

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,080
for your Young Master.

64
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,519
You even ignored

65
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,879
your injured fingers.

66
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,318
But you've never made

67
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,799
anything for me.

68
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,199
Who said I never made anything for you?

69
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,879
What did you make for me?

70
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,040
Did

71
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,280
you make this yourself?

72
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,720
I already started making it

73
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:19,999
when I was at Tong Pass.

74
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:21,678
I wanted to find the chance

75
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:23,159
to give it to you.

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,799
But then I realized

77
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,478
you're an ingrate

78
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,999
and refuse to help others in need.

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,839
I should just burn it.

80
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,119
You can't burn it.

81
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,559
If you're not angry...

82
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,639
As long as you're not angry,

83
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,118
even if you scold me

84
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,358
countless times a day,

85
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,879
I'll listen obediently.

86
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,759
Who wants to scold you?

87
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,080
Why don't I put it on and show you?

88
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:10,600
It's difficult to do with one hand.

89
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,639
Can you help me?

90
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,280
It's not tight enough.

91
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,959
Look at it.

92
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,759
Or else you're giving it away
for nothing.

93
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,119
Let me see.

94
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,520
In the end,

95
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,160
we're foes, not friends.

96
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:40,759
When we meet again

97
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,119
after parting today,

98
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,999
I'm afraid it'll be on the battlefield,

99
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,280
fighting for our lives.

100
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,520
Shiqi,

101
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,960
take care.

102
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,320
Where's Ear?

103
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,440
He already passed out.

104
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,960
I pricked him a couple of times more.

105
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,320
He won't wake up
for at least three days.

106
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,360
That's really ruthless.

107
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,840
You taught me well.

108
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,560
Excuse me! Sir!

109
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,039
Please take us to the other side!

110
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,519
The sooner, the better!

111
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:38,639
Hurry.

112
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,159
Lord Qin?

113
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,080
You were calling me?

114
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,119
Lord Qin, that was a great strategy.

115
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,480
I was just planning as I played along.

116
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,718
When I looked at the prescription

117
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:26,838
Taozi gave Chang'er that day,

118
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:27,838
I already suspected something.

119
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,159
As I suspected,

120
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:30,318
not only did you make contact

121
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:31,759
with the Cui Army
through the apothecary,

122
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,519
but you also put up an act.

123
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,838
All to make Chang'er believed

124
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,678
that Taozi spoke well of me,

125
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,279
and you were really persuaded.

126
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:39,678
It was all to set up a meal

127
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,840
to prick me unconscious and escape.

128
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:43,999
So, you knew all along,

129
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,919
and you played along with us.

130
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,279
Well, I know you too well.

131
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,598
If I don't let you try to escape once,

132
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:49,999
how would you be content?

133
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,318
All right, then.

134
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,399
I'm taking you back

135
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,360
to your residence now.

136
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,519
Let's go.

137
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Grand Governor,

138
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,639
the envoy we sent to the Cui Army

139
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,519
was whipped by Cui Yi

140
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,440
before being sent back here.

141
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:17,119
Cui Yi's temper

142
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,999
hasn't changed at all.

143
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,239
The vanguard of the Cui Army

144
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,639
has reached entrance of Jiuqu.

145
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,279
It seems they want to cross the river.

146
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,078
If Cui Yi crosses the river

147
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,159
and joins forces with Li Ni

148
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,558
to besiege and attack Xichang,

149
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,159
there would an unrest in the capital.

150
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,840
I'm afraid it might hinder
the overall situation.

151
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,119
Grand Governor,

152
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,680
should we attack him
while they were crossing

153
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,999
the river?

154
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,519
Cui Yi has always been cunning.

155
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,200
If he dares to cross the river
from the entrance of Jiuqu,

156
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:45,198
he must have considered

157
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:46,958
the shallow waters.

158
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,239
Crossing the river is easy,

159
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,680
and so is being ambushed.

160
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,840
No,

161
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,399
he won't cross the river

162
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,159
from the entrance of Jiuqu.

163
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,440
He's probably creating a diversion.

164
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:00,399
Didn't Cui Yi's son

165
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,239
get intercepted and killed?

166
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:03,958
I don't think

167
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,680
he's targeting Xichang this time.

168
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,759
Let him cross the river.

169
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,720
Grand Governor,

170
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,040
if the Cui Army crosses the river
and cooperates with Li Ni...

171
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
I said, let him cross the river.

172
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,399
If he dares to take the advantage

173
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,239
and attack Xichang,

174
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,919
then, I'll fight him to the death.

175
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,999
If he heads toward Luoyang,

176
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,159
I'll deploy the troops

177
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,200
to seize the opportunity
and eliminate Li Ni.

178
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,120
Be careful, it's hot.

179
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,399
Taozi,

180
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,200
how is Lieutenant He's health?

181
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,639
Do you still need medicinal herbs?

182
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,519
Thanks to Your Highness,

183
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,200
we're not lacking in medicinal herbs.

184
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,879
I'm sure you know

185
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,078
your provocation

186
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,759
worsened the Lieutenant He's illness.

187
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,279
Now, that's bad.

188
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,798
How about I say something

189
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,200
to make her livid even more?

190
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,440
Due to the lesson from this time,

191
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,958
I've dispatched heavy troops

192
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,239
to surround Taiqing Palace
inside and out

193
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,279
like an iron bucket.

194
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,918
I've also sent dozens of scouts

195
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,119
to watch every exit closely.

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,279
If you still want to escape,

197
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,039
I'll be nervous for you.

198
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,360
Lord Qin,

199
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,359
I believe you've planned thoroughly

200
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,399
and prepared for a surefire hit

201
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,360
in Xichang.

202
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,519
No matter how thorough the plan is,

203
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,759
there will be flaws.

204
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,039
How can we talk about being thorough

205
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,438
or ensuring a sure hit?

206
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:43,720
Since there isn't a thorough plan yet,

207
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,320
how about this?

208
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,999
I'll plan it for you,

209
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,318
kill Sun Jing,

210
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:50,879
and then you let me go.

211
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,840
How about that?

212
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,759
It's not worth it.

213
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,759
So, no.

214
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,318
I didn't expect you

215
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,960
to value me this much.

216
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,759
Is a woman like me

217
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,879
worth more than Sun Jin?

218
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:18,119
Cui Yi's only daughter

219
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,999
is naturally more valuable
than Sun Jin.

220
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,680
So, you knew early on
that she is the Great General's daughter.

221
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,999
So, you already knew.

222
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,918
No wonder

223
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,600
you've been refusing to let me go.

224
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,639
Miss Taozi,

225
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,960
could you step outside for a moment?

226
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,399
I have a few words

227
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,399
I'd like to say

228
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,159
to Lieutenant He.

229
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,399
Actually, after saving you,

230
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,279
I wrote a letter

231
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,639
to Great General Cui.

232
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,720
(Great General Cui,)

233
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,360
(we happened to be nearby
when the Cui Army was ambushed.)

234
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,598
(It's a pity we were too late)

235
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,039
(and Mister Cui fell into the river.)

236
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,840
(But it's fortunate, we rescued Ying.)

237
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,960
(You can rest assured now.)

238
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,958
(Ying is safe and sound.)

239
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,720
(She's currently recuperating
at Zhenxi Army's camp.)

240
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:30,120
(I earnestly hope
that you can lead your army)

241
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,360
(to join forces with the Zhenxi Army,
to capture Xichang together,)

242
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,840
(eliminate Sun Jin, and help
the ruler suppress the rebellion.)

243
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,318
(Till then, your pearl in the palm)

244
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:38,759
(will return to your side.)

245
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,600
I mentioned that you are safe and sound,

246
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,798
and I earnestly implore him

247
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,159
to join me in suppressing Crook Sun

248
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,600
and reclaiming Xichang.

249
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,480
Although Great General Cui
replied to my letter,

250
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,119
but...

251
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,680
What do you want to say, Your Highness?

252
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,879
Just be frank.

253
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:55,280
I finally found out

254
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,039
that the Heroic Lady who led the women
to fight to the death in Yingzhou

255
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,759
and refused to surrender

256
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,119
was your mother.

257
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,759
The Heroic Lady's last name is He.

258
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,958
So you change your last name

259
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,440
and claim to be from the He clan.

260
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,480
I've been thinking about it
these past few days.

261
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,480
Heroic Lady was such a brave figure

262
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,480
and Great General Cui
is also an extraordinary person

263
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,119
to have a daughter like you.

264
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,879
Are you probing?

265
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,720
Yes.

266
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,399
I know nothing

267
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,919
about Great General Cui.

268
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,039
So I can only ask through this method.

269
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
Perhaps,

270
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:33,239
after some time,

271
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,320
you'll know what kind of person

272
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,440
my father is.

273
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,399
I have a bad feeling about this.

274
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,639
Why?

275
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,440
I always feel

276
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,119
that he's like you.

277
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,198
Intelligent

278
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,119
and extremely formidable.

279
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,159
I don't know how he'll react

280
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,800
after offending him like this.

281
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,480
I'm Father's only daughter.

282
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,519
You used me to pressure him.

283
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,359
Do I need to tell you

284
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,879
how he will react to this?

285
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,399
If you fall into his hands,

286
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:08,959
it's likely

287
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,199
he'll whip you.

288
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:17,199
Then I must be careful

289
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,919
not to fall into his hand.

290
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:34,679
Great General,

291
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,679
the vanguard
has already crossed the river.

292
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,080
It's time for the middle army
to break camp.

293
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,919
The mastermind

294
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,919
is hiding in Luoyang.

295
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,240
He dared to kill my son.

296
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,519
The Cui Army

297
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,719
will naturally retaliate.

298
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:00,879
What?

299
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,118
Cui Yi doesn't have a son,

300
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,519
only a daughter?

301
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,199
Lieutenant He is Cui Lin?

302
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,239
The one who died

303
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,800
was just a fake?

304
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,479
Impossible.

305
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,840
Absolutely impossible.

306
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,399
Shiqi,

307
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,598
did you make up this nonsense

308
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,679
to lie to me

309
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,399
so you can marry her?

310
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,279
Think carefully

311
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,279
about Mister Cui's attitude

312
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,840
toward Lieutenant He.

313
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,479
Also, think carefully

314
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,080
if I need to lie to you.

315
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,719
I see.

316
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,719
That's why

317
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,158
you've kept her locked up

318
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,118
in Taiqing Palace

319
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,759
and deployed heavy troops here.

320
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,879
You wanted to use her
to pressure Cui Yi?

321
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,919
This is not considered
as pressuring him.

322
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,558
It's a sincere invitation

323
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,719
to Great General Pingliang, Cui Yi.

324
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,798
To consider the Zhenxi Army

325
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,000
in rescuing his daughter,

326
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,080
I ask him to join us

327
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,040
in the loyal cause of quelling rebellion

328
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:01,159
and reclaiming Xichang.

329
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,719
Time for your medicine.

330
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,199
Here you go.

331
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,638
The flowers Lord Qin sent today

332
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:13,040
are quite beautiful.

333
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,519
Why do you

334
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,399
seem different today?

335
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,398
Different in what way?

336
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:32,199
Like you've come around

337
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,800
to your usual self.

338
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,399
I'm just thinking

339
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,000
that in a few days,

340
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:41,719
I might be able

341
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,439
to return to Father's side.

342
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,879
If I don't get better,

343
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,840
won't it make him worry?

344
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,479
Have you thought of a way
to get away from here?

345
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,999
I think Father
has already led the army

346
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,719
and arrived outside of Luoyang.

347
00:19:57,399 --> 00:19:59,520
The situation is changing rapidly.

348
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,360
Li Ni

349
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,520
won't be able to trap us for long.

350
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,600
That's great.

351
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,119
I was just thinking

352
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,280
if Young Master

353
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:18,479
could escape safely,

354
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,280
that would be really great.

355
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,600
Otherwise,

356
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,879
it would be a lifelong regret for me.

357
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,000
There, there.

358
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,320
If Young Master knew,

359
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,358
he would also hope

360
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,719
you wouldn't overthink it

361
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,360
and take care of yourself.

362
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,919
The living should cherish their lives.

363
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,919
That's the best comfort

364
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,560
for the departed.

365
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,679
This is what Father told me

366
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,719
after Mother sacrificed herself
for the city.

367
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,240
Mister Shiqi, there's news.
Sun Jing has indeed mobilized his troops.

368
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,199
He's splitting them into two,

369
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,358
one heading to Luoyang,

370
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,280
and the other one directly
to our main camp.

371
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,520
It's just as you predicted.

372
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,719
That crook of Sun Jing

373
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,679
is taking advantage

374
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,999
of Cui Yi's attack on Luoyang

375
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,719
to send troops
to attack the Zhenxi Army.

376
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,199
And he even sent a detachment

377
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,000
to Luoyang.

378
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,680
It seems he really wants
to take advantage of this opportunity.

379
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,520
Then we'll strike them here first,
catching them off guard.

380
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,679
The weather is getting cold now.

381
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,439
Where did all these flowers come from?

382
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:45,519
Didn't Lord Qin instruct someone

383
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,358
to send a bouquet every day?

384
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,279
So, I plucked the petals

385
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,279
and flower buds.

386
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,838
Those suitable for medicine
will be used,

387
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,199
and the others can be used for bathing.

388
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,320
No waste at all.

389
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:56,279
Our Taozi

390
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,199
really doesn't mind trouble.

391
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,838
Staying here every day

392
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,279
is so boring.

393
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,159
We have to find something to do.

394
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,999
The clothing and accessories
Lord Qin sent before

395
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,639
are really nice.

396
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,959
Lieutenant He,

397
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,959
I think

398
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,039
you look the best dressing

399
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,280
in this style.

400
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,519
You really like me dressing up

401
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,840
as a beautiful lady.

402
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,959
Well Lieutenant He,

403
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,840
you also look heroic
and valiant in the army.

404
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:35,398
But it's not every day

405
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:37,558
you dress up like this.

406
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,759
I still think you look

407
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,199
the most beautiful like this.

408
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,080
Why hasn't Lord Qin come yet?

409
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,279
I guess

410
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,279
he must have been held up

411
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,600
by something.

412
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,280
Maybe

413
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,360
Father has already arrived.

414
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:57,039
Luoyang city really needs to step up.

415
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,800
Every moment it holds
is a moment gained.

416
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,439
If Luoyang falls,

417
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,598
Sun Jing's forces

418
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,039
will quickly turn around and join them,

419
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,240
sandwiching us.

420
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,639
If that happens,

421
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,479
that will be a big problem.

422
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:09,959
Youdao,

423
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,158
let's make a bet.

424
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:11,638
What?

425
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:12,638
Let's bet on how long

426
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:13,759
Luoyang city can hold out.

427
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,040
I'm not betting with you.

428
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,598
I'm afraid Luoyang

429
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,520
may not last long.

430
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:20,560
What a bunch of simple-minded men.

431
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:22,879
We can only hope

432
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,199
that Cui Yi can delay Sun Jing.

433
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,199
Really?

434
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,679
Great General is here?

435
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,999
It may be a guess.

436
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,639
But it's likely the case.

437
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:57,160
Over these years, the Cui Army
has been going on expeditions

438
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,318
in the name of Young Master.

439
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,280
While Father has been staying
in Yingzhou for a long time.

440
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,479
But whenever he makes a move,

441
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,320
he always crushes Sun Jing's army.

442
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,838
Li Ni is a cunning person.

443
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,558
He can't figure out

444
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,358
Father's way of doing things.

445
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,080
So, he won't act recklessly.

446
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,719
What does Lord Qin want to do?

447
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,119
Does he want to go to war
with the Great General?

448
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,398
Engage the enemy's plan,

449
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:20,760
then engage the enemy in battle.

450
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,919
Li Ni's top priority

451
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,838
must be winning Father

452
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,999
to form alliances,

453
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,318
recover Xichang,

454
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,719
and protect the Li family's realm.

455
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,358
Li Ni

456
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,679
sure thinks highly of himself.

457
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,039
Young Lady,

458
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,000
don't say anything to him.

459
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:38,798
When Great General comes,

460
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,118
we must give him a good beating

461
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,439
to vent our frustration.

462
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,040
Don't worry.

463
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,600
I won't say anything to him.

464
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,760
Besides,

465
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,959
do I need to say anything

466
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,479
when Father is a remarkable figure?

467
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,080
Shiqi,

468
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,039
we have the prisoners settled down.

469
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,318
Some wounded soldiers

470
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,600
have also been treated.

471
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,679
This battle

472
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,800
has caused quite
a few casualties to Sun Jing.

473
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,719
Mister Shiqi.

474
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,759
Cui Yi breached Luoyang

475
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,158
through Fengtai Gate around 15 p.m.

476
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,239
There's no news

477
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,919
of Lord Xin, Lord Qi, and His Majesty.

478
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,719
Also,

479
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,719
Cui Yi also sent someone
to deliver a letter.

480
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:29,000
(I'm serving His Majesty,
Lord Xin, and Lord Qi in Luoyang.)

481
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,959
(To demonstrate my sincerity,)

482
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,959
(I hope Your Highness returns
the Cui Army's members.)

483
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,080
(Otherwise,
we'll see each other in battle.)

484
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,159
Truly, like father, like daughter.

485
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,679
They refuse to suffer any losses.

486
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,520
Your Highness,

487
00:27:02,879 --> 00:27:04,199
please have some tea.

488
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,959
Here you go.

489
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,080
Thank you.

490
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,520
You're still wearing the bracer?

491
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,679
Yes.

492
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,878
It took some effort
to remove the silver needle.

493
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:25,398
After that,

494
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:26,399
I never took it off again.

495
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:32,000
You even have one bracer only.

496
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,280
Your Highness,
why put yourself in such a state?

497
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,959
If someone is willing
to give me another one,

498
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,679
I'd be more than happy to accept it.

499
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,800
Despire your busy military affairs,

500
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,879
you came here.

501
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:46,159
I'm sure my father

502
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,000
has shown you his sincerity.

503
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,358
Before this,

504
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,318
I was curious

505
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,840
about your father's personality.

506
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,199
As expected, he's just like I imagined.

507
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,398
Both of you

508
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:01,360
are practically identical.

509
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,479
You're indeed his daughter,

510
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,679
and he's indeed your father.

511
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,840
How so?

512
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,999
Your father

513
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,240
captured Luoyang

514
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,600
without much effort.

515
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:17,080
My father and my two older brothers

516
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,800
have all been captured by your father.

517
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:25,199
Father is generous and hospitable.

518
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,679
I'm sure His Majesty

519
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,399
will appreciate him greatly.

520
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,719
So, tell me.

521
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,318
You have such a charming look.

522
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,039
Do you resemble your father more

523
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,719
or do you take after your mother?

524
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,439
I hope you don't think

525
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,838
your sweet talk

526
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,919
will make me forget

527
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,080
the grudge of being imprisoned by you.

528
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,280
Your father is so welcoming.

529
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,040
I dare not make you stay anymore.

530
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,280
It's just that...

531
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,560
It's just that

532
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,719
who knows when and where it will be

533
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,159
the next time we meet.

534
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,280
When do you plan

535
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,320
to let me go?

536
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,800
The Great General Cui wrote
a letter stating,

537
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:19,479
he wants to see you tomorrow.

538
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,840
How could I not comply?

539
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,439
Tomorrow?

540
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,080
Tomorrow

541
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,760
is really too soon, isn't it?

542
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:04,360
Give it a blow.

543
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,600
You really made it?

544
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,320
Can you really hear it?

545
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,798
From now on, as long as you blow it,

546
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,679
I will immediately come to you.

547
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:42,320
Here I am.

548
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,280
What...

549
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,080
What's the matter?

550
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,600
Don't you like it?

551
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,600
I like it very much.

552
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,879
I just want to have some pig's ear.

553
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,520
I'll go and buy some for you.

554
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,358
Don't be sad.

555
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,600
I'll be back soon.

556
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:23,878
What's wrong?

557
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:25,080
What happened?

558
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:27,679
I'm leaving tomorrow.

559
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,638
Are you really going

560
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:30,439
to go and buy pig's ears now?

561
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:33,520
But...

562
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,879
you said you wanted to have some.

563
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,199
You

564
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:43,399
really are hopelessly silly.

565
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:06,679
I'm right here.

566
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,040
Shiqi,

567
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,279
didn't you say

568
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,759
heavy troops

569
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,360
and many scouts are guarding
around here?

570
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,159
Yes.

571
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:42,999
So,

572
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,280
if we quietly slip out from here,

573
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,199
will anyone notice?

574
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,600
We can try.

575
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,080
Come.

576
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,719
Let's see who reaches the stable first.

577
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:06,600
Sure.

I wonder who's considered

the winner in this case.

596
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,999
Then we can compete again

597
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,919

Looking at the capital from Wonderland

607
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,779
is indeed beautiful.

608
00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:02,619
You see,

609
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,540
I've always been curious

610
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:08,100
about how you discovered my identity.

611
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:10,858
The demeanor of the Young Lady
from the Cui family

612
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,859
is naturally not an ordinary person
can understand.

613
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:15,659
No one has ever suspected

614
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,418
my identity and my relationship

615
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:18,819
with Young Master before.

616
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,538
Why were you

617
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:20,940
able to see it through?

618
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:23,339
When you lied to me claiming

619
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,099
to be Mister Cui's concubine,

620
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,100
I started to be suspicious
of your identity.

621
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,779
So I held a feast

622
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,018
to test Mister Cui,

623
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:31,378
which only confirmed

624
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,140
that your identity was not simple.

625
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,299
You and your young master
appeared to be master and servant.

626
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,259
But in reality,

627
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,938
he treated you with even more respect.

628
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:40,418
Also, before the incident in Luoyang,

629
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:44,100
I witnessed you stepping in
for your young master in battle.

630
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,739
I knew

631
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,538
you would be suspicious

632
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:48,819
after removing my mask.

633
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,659
But at that time,

634
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,699
I was merely standing in
for Young Master in battle.

635
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,538
How could you be sure

636
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:55,219
that I was Father's daughter?

637
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,458
When you were at Tong Pass,

638
00:35:56,459 --> 00:35:57,418
you risked yourself

639
00:35:57,419 --> 00:35:58,619
to save the Great General Cui.

640
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,179
It may seem flawless to others.

641
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,219
But after pondering,

642
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,859
something seemed to be amiss.

643
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:07,339
Finally, I guessed it.

644
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,819
So, you knew it all along.

645
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,819
You know what?

646
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:18,620
I often wonder

647
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:21,418
if you were not the daughter
of the Cui family

648
00:36:21,419 --> 00:36:23,219
and I were not of the Li family,

649
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:25,299
would there

650
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,540
be this many conflicts and setbacks
between us?

651
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,500
Shiqi,

652
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,940
identities are predetermined.

653
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,500
There's nothing

654
00:36:38,419 --> 00:36:39,859
we can do about it.

655
00:36:40,939 --> 00:36:41,980
You're right.

656
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,620
When the chaos broke out initially,

657
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,858
I thought this turbulent world

658
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,500
was beyond salvation.

659
00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:50,938
I couldn't bear
to see the people's suffering

660
00:36:50,939 --> 00:36:52,699
because of the chaos.

661
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:54,538
So, I asked Father

662
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:55,858
to let me and Young Master

663
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,940
lead the Cui Army southward.

664
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,378
At that time,

665
00:36:59,379 --> 00:37:00,259
it was merely

666
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,379
to quickly restore peace to the world.

667
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,259
But unexpectedly,

668
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,500
the Li family

669
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,620
had someone like you.

670
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,020
When we first met,

671
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,540
did I cause you a lot of trouble?

672
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,540
Well, I did the same too.

673
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,859
Shiqi,

674
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:28,140
has it occurred to you

675
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,140
that if one day

676
00:37:30,419 --> 00:37:32,460
we can restore Xichang

677
00:37:32,979 --> 00:37:35,259
and peace to the world,

678
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:36,538
then

679
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:39,020
what kind of ruler
does the world need?

680
00:37:39,939 --> 00:37:41,819
Your father is aging.

681
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:44,379
Lord Xin and Lord Qi

682
00:37:44,459 --> 00:37:46,060
are not good rulers.

683
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:48,140
We still have
the imperial great grandson.

684
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,259
I want to find him back

685
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,898
and persuade Father

686
00:37:51,899 --> 00:37:53,659
to appoint him as the Crown Prince.

687
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,980
He possesses outstanding intelligence

688
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:56,739
with excellent mentors.

689
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,580
In the future,

690
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:01,940
he'll surely become a good ruler.

691
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,819
What if you can't find
the imperial great grandson

692
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,540
or if your father

693
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,458
is unwilling

694
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:09,259
to appoint him as the Crown Prince?

695
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,899
Let's elope.

696
00:38:18,419 --> 00:38:19,739
When the world is at peace

697
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,259
and the imperial great grandson
is found,

698
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:23,940
we'll leave Xichang

699
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,660
and live freely in Laolan Pass.

700
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,899
What do you think?

701
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,100
Even though I know it's not real,

702
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:42,739
hearing you say it

703
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:45,100
makes me happy.

704
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,940
That day, we agreed

705
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:06,020
to wander Wonderland

706
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:08,219
when the world is peaceful.

707
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,620
Unfortunately,

708
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:12,620
the world is still in chaos.

709
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,299
Tomorrow,

710
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,420
we'll go our separate ways.

711
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:25,980
That day will come.

712
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,699
When it comes,

713
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,339
we'll visit Wonderland first.

714
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,100
Then go to Laolan Pass.

715
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,980
We'll ride horses together

716
00:39:36,419 --> 00:39:38,060
and enjoy the sight of wonder.

717
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,339
All right?

718
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:42,940
All right.

719
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:14,779
We'll part ways tomorrow.

720
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,460
Who knows when we'll meet again?

721
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,660
That day,

722
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:22,379
I took away what you loved.

723
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,739
Today,

724
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,460
it has returned to its rightful owner.

725
00:41:13,379 --> 00:41:14,219
Ying,

726
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,898
did you and your young master

727
00:41:15,899 --> 00:41:17,699
really grow up together?

728
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:20,378
I can see you're particularly concerned

729
00:41:20,379 --> 00:41:21,418
about this matter.

730
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:22,420
Of course.

731
00:41:22,499 --> 00:41:23,819
The first time I met you two,

732
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,139
you were so close.

733
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,460
It made me uncomfortable.

734
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,779
Why do you still want to ask?

735
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,020
Young Master

736
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,779
is probably no longer in this world.

737
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:39,339
I just wanted

738
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,580
to hear you explain it to me.

739
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,538
Then I won't have suspicions.

740
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:43,339
After this,

741
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,779
I promise not to ask again.

742
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,659
Young Master's real name

743
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,179
is Liu Chengfeng.

744
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,660
He saved my life when we were young.

745
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,500
His parents died early.

746
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,018
So,

747
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:59,179
Father adopted him as his son.

748
00:41:59,979 --> 00:42:01,259
My mother was injured

749
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,000
when she was young
and it affected her health.

750
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,179
That's why after ten years
of being married to my father,

751
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,540
she hadn't had any children.

752
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,940
But at that time,

753
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,699
Father was already a frontier general.

754
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,819
To control Father, the imperial court

755
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,219
insisted on granting him another wife

756
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,259
with the excuse of not having any sons.

757
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:17,819
Later, my mother was determined

758
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,779
and sought medical advice everywhere.

759
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:21,500
Finally, I was born.

760
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,259
Unfortunately,

761
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,938
it still couldn't satisfy
the imperial court.

762
00:42:24,939 --> 00:42:26,339
So, Father lied and claimed

763
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,819
that he had a son,

764
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,420
named Cui Lin, following the Cui family's
naming tradition,

765
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:33,179
and reported it to the imperial court.

766
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,859
I see.

767
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,140
After that,

768
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:44,140
Father fought against Jieshuo
in Yingzhou,

769
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,219
and Mother fought bravely
and died in the city.

770
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,819
The imperial court honored Mother
as Heroic Lady.

771
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:53,259
Father cherishes the love
he had with Mother.

772
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,660
So, he never remarries.

773
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:56,339
After that, Father

774
00:42:56,379 --> 00:42:58,739
raised me up as a boy.

775
00:42:58,979 --> 00:43:01,060
But when I turn seven,

776
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,418
I can no longer hide

777
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:03,859
the feminine side of me.

778
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:06,058
So, Father let Liu Chengfeng

779
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:07,739
take on my name, Cui Lin,

780
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,458
in the military camp

781
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:10,779
to prevent my identity as a girl

782
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,859
from being exposed.

783
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,699
Since young,

784
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,938
Young Master faced many dangers

785
00:43:15,939 --> 00:43:17,699
because of me.

786
00:43:18,859 --> 00:43:20,379
Even his name

787
00:43:20,419 --> 00:43:22,100
remained unknown to others.

788
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:24,699
So, he became

789
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,500
a living shadow for me.

790
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,100
We grew up together.

791
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,739
I considered him as an older brother.

792
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,578
Naturally, we were closer

793
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:33,859
than others.

794
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,018
You considered him as an older brother.

795
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:38,819
But he didn't see it that way.

796
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:41,819
He's no longer with us.

797
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,660
Why do you still mind it so much?

798
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,099
Why does it always have to be about me?

799
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,379
What about you?

800
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:51,940
What about me?

801
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:53,699
Prime Minister Gu's daughter

802
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,858
likes you very much.

803
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:56,339
When we were in Xichang,

804
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,280
she even risked danger to come to the inn
and deliver a message to you.

805
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,100
Aren't you going
to reciprocate her feelings?

806
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:04,420
What Miss Gu feels about me
and me about her,

807
00:44:04,899 --> 00:44:06,060
are not the same.

808
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:07,898
She's interested in me.

809
00:44:07,899 --> 00:44:09,339
But I'm not interested in her.

810
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,980
So, I can only disappoint her.

811
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,219
Sharing a drink and song

812
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,420
as we ponder about life.

813
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,940
Shiqi,

814
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:33,940
can you sing a song for me?

815
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:36,139
I can't sing.

816
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,339
I can only hum a bit

817
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,538
of the Laolan Pass tune.

818
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:40,179
The Laolan Pass tune is fine too.

819
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,219
I want to hear it.

820
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,619
These rural folk songs

821
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,378
can't be compared
to the elegance of literature.

822
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:47,580
They are a bit rough.

823
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,938
So, please bear with me.

824
00:44:49,939 --> 00:44:51,259
I don't mind.

825
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,140
