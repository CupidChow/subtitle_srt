Sorry for keeping you wait.

31
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,270
Greetings, Lord Han.

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,830
I'm the envoy of Grand Governor.

33
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,320
How dare you stop me?

34
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,190
(Cui)

35
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,620
Do you know
that befriending Cui Yi privately

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,960
without informing Grand Governor
is a crime?

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,710
Please don't be mad.

38
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,520
I was planning to invite you here

39
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,870
to discuss together.

40
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,960
I didn't expect you to arrive so quickly.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,590
You're from Cui Army?

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,640
Why did General Cui send you here?

43
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,640
Lord Han.

44
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,430
Lieutenant He from Cui Army

45
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,640
is in your residence.

46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,710
Please ask her out to meet me.

47
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,750
Lieutenant He from Cui Army

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,640
is in my residence?

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,750
There's no such thing.

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,590
Cui Army is right outside of Bingzhou.

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,990
If you insist on not releasing her,

52
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,710
don't blame us
for entering the city to look for her.

53
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,150
Lord Han.

54
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,310
This is your fault.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,920
Zhenxi Rebel is right at our doorstep.

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,360
Not only you're
not working with Cui Army,

57
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,430
you're detaining

58
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,800
someone from Cui Army.

59
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,360
You're oppressing our ally.

60
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,920
I must report it to Grand Governor.

61
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,400
Listen to yourself.

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,960
Nothing as such

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,150
happened here.

64
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,240
We haven't even seen

65
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,430
Lieutenant He you mentioned.

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,080
You can fool Cui Army,

67
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,920
but you can't fool me.

68
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,220
The guest room
in the backyard is heavily guarded.

69
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,750
Even Golden Guards
aren't allowed to get close.

70
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,590
People from Cui Army

71
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,480
must have been imprisoned there.

72
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,480
Let's go.

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,680
I'll take you to see Lieutenant He.

74
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,520
Thank you.

75
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,710
No need.

76
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,640
I'll ask

77
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,990
Young Master Cui
and Lieutenant He out.

78
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,310
Let's go.

79
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,800
Young Master.

80
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,190
How are you?

81
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,190
Can you hold on?

82
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,600
Young Master.

83
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,990
Why are you doing this?

84
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,190
We only want to invite you to a banquet.

85
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,800
If you see our guest,

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,160
you'll surely be happy.

87
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,140
Lead the way.

88
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,190
Master, Young Master Cui is here.

89
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,870
You really do
pamper the beauty, Young Master.

90
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,480
It's a feast today.

91
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,360
I'm so fortunate.

92
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,920
Young Master Cui,

93
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,950
this is the envoy

94
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,720
sent by Grand Governor.

95
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,390
I've long heard
that Young Master Cui is charming.

96
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,600
Now that I see you,

97
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,160
your reputation is well-deserved.

98
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,920
Greetings, Young Master.

99
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,990
Over ten thousand people
from Cui Army

100
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,190
are standing by outside Bingzhou,

101
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,920
waiting for your command.

102
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,410
Lord Han is detaining me
and not letting me leave.

103
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,550
Here.

104
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,600
Tell the leader

105
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,070
that they can march in,

106
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,160
so everyone knows

107
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,920
how great Cui Army is.

108
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,070
You've misunderstood, Young Master Cui.

109
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,040
Outside of the city is crude.

110
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,070
It's not

111
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,550
as comfortable as my mansion.

112
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,480
I just wanted to

113
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,720
make you stay

114
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,240
for a few days more.

115
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,120
Don't worry, Young Master Cui.

116
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,480
If Grand Governor knows

117
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,310
that you're a guest in Bingzhou,

118
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,800
he'll surely have Lord Han

119
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,160
send people
to escort you into the capital.

120
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,310
Xichang is a prosperous place.

121
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,510
You'll like it so much
that you don't want to leave.

122
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,940
Still hurt?

123
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,510
I'm inviting you to the capital
on behalf of Grand Governor.

124
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,600
You're so impolite.

125
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,410
Are you looking down
upon our Grand Governor?

126
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,360
Calm down.

127
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,630
Calm down.

128
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,600
Young Master Cui cares for the beauty.

129
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,480
It's the temperament of a young man.

130
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,310
I'm the envoy of Grand Governor,

131
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,390
equivalent to Grand Governor
on an inspection tour.

132
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,160
You're so arrogant.

133
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,800
You want to rebel?

134
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,950
Don't be angry.

135
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,870
You have no idea.

136
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,040
Lady He

137
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,600
is the lover of Young Master Cui.

138
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,800
In that case,

139
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,360
let's have Lady He
perform a dance in the capital

140
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,430
to celebrate Grand Governor's birthday.

141
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,390
What do you mean by that?

142
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,480
Are you insulting Cui Army?

143
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,510
Her foot is injured.

144
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,430
She can't dance.

145
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,990
Why don't I perform a sword dance

146
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
for Grand Governor

147
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,080
in her place?

148
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,750
Great idea.

149
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,360
I didn't expect

150
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,270
to be so fortunate today.

151
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,870
Listen up.

152
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,270
Prepare a sword.

153
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:47,960
No need.

154
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,910
I shall borrow your sword.

155
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,630
You have no idea.

156
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,390
My sword

157
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,240
is a gentleman's sword.

158
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,240
It has never been used.

159
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,720
It's okay.

160
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,320
I'm just using it for a performance,

161
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,720
not for killing.

162
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,270
You're humorous.

163
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,270
Young Master is performing in my place.

164
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,870
I shall play the zither and sing

165
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,320
as accompaniment.

166
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,750
The beauty does live up to

167
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,600
the kindness of Young Master Cui.

168
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,630

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,240
If this time

191
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,960
you fall into the hands
of Grand Governor,

192
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,990
I'm afraid it'll
be hard for you to escape.

193
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
I only hope that
your army outside of the city

194
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,840
can scare the envoy.

195
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,030
I understand Lord Han's good intention.

196
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,480
But your master

197
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,600
is very cunning.

198
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,320
He's unwilling to take action,

199
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,320
and instead
he passes this problem to us.

200
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,480
You're kidding.

201
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,840
After I kill Sun Jing's envoy,

202
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,390
will you just let us go?

203
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,270
If I made a false promise
on behalf of Lord Han,

204
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,840
I would be deceiving you.

205
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,870
But if you kill the envoy,

206
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,080
Lady He can go back.

207
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,360
As for you,

208
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,150
please stay for a few more days.

209
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,390
After Cui Army

210
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,960
retreats for 60 miles,

211
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,670
you shall be allowed to return.

212
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,750
Lord Han.

213
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,700
Although the banquet is nice,
there'll still be an end.

214
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,480
Should you stick to your promise

215
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,270
and let her go?

216
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,390
Of course.

217
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,440
Be sure

218
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,840
to have a physician
look at your wound closely.

219
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,190
Don't leave a chronic pain.

220
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,560
Let's go. I'll see you off.

221
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,080
Here, be careful.

222
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,030
For your luck.

223
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,750
Look at my awesome head.

224
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,560
If it's gone,

225
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,480
I wonder

226
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,630
if anyone will cry for me.

227
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,560
I won't.

228
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,030
Charge!

229
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,240
Ying.

230
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,380
Young Master.

231
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,110
- What's wrong with your foot?
- It's fine.

232
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,440
It's just a minor injury.

233
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,480
No big deal.

234
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,300
Where's your hairpin?

235
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,430
It was chaotic just now,
I lost it accidentally.

236
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,320
I didn't look for it.

237
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,630
What a shame.

238
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,960
It's your favourite thing

239
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,840
growing up.

240
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,320
But it's okay.

241
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,840
I'll order you a new one.

242
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,910
It's okay, Young Master. Forget it.

243
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,910
Are you tired?

244
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,320
Let's go back and rest.

245
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,390
I ordered someone to cook a table

246
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,670
full of your favourite food.

247
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,320
Let's go.

248
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,710
Where is Lieutenant He's hairpin?

249
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,320
How would I know?

250
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,220
When I arrived,

251
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,790
Lieutenant's hairpin was already gone.

252
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,840
You're lying.

253
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,240
That hairpin is gifted to Lieutenant He

254
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,030
by her mother.

255
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,280
Even if she died,

256
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,910
she wouldn't lose the hairpin.

257
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,270
Are you hiding something
with Lieutenant He?

258
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,390
No. It's really missing.

259
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,560
She's very upset.

260
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,840
I stopped her

261
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,150
from looking for it.

262
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,080
It was too dangerous.

263
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,520
I don't trust you.

264
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:25,241
(Palace of Xichang)

265
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,080
Look.

266
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,390
How beautiful.

267
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,840
Can I fly it higher?

268
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,870
You can.

269
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,040
You can.

270
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,120
Madam, you're amazing.

271
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,840
Will it fall?

272
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,630
Higher.

273
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,600
No.

274
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,670
Higher. It won't fall.

275
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,120
Look. It's so high and far.

276
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,600
It's so high, Madam.

277
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,320
Fly it.

278
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,040
It's raising.

279
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,670
Will it fall?

280
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,080
No.

281
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,510
- So beautiful.
- So high.

282
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,910
It's raising. So high.

283
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,630
Madam, you're amazing.

284
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,190
Yes.

285
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,390
Whose kite is that?

286
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,560
Indeed.

287
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:11,910
What?

288
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,670
- It doesn't move.
- Be careful, Madam.

289
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,230
This...

290
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,840
Let's go.

291
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,430
It's you.

292
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,080
I didn't expect

293
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,410
(First wife of Sun Jing, Madam of Wei)
you to still have the mood.

294
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,390
(First wife of Sun Jing, Madam of Wei)

295
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,560
However,

296
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
your kite and my kite

297
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,600
are entangled.

298
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,910
Cut it off.

299
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,950
Since you said so,

300
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,710
then cut it off.

301
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,840
Yes.

302
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,040
What are you doing?

303
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,760
My kite

304
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,320
is gifted by Grand Governor.

305
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,630
It can't be lost.

306
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,910
Therefore,

307
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,190
we can only cut the line

308
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,670
of your kite.

309
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,870
Please forgive me, Madam of Wei.

310
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,800
You...

311
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,530
Let's go!

312
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,470
Consort Xiao is so rude.

313
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,430
Does she think

314
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,630
she's still Crown Princess?

315
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,520
She didn't even greet you.

316
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,870
You're the first wife
of Grand Governor.

317
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,470
Consort Xiao is relying on
her past relationship with Master.

318
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,800
Right now Master

319
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,520
is sympathizing her.

320
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,080
Such a capricious

321
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,630
and fickle woman.

322
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,710
I don't want to think like her.

323
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,430
Your Highness.

324
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,870
Madam of Wei is
the first wife of Grand Governor.

325
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,710
You're in an awkward situation now.

326
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
Why did you make her angry

327
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,430
because of such a small matter?

328
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,950
If I want to send
the pregnant Jiang

329
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,430
out of the palace,

330
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,320
I have to do it through

331
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,560
Madam of Wei.

332
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
Even a dull knife with a chipped edge,

333
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,520
when it's used right,

334
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,560
can cut open

335
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,190
the tightest cage.

336
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,560
Lieutenant He.

337
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,190
Let me have a look at

338
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,080
how your wound is.

339
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,430
No big deal.

340
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,470
I've applied medicine

341
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,630
and bandaged it.

342
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,800
Alright.

343
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,760
But in the coming days,

344
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,320
we have to keep applying medicine.

345
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,150
Or else,

346
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,470
it may cause chronic pain.

347
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,280
Okay, I'll listen to you.

348
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,600
By the way, Taozi,

349
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,910
this time

350
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,150
I met Imperial Grandson, Li Ni.

351
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,190
He was the one who you wanted to

352
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,080
shoot in the cottage.

353
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,760
It's him?

354
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,360
Didn't you tell me that

355
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,040
Li Ni

356
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,710
is the guise of Zhenxi Army

357
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,150
and surely is a useless idiot?

358
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,710
I was wrong.

359
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,910
This person is capable

360
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,040
and very intelligent.

361
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,470
Instead, we shouldn't

362
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,910
take him lightly.

363
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,120
I didn't expect

364
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,470
Li family

365
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,950
to have such an outstanding offspring.

366
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,560
I haven't heard about him.

367
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,870
So what if he's great?

368
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,040
Is he as smart and capable
as our lieutenant?

369
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,390
Sweet-talker.

370
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,670
When I wasn't around,

371
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,710
what did you eat?

372
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,800
They cooked me pork shoulder.

373
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,870
I didn't expect

374
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,840
Young Master Cui

375
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,630
to be a sentimental person.

376
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,040
He saw Lady He left.

377
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,320
Tender melancholy.

378
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,710
Deplorable and sad.

379
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,910
A young hero

380
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,470
is always sentimental.

381
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,470
Master.

382
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,910
Master.

383
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,460
A letter from outside of the city.

384
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,120
Young Master Cui wrote it to you.

385
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,000
Young Master Cui?

386
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,320
Isn't Young Master Cui in the residence?

387
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:57,870
Leave.

388
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,320
Yes, Master.

389
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,080
Young Master, Lieutenant He is here.

390
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:16,870
Ying.

391
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,080
I said I'll go to your tent,

392
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,320
so you don't have to walk around
with your injury.

393
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:21,950
Be careful.

394
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,670
It's okay.

395
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,710
Just a minor injury.

396
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,120
Since we're in the military camp,

397
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,210
it's better for me to come
to your tent to discuss.

398
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:27,950
Follow the rules.

399
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,000
Fortunately,

400
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,560
you're back safely.

401
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,520
By the way,

402
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,320
what do you think
about the current situation?

403
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,360
Although Zhenxi Army

404
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,670
took down Wangzhou,

405
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,670
without Bingzhou and Jianzhou,

406
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
they can't

407
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,320
move a step closer to Tong Pass.

408
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,910
As for Xichang,

409
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,390
it's even more out of reach.

410
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,630
You're right.

411
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,630
I think so too.

412
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,190
I think since we have the military power,

413
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,430
why don't we attack Bingzhou?

414
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,430
When we have Bingzhou and Jianzhou,

415
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,320
it doesn't matter if it's Sun Jing or Li Ni,

416
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,120
they'll have to act
according to Cui Army.

417
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,320
Young Master.

418
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,670
This time

419
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,840
I actually met Li Ni.

420
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,000
This person

421
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,870
can't be taken lightly.

422
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,430
He's a rare opponent.

423
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,870
We're the one
who should be on guard instead.

424
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,910
What kind of person is he?

425
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,950
That he made you say such things.

426
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,430
This person

427
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,390
is great,

428
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,910
but it's not that

429
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,120
we have no way

430
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,630
to take down Bingzhou.

431
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,250
We need a perfect strategy.

432
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,600
What good way do you have

433
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,950
to take down Bingzhou?

434
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,870
Isn't General Pei Yuan

435
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,150
in Wangzhou?

436
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,430
Why don't we

437
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,910
reminisce with him first?

438
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,280
But we rarely have contact
with Zhenxi Army.

439
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,150
On the contrary, we argued
because of military rations.

440
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,320
I'm afraid

441
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,320
they won't form allies
with us so easily.

442
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,470
Even if we do,

443
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,620
I'm afraid
they'll have different intentions.

444
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,430
Don't worry.

445
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,710
I have a way

446
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,390
for them to agree to form allies.

447
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,360
I also have a way

448
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,000
to avoid different intentions.

449
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,510
(The one in your residence is not me.)
I'm so angry.

450
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Cui family has crossed the line.

451
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,040
What happened, Master?

452
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,800
Go!

453
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,280
Go get the fake Young Master Cui

454
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,870
imprisoned right now.

455
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,360
Yes, Master.

456
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,040
No. Kill him immediately!

457
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,600
Take him.

458
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,910
What else do you want to say?

459
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,560
Lord Han.

460
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,800
I'll be honest.

461
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,040
I'm Young Master Cui's study partner.

462
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,950
I got his order to come here

463
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,600
and discuss something important with you.

464
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,520
Unexpectedly,

465
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,710
you mistook me as Young Master Cui.

466
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,940
Under the instruction of Lieutenant He,

467
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,710
I took advantage of the mistake.

468
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,080
But I didn't intent

469
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,670
to lie to you.

470
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,950
I went through
fire and water for Cui family.

471
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,390
But I didn't expect them

472
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,840
to betray me today,

473
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,800
let alone being abandoned.

474
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,150
Since you know that you're abandoned,

475
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,430
what other use do you have?

476
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:13,950
Lord Han.

477
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,100
Since Cui family is unkind to me,

478
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,710
I'll return this injustice.

479
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,280
I have a plan

480
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,800
that can solve your urgency.

481
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,230
I know that Cui Army has robbed

482
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,800
the ration of Zhenxi Army.

483
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,800
Zhenxi Army is desperate of ration.

484
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,600
They hate Cui Army's guts.

485
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,080
Why don't you send someone to Wangzhou

486
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,630
to discuss an ally with Li Ni

487
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,080
to destroy Cui Army?

488
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,910
You'll be rescued

489
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,470
and Zhenxi Army will get their ration.

490
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,430
Master.

491
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,080
He has got his points.

492
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,840
Our spy

493
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,320
has also reported

494
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,630
about the robbed ration.

495
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:00,760
I'm just someone

496
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,190
abandoned by Cui family.

497
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,760
I have nothing.

498
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,360
Only you can give me a chance to live.

499
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,910
Lord Han.

500
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,470
Why don't you have someone
get the opinion of Zhenxi Army?

501
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,470
As for me,

502
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,390
you don't have to

503
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,800
kill me instantly.

504
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,800
If Zhenxi Army doesn't agree,

505
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,470
it's not too late to kill me then.

506
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,000
If this plan works,

507
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,840
I'm willing to follow you

508
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,800
and be at your service.

509
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,080
Take him down

510
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,520
and imprison him.

511
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,070
Come along.

512
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,950
The prisoner is here.

513
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,230
Keep him in this cell.

514
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,115
(Guo Residence)

515
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,760
General Pei Yuan.

516
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,190
Mister Shiqi is found.

517
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,560
Really?

518
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,230
Where is he?

519
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,870
Cui Army reported

520
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,870
that Mister Shiqi

521
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,600
is in Han Li's residence in Bingzhou.

522
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,490
What is he doing there?

523
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,710
I asked, but she didn't want to answer.

524
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,360
She wants to see you
and report the details in person.

525
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,670
See me in person?

526
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,120
Who is that?

527
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,080
She's a very fierce young lady.

528
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,950
She knows how to use poison

529
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,000
and fight.

530
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,600
She's fierce and formidable.

531
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,800
Greetings, General Pei Yuan.

532
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,470
Raise.

533
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,360
Lieutenant He

534
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,120
sent me here to see you.

535
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,150
The whereabouts of Li Ni

536
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,520
is a present

537
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,600
from Cui Army to you.

538
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,630
With this

539
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,000
we would like to show
the sincerity of Cui Army.

540
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,230
Speaking of which,

541
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,120
Li Ni and Lieutenant He

542
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,600
are quite fated.

543
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,950
Awhile ago,

544
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,190
Lieutenant He saved Li Ni
a couple of times.

545
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,150
This time

546
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,800
she also doesn't want to see him dead.

547
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,560
Therefore, Cui Army

548
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,390
is willing to form an ally with you

549
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,000
to rescue Li Ni.

550
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:22,870
Really?

551
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,190
Lieutenant He said

552
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,520
if I say this,

553
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,000
you'll most likely not believe me.

554
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,150
However,

555
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,280
you can send someone

556
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,950
to find it out in Bingzhou.

557
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,560
Then you'll know
if we're speaking the truth.

558
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,800
General Pei Yuan. Gen...

559
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,520
Lieutenant He also said

560
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,280
if I arrive at the right time,

561
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,670
at this point

562
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,280
Han Li from Bingzhou

563
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,760
will also send someone

564
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,600
to discuss an important issue with you.

565
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,910
I wonder

566
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,670
if Han Li sent someone over.

567
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,150
This young lady

568
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,760
is really accurate.

569
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,670
Han Li really sent someone over?

570
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,000
Yes.

571
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,710
See.

572
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,520
Our lieutenant has
taken everything into account.

573
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,040
Mister Shiqi.

574
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,120
We brought many people to save you.

575
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,150
How many?

576
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,430
Six.

577
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:40,800
Go back.

578
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,840
What's wrong?

579
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,190
I don't know what happened,

580
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,710
my stomach isn't feeling well.

581
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,360
My stomach grumbles.

582
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,470
Hurry back.

583
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,230
Okay.

584
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,950
Lieutenant He.

585
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,190
Do you really think

586
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,910
we can work with Zhenxi Army?

587
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,120
The marshal of Zhenxi Army, Li Ni,

588
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,630
is the smartest

589
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,280
and trickiest person I've seen.

590
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,910
Even if you restrain him

591
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,320
with metal chains,

592
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,470
(put him in a box,)

593
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,950
(tie it to a rock
and then sink him into the river.)

594
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,120
(In a blink of an eye,)

595
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,840
(he'll float to the surface)

596
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,710
and with a smile

597
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,040
he'll trick you back.

598
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,360
Of course we can

599
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,280
work with such a smart person.

600
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,230
Why are you so sure

601
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,840
that Li Ni

602
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,760
can persuade Han Li

603
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,150
to send someone to see Pei Yuan?

604
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,520
Li Ni

605
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,150
is an expert

606
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,560
in escaping death.

607
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,150
I'm very sure

608
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,670
that we'll be able to persuade Han Li

609
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,630
and set up a double-trick trap for him.

610
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,950
In that case,

611
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,760
why don't we

612
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,150
take advantage of his trap

613
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,760
to make it our trap?

614
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,360
You're quite capable.

615
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,000
Pei Yuan actually agreed

616
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,280
to work with us

617
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,470
to attack Cui Army from both sides.

618
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
However,

619
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,760
he has one term.

620
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,760
Other than keeping the food supplies
of Cui Army,

621
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,760
he wants to take the passage
via Jianzhou to the south.

622
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,150
To be honest,

623
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,670
if Pei Yuan didn't have any terms,

624
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,760
you shouldn't even believe him.

625
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,390
Since he brought up a condition,

626
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,190
I think

627
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,430
this is most likely going to work.

628
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,800
Tell me more.

629
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,080
You can pretend to agree to his passage.

630
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,080
Jianzhou has a dangerous terrain.

631
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,710
Your garrison can make use of the terrain
to attack with lesser manpower.

632
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,280
When Zhenxi Army is in Xialuo Valley,

633
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,080
by clutching them from front and back,

634
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,430
we can severely damage Zhenxi Army.

635
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,800
First destroy Cui Army,

636
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,710
then severely damage Zhenxi Army.

637
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,320
Then,

638
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,630
even Grand Governor Sun

639
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,840
in the capital

640
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,150
can no longer oppress you.

641
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,280
You've read books on art of war?

642
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,800
I'm the study partner
of Young Master Cui.

643
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,560
The four arts of Chinese scholar,

644
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,000
military leadership and strategy,

645
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,390
I've studied them all.

646
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,870
Very well.

647
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,430
You're a talented person.

648
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,080
I'm flattered, Lord Han.

649
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,670
I'm born in a chaotic world.

650
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,120
I just want to survive.

651
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,120
I'm willing to

652
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,280
be at your service.

653
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,190
I still have to

654
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,280
test your capabilities.

655
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,390
I'm sorry
that you still have to stay in the prison.

656
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,040
In the future,

657
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,560
if I really am able
to damage Zhenxi Army,

658
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,120
I'll release you

659
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,430
and make you my adviser.

660
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,190
Thank you, Lord Han.

661
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,520
Why are you behaving oddly

662
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,910
every time you mention Li Ni?

663
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,520
How odd?

664
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,320
You seem to hate him

665
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,800
very much.

666
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,960
Don't I?

667
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,520
In that case,

668
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,960
why must we save him?

669
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,270
He's such an interesting person.

670
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,270
It'll be a shame if he dies.

671
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,350
That's true.

672
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,600
I've never heard you

673
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,120
describe someone this way.

674
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I've also not heard

675
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,350
you call anyone

676
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,400
as your opponent.

677
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,520
Who's your opponent?

678
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,520
Young Master.

679
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,710
Nothing.

680
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,190
I'm just chatting with Taozi.

681
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,080
Ying.

682
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,120
I have something for you.

683
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,750
The hairpin your mother left you...

684
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,750
I know

685
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,830
you must be sad to have lost it.

686
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,350
Look.

687
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,940
Doesn't it look
very similar to your old one?

688
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,270
It does.

689
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,630
I made it myself.

690
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,230
Let me put it on.

691
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,440
Young Master.

692
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,670
The old hairpin

693
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,190
has a different meaning to me.

694
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,560
Even if they look alike,

695
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,350
I don't want to replace the old one

696
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,630
with another hairpin.

697
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,600
Thank you for your thought.

698
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,630
I'll keep

699
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,600
this hairpin safely.

700
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:28,790
Okay.

701
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,150
Ying.

702
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,670
Don't you think

703
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,440
I have no idea about your plan.

704
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,630
When I'm out,

705
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,830
I'll deal with you about this.

706
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,150
Lord Han told me to visit you.

707
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,520
He's afraid that you'll be upset.

708
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,000
Lord Han is so kind.

709
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,310
Thank you, Mister Lv.

710
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,560
I'm not upset.

711
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,190
I'm abandoned by Cui Army.

712
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,920
Thanks to Lord Han

713
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,150
for sparing my life

714
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,750
and listening to my plans.

715
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,040
I'm more than grateful,

716
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,440
why would I be upset?

717
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:22,830
Okay.

718
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,120
I knew you're an open-minded person.

719
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,710
I brought some good liquor along.

720
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,310
Let's have a drink.

721
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,670
This liquor smells good.

722
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,220
This is a fine liquor of Lord Han,

723
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,350
of course it smells good.

724
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,520
You're right.

725
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
The enemy is attacking.

726
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,820
- Something bad happened.
- The enemy is attacking.

727
00:36:46,968 --> 00:36:49,359
(Zhenxi)

728
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:54,976
(Li)

729
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:58,843
(Cui)

730
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,270
Send my order,

731
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,790
attack!

732
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,270
In this war we're charging in on horseback.

733
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,210
Even more fun
than attacking Wangzhou last time.

734
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,630
Youren, have you ridden a horse before?

735
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,520
When I learned to ride a horse,

736
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,120
you were just a foolish child.

737
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,790
Take down Bingzhou! Charge!

738
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,230
Charge!

739
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,031
(Zhenxi)

740
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,230
I'll send someone to find out.

741
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:34,830
Hurry.

742
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,400
Yes.

743
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:42,830
Here.

744
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,040
Let's drink this up.

745
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,310
Sorry for the past.

746
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,270
In the future,

747
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,960
please share your guidance.

748
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,600
Here.

749
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,120
Good liquor.

750
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,830
Young man.

751
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,750
We've known each other for awhile.

752
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,520
It feels like we've
known each other all along.

753
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,270
But I don't know

754
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,080
what your name is

755
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,310
and where you're from.

756
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,400
How did you become

757
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,120
