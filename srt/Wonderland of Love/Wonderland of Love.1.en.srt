Let me add more water for you.

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,599
Don't fight for the food.

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,759
It's enough for everyone.

39
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,879
We have food for everyone.

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,599

but you didn't even keep one for me.

45
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:33,240
Just eat it if you want.

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,820

Stop blabbering.

You.

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,319
Don't shut me up
with a piece of flatbread.

50
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,360
Just now, Du was grumbling
in the kitchen

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,319
about how he lost

52
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,759
a bag of high-quality wheat flour.

53
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Someone delivered it from afar

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,599
to make snacks
for Seventeenth Imperial Grandson.

55
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,559
How dare you steal it?

56
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,279
Don't simply accuse me.

57
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,920
I just went in and grabbed
a handful of flour

58
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,279
when there was no one in the kitchen.

59
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,650
Stealing a bag of flour is stealing.

60
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,279
Grabbing a handful of flour
is stealing too.

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,640
Stealing the military rations
is a serious crime, you know.

62
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,319
I just took something from Mister Shiqi.
[*Shiqi=Seventeenth]

63
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,719
He told me

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,640
not to treat him
as an imperial grandson.

65
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,159
He said that we would go through

66
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:11,400
thick and thin together.

67
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,319
And that he would eat

68
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,479
whatever we ate.

69
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,559
Right?

70
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,240
- Yes!
- Yes!

71
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,680
That's right.

72

73
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,439

Ready!

78
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:19,820
We are the Garrison of the West.

79
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,530
It's General Pei Xian.

80
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,820
We are not the Qing Army.

81
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,970
We are not the enemy.

82
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,730
We are the Garrison of the West.

83
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,080
(Zhenxi)

84
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,260
Greetings, Your Highness.

85
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,210
Uncle Pei.

86
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,650
Three days ago, Wanxi received
an urgent announcement from Hejian Prefecture.

87
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,240
On His Majesty's

88
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,140
(Great General)
sixtieth birthday on the sixth of June,

89
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,460
(of the Zhenxi Army, Pei Xian)
he was assassinated by Sun Jing.

90
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,460
His Majesty has passed away.

91
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,240
They instigated rebellion
within the Imperial Army,

92
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,950
locked the palace and
massacred everyone in the city.

93
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,580
Crown Prince
died fighting for the nation.

94
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,850
All the lords, princes and
imperial grandchildren are dead.

95
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,340
Many princesses and consorts
are either dead or injured.

96
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,900
General Yunchang, Han Chang,
protected Great Imperial Grandson

97
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,700
and killed his way

98
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,770
out of the capital.

99
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,530
They were separated
by the rebels outside of the city.

100
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,730
It's uncertain whether
they are still alive or not.

101
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,090
What about my father?

102
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,260
Lord Liang didn't enter the palace
because he was sick.

103
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,380
And it saved him.

104
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,060
But he's held hostage
by the enemies now.

105
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,090
Your Highness.

106
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,940
All of the lords are dead.

107
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,850
Lord Liang is the only surviving lord.

108
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,970
Zhenxi Prefecture and I
have come to an agreement

109
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,020
to serve Lord Liang as the emperor

110
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,290
and you as the crown prince

111
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,340
so that we can gather our troops
to fight for the throne.

112
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,260
Please allow us to do that.

113
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,500
General Pei.

114
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,060
I can't allow you to do that.

115
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,210
Your Highness.

116
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,410
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

117
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,160
Great Imperial Grandson
has gone missing.

118
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,970
But he may still be alive.

119
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,120
With the passing of Emperor
and Crown Prince,

120
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,900
the next should be
Great Imperial Grandson.

121
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,290
Even if he's alive now,

122
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,820
he's just a boy
who's around seven years old.

123
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,060
He is just Crown Prince's first son.

124
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,530
He's not appointed as the next in line.

125
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,340
Our enemies are everywhere now.

126
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,820
Our nation is in a grave situation
right now.

127
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,730
How can we let a child

128
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,900
be the head of our nation?

129
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,140
General Pei.

130
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,770
Great Imperial Grandson
is born a genius.

131
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,410
It's only right

132
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,140
for the first son
to inherit his father's title.

133
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,290
Moreover,

134
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,380
Sun Jing has my father.

135
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,850
If you want me to take over
the ruling,

136
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,730
you'll put my father in danger.

137
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,530
Your Highness!

138
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,410
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

139
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,940
(Zhenxi)
(Seventeenth Imperial Grandson, Li Ni,)

140
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,970
(leads the Zhenxi Army)

141
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,500
(from the south of Laolan Pass
all the way)

142
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,730
(to the capital city, Xichang,
to put down the rebellion)

143
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,460
(in the hope of rescuing Lord Liang)

144
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,530
(and restoring the glory
of the Dayu Dynasty.)

145
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,610
(Meanwhile,)

146
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,460
(General Pingliang, Cui Yi,)

147
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,850
(sends his only son, Cui Lin,)

148
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,210
(to travel to Yingzhou with the Cui Army)

149
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,770
(to take down Xichang,)

150
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,410
(kill Sun Jing, and become
the ruler of the nation.)

151
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,700
(Both armies will cross paths.)

152
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,900
(Who will turn out to be the winner)

153
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,380
(and restore peace to the nation?)

154
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,340
=Episode 1=

155
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,270
(Zhilu Hall)

156
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,690
(Musician of Zhilu Hall, Yue)

157
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,810
I'm sure that even
your father can't recognise you.

158
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,580
Are you sure?

159
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,140
(General of the Zhenxi Army,
Pei Yuan)

160
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,500
As expected from Mister Shiqi

161
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,850
who was once the best scout

162
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,890
at Laolan Pass.

163
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,370
And now you personally
come all the way here

164
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,130
to catch Mister Pi Si.

165
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,130
Pei Yuan.

166
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,780
It's so annoying to be a marshal.

167
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,180
I'm here to arrest someone.

168
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,210
But your father is acting

169
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:41,850
as if I'm going

170
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,090
to be kidnapped.

171
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,580
You are the marshal
of the entire army now.

172
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,180
My father is just worried
about your safety.

173
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,010
Yes.

174
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,180
I just want to attack
the capital city now

175
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,730
and kill that rebel, Sun Jing.

176
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,010
Then, I'll rescue my father,
find Great Imperial Grandson

177
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,460
and restore the glory
of the Dayu Dynasty.

178
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,700
Okay.

179
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,250
What then?

180
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,370
Then, I'll go back to Laolan Pass

181
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,700
and be as free as a bird.

182
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,730
When there's no battle,

183
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,560
it's great to go and hunt for
the Mongolian gazelle.

184
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,610
I knew it.

185
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,370
You just want to go back to Laolan Pass.

186
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,370
Laolan Pass is an amazing place.

187
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,460
Isn't Bao's barbecued gazelle meat
scrumptious?

188
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,940
Aren't you getting hungry

189
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,090
just by thinking about it?

190
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,010
Yes.

191
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,540
I'm famished.

192
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,820
Mister Shiqi.

193
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,370
The entire army is starving now.

194
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,660
Even our injured

195
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,300
can only eat twice a day now.

196
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,610
If we continue to be without food,

197
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,820
our army will be starved to death

198
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,540
before we can attack Xichang.

199
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,250
That's why we have to

200
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,970
capture Mister Pi Si today

201
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,850
at all costs.

202
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,490
We need to steal the supplies

203
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,010
that he's transporting to Sun Jing.

204
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,370
Lieutenant He.

205
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,340
Everything is ready.

206
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,070
Just wait for Mister Pi Si
to fall into our trap.

207
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,040
(Personal Guard of the Cui Army,
Shu)

208
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,260
(Cui Army, Lieutenant He)

209
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,330
(Cui Army, Lieutenant He)
Let's go.

210
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,290
Yue, I'm here.

211
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,100
That's Mister Pi Si.

212
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,260
I'll go and catch him.

213
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,340
Go and tell Pei Yuan

214
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,620
to cause chaos inside the hall

215
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,620
to buy me some time.

216
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,690
- Great!
- Amazing!

217
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,260
- Nice!
- Very good.

218
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,690
- Awesome.
- Good.

219
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,500
Miss Yue.

220
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,650
Your performance with the pipa
is amazing.

221
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,140
Let go of her!

222
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,410
Miss Yue's hand can't be touched
by a scoundrel like you .

223
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,100
Let go of her!

224
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,290
You are the scoundrel here.

225
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,620
I treat Miss Yue
to some liquor.

226
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,530
It's none of your business.

227
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,620
My respected guests.
Miss Yue is just here to perform.

228
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,580
Shut your mouth.

229
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,690
Please stop.

230
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,750
My fellow respected guests.

231
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,890
What happened?

232
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,890
What happened?

233
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,770
Don't be like this.

234
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,620
Stop fighting.

235
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:19,980
Miss.

236
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,930
Why hasn't Yue come back yet?

237
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,620
(Food Supplier, Mister Pi Si)
This is a heavenly song.

238
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,500
(Food Supplier, Mister Pi Si)

239
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,140
It's a rarity on earth.

240
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,380
Yue.

241
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,620
It's worth it for me

242
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,530
to come all the way here

243
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,220
to hear you perform.

244
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,170
I want to give this to Yue.

245
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,650
She won't like something
as common as this.

246
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,010
You are right.

247
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,580
Yue.

248
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,380
I'm sure you'll like this.

249
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,530
Yue.

250
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,050
You are here, Yue.

251
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,510
- Yue, I've waited so long for you.
- Miss, don't be angry.

252
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,100
Yue, what's wrong?

253
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,290
What happened?

254
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,580
Yue, what's wrong?

255
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,380
What happened?

256
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,610
(Zhilu Hall)

257
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,580
Dear guest.

258
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,580
Please halt, my fellow respected guests.

259
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,170
All the other guests

260
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,810
are watching the performances
in the front hall.

261
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,890
If you need anything,

262
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,810
you just need

263
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,720
(Sun Jing's Subordinate, Yu San)
to inform me about it.

264
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,100
(Sun Jing's Subordinate, Yu San)
Where's Pi Si?

265
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,690
Pi...

266
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,140
All of you are our respected guests.

267
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,410
But I can't reveal our guest's

268
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,460
personal information to you.

269
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,720
We are under
General Guo Zhi's command.

270
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,010
Can you take responsibility for it
if something goes amiss?

271
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,500
Which room belongs to the musician

272
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,860
called Yue?

273
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,740
I have prepared this specially for you.

274
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,890
A beautiful jade for a stunning woman.

275
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,300
Do you like this jade?

276
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,410
Yue.

277
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,260
Actually, I've waited

278
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,810
a long time for you today.

279
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,140
Because I want

280
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,170
to hear you perform for me alone.

281
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,100
What were you doing?

282
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,810
Why could you let guests enter my room?

283
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,010
Aren't you afraid
that Shopkeeper Qiu will break your legs?

284
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,770
No.

285
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,980
They didn't let me in.

286
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,010
I sneaked in.

287
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,170
Yue.

288
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,580
Don't be angry, okay?

289
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,580
Next time,

290
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,250
I'll give you another gift,

291
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:09,850
okay?

292
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,660
Drink more water.

293
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,940
Yue!

294
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,420
How dare you keep someone here.

295
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,730
And there are two of them.

296
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,780
Don't misunderstand.

297
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,530
We barged into here
under the emergency.

298
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,300
Please forgive us.

299
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,730
How shameless of you.

300
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,660
Get out of my room at once.

301
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,590
Yes.

302
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,180
- I know that you are not someone like that.
- Change the water and chase him out.

303
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,130
- Yes, Miss.
- Yes, Miss.

304
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,890
I've wronged you.

305
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,820
- Get up.
- Yue.

306
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,370
Let me go. Yue.

307
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:48,890
Leave now.

308
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,660
Don't chase me out.

309
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,210
- Pi Si.
- Yue.

310
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,700
Get out.

311
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,660
How dare you sneak out

312
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,060
from the stage station to come here.

313
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,940
Take him back.

314
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,570
Yes.

315
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,130
Do you know who I am?

316
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,060
Let go of me.

317
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,970
Release me!

318
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,130
Who are you?

319
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,940
This is a recreational house.

320
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,490
As a woman, why are you here?

321
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,730
Who says I'm a woman?

322
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,460
Small feet.

323
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,250
Wasp waist.

324
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,850
Narrow shoulder.

325
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,090
And you say you are not a woman.

326
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,780
Lieutenant He.

327
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:33,780
Let's go.

328
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,540
How are you?

329
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,320
Lieutenant He.

330
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,300
Are you hurt?

331
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,650
No.

332
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,820
Who is he?

333
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,130
He managed to fight off
four men with ease.

334
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,300
Is he someone from Sun Jing's army?

335
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:27,980
No.

336
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,690
Although he used a knife,

337
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,060
he wielded it like a sword.

338
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,930
And he could attack and defend
at any time.

339
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,300
Like storm and thunder.

340
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,650
It looked like General Pei's
secret sword technique.

341
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,260
It's rumored

342
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,930
that General Pei used to be the tutor
of the royal family.

343
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,220
Can it be that...

344
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,650
The Li Clan of the royal family
is incompetent and unambitious.

345
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,020
I've never heard

346
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,130
about any of them

347
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,260
being successful.

348
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,410
Let alone someone who's so skillful.

349
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,580
That person

350
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,740
is most probably a family member
of the Pei family.

351
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,300
Who is that person?

352
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,470
They are a formidable opponent.

353
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,260
Are they the personal guards of Sun Jing?

354
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,020
No.

355
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,580
Not the personal guards
of Sun Jing.

356
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,220
And they are not
the soldiers of Guo Zhi.

357
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,410
They are from the Cui Army.

358
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,690
They are from the Cui family.

359
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,780
The Cui family?

360
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,340
The Cui family rules over Pingliang.

361
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,260
Why are they here?

362
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,610
As soon as Sun Jing rebelled
and killed the emperor,

363
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,340
the Cui Army departed from Yingzhou

364
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,820
in the name of fighting for the throne.

365
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,370
Now that the world is in chaos,

366
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,020
I'm sure

367
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,500
they have their own plan.

368
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,410
A few months ago,

369
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,740
the Cui family

370
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,220
has seized many cities

371
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,540
in the name of fighting for the throne.

372
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,610
Now, other than Zhenxi Army

373
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,740
and Sun Jing's army,

374
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,260
the Cui Army

375
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,580
is the most powerful army out there.

376
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,410
I never thought that the Cui family

377
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,450
would move at such a fast pace.

378
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,130
They are already in Wangzhou.

379
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,060
Mister Shiqi.

380
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,740
They sneaked into this city

381
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,170
just like us.

382
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,130
How about we...

383
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,740
No.

384
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,540
According to the Cui family,

385
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,370
they are fighting for the throne.

386
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,370
Since they are here to help,

387
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,500
we should be courteous

388
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,780
and see how they are planning
to do that.

389
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,820
Lieutenant He, time to eat.

390
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,890
Unfortunately, we didn't manage to capture
that food supplier, Mister Pi Si.

391
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,820
Your prediction is as accurate as ever.

392
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,300
Zhenxi Army
is short on food supplies

393
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,010
and will probably try
to capture Mister Pi Si.

394
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,170
But we never thought

395
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,710
that the men of the Pei family
of Zhenxi Army

396
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,930
would arrive so quickly.

397
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,090
General Pei Xian from the Zhenxi Army

398
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,360
appointed the so-called
imperial grandson, Li Ni,

399
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,170
as the marshal.

400
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,260
And they are recruiting soldiers
to fight for the throne.

401
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,540
I think Pei Xian is just trying
to use Imperial Grandson, Li Ni,

402
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,410
as a leverage

403
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,690
to control all the marquises

404
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,130
in this nation.

405
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,580
Pei Xian used to be our general's comrade.

406
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,410
We can't underestimate him.

407
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:17,930
Without food supplies,

408
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,410
no matter how valiant Pei Xian is,

409
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,980
it'll be hard for the Zhenxi Army
to march forward.

410
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:22,890
The Cui Army

411
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,980
is trying to compete with us
for the food supplies.

412
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,580
They've ruined our perfect plan.

413
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,090
What should we do now?

414
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,450
Another thing, Mister Shiqi.

415
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,450
When we left,

416
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,090
Mister Pi Si

417
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,310
was taken away and kept under watch

418
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,090
by Guo Zhi's men.

419
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,410
Mister Pi Si is dying

420
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,780
to get into Zhilu Hall, right?

421
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,850
Let's help him.

422
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,220
Tomorrow,

423
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,820
we are going to put on a great act.

424
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,080
Lieutenant He.

425
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,980
What are we going to do next?

426
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,930
I think we can use

427
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,500
that person in Zhilu Hall
to help us with our cause.

428
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,440
Lieutenant He.

429
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,260
Come in.

430
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,340
Young Master sent a letter.

431
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,690
Is it about Great Imperial Grandson?

432
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,370
No.

433
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:41,850
Lieutenant He.

434
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,020
If it's about him,

435
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,070
I'm sure Young Master will put a marking
on the envelope.

436
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,060
Send out more of our men.

437
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,880
We must find Great Imperial Grandson
as fast as we can.

438
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,340
We can't let others get ahead of us.

439
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,610
We need to find him

440
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
so that the Cui family

441
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,500
can have a royalty in our rank.

442
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:56,740
When that time comes,

443
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,260
the imperial grandson, Li Ni,

444
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,340
who is in Pei Xian's army

445
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540
will become a joke.

446
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:01,890
Yes.

447
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,260
I already said in Yingzhou
that the Li Clan

448
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,780
was incompetent and useless.

449
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,850
It's the end for them.

450
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,580
Sooner or later,
they'll lose the nation.

451
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,780
Descendants of the Li Clan are all
about indulging in entertainment and pleasure.

452
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,090
None of them can handle
the responsibility to rule a nation.

453
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,740
Is that why you convinced

454
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,170
our general and Young Master

455
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,500
to lead our army out of Yingzhou?

456
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,210
If they can fight
to rule over this nation,

457
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,930
why can't we?

458
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,220
I'm afraid that only the Cui family

459
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
can bring peace to the nation

460
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,410
and give its people a prosperous life.

461
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,220
The topographic map of Wangzhou.

462
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,260
Are you still thinking about it?

463
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,340
If we can take down Wangzhou,

464
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,690
we'll be able to solve
half of the food supply.

465
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,060
(Wangzhou)
Stop thinking about it. Get some rest.

466
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,370
I've already arranged
the accommodation for you.

467
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,820
How about this?

468
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,820
I'll keep watch
on the first half of the night

469
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,450
and Bao keeps watch
on the second half.

470
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,930
Forget it.

471
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,340
Ear, you are hurt.

472
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,130
I'll keep watch.

473
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:04,650
Mister Shiqi.

474
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,540
How about I sleep with you tonight?

475
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,780
Forget it.

476
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,170
You never wash your stinky feet.

477
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,980
If I sleep with you,

478
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,220
I'll suffocate.

479
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,690
You...

480
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,850
You are the abnormal one here.

481
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,260
Why do you wash your feet every day?

482
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,580
Ear, smell my feet.

483
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,610
Are they smelly?

484
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,580
Come out.

485
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,890
Don't think that I haven't seen you.

486
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,980
It's you again.

487
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,540
Give it back.

488
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:11,850
Give it back!

489
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,300
What are you talking about?

490
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:15,780
This?

491
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,170
Where's my pearl?

492
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,370
Give it back to me first.

493
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,060
You are so vicious.

494
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:40,740
Wait.

495
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,300
Pei.

496
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,910
I know where Great Imperial Grandson is.

497
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,090
How do you know?

498
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,740
Is your surname Cui?

499
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,410
Why should I tell you?

500
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,060
Where is he?

501
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,060
What's taking him

502
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,260
so long to wash his feet?

503
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,650
Mister Shiqi!

504
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:31,780
Mister Shiqi!

505
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,890
Bao, I'm here!

506
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,610
Bao, I'm here!

507
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,260
Mister Shiqi.
Why are you in the well?

508
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,780
I'll pull you up at once.

509
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,780
Wait for me!

510
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,170
Are you okay, Mister Shiqi?

511
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,370
How did you fall into the well

512
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,060
from washing your feet?

513
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,410
Just now, I was trying
to save a wild cat.

514
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,500
But it scratched me instead.

515
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,310
So, I lost my footing
and fell into the well.

516
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,130
It's hard to tame a wild animal.

517
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,090
Why did you save

518
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,500
an ungrateful animal?

519
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,130
Yes.

520
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,060
It's indeed hard to tame.

521
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,610
And it's cunning.

522
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,580
Cunning?

523
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,220
I'll go and get changed.

524
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:17,690
Okay.

525
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,300
Yue.

526
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,300
Look at what I've brought for you.

527
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,540
Yue.

528
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,020
It's a bun from Dehua Restaurant.

529
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,340
And it's still hot.

530
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,890
I lined up for it.

531
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,300
Thank you.

532
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,370
And I have this premium
Huangjin Gui tea for you too.

533
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,780
It's best to drink the fruit tea
with some confections.

534
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,060
Fruit tea?

535
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,170
Yue.

536
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,340
You don't know this.

537
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,500
But I did my best to escape

538
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,260
so that I can buy you this.

539
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,060
If I didn't bribe the second lieutenant
who works for General Guo,

540
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,020
I wouldn't ...

541
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,540
Have you eaten breakfast?

542
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,090
Yue.

543
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,020
Did you just ask me

544
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,780
if I have eaten breakfast or not?

545
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,580
Yue.

546
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,690
You care about me.

547
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,330
Why not have breakfast together?

548
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,850
We can brew this fruit tea.

549
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,090
Okay.

550
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,130
(Zhilu Hall)

551
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,710
What are you doing here?

552
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,410
Do not enter!

553
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,220
Get away!

554
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,340
Move aside!

555
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,020
Where's Mister Si?

556
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,740
Where are you hiding him?

557
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,980
Hand him over!

558
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,850
Hurry up!

559
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,340
They say that Lady Qu San
in the capital city

560
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,580
can play pipa very well.

561
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,940
But after hearing her play,

562
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,410
she's far behind you.

563
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:54,890
Look at your hand.

564
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,130
This is bad.

565
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,220
There are
some fierce-looking men out there.

566
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,850
They say that they are sent here
by Madam Pi

567
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,300
to look for Mister Pi Si.

568
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,130
She...

569
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,220
That tigress

570
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,580
has tracked me all the way here?

571
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,300
Wait.

572
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,610
If you go out like this,

573
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,820
they'll notice you immediately.

574
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,170
How about you get changed

575
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,020
and dress up as another person
before you go out?

576
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,850
Who are you?

577
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,220
How dare you kidnap me?

578
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,300
Did the tigress send you?

579
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,690
Let me go!

580
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,780
What are you looking at?

581
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,260
If so, our Madam will report this
to the authority to raid Zhilu Hall.

582
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,130
I'll file for a divorce when I go back!

583
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,130
Let me down!

584
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,980
You crazy!

585
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,580
Let me down!

586
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,450
Do you want to die?

587
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,090
Who sent you?

588
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,410
Let me go.

589
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,220
Get in.

590
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,610
Let go of me.

591
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,820
Let me go!

592
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,780
Mister Pi Si!

593
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,260
Madam said that you lied to her.

594
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,580
You told her

595
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,340
that you were selling food
to the army of rebels.

596
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,450
But actually, you just wanted
to go to Zhilu Hall

597
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,300
to watch the women perform for you.

598
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,320
Madam asked me to break your teeth first

599
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,020
as soon as I see you.

600
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,020
Give me the hammer!

601
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,580
No.

602
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,340
Please spare me.

603
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,610
I didn't lie to her.

604
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,850
I didn't lie to her.

605
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,220
Believe me.

606
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,890
Actually, Madam said

607
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,090
that she could give you
a chance to explain.

608
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,930
No.

609
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,540
You've wronged me.

610
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,980
I am supplying food for General Guo.

611
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,060
I wouldn't lie to her.

612
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,940
I just happened to pass by Zhilu Hall

613
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,370
on my way back.

614
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,980
So, I paid it a visit.

615
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,820
Lies.

616
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,610
Open his mouth!

617
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,170
It's true.

618
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,260
It's the truth.

619
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,020
I have a pass.

620
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
It's a food supplier pass
from General Guo.

621
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,980
I wouldn't dare lie to her.

622
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,300
I'm here to supply food to his army.

623
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,220
Where's the pass?

624
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,060
In the pouch tied around my waist.

625
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,370
In the pouch tied around my waist.

626
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,020
It's not there.

627
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,340
Impossible.

628
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:18,580
Impossible.

629
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,410
It's inside the pouch.

630
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,260
- Lies.
- Why is it?

631
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,810
- Impossible.
- You don't have a pass at all.

632
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,740
I'm not lying to you.

633
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,300
Tricking us?

634
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,060
I do have a pass.

635
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,330
- Open his mouth.
- I'm not.

636
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,650
I really have a pass.

637
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,170
But I don't know

638
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,650
where I lost it.

639
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,690
Tell your master

640
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,170
that I've done my part.

641
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,980
This is the slave contract

642
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,690
that we've promised you.
You are free now.

643
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,140
(Slave Contract)

644
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,260
Mister Shiqi.

645
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,850
It doesn't look like
Mister Pi Si is lying.

646
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,980
I think he really doesn't know
how he lost his pass.

647
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,850
Looks like the Cui family

648
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,980
is one step ahead of us.

649
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,220
I thought that we could trick him

650
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,580
to find the pass with this plan.

651
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,980
I never thought that we had made
things easier for them instead.

652
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,690
But it's okay.

653
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,890
We have Mister Pi Si in our hands.

654
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,540
And we've found out
the whereabouts of the food.

655
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,130
We just need to take him with us

656
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,650
and we'll probably
be able to rob the food.

657
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,220
We have thousands of soldiers
from Zhenxi Army nearby.

658
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,740
They can back us up.

659
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,820
It's too late.

660
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,130
What?

661
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,450
If I was from the Cui family,

662
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,820
me and my men would dress up

663
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,780
as the garrison soldiers of Wangzhou

664
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,650
and leave the city at once to retrieve

665
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,220
the food supply with the pass.

666
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,450
We are here on General Guo's order

667
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:57,980
to leave to retrieve our food supply.

668
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,230
(While we were coveting gains ahead,
there were dangers behind us.)

669
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,090
(We are one step behind.)

670
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,450
(What should we do now?)

671
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,180
We can't let the Cui Army
take advantage of it.

672
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,570
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.

673
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,820
Since Sun Jing's rebellion,

674
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,220
the Cui Army

675
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,050
has taken so much advantage of it.

676
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,370
This time,

677
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,850
it's finally our turn.

678
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,570
You useless man!

679
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,100
(Guo Residence)
Just watch over a food supplier.

680
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,530
(Guo Residence)
But you lost him.

681
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,300
I never thought

682
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,570
that Pi Si would be kidnapped

683
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,010
in broad daylight.

684
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,050
I beheaded the second lieutenant
who set him free.

685
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,300
Please punish me

686
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,570
according to the martial law.

687
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,970
(Guardian of Wangzhou)
I don't have time

688
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,260
(under Sun Jing, Guo Zhi)
to behead you now.

689
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,930
Order our army to leave

690
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,140
to retrieve the food supply.

691
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:55,850
Lieutenant He.

692
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:56,490
What is it?

693
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,050
Although we won't run into Guo Zhi

694
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,300
by taking the alternative route,

695
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,890
we only have 300 soldiers nearby.

696
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,560
Now, 100 of them
are transporting the food.

697
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,820
So, only 200 soldiers
in Wangzhou.

698
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:05,660
Will that be okay?

699
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,610
As soon as Guo Zhi finds out
that the food supply is stolen,

700
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,260
he'll panic and lead his army out
to retrieve the food supply.

701
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,660
When that happens,

702
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,100
the defense of the city will be lowered.

703
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,450
Then, our 200 men

704
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,890
just need to infiltrate the city

705
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,620
and kill the garrison soldiers
at unawares.

706
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,220
As soon as we return,

707
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,620
we'll close the gate.

708
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,740
Moreover, Young Master's army is arriving.

709
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,410
Victory will be ours.

710
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,250
(Wangzhou)

711
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,050
General Pei Yuan.

712
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,050
Thousands of our soldiers nearby

713
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,370
are approaching the city gate.

714
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,530
Take your men

715
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,740
to take advantage of this.

716
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,450
General.

717
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,490
Two hours ago,

718
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,710
a group of garrison soldiers came

719
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,610
to retrieve the food supply

720
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,530
after showing us the pass.

721
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,780
I checked the pass carefully.

722
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:07,570
It was authentic.

723
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,220
So, I handed over
the food supply to them.

724
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,140
Those cunning thieves.

725
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,210
Chase after them.

726
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,620
(Wangzhou)

727
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,190
(Wangzhou)

728
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,780
Mister Shiqi.

729
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,620
Do you think the people of Cui Army

730
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,140
will ask for our help?

731
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,260
Someone is hot on their trail.

732
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,400
They have no choice

733
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,600
but to agree to anything we demand.

734
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,140
Later,

735
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,220
I'm going

736
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,970
to ask her to jump into the well

737
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,660
and get soaked for a while first.

738
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,410
Jump into the well?

739
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,850
Why?

740
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,890
Lieutenant He, what should we do?

741
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,700
Guo Zhi will be here soon with his army.

742
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,530
We have the food.

743
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,930
The Zhenxi Army

744
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,700
won't let us fall into the hands
of our enemies.

745
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,050
Now,

746
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,010
he's waiting for us to beg him

747
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,660
so that he can demand anything from us

748
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,410
and force us to accept his conditions.

749
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,300
Lieutenant He,
it's time to make a decision.

750
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,140
Otherwise,
Guo Zhi's army will be here soon.

751
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,300
Lieutenant He, our army is here!

752
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,700
The Cui Army is here!

753
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:28,930
It's Young Master Cui.

754
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,660
Young Master Cui is here for us.

755
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,100
