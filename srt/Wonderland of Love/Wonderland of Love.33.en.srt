Spare the formalities.

00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:01,516
Bring in the criminal!

32
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:15,756
I'm Jia Li of Shenli Tribe, Jieshuo.

33
00:02:15,756 --> 00:02:17,316
Greetings, Your Majesty.

34
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:20,316
Long live Your Majesty.

35
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:21,077
That's enough.

36
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:24,036
You said you wanted
to inform against someone.

37
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:25,557
Who are you referring to?

38
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:27,397
I want to inform against Cui Yi.

39
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:28,756
Initially, Cui Yi made a deal with

40
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:30,196
the chief of Wuluo.

41
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,916
He'll give us salt and ironware

42
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,036
in private

43
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,156
if we withdraw from Baishui Pass.

44
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:35,636
But he didn't keep his promise.

45
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,976
Not only did he send his troops
after our tribe and Fanggong Tribe,

46
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,237
but he also insisted that

47
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:40,916
the old and weak were elite soldiers

48
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,156
and chopped off their heads

49
00:02:42,156 --> 00:02:43,517
to use as spoils of war.

50
00:02:46,837 --> 00:02:47,476
Your Majesty,

51
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:49,156
this is the leader of Shenli Tribe,

52
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:50,120
which was captured by Cui Yi.

53
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,119
He's bitter about his defeat.

54
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,156
That's why he's slandering

55
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:54,196
our commander with his words.

56
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:54,997
Nonsense!

57
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:57,196
Jieshuo people are
the most straightforward people you'll see!

58
00:02:57,436 --> 00:02:59,196
If we lose, we lose.

59
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:00,797
We'll accept our defeat.

60
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:03,876
Cui Yi agreed
to stage a fake battle with us.

61
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:06,476
However, he killed all of the old
and weak members of my tribe!

62
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:07,797
How could I stand for that?

63
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,756
If so, why didn't you expose Cui Yi
when he was in the court?

64
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:15,277
Back then, I hadn't met the emperor yet.

65
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:17,677
I have no idea His Majesty
was this kind and benevolent.

66
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,436
Not only did he spare my life,

67
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:20,677
but he also granted me new apparel

68
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:22,117
and found me a place
to stay in the capital.

69
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,837
Only then, I understood

70
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,397
that what Cui Yi did

71
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:26,756
wasn't what His Majesty

72
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:27,596
ordered him to do.

73
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:29,316
He did that of his own accord.

74
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,196
I told you already.

75
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:34,677
If you influence one with virtue,

76
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,517
one will definitely
repay your favor with virtue.

77
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:38,397
Look.

78
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:39,876
I've managed

79
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:42,756
to change Jia Li with how I act.

80
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:44,357
Your Majesty,

81
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:45,840
Cui Yi is our great general.

82
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,806
The Cui family has guarded Yingzhou
for several generations.

83
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:49,400
And, they engage Jieshuo in battle
for many years.

84
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,316
Cui Yi has no reason to collude with them!

85
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:53,797
Your Majesty, nurturing bandits like them
always lead to arrogance.

86
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,557
Military officials always use
their military merit to coerce the court.

87
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,357
Why wouldn't Cui Yi

88
00:03:58,357 --> 00:03:59,436
collude with Jieshuo?

89
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:01,436
Jia Li has made himself clear.

90
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:03,117
Cui Yi has killed the old and the weak

91
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,036
to render fake merit.

92
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,436
He should be convicted
of deceiving the emperor!

93
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,436
Such nonsense!

94
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:11,837
More than a hundred members
of the Cui family have been killed by Jieshuo.

95
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:15,517
And, Cui Yi's wife died
defending the city.

96
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:18,276
She was appointed as Heroic Lady
by the court.

97
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:20,516
He has a deep-seated grudge
against Jieshuo.

98
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:23,357
Why would Cui Yi collude with them?

99
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:24,157
Your Majesty,

100
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:26,997
when things go awry, there must be
an explanation for it.

101
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:29,897
The reclamation of Baishui Pass
is too much of a coincidence.

102
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:31,076
It's more than just a coincidence.

103
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:32,797
We lost Baishui Pass
right after Cui Yi's adopted son

104
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:34,240
persuaded the defending general
to surrender.

105
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,196
And, Cui Yi and his army

106
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:36,677
were in the vicinity.

107
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:37,477
It was as if

108
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,797
he was waiting to claim credit.

109
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:41,237
I think

110
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:42,717
we should investigate the case.

111
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,597
I don't understand one more thing.

112
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:46,237
Why is Great General Pei

113
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:47,636
trying to defend Cui Yi and the Cui Army

114
00:04:47,636 --> 00:04:49,477
when he doesn't know much about them?

115
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:52,357
Could it be that he has done

116
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:53,836
the same as well?

117
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:55,677
You! How dare you malign me?

118
00:04:56,157 --> 00:04:57,276
How could you be so sure

119
00:04:57,276 --> 00:05:00,997
that Cui Yi didn't collude with Jieshuo
if you didn't do the same yourself?

120
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:03,797
It's an unpardonable sin.

121
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,717
Great General Pei,

122
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:08,876
don't tell me you can guarantee
Cui Yi's innocence with your life and assets?

123
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:10,797
This is a serious crime.

124
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:13,237
Great General Pei,
don't tell me we can drop the case

125
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:14,997
because of your guarantee?

126
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:15,997
Stop spouting nonsense!

127
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:16,516
Enough!

128
00:05:21,597 --> 00:05:23,340
It's unfortunate
that our civil and military officials

129
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,717
are arguing with each other.

130
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:32,797
Since you said Cui Yi

131
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:34,797
colluded with you all,

132
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:37,076
how did he collude

133
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:38,076
with you guys then?

134
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:40,640
Who did he send to make
secret arrangements together with Wuluo?

135
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:41,956
Since it was secret arrangements,

136
00:05:42,157 --> 00:05:43,477
how did you find out about it?

137
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:44,797
Since you've found out,

138
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,076
why didn't Cui Yi kill you?

139
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:49,157
Cui Yi sent his adopted son,
Liu Chengfeng, as his envoy

140
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:50,717
to make secret arrangements
with Chief Wuluo.

141
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:52,516
I'm the nephew of Chief Wuluo.

142
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:55,237
Therefore, he once told me about
the secret meeting he had with them.

143
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:56,597
Cui Yi didn't kill me

144
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:57,756
because he didn't know

145
00:05:57,756 --> 00:05:59,956
that I knew that he was colluding
with Chief Wuluo.

146
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:04,477
You're our prisoner of war.

147
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,396
And His Majesty had spared you

148
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:07,956
on account of his grace.

149
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:10,037
However, you maligned our commander.

150
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,477
That alone

151
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,597
is enough for you to be executed.

152
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:15,076
And,

153
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:21,357
don't think that everything is over

154
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:23,237
once you're dead.

155
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,436
I will bring my troops

156
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:28,157
and demolish every camp Wuluo has.

157
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:29,636
I'm telling the truth!

158
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:30,917
With what you said?

159
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:33,876
You think you can malign
Great General Cui Yi with that?

160
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:36,636
Cui Yi's adopted son, Liu Chengfeng,
wants to inform against him too.

161
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:38,597
Why don't you bring him here
and interrogate him?

162
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:40,797
He knows more than me.

163
00:06:40,797 --> 00:06:41,557
Enough.

164
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:44,196
Bring Liu Chengfeng here.

165
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:45,117
Yes, Your Majesty.

166
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,636
Liu Chengfeng is here.

167
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:14,276
I'm Liu Chengfeng.

168
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:15,516
Greetings, Your Majesty.

169
00:07:15,797 --> 00:07:18,516
Long live Your Majesty.

170
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,037
Since you want to inform against him,

171
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:23,076
tell us what happened.

172
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:26,196
What's going on

173
00:07:26,316 --> 00:07:28,316
between Cui Yi and Jieshuo?

174
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:29,396
Yes, Your Majesty.

175
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,956
Cui Yi told me

176
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:35,276
he wanted to conserve
the Cui Army's strength

177
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:37,157
and wasn't willing to engage
Jieshuo in battle.

178
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,797
But he was worried that the court might
lay off the Cui Army.

179
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:42,636
That's why he wanted to cover all bases.

180
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:46,076
Therefore, he sent me there
to make secret arrangements with Wuluo.

181
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:47,677
I'll pretend to surrender

182
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:48,876
and sell Baishui Pass out.

183
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:49,917
This way,

184
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:52,037
I can remain in Jieshuo

185
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:53,876
as the Cui Army's escape route.

186
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:55,357
However,

187
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,516
Cui Yi already made a deal
with Wuluo long ago.

188
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:00,997
He would lead his army to Baishui Pass

189
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:02,597
and Wuluo would pretend to be defeated.

190
00:08:02,956 --> 00:08:04,836
This way,
Cui Yi would render huge merit.

191
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:06,037
And, the court

192
00:08:06,196 --> 00:08:08,037
won't lay off the Cui Army.

193
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:10,237
Thus, Cui Yi can do whatever he likes.

194
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:12,876
Whenever the court
intends to lay off the Cui Army,

195
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:15,076
he'll command Jieshuo
to invade the borders.

196
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:17,440
And, Cui Yi has agreed

197
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,357
to provide salt and ironware
to Jieshuo in secret,

198
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:22,516
which they lack severely.

199
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,037
He did this for his own good.

200
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:33,317
If so, why are you
informing against him today?

201
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:37,796
Cui Yi used me as his pawn

202
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:39,276
to sell Baishui Pass off.

203
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:41,197
My reputation was ruined because of him.

204
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:44,156
I can't face my parents and ancestors

205
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,197
in the afterlife.

206
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:48,120
However, Cui Yi
has no sense of shame at all

207
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,520
as he occupies a high position
in the court.

208
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,556
Everyone in the world thinks
that he's a meritorious official.

209
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:53,957
I know

210
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:55,237
that my sin is unpardonable.

211
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:58,276
However, as a citizen of the nation,

212
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,597
I mustn't betray my nation.

213
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:01,036
That's my bottom line.

214
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:05,957
Therefore,

215
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:12,037
I'm putting righteousness
above family ties

216
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:14,597
and informing against him.

217
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:29,317
Liu Chengfeng, oh, Liu Chengfeng.

218
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:32,916
Cui Yi raised and nurtured you.

219
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:34,396
How could you

220
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:35,636
malign him like this

221
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:37,477
because of your selfish desire?

222
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:43,077
Your Highness, you're defending Cui Yi
with all your might.

223
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:45,477
Aren't you also doing it

224
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:46,837
because of your selfish desire?

225
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:52,276
Your Majesty,

226
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:54,717
Cui Yi saved your life

227
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:55,957
during the Lords' rebellion.

228
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:57,396
Why would he do that if he wanted

229
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,197
to betray the nation?

230
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,796
How could he arrive there
at the perfect time

231
00:09:59,796 --> 00:10:01,597
to save His Majesty
if he didn't collude with

232
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:02,876
Jieshuo in the first place?

233
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:06,556
Your Majesty,

234
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:09,597
this is just like
his previous massive victory.

235
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:12,636
It's all evidence of him claiming credit

236
00:10:12,636 --> 00:10:14,477
from all those fake merits!

237
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:17,477
You're right.

238
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,997
You have a point.

239
00:10:19,197 --> 00:10:20,837
This is more than just a coincidence

240
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,796
when he did it every time.

241
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:24,796
Your Majesty,

242
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:26,156
now,

243
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:27,556
we can only order Great General Cui

244
00:10:27,556 --> 00:10:28,717
to return to the court

245
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:29,957
and interrogate him.

246
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:31,396
Then, we'll find out.

247
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:35,237
Cui Yi left the capital in a hurry.

248
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:37,276
Who knows what he's up to?

249
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:39,317
Your Majesty,

250
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:41,276
we should send our troops

251
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:43,916
to capture Cui Yi and bring him back.

252
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,357
And, we have to prevent the Cui Army
from causing a commotion.

253
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:48,077
I concur.

254
00:10:48,077 --> 00:10:49,837
I concur.

255
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:22,516
Young Lady,

256
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:23,997
should we leave right now?

257
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:27,357
If we leave,

258
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,160
people can substantiate
their allegations.

259
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:30,717
However, if we don't,

260
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:32,916
Great General will
be more worried about you.

261
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:35,957
This is a net

262
00:11:35,957 --> 00:11:37,477
that's been set up meticulously.

263
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:39,717
Our enemies are
coming from all directions.

264
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:41,597
Now, we're in the open

265
00:11:41,597 --> 00:11:42,960
while our enemies
are lurking in the dark.

266
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:43,876
We still don't know

267
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:45,036
the kinds of traps

268
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:46,237
that are waiting for us.

269
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:49,516
What should we do then?

270
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:52,117
I was thinking

271
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:53,717
that as long as Father can return

272
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:55,156
to the Cui Army's main camp in Yingzhou,

273
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:58,276
the court doesn't dare
to do anything to him.

274
00:11:58,957 --> 00:11:59,916
By then,

275
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:01,396
we can think of something else.

276
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:03,516
Now,

277
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:04,916
His Highness is still in the palace.

278
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:07,357
Why don't you guys
discuss a solution together

279
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:08,597
after he comes back?

280
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:10,156
No.

281
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:12,156
We're under suspicion right now.

282
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,597
And, he's the crown prince.

283
00:12:13,837 --> 00:12:15,756
This incident also concerns
the Lords' rebellion.

284
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:17,640
We're already
under suspicious circumstances.

285
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,597
It's a delicate situation.

286
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:20,036
We shouldn't drag him into this.

287
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:21,717
He should steer clear of suspicion.

288
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:23,676
Do you know the situation we're in?

289
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:25,237
Why are you still caring for him?

290
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:28,357
He always cares for me.

291
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:32,357
I should care for him too.

292
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:49,676
Shiqi.

293
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,717
I've been waiting for you
after exiting the palace.

294
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:53,697
You weren't there even
when I waited until midnight.

295
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:55,796
What's going on in your residence?

296
00:12:55,997 --> 00:12:58,040
I snuck into the residence
with no trouble at all just now.

297
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,276
What if there are assassins here?

298
00:13:00,756 --> 00:13:01,597
Shiqi, it's because

299
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:02,876
you're the best scout there is.

300
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:04,396
That's why you didn't encounter
any trouble.

301
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:06,360
Other people would've been
turned into a porcupine by now

302
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,477
had they tried to sneak in.

303
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:08,597
Really?

304
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:09,437
I don't believe you.

305
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:11,317
Someone!

306
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:20,077
You guys may leave.

307
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:27,197
Do you believe me now?

308
00:13:27,317 --> 00:13:28,477
I do.

309
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:29,957
I'm relieved.

310
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't tell me you came here
in the middle of the night

311
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,636
just to inspect the security here?

312
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:41,276
I'm worried about you
and Great General Cui.

313
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:46,676
Only shady individuals

314
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:48,997
can think of such shady tricks.

315
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,597
They won't assassinate me and Father

316
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:54,837
before they achieve their goals.

317
00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:57,036
Ying.

318
00:13:58,036 --> 00:13:58,876
Don't worry.

319
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:00,357
I'll be fine.

320
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:07,237
Someone! There's a fire!

321
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:08,516
There's a fire!

322
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:13,437
Where is that?

323
00:14:13,597 --> 00:14:14,597
What's with the sudden fire?

324
00:14:14,997 --> 00:14:16,200
It's the Court of Judicial Review.

325
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:17,556
Oh no.

326
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:19,477
How could this happen?

327
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:21,997
Such audacity.

328
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:25,117
His Majesty has arrived!

329
00:14:36,516 --> 00:14:37,957
Your Majesty,
you must've been frightened.

330
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,556
We deserve to die!

331
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:40,796
Even the Court of Judicial Review

332
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:42,317
isn't safe now.

333
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,796
As the emperor,

334
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:48,156
I deserve to lose sleep over this.

335
00:14:48,876 --> 00:14:49,636
All right now.

336
00:14:50,197 --> 00:14:52,396
Tell me what happened.

337
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:54,437
A group of highly-skilled crooks

338
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:56,156
barged into prison.

339
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,636
14 prison guards were killed.

340
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,197
Jia Li, leader of Shenli Tribe of Jieshuo,
was stabbed to death.

341
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:01,480
Liu Chengfeng was seriously injured.

342
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:03,156
Luckily, the Imperial Army
arrived there in time.

343
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:04,876
They fought with the crooks.

344
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:07,240
Three of the crooks were slain.
Initially, four of them were captured.

345
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,717
They took their own lives
by taking poison.

346
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:09,756
Some of them had escaped.

347
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,636
I've inspected the weapons, apparel,

348
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:12,916
and items they used.

349
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,357
I have no idea where they come from.

350
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:17,717
So, they committed murder under my nose.

351
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,197
Excellent job.

352
00:15:19,357 --> 00:15:21,077
I assume they set fire to the place

353
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:23,477
so that they can get rid
of all the evidence and witnesses.

354
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:25,077
Luckily, the Imperial Army
arrived in time.

355
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:27,036
They rescued Liu Chengfeng,
who was seriously injured.

356
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:28,477
However, he's seriously wounded.

357
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:29,636
We can't interrogate him yet.

358
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:32,036
This is very obvious.

359
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:32,796
I'm sure Cui Yi

360
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:34,477
sent these crooks here

361
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:37,276
to silence them.

362
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:38,756
Pei Xian.

363
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:40,077
Yes, Your Majesty.

364
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:42,117
Go after Cui Yi personally
with your troops.

365
00:15:42,237 --> 00:15:43,237
If you can't,

366
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:45,676
you don't need to come back.

367
00:15:45,957 --> 00:15:46,556
But...

368
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:48,156
Your Majesty,

369
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,437
Great General Pei is no longer young.

370
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:51,957
His body can't take it.

371
00:15:51,957 --> 00:15:53,116
You should send Pei Yuan instead.

372
00:15:54,197 --> 00:15:54,997
That works.

373
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:57,957
Relay my order to Pei Residence.

374
00:15:58,077 --> 00:15:59,837
Tell Pei Yuan
to bring back Cui Yi at all costs

375
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:01,837
together with his elite troops.

376
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:02,556
If not,

377
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,357
I'll punish him.

378
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:06,636
Yes, Your Majesty.

379
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:10,036
Your Majesty,

380
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,997
if this was truly Cui Yi's doing,

381
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:14,077
I'm afraid the daughter
he left behind in the capital

382
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:15,276
would be one of the masterminds.

383
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:17,197
Why don't we bring her here
and interrogate her?

384
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:18,197
She's not.

385
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:23,997
How would you know?

386
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:25,756
I was in her room tonight.

387
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:26,876
Naturally, she's not.

388
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:32,396
You shameless brat!

389
00:16:33,197 --> 00:16:33,997
Your Majesty,

390
00:16:34,197 --> 00:16:35,837
they're both unmarried.

391
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:37,357
It's common for youngsters

392
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:38,437
to enjoy their time together

393
00:16:38,437 --> 00:16:39,676
and neglect other stuff.

394
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,477
A man and a woman

395
00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:43,876
spending time together
in a room in the middle of the night?

396
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:45,556
How dare you say it out?

397
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:47,717
That Cui girl,

398
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:49,077
she's a vixen.

399
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,916
She corrupted my crown prince!

400
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:53,916
I was the one
who barged into her residence.

401
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:55,597
I got in by scaling their wall.

402
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:56,717
You!

403
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:09,036
I'll make myself clear today.

404
00:17:09,356 --> 00:17:11,237
I will make Cui Lin my wife.

405
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:12,877
It doesn't matter
who tries to persuade me.

406
00:17:13,356 --> 00:17:14,477
She's the only crown princess

407
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:16,197
I will acknowledge.

408
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,756
What sin have I committed

409
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:28,316
to give birth to a brat like you?

410
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:30,477
I'm sure it's something
I did in my past life!

411
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:32,717
That's why you're here
to deliver retribution!

412
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:35,957
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

413
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:37,516
Your Majesty, please mind your words.

414
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:38,477
You'll break

415
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:41,877
His Highness' heart by saying that.

416
00:17:42,556 --> 00:17:43,276
I...

417
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,076
I finally understand now.

418
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,917
He can become the emperor

419
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:51,157
if I die after
he infuriates me to no end.

420
00:17:52,076 --> 00:17:52,637
I...

421
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:56,717
What's the point of living then?

422
00:17:57,796 --> 00:18:00,157
I would rather die!

423
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:04,157
Your Highness,

424
00:18:04,356 --> 00:18:06,157
you should apologize for that.

425
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:08,836
His Majesty is no longer young.

426
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:11,057
Your Highness, let's forget
the fact that you're his subject.

427
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:12,756
Even as his son,

428
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,877
you shouldn't have done so.

429
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:16,197
Your Highness!

430
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,316
Your Highness!

431
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:21,796
Your Highness!

432
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:33,917
Your Highness,

433
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:36,836
why don't you bring
Great General Cui back?

434
00:18:36,877 --> 00:18:37,836
Everything will be over

435
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,276
if you bring him here

436
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:41,596
and bring light to the truth.

437
00:18:43,316 --> 00:18:44,437
That's right.

438
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:47,036
There's no need to send Pei Yuan there.
Bring him back yourself.

439
00:18:47,237 --> 00:18:48,997
I'll still acknowledge you as my son

440
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:51,917
as long as you bring Cui Yi back.

441
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:53,276
If not,

442
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:56,917
I'll kill myself

443
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:58,756
by slamming my head into the pillar!

444
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:02,036
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

445
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:05,397
Your Highness,

446
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:07,997
please listen to my advice.

447
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,477
Please bring Great General Cui back.

448
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:11,796
His Majesty is a wise ruler.

449
00:19:11,957 --> 00:19:14,637
He'll never malign a loyal subject.

450
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,316
I'll definitely kill Cui Yi's daughter

451
00:19:17,437 --> 00:19:19,316
if you can't bring him back.

452
00:19:19,637 --> 00:19:21,076
Kill me

453
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,276
and become the emperor

454
00:19:22,276 --> 00:19:23,516
if you dare!

455
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:28,157
Why are you still here?

456
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:48,085
(Topographic Map)

457
00:19:54,397 --> 00:19:54,997
Young Lady,

458
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:56,637
for some reason,

459
00:19:56,836 --> 00:19:58,076
General Pei Yuan

460
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,877
has surrounded our residence with his men.

461
00:20:02,756 --> 00:20:04,316
General Pei Yuan came here with his men?

462
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,356
Didn't he say
that he was going to see me?

463
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:09,197
No.

464
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:11,157
He only told me to tell you

465
00:20:11,197 --> 00:20:12,516
that he came here
with the Imperial Army.

466
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:15,197
He told me not to let anyone
enter or exit the residence for now.

467
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:16,997
It's almost dawn now.

468
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:19,756
I wonder if Father

469
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:22,157
has passed Yuezhou?

470
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:25,997
Why don't we send someone
to ask His Highness about it?

471
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:28,036
No.

472
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,477
I'm afraid Li Ni

473
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:32,556
is no longer in Xichang.

474
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:46,356
Great General,

475
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:47,796
we'll reach Shizhou

476
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:49,116
after passing that strait.

477
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:50,516
The Cui Army's heavy cavalry

478
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:51,997
can be found east of Qingbi River.

479
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:53,880
They've already received our order
to receive you.

480
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,356
Once we rendezvous with them,

481
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:56,596
we can return to Yingzhou

482
00:20:56,677 --> 00:20:57,877
safe and sound.

483
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:01,116
Let's go.

484
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:04,397
The sooner we rendezvous
with our main army,

485
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:06,896
the sooner we can have peace of mind.

486
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:07,820
Yes, Great General.

487
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:22,477
It's been over a week since then.

488
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:24,877
Do you think Li Ni

489
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:26,917
can bring Cui Yi back?

490
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,477
It's hard to say.

491
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:32,957
Betraying one's nation
is a serious crime.

492
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:35,637
If His Highness does bring Cui Yi back,

493
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,316
Your Majesty, you must launch
a thorough investigation.

494
00:21:39,796 --> 00:21:41,997
Prime Minister Gu, you have a point.

495
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:45,237
If Cui Yi did betray the nation,

496
00:21:45,477 --> 00:21:46,836
I'll definitely execute him.

497
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:51,756
However, the crown prince
is in love with his daughter.

498
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,556
If he insists on making her
the crown princess,

499
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:59,076
it'll be difficult to punish Cui Yi.

500
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:02,356
Why don't I grant Li Ni

501
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,116
the crown princess

502
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,316
while he's not in Xichang?

503
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:10,877
This way, he will have no way
to reject it when he's back.

504
00:22:10,957 --> 00:22:11,877
This...

505
00:22:12,157 --> 00:22:13,877
If His Highness isn't around,

506
00:22:13,877 --> 00:22:14,836
according to the rites,

507
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:17,197
the crown princess cannot be selected.

508
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:19,717
What about a lady of excellence?

509
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:23,237
Selecting a lady of excellence doesn't
require the presence of the crown prince.

510
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:24,997
And, most importantly,

511
00:22:24,997 --> 00:22:27,397
the lady of excellence
is only one rank below the crown princess.

512
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:29,949
It'll be fine when we appoint her
as the crown princess when he's back.

513
00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:32,157
Your Majesty,

514
00:22:33,596 --> 00:22:34,796
this plan of yours might work.

515
00:22:39,116 --> 00:22:40,437
Prime Minister Gu,

516
00:22:40,516 --> 00:22:41,356
I knew

517
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:44,036
you would understand my feelings.

518
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,197
Your daughter, Wan'niang,
is an excellent girl.

519
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:50,356
I can't bear for her
to suffer grievances too.

520
00:22:50,677 --> 00:22:53,157
But now, we're in a state of emergency.

521
00:22:53,237 --> 00:22:55,276
I can only make her
a lady of excellence for now.

522
00:22:56,717 --> 00:22:58,036
Once Li Ni is back,

523
00:22:58,637 --> 00:23:00,917
I promise I'll appoint her
as the crown princess.

524
00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:02,036
What?

525
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,237
You mustn't!

526
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:06,516
You mustn't do so!

527
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:07,596
Your Majesty, you mustn't do so!

528
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:09,836
My daughter isn't good enough

529
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:10,957
for His Highness!

530
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:11,516
Your Majesty,

531
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,957
please rescind your order.

532
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:15,477
Your Majesty, you mustn't do so!

533
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:17,116
Prime Minister Gu,

534
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:20,116
you've been our prime minister
for over a decade.

535
00:23:20,397 --> 00:23:21,397
You were loyal

536
00:23:21,437 --> 00:23:24,637
to both the late emperor and me.

537
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:27,516
I know.

538
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:31,116
Your daughter is suffering grievances
when I'm putting her through this.

539
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:33,877
But now, we're in a state of emergency.

540
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:35,516
There's no one else

541
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:39,197
I can trust except for you.

542
00:23:39,596 --> 00:23:41,356
Prime Minister Gu, if you say no,

543
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:44,477
I...

544
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:45,556
Your Majesty,

545
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,237
it's not that
I don't want to agree to it.

546
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:49,796
However, if news of this gets out,

547
00:23:49,957 --> 00:23:51,276
people will say

548
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:53,997
that I'm sending my daughter
to the crown prince by force

549
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:55,237
in order to ascend the ranks.

550
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:56,397
I would have no way

551
00:23:56,397 --> 00:23:59,116
to face the people in the future.

552
00:23:59,197 --> 00:24:00,276
Prime Minister Gu,

553
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:05,076
do you want me to beg you then?

554
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:12,877
Your Majesty.

555
00:24:13,437 --> 00:24:14,677
Your Majesty,

556
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:16,756
I'm willing to die a thousand deaths
for your sake.

557
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,477
Facing such rumors and criticisms,

558
00:24:19,756 --> 00:24:21,036
I will not mind them

559
00:24:23,516 --> 00:24:24,556
for the sake of the nation.

560
00:24:25,076 --> 00:24:25,917
Excellent.

561
00:24:26,437 --> 00:24:27,796
That's more like it.

562
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:38,237
General Pei Yuan delivered these to us.

563
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:41,116
He also delivered some
vegetables and fruits to us.

564
00:24:41,276 --> 00:24:42,437
He actually dared to ask me

565
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:43,997
what we lacked in the residence.

566
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:48,796
He's just fulfilling his duty.

567
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:50,397
Why are you angry at him?

568
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:52,997
But we're close friends, aren't we?

569
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:54,437
But him?

570
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:55,917
He didn't even notify us

571
00:24:56,437 --> 00:24:59,157
before he surrounded our residence

572
00:24:59,157 --> 00:25:00,356
with the Imperial Army.

573
00:25:01,756 --> 00:25:02,997
There's no need to blame him.

574
00:25:03,717 --> 00:25:04,877
It's likely that Li Ni

575
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:06,157
instructed him to do so.

576
00:25:08,516 --> 00:25:09,997
That's even worse.

577
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,076
He went after Great General himself.

578
00:25:12,556 --> 00:25:13,836
And, he even sent Pei Yuan here

579
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:15,036
to keep an eye on us.

580
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:16,717
It's been quite some time, you know?

581
00:25:17,237 --> 00:25:19,116
Not even a fly
could enter our residence.

582
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:21,356
Taozi,

583
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,157
has this ever occurred to you?

584
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:25,556
We lack forces in the capital.

585
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,957
Li Ni told Pei Yuan
to surround our residence

586
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:30,397
because it's more convenient and safer

587
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:33,197
compared to someone else
surrounding our residence.

588
00:25:34,477 --> 00:25:37,316
I will head to the Eastern Palace
under imperial edict tomorrow.

589
00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:40,717
Father, do you have
any other instructions for me?

590
00:25:41,437 --> 00:25:42,116
Wan'niang,

591
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:43,917
come here.

592
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:49,877
Wan,

593
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:51,516
you know this too.

594
00:25:52,197 --> 00:25:54,276
The crown prince is very intelligent.

595
00:25:55,516 --> 00:25:56,237
My child,

596
00:25:57,197 --> 00:25:58,677
this will be a perilous trip.

597
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,076
Judging from your intellect,

598
00:26:01,237 --> 00:26:02,817
you'll be able to win
the crown prince's heart

599
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:04,596
at most after a few years.

600
00:26:05,157 --> 00:26:07,076
Everything will be settled down

601
00:26:07,477 --> 00:26:08,836
once you give birth to a child for him.

602
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:09,677
If so,

603
00:26:10,516 --> 00:26:12,076
you'll become the empress in the future.

604
00:26:13,316 --> 00:26:13,997
Father,

605
00:26:14,997 --> 00:26:16,157
please rest assured.

606
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:20,356
There's thick fog ahead.

607
00:26:20,437 --> 00:26:21,397
Let's proceed slowly.

608
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:31,157
Young Lady,

609
00:26:31,877 --> 00:26:35,116
do you think Great General
will return with His Highness?

610
00:26:44,957 --> 00:26:45,836
I have no idea.

611
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:49,397
If Cui Yi dares to come back,

612
00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:52,756
he'll be an eagle trapped in a cage,

613
00:26:52,997 --> 00:26:55,076
a tiger without its fangs.

614
00:26:55,877 --> 00:26:56,917
No matter if it's in the court

615
00:26:57,397 --> 00:26:58,276
or the capital,

616
00:26:59,477 --> 00:27:02,437
there's always a way to take his life.

617
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:06,836
If so, I won't need to worry.

618
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:52,717
It's you?

619
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:54,356
Great General,

620
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,556
please return with me.

621
00:27:56,237 --> 00:27:57,917
Someone maligned you
for colluding with Jieshuo

622
00:27:58,036 --> 00:27:58,957
and betraying the nation.

623
00:27:59,356 --> 00:28:02,157
Great General, please return with me
so that we can resolve their doubts.

624
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:04,437
So, Your Highness,

625
00:28:05,356 --> 00:28:07,036
are you here to ambush me?

626
00:28:07,556 --> 00:28:08,036
No.

627
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:10,356
My steeds are faster than yours.

628
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:12,437
Moreover, I left the capital
with an imperial pass.

629
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:14,437
I can mobilize the soldiers
of all states and prefectures.

630
00:28:15,197 --> 00:28:16,760
Great General, if I truly
intended to ambush you,

631
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:19,836
I would've set up ambushes
at Xuanzhou, Qizhou, Zizhou, and so on.

632
00:28:20,756 --> 00:28:23,556
Since I'm waiting here,
that means I'm showing you my sincerity.

633
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:29,477
The three locations you chose
for the ambush are pretty good.

634
00:28:30,197 --> 00:28:32,197
Why don't you set up ambushes
like you intended

635
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:34,437
and fight me to the death?

636
00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:38,036
Great General,
if you return to Yingzhou now,

637
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:41,197
the court will definitely see the Cui Army

638
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:43,116
as a major threat.

639
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:45,560
I'm afraid they would order me
to command my army by then.

640
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:48,516
Great General Cui,
I don't want to engage you in battle.

641
00:28:49,596 --> 00:28:50,957
If we do engage each other in battle,

642
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:52,596
the people will suffer.

643
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:54,737
Great General, if you follow me
back to the capital,

644
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:56,237
I will do everything I can

645
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:58,477
to clear your name
and prove your innocence.

646
00:29:24,477 --> 00:29:25,516
Greetings, Mother.

647
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,717
Hurry and get up.

648
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,276
I made this embroidery.

649
00:29:30,276 --> 00:29:31,677
It's the trendiest design available.

650
00:29:32,076 --> 00:29:33,997
Let me make you
a pair of socks with this.

651
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,237
It's very exquisite.

652
00:29:47,877 --> 00:29:49,397
I can't bear to use it for my socks.

653
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:52,237
Grant Lady Gu a seat.

654
00:29:53,276 --> 00:29:55,036
Thank you.

655
00:29:57,477 --> 00:29:59,957
It must've been tough for you

656
00:30:00,197 --> 00:30:01,596
to come here and greet me every day

657
00:30:01,756 --> 00:30:03,157
ever since you lived
the Eastern Palace.

658
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:06,516
It's my duty to greet you
every morning and evening.

659
00:30:07,477 --> 00:30:09,437
Just now, His Majesty was telling me

660
00:30:10,197 --> 00:30:11,596
that the crown prince

661
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:15,437
should return after another week.

662
00:30:16,556 --> 00:30:17,877
Once he is back,

663
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:19,717
you don't need to come here every day

664
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,917
since you two are newlyweds.

665
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:24,717
You should serve
the crown prince instead.

666
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:29,356
Your Majesty!

667
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:30,677
Prime Minister Gu.

668
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:31,637
Your Majesty,

669
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:33,756
His Highness has
passed through Chongjia Gate

670
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:35,356
together with Great General Cui.

671
00:30:35,397 --> 00:30:36,157
What?

672
00:30:36,957 --> 00:30:38,677
He is back already?

673
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,276
And, he did bring Cui Yi

674
00:30:40,356 --> 00:30:42,076
back with him, huh?

675
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:49,788
(Cui Residence)

676
00:30:59,197 --> 00:30:59,796
Great General.

677
00:31:03,717 --> 00:31:04,356
Father!

678
00:31:06,836 --> 00:31:07,516
Father.

679
00:31:09,197 --> 00:31:10,717
Father, why did you come back?

680
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:11,756
I'm back.

681
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:14,356
Let's talk inside.

682
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:32,036
Your Highness!

683
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:32,997
Your Highness!

684
00:31:34,516 --> 00:31:35,376
What are you doing here?

685
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:36,920
Great General Cui has
returned to his residence.

686
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,800
Their residence is safe for now.
That's why I rushed here.

687
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,997
There's something important
I have to tell you, Your Highness.

688
00:31:41,756 --> 00:31:42,316
What is it?

689
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:44,556
His Majesty granted you
a lady of excellence

690
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:46,237
while you were away.

691
00:31:47,796 --> 00:31:49,756
It's Gu Wan'niang, the daughter
of Prime Minister Gu.

692
00:31:50,237 --> 00:31:50,836
What?

693
00:31:51,197 --> 00:31:52,997
Lady Gu is already
at the Eastern Palace.

694
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,800
Lady of excellence
is inferior to the crown princess.

695
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,047
They can be sent to the Eastern Palace

696
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,840
once the Ministry of Rites
conducts the necessary rite.

697
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,316
Your Highness!

698
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,076
Your Highness!

699
00:31:59,157 --> 00:31:59,717
Your Highness!

700
00:32:00,997 --> 00:32:02,836
Your Highness,
judging from your expression,

701
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:05,836
you must've talked back to His Majesty
due to the incident with Great General Cui.

702
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:08,836
If you barge into the palace now
and fall out with His Majesty

703
00:32:08,957 --> 00:32:10,116
because of Gu Wan'niang,

704
00:32:10,356 --> 00:32:11,677
it'll be detrimental to us in every way.

705
00:32:13,637 --> 00:32:14,237
Right now,

706
00:32:14,756 --> 00:32:16,316
clearing Great General Cui's name

707
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:18,237
and appointing Miss Cui
as the crown princess

708
00:32:18,596 --> 00:32:20,276
are our priorities.

709
00:32:46,116 --> 00:32:46,917
Let's eat.

710
00:33:04,877 --> 00:33:06,076
Father, why did you come back?

711
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:10,036
I was thinking

712
00:33:10,437 --> 00:33:11,677
that you were all alone here.

713
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:14,197
I came back to prevent that brat

714
00:33:14,477 --> 00:33:15,237
from bullying you.

715
00:33:17,437 --> 00:33:18,036
What's wrong?

716
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:19,677
Ying, are you upset

717
00:33:20,877 --> 00:33:22,596
because I came back late?

718
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:26,637
I know.

719
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:28,437
Father, you came back

720
00:33:28,437 --> 00:33:29,076
because of me.

721
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:31,796
All those petty fellows

722
00:33:32,397 --> 00:33:33,356
tried to frame me.

723
00:33:33,836 --> 00:33:35,397
I came back to see

724
00:33:35,836 --> 00:33:37,276
the kind of despicable scums they are

725
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,276
for them to commit such a heinous deed.

726
00:33:49,437 --> 00:33:50,197
What's wrong?

727
00:33:52,637 --> 00:33:53,796
I'm just upset.

728
00:33:54,477 --> 00:33:55,717
Father, by coming back,

729
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:57,036
you're walking into the trap yourself.

730
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:00,157
You knew

731
00:34:00,316 --> 00:34:01,157
that I wouldn't be able

732
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:03,877
to get married to Li Ni
if you didn't come back.

733
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,437
You came back because of me.

734
00:34:07,076 --> 00:34:08,757
It's fine no matter
if you get married to him or not.

735
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:10,917
However, I'm unwilling

736
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:12,397
to be seen as a traitor.

737
00:34:12,596 --> 00:34:14,080
I don't want you to suffer grievances.

738
00:34:18,797 --> 00:34:19,957
All right now.

739
00:34:20,277 --> 00:34:21,196
Don't be upset.

740
00:34:22,196 --> 00:34:23,196
I'm fine.

741
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:27,437
Let's eat.

742
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,036
Your Highness, you're back.
Do we need to prepare your bath?

743
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:01,716
Your Highness!

744
00:35:01,997 --> 00:35:02,997
Your Highness!

745
00:35:03,277 --> 00:35:03,877
Your Highness!

746
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:05,917
Your Highness! Please save my young lady!

747
00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:06,357
No.

748
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,797
Please save Lady Gu!

749
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:09,917
When she heard that you were coming back,

750
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:11,997
she told me to get some snacks.

751
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:12,477
After that,

752
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:14,757
she tried to hang herself!

753
00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:19,076
Young Lady!

754
00:35:19,477 --> 00:35:20,236
Young Lady!

755
00:35:21,397 --> 00:35:22,196
Young Lady!

756
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:23,837
His Highness is here.

757
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:26,236
Young Lady! His Highness
is here to see you!

758
00:35:26,317 --> 00:35:27,076
Young Lady!

759
00:35:27,397 --> 00:35:28,676
His Highness is here!

760
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:39,997
Help me up.

761
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:51,196
Your Highness,
sorry to make you worried.

762
00:35:51,877 --> 00:35:52,680
You may lie down.

763
00:35:54,437 --> 00:35:55,716
His Majesty granted us a marriage,

764
00:35:56,757 --> 00:35:59,757
making me your lady of excellence.

765
00:36:00,317 --> 00:36:03,236
Initially, I wanted to take my own life
in my residence.

766
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:06,196
However, I was afraid that I'd
implicate my father

767
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,116
for going against the imperial edict.

768
00:36:11,556 --> 00:36:12,397
I was thinking

769
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:14,317
that I could take my own life

770
00:36:15,196 --> 00:36:16,477
after Your Highness

771
00:36:16,797 --> 00:36:18,277
has returned to the capital.

772
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,437
However, I never expected Qiucui

773
00:36:21,877 --> 00:36:23,076
to bump into me.

774
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:25,196
Your Highness,

775
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:28,357
I'm willing to be a nun for your sake.

776
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:30,877
You can't even speak properly.

777
00:36:31,716 --> 00:36:32,397
You should rest.

778
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:34,560
Rest and recuperate for a few days.

779
00:36:35,437 --> 00:36:36,437
Your Highness,

780
00:36:36,957 --> 00:36:37,676
I'm not willing

781
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:42,156
to cause a strain on your relationship
with Miss Cui.

782
00:36:42,957 --> 00:36:45,397
I know my existence is unnecessary.

783
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:49,837
I'm willing to die for your sake.

784
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:53,516
You're still young.

785
00:36:54,636 --> 00:36:55,997
Why are you talking about death?

786
00:36:57,596 --> 00:36:58,556
There were too many people

787
00:36:58,556 --> 00:36:59,397
who died in front of me

788
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:00,917
while I couldn't save them.

789
00:37:02,516 --> 00:37:04,196
Do you know how many people

790
00:37:04,877 --> 00:37:05,997
in the world

791
00:37:05,997 --> 00:37:07,556
who only wish for a peaceful life?

792
00:37:08,957 --> 00:37:09,596
You're someone

793
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:10,596
who has the privilege to live,

794
00:37:11,317 --> 00:37:12,397
yet you want to seek death.

795
00:37:13,757 --> 00:37:14,757
Your Highness.

796
00:37:16,556 --> 00:37:17,317
Rest and recuperate.

797
00:37:19,716 --> 00:37:20,636
Your Highness!

798
00:37:21,797 --> 00:37:22,477
Your Highness!

799
00:37:23,757 --> 00:37:24,477
Your Highness!

800
00:37:25,437 --> 00:37:26,196
Your Highness!

801
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:33,196
Young Lady!

802
00:37:34,357 --> 00:37:35,156
Young Lady!

803
00:37:41,036 --> 00:37:42,957
Call me Lady Gu.

804
00:37:49,357 --> 00:37:51,437
Since you forbade me to seek death

805
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:54,676
and didn't take advantage of
the situation to make me a nun,

806
00:37:55,636 --> 00:37:56,676
in the future,

807
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:59,797
I'll be your lady of excellence.

808
00:38:05,196 --> 00:38:07,957
The court has been arguing
over this for many days.

809
00:38:08,357 --> 00:38:09,556
But today, His Majesty

810
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:11,437
actually issued an edict

811
00:38:11,437 --> 00:38:15,196
and convicted Cui Yi of treason.

812
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:18,676
His Highness investigated
the case for many days but to no avail.

813
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:20,036
This happened

814
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:21,757
all because of Jia Li's statement.

815
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:23,917
However, Jia Li was silenced.

816
00:38:24,357 --> 00:38:25,397
Now, there's only Liu Chengfeng,

817
00:38:25,397 --> 00:38:26,516
who's barely alive.

818
00:38:26,516 --> 00:38:27,837
He's bent on maligning
Great General Cui.

819
00:38:28,596 --> 00:38:29,397
But now,

820
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:31,357
we cannot confront Jieshuo
over this case.

821
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:33,040
Naturally, there's no way
to procure evidence.

822
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:36,797
This is an elaborate set-up.

823
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:39,877
It's obvious that they're trying
to get rid of Cui Yi here.

824
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:41,116
But Father,

825
00:38:42,036 --> 00:38:43,917
His Highness is still insisting
that Great General Cui

826
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:45,556
is innocent inside the palace.

827
00:38:48,797 --> 00:38:50,317
Look at the weather.

828
00:38:50,477 --> 00:38:54,036
I'm afraid it'll rain soon.

829
00:38:57,317 --> 00:38:57,877
Father,

830
00:38:58,997 --> 00:39:01,477
will His Highness be able to convince
His Majesty to change his mind?

831
00:39:02,116 --> 00:39:03,837
His Majesty was prejudiced against

832
00:39:04,196 --> 00:39:06,076
Cui Yi and his daughter
in the first place.

833
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:07,877
And, His Majesty

834
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:09,116
isn't close to His Highness.

835
00:39:09,877 --> 00:39:12,676
And, I have the feeling that someone

836
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:15,516
was instigating His Majesty in secret.

837
00:39:16,236 --> 00:39:17,317
I'm afraid

838
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:20,917
His Highness won't be able
to convince him to change his mind.

839
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,069
(Chaoqian Hall)

840
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:01,477
Your Majesty,

841
00:40:02,397 --> 00:40:04,797
you've made the crown prince
kneel outside the palace

842
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:06,636
for the entire afternoon.

843
00:40:07,236 --> 00:40:08,277
If this continues,

844
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:09,877
I'm afraid he'll be...

845
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:10,556
Forget about him.

846
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:12,716
That rebellious brat,

847
00:40:12,716 --> 00:40:14,520
he only knows how to
coerce me into doing his bidding.

848
00:40:15,156 --> 00:40:17,116
He insisted on saying
that Cui Yi was innocent.

849
00:40:18,076 --> 00:40:19,357
He's defending him so much.

850
00:40:19,636 --> 00:40:21,837
Does he think Cui Yi
is his biological father?

851
00:40:23,277 --> 00:40:23,997
Your Majesty!

852
00:40:33,957 --> 00:40:35,757
Your Majesty, I know you're frustrated.

853
00:40:36,716 --> 00:40:37,797
But the crown prince

854
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:40,477
is just troubled by his relationship.

855
00:40:40,477 --> 00:40:41,636
That rebellious brat!

856
00:40:42,116 --> 00:40:43,997
I selected such
a great lady of excellence for him!

857
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,676
But he didn't even look at her!

858
00:40:46,636 --> 00:40:47,877
And now,

859
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:49,397
he's even risking his life for Cui Yi

860
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:51,716
for his daughter's sake.

861
00:40:53,837 --> 00:40:55,516
Your Majesty, don't be angry.

862
00:40:56,596 --> 00:40:59,036
The crown prince sustained
serious injuries before this.

863
00:40:59,477 --> 00:41:02,477
And, he left the city
to intercept Cui Yi on your behalf

864
00:41:02,477 --> 00:41:03,457
not long after his recovery.

865
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:06,516
He's already traveled-worn.

866
00:41:07,277 --> 00:41:08,477
Even if he didn't render any merit,

867
00:41:08,556 --> 00:41:09,757
you should appreciate his effort.

868
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:12,277
It's pouring out there.

869
00:41:12,957 --> 00:41:14,400
You should tell him
to get a change of outfit

870
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:15,556
so that he won't catch a cold.

871
00:41:16,116 --> 00:41:17,917
You should tell the crown prince
to get up first.

872
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,156
Just let him kneel.

873
00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:22,116
He's stubborn, isn't he?

874
00:41:22,636 --> 00:41:24,397
I'll only let him get up

875
00:41:24,636 --> 00:41:25,556
if he admits his fault.

876
00:41:29,397 --> 00:41:30,357
Your Majesty,

877
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,917
he's the only son you have now.

878
00:41:47,277 --> 00:41:47,877
Your Highness!

879
00:41:47,997 --> 00:41:49,236
His Majesty ordered you to get up!

880
00:41:49,236 --> 00:41:51,080
He ordered me to help you
change into a new set of attire.

881
00:41:52,556 --> 00:41:53,116
Your Highness!

882
00:41:56,757 --> 00:41:57,757
Tell His Majesty

883
00:41:58,196 --> 00:41:59,676
that I won't get up

884
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,997
until he clears Cui Yi's name
and selects his daughter

885
00:42:04,317 --> 00:42:05,116
as the crown princess.

886
00:42:05,797 --> 00:42:06,837
Your Highness, you...

887
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:08,757
You're putting me on the spot here.

888
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:10,076
Tell him what I said word for word!

889
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,116
Yes, Your Highness.

890
00:42:11,556 --> 00:42:12,757
I would've returned to Laolan Pass

891
00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:14,877
had this happened in the past.

892
00:42:15,997 --> 00:42:17,877
Now, I cannot just leave the world
in the lurch.

893
00:42:18,676 --> 00:42:19,997
Tell His Majesty to figure out

894
00:42:21,397 --> 00:42:23,076
whether maligning Cui Yi
is more important

895
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:25,676
than preserving Li Ni's life.

896
00:42:27,997 --> 00:42:28,477
Here!

897
00:42:29,676 --> 00:42:30,397
Go now!

898
00:42:31,397 --> 00:42:32,360
Yes, Your Highness!

899
00:43:21,156 --> 00:43:21,917
Father,

900
00:43:22,997 --> 00:43:23,877
time to take your medicine.

901
00:43:25,957 --> 00:43:27,156
It's a rainy day.

902
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:30,837
Your body will be sore
from the old wounds you sustained.

903
00:43:32,036 --> 00:43:33,236
Why are you still standing outside?

904
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:35,477
Indeed.

905
00:43:35,997 --> 00:43:38,957
My body is sore indeed.

906
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:43,036
It doesn't look like

907
00:43:44,076 --> 00:43:45,676
the rain is going to stop anytime soon.

908
00:43:58,491 --> 00:44:00,155
(Chaoqian Hall)

909
00:44:08,837 --> 00:44:09,716
Your Highness!

910
00:44:13,596 --> 00:44:15,636
Your Highness, please get up!

911
00:44:15,636 --> 00:44:17,516
I'm begging you!

912
00:44:17,516 --> 00:44:19,156
I'm begging you!

913
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,917
There's no need to do this out of spite!

914
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:22,357
Your health is more important!

915
00:44:22,357 --> 00:44:23,917
Your Highness! I'm begging you!

916
00:44:24,156 --> 00:44:24,957
Please get up!

917
00:44:26,357 --> 00:44:27,036
Out of spite?

918
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:29,596
It's not the doing of a wise ruler

919
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,436
to let a loyal subject suffer grievances

920
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:33,716
and be harmed.

921
00:44:35,036 --> 00:44:36,076
Great General Cui,

922
00:44:37,397 --> 00:44:39,757
he saved His Majesty's life before.

923
00:44:41,397 --> 00:44:43,040
Do you think
I'm doing this out of spite?

924
00:44:43,997 --> 00:44:45,116
How could His Majesty

925
00:44:45,116 --> 00:44:46,477
do such a silly thing?

926
00:44:47,516 --> 00:44:49,036
He fell for our enemies' trick.

927
00:44:49,757 --> 00:44:51,277
How could he be a ruler like this?

928
00:44:52,196 --> 00:44:54,076
