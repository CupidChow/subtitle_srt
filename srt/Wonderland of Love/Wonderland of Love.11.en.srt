29
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:12,481
Cui Li, why are you blocking me?

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,120
Collaborating with the enemy,

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,521
collaborating with the Zhenxi Army.

32
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:16,784
Why?

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,280
Are you not going to confess?

34
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,820
Do you have any evidence?

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,201
This is a secret letter from Li Ni

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,680
of the Zhenxi Army wrote to you.

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,921
You gave the Zhenxi Army

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,201
every detail of the situation
of the besieged Yingzhou.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,201
The letter is crystal clear.

40
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,400
How did you get your hands
on this letter?

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,641
Why?

42
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,740
You're finally admitting it now.

43
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,041
It's rock-solid evidence.

44
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,641
If it weren't for you,

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,880
we didn't have to

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,120
hand over Luoyang City
to the Zhenxi Army.

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,321
Arrest her!

48
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:50,000
Stop it!

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,321
Shiqi, you're finally back.

50
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,560
Did anything happen?

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,800
We received an urgent military report.

52
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:03,120
Li Jun and Li Lai and their troops

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,720
are closing into Luoshui.

54
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:07,921
It looks like

55
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,720
Sun Jing has long withdrawn his men

56
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,560
from besieging my brothers.

57
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,120
Those two brothers of mine

58
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,361
sure don't disappoint me.

59
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,321
What are you doing?

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,600
Lin, you're here just in time.

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,081
I've long suspected

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,840
that Lieutenant He has been contacting Li Ni
from the Zhenxi Army in secret.

63
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,000
It was she

64
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,720
who leaked many of our military secrets.

65
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,160
This is the evidence.

66
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:47,000
It was Lieutenant He

67
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,440
who leaked the news
about Yingzhou being besieged.

68
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
It was the reason

69
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:52,560
we had to surrender Luoyang City.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,720
If Lieutenant He doesn't die,

71
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,801
how can we face the soldiers

72
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:58,160
who have fought valiantly
on the battlefield?

73
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,720
Lin,

74
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,280
I know you have a soft heart.

75
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,000
So,

76
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:06,321
let me handle this for you.

77
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,950
So, you don't have to worry.

78
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:09,481
Guards!

79
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,081
Stop it!

80
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:16,441
Cui Li,

81
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,800
Taozi wrote this letter.

82
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,110
Young Master is aware
of this matter as well.

83
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,121
Recently, Lieutenant He noticed
unusual activity

84
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
within the army.

85
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,240
After she reported this to me,

86
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,840
she deliberately wrote this letter as bait

87
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,641
to see

88
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:37,720
who would fall for it.

89
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
You set me up.

90
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,480
The letter is in my camp.

91
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,240
If you didn't send someone to steal it

92
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,540
because of your malicious intent,

93
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,321
how would it have ended up
in your hands?

94
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,121
Lin, I...

95
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,561
I did this

96
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:59,360
because she's behaving
very suspiciously.

97
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:01,360
I only wanted to assist you.

98
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:02,759
You have to believe me.

99
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,540
I was only trying to...

100
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:04,280
Father trained

101
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,561
the Cui Army.

102
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,521
Our soldiers are united

103
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:09,321
and follow a strict military code.

104
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,840
We've never had any internal conflicts

105
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,400
or power struggles.

106
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,160
Cui Li, since you arrived,

107
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:18,641
you've repeatedly tried
to frame your comrades!

108
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:19,881
Do you think

109
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:21,600
I didn't notice

110
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,521
your little schemes and ideas?

111
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:27,521
When one frames his comrade,

112
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,040
what is the punishment
according to the Cui Army's regulations?

113
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,881
Those who frame comrades
will be stripped of their military power

114
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:35,160
and receive thirty strokes.

115
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,600
Cui Li, your five thousand soldiers

116
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,280
will be temporarily commanded by Shu.

117
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,160
Since this is your first offense,

118
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:45,480
we'll skip the rod punishment.

119
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,040
Lin...

120
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,881
Go!

121
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,110
This time, we managed to take the opportunity
to reclaim Cui Li's military power.

122
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,201
I believe

123
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:02,280
he can't stir up any trouble now.

124
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:08,121
Young Master,

125
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,920
are you all right?

126
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,600
Did you catch a cold
from staying outside too long?

127
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,521
I'll have Taozi come

128
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:15,800
and check your pulse.

129
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,840
Ying,

130
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,920
where did you go

131
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,441
when you left the camp today?

132
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:29,280
I went to see Li Ni.

133
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,280
Li Ni is the commander
of the Zhenxi Army!

134
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:35,040
You shouldn't have gone
and met him privately multiple times!

135
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:38,521
I know

136
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:41,121
you don't want to hear me
say this right now.

137
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:42,600
But

138
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:43,920
as you saw today,

139
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,800
we set up a trap,

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,210
waiting to lure the snake
out of its hole.

141
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,681
You went out on your own

142
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,441
and gave Cui Li a chance
to intercept you.

143
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:52,521
What if he had really attacked you?

144
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,081
Don't worry, Young Master.

145
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
A mere Cui Li

146
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:56,641
can't do anything to me.

147
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:02,681
Ying,

148
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,561
I know you're confident and prepared.

149
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,840
But things are unpredictable in a fight.

150
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,720
If you had gotten hurt for real,

151
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,920
how could I feel at ease?

152
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,280
Young Master, here.

153
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,561
Have some tea.

154
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:22,840
Drink it.

155
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,760
Are you feeling better?

156
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:35,600
Ying,

157
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,040
do you know something?

158
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,720
You mean more to me

159
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,280
than anything else.

160
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:50,121
Even...

161
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,360
Even more than myself.

162
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:04,441
We grew up together.

163
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,840
I've always regarded you
as an older brother.

164
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:11,840
So, you're also important

165
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,160
to me.

166
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:21,761
Yes,

167
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,840
we share a sibling-like bond.

168
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:29,121
Saying these

169
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,321
unexpectedly...

170
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,520
Unexpectedly makes us feel distant.

171
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:39,760
The physician has instructed

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,321
that you need a quiet rest.

173
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,321
So, I won't bother you anymore.

174
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,161
Get some rest.

175
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,281
All right.

176
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,561
At the latest, tomorrow,

177
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:21,720
Li Jun and Li Lai will lead their troops
to arrive in Luoyang.

178
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,321
Those two

179
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,600
have always been jealous

180
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,201
of your military achievements.

181
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,240
They must have come

182
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,561
with ill intentions this time.

183
00:09:28,961 --> 00:09:30,840
Shiqi, make up a plan.

184
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,000
Since my brothers have come,

185
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:36,760
we should leave

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and give up Luoyang City

187
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,120
to them.

188
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,000
Give up Luoyang City to them?

189
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
We fought hard

190
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,281
to take Luoyang.

191
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,380
And we even gave up three cities

192
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,180
in exchange for the withdrawal
of the Cui Army from Luoyang.

193
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,401
Now, do we just hand it over to them?

194
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,110
It's the same
if my brothers are stationed

195
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,041
in Luoyang City.

196
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,740
Quick and decisive action
is essential.

197
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:53,480
We'll head to Tong Pass.

198
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:55,240
How can it be the same?

199
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,196
(Tong Pass)

200
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:13,720
I get it now.

201
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:17,319
Tong Pass is strategically located
with the Wei River to the north,

202
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,199
Mount Qinling to the south,

203
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,110
Central Plains to the east,
and Guanzhong plain to the west.

204
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,080
Plus, it controls the post road
between Xichang and Luoyang.

205
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:23,420
It's highly contested military ground.

206
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,801
Sun Jing won't expect us

207
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:25,961
to abandon Luoyang.

208
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:27,321
This will catch him off guard.

209
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,000
Once we occupy Tong Pass,

210
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,360
it's like holding Xichang at its throat.

211
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,961
Then, we'll be close

212
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:35,401
to capturing Xichang.

213
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,681
That would be the best.

214
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:39,840
As long as we hold Tong Pass,

215
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,060
those brothers of yours
won't have anywhere to advance

216
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:44,561
or to retreat even if they want
to take any action.

217
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,520
Shiqi,

218
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
I thought

219
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
you would go soft

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,961
on those two.

221
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,161
It's good

222
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:52,441
to see you're not.

223
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,041
I'm just looking out
for my two older brothers.

224
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,020
They tend to be overly ambitious

225
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,520
and easily get carried away.

226
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:04,120
It's better to let them stay in Luoyang City.

227
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,600
Lest they fall into any traps,

228
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,040
and I have to go through great trouble
to rescue them.

229
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,120
Young Master.

230
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,420
Young Master, you're awake.

231
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,041
Where's Lieutenant He?

232
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:37,840
She stayed in her tent all night

233
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:38,801
and didn't go out.

234
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,360
Young Master,

235
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,921
the physician has checked on you.

236
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,201
He said you fainted twice.

237
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
You must worry less,

238
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
and focus on your recovery.

239
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,921
I know you're worried about Lieutenant He.

240
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,559
But sooner or later,

241
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,000
she'll know you're the nicest person
to her in the world, Young Master.

242
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,801
She's so intelligent.

243
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,360
Of course, she could feel

244
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:14,880
how well I treated her.

245
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:17,720
Then, you should feel at ease even more.

246
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,319
Lieutenant He isn't an ungrateful person.

247
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,220
Yesterday, you went to her rescue
despite being ill.

248
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,281
Seeing that,

249
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,760
she'll definitely feel moved.

250
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:28,801
But what I want from her

251
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:33,161
is never her gratitude

252
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:34,600
or repayment.

253
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,120
Master, stop drinking.

254
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,201
You haven't slept all night.

255
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:45,081
It's harmful to your health.

256
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,961
Cui Lin, you cunning fox.

257
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,000
You teamed up with Lieutenant He to trick me

258
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,760
and forced me
to hand over my military authority!

259
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,041
It seems

260
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,600
they're already suspicious of me now.

261
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,720
It won't be easy to act

262
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,480
in the future.

263
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:14,120
Master, we just received
a secret report.

264
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:16,760
The Zhenxi Army sent a letter
to Lieutenant He again.

265
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,801
Does Cui Lin know about this?

266
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,260
The secret letter was delivered directly
to Lieutenant He's tent.

267
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:23,921
The main camp is unaware of it.

268
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:25,201
So,

269
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,640
should we send someone to investigate?

270
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,120
After what happened yesterday,

271
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,520
Lieutenant He may lower their guard.

272
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,120
We may never know

273
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
if we find something.

274
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,401
As long as Cui Lin is here,

275
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:41,480
it won't be easy

276
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,041
to take action against Lieutenant He.

277
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:46,480
But if we can discover

278
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:47,640
any information,

279
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:50,081
it would be to our advantage.

280
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,041
So

281
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,840
order someone to investigate

282
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,240
the content of the secret letter.

283
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,161
Don't leave any trace.

284
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,321
(During my spare time,)

285
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,520
(I often admire personal artwork.)

286
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,300
(I'm currently creating
artwork diligently.)

287
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,260
(Is it possible for me to ask
for a beautiful portrait of you,)

288
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:14,161
(so I won't feel lonely?)

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,760
Lieutenant He,

290
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,300
aren't you going to reply to the letter?

291
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,441
Why are you rushing?

292
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,961
No, I'm not rushing.

293
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,760
The letter isn't for me.

294
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,640
Since you're not in a rush,

295
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,520
so I'll handle
some official documents first.

296
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,810
You can go back and get some rest.

297
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,920
You don't have to keep me company.

298
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,441
I'm not in a hurry.

299
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,441
But Xie Chang'er
who delivered the letter

300
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,681
is in a rush.

301
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,401
It's such a hot day.

302
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,921
He probably has gone back already.

303
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
You don't know

304
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,561
how stubborn that person is.

305
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,870
If you don't notify him
that you're not replying to the letter,

306
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,561
he'll definitely still
be waiting outside.

307
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,681
Lieutenant He,

308
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:04,921
I'll go and inform him, then.

309
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:07,520
I'm going now.

310
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,240
I'm going for real.

311
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:09,860
I...

312
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,600
Wait.

313
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,640
Since you're in a rush,

314
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,320
I'll just write one
to reply to his letter.

315
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,480
Lest our little Miss Taozi

316
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,921
made a trip for nothing.

317
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:20,360
All right.

318
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,600
I'll wait for you.

319
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:27,081
Lieutenant He, the scout reported

320
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,820
that the Zhenxi Army had withdrawn
from Luoyang.

321
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,401
Lord Liang's eldest son,
Lord Linzi, Li Jun,

322
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,420
has led his troop into the city.

323
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,321
By tonight,

324
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,321
Lord Liang's second son,
Lord Kuaiji, Li Lai,

325
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,600
will also arrive with his troops.

326
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,441
All right.

327
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:44,360
I didn't expect

328
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,840
Imperial Grandson
to be so accommodating

329
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,159
to his two older brothers.

330
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,410
He agrees to whatever they want.

331
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:49,961
But Lieutenant He,

332
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:51,921
where will he go

333
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,110
after leaving Luoyang?

334
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,681
Did he mention it in his letter?

335
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,921
Of course, he won't mention it
in the letter.

336
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:01,041
If he didn't mention it in the letter,

337
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,441
what do you all write about then?

338
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:07,561
Only some trivial matters.

339
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:09,948
(Please draw it yourself.)

340
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,681
Hello, Miss Taozi.

341
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,880
A letter our Lieutenant to His Highness.

342
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,720
Thank you, Miss Taozi.

343
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,720
I'll get going, then.

344
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,020
Are you leaving just like that?

345
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:35,000
Is there anything else?

346
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:40,600
What's this?

347
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,281
This is a special healing ointment
I personally formulated.

348
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,120
You can't buy it outside.

349
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,041
I thought,

350
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:50,681
with all your military activities,

351
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:51,520
there might be

352
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:52,760
some bumps and bruises.

353
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,520
If you use this,

354
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,201
you'll recover quickly.

355
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,360
Thank you, Miss Taozi.

356
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,570
You're a nice person.

357
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Stop talking nonsense.

358
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,201
I'll get going then.

359
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:05,361
Thank you!

360
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:08,841
What a fool.

361
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,590
(Last night,
I stayed in the countryside.)

362
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:27,240
(The moon was as clean
as if it was washed.)

363
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,540
(I felt like I could pluck the stars
from the sky.)

364
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,401
(A few days ago,
I visited Zhuque Lane in Dongdu)

365
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:33,400
(and bought some dried fruits.)

366
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:34,601
(They tasted delicious.)

367
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,300
(They broke like fine jade
as I chewed them)

368
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,910
(and enjoyed chewing them
through the long night.)

369
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,480
(I hope to share
this experience with you.)

370
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:45,170
♪A fated relationship♪

371
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:49,076
♪Yet, playing roles that shouldn't be♪

372
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:51,910
(I found combining dried nuts
with preserved fruits)

373
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,441
(enhances the flavor.)

374
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:57,161
(People in the past
enjoyed them separately.)

375
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:59,441
(But trying them together now,)

376
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,201
(the taste is intriguing.)

377
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:03,037
♪Cut off resentment and hatred♪

378
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:05,357

(The horse leaped over the stream
this morning.)

385
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:41,760
(Upon smelling the fragrance)

386
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,410
(and coming across
a wild cinnamon tree.)

387
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:46,600
(With its hidden aroma drifting
in the air,)

388
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:49,841
(I enjoyed this sight myself
with deep regret.)

389
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,040
(Then, I picked several flower buds)

390
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,240
(to create a fragrant sachet,)

391
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:57,841
(hoping we could enjoy it together
another day.)

394
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,401
Lieutenant He!

395
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:29,161
Lieutenant He, I've been looking for you.

396
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,201
So here you are.

397
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,240
What's the matter?

398
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,560
Nothing.

399
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,121
I just want to ask

400
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,040
if you're replying to his letter today.

401
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,810
Are you worried that Xie Chang'er

402
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:40,881
is in a rush again?

403
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,641
No.

404
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:44,480
I made an appointment with him

405
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,921
that Luoyang would be our meeting point

406
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,601
to exchange letters.

407
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,601
Luoyang as the meeting point?

408
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:53,720
Was it your idea

409
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:55,240
or Xie Chang'er's idea?

410
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:57,121
Xie Chang'er said,

411
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,841
it was Mister Shiqi who suggested

412
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:00,280
meeting in Luoyang

413
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:01,641
to make it easier to find each other

414
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,961
while marching.

415
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:04,560
Xie Chang'er is the one

416
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,361
who delivers messages
between the two armies.

417
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,560
By keeping track of when he arrives

418
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,681
and calculating

419
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,240
the speed of the horses,

420
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:12,720
it's quite easy to figure out

421
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:15,560
where the Zhenxi Army
is currently heading.

422
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:19,201
What?

423
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:21,280
Li Ni is so cunning.

424
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:24,000
Lieutenant He, only you

425
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:25,480
could guess

426
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,320
all his intricate thoughts
and intentions.

427
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,601
Does that mean

428
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,841
I'm cunning too?

429
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:30,961
No,

430
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:32,121
yours is wisdom.

431
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,161
So are you going to reply to his letter?

432
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:40,401
I don't know yet.

433
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,520
What do you mean you don't know?

434
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,780
Are you going to reply to him?

435
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,740
Well, I really don't know.

436
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,000
Well, will you write it?

437
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,740
Come on, write it.

438
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,420
Someone went inside your tent.

439
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:55,921
Taozi, come.

440
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,361
Let's take a walk.

441
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,681
Lieutenant He,

442
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,810
are we not going in
to catch that spy red-handed?

443
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:01,480
No matter.

444
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,110
Communicating with Li Ni using letters

445
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,401
was meant to lure out this spy.

446
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,921
Since they fell for it
and acted foolish again,

447
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,161
then let them be.

448
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:13,641
Master,

449
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:17,161
this is the letter Li Ni wrote
to Lieutenant He.

450
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,520
I thought of a way

451
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:20,800
and copied it word by word.

452
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:26,961
"I found combining dried nuts
with preserved fruits

453
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:29,441
enhances the flavor?

454
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:33,361
But trying them together now..."

455
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,841
What's this?

456
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,641
In my opinion,

457
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:40,441
Li Ni and Lieutenant He

458
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:42,121
are both shrewd individuals.

459
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
This letter appears normal
on the surface.

460
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:45,841
But it contains secret codes

461
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,641
with hidden messages.

462
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,980
That's why Lieutenant He

463
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,560
didn't hide the letter
in some hidden place.

464
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,710
She just left it out in the open

465
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,110
without being afraid of it being seen.

466
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,520
The phrase about combining dried nuts
and preserved fruits together

467
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
must be their secret code.

468
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,121
That makes sense.

469
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,480
How about we get someone

470
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:05,841
to decipher this letter?

471
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:07,520
Of course.

472
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:09,841
(Since our parting,)

473
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,480
(just a few days have passed,
yet it feels like years.)

474
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:16,601
(I have never felt like this before.)

475
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:19,040
(How I miss you so.)

476
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:33,320
(At sunset, I saw some plump
common water frogs.)

477
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,401
(I caught a few of them
and roasted them.)

478
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,480
(Too bad the fire was too intense,)

479
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,280
(and they got slightly burnt.)

480
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,377
(Letters)

481
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:03,601
Master!

482
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,480
After a lot of effort,

483
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,980
we've finally figured out
the secret behind the communication

484
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,220
between Lieutenant He and Li Ni.

485
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:10,161
Go on.

486
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:13,201
Upon leaving Laolan Pass,
Li Ni, Imperial Grandson,

487
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:15,359
has always excelled
in long-distance raids,

488
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,941
using deception
and diversion to create chaos.

489
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:17,520
This time,

490
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,401
he left Luoyang voluntarily.

491
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:21,441
I'm sure he's using the same tactic.

492
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:23,121
You have a point.

493
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,280
Keep going.

494
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,320
Master Cui, please take a look.

495
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,280
This letter is the most recent letter
that Lieutenant He received.

496
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,040
The phrase "caught a few"

497
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,201
typically refers

498
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,401
to a target staying by the lakeside.

499
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,720
By breaking down the phrase,

500
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:39,000
doesn't it suggest
an encircling strategy?

501
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:42,681
Then who's the target by the lakeside?

502
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,040
Now, isn't it a coincidence

503
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,161
that our army happened
to have passed by a lake

504
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,240
and is now located by the lakeside?

505
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:50,201
If nothing goes wrong,

506
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,560
at sunset today,

507
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,161
the Zhenxi Army will likely send someone
to join Lieutenant He,

508
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:56,121
coordinating an ambush
against our forces.

509
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,881
Master,

510
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,921
why not inform
the commander of this now?

511
00:24:01,121 --> 00:24:02,961
Then, we could set an ambush.

512
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:04,480
If we successfully repel
the Zhenxi Army,

513
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:06,560
it would be a significant achievement.

514
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,361
Indeed.

515
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:12,121
You fools!

516
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:13,601
Master, calm down.

517
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,560
Answer me.

518
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,080
Everyone knows that Li Ni
is trying to breach Tong Pass.

519
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,361
How can he simultaneously launch
an attack on us?

520
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:21,080
Uh...

521
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,921
It has already passed sunset.

522
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:27,760
So, where is Li Ni?

523
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,121
Answer me!

524
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:30,760
Master.

525
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,320
Oh, Master.

526
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,841
Useless bunch!

527
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:33,000
- What a useless bunch!
- Please, Master.

528
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:33,701
Get lost.

529
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,480
I said, get lost!

530
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:35,361
Yes.

531
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,401
We'll take our leave.

532
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:39,560
Where did you get these?

533
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,740
Cui Li has been ordering his men
to monitor Lieutenant He.

534
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,180
These are the letters
he copied secretly.

535
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,361
I obtained these

536
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,480
from Cui Li's tent.

537
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,480
But Lieutenant He knew

538
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:48,800
about Cui Li's action.

539
00:24:49,361 --> 00:24:50,441
But she didn't pursue it.

540
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,841
Master, calm down.

541
00:24:58,401 --> 00:24:59,720
I just remembered

542
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:00,961
something important.

543
00:25:01,361 --> 00:25:03,401
Previously, Lieutenant He used a letter

544
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:04,560
to set us up.

545
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:07,000
This reminds me

546
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:08,961
of how coincident it was.

547
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:11,520
It happened

548
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,681
after you met Pei Yuan.

549
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:18,601
Are you saying

550
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:21,240
that after I met with Pei Yuan,

551
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:23,361
he disclosed the plan to Lieutenant He?

552
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,601
The two collaborated to lure me in?

553
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,641
But shouldn't we

554
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,520
be on the same side

555
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:33,401
when it comes to killing Cui Lin?

556
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,760
If you want His Highness's letter,

557
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,000
it depends on
whether you can kill Cui Lin.

558
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
It appears
Li Ni has a close relationship

559
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,841
with Lieutenant He.

560
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Otherwise,

561
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:47,320
why would he share

562
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,961
such classified information with her?

563
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,681
I previously considered

564
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:54,800
using Li Ni's hand to eliminate Lieutenant He.

565
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,000
But now it seems

566
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:58,080
not only he won't assist us,

567
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:00,480
but he'll also be against me.

568
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,520
Master, be patient.

569
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,560
Those defending Luoyang

570
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,601
are Li Ni's two older brothers,

571
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,201
Li Jun and Li Lai.

572
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:10,881
They have always been at odds with him.

573
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,201
Why don't we join forces with them?

574
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:15,641
This way,

575
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,841
we can resolve our issue
of having no military authority.

576
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:23,121
Excellent idea.

577
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,240
(Tong Pass is a formidable stronghold,
easy to defend and difficult to attack.)

578
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:33,641
(Li Ni led his army
and they fought for six days.)

579
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:35,560
(With Pei Yuan leading the charge,)

580
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,520
(they finally captured Tong Pass.)

581
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:43,161
Congratulations, Your Highness.

582
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,040
After the Zhenxi Army recaptured Dongdu,

583
00:26:46,361 --> 00:26:48,841
they captured Tong Pass
not long after that.

584
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,961
Tong Pass?

585
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,000
That means they're not far

586
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:53,121
from Xichang anymore.

587
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,110
Yes, Your Highness.

588
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,881
They're getting close

589
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,681
to Xichang.

590
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:08,520
Li Ni chose not to contend
with his older brothers

591
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:10,760
and directly abandoned Luoyang.

592
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,641
He launched a surprise attack
on Tong Pass, which is 500 li away.

593
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,441
A bad bamboo can sometimes
yield good shoots.

594
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:20,480
Lord Liang

595
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,760
sure has a capable son.

596
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,161
Well, never mind that.

597
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,000
Lord Liang's three sons

598
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:27,641
are now close by.

599
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:29,520
As their father,

600
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,601
he has been held up in the capital
for a long time.

601
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,361
It's time for him
to write letters to his sons.

602
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:38,040
Sit.

603
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,000
Shiqi, how did the battle go?

604
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,681
Sit.

605
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:47,760
The overall situation is settled.

606
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,961
Don't pursue a desperate foe.

607
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:49,881
What about you?

608
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,921
Are you all right?

609
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,121
These are just flesh injuries.

610
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:56,201
Great.

611
00:27:56,681 --> 00:27:58,161
After battling hard for so long,

612
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,161
we've finally taken Tong Pass.

613
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,121
My father said

614
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,881
Tong Pass is known
as the strongest stronghold.

615
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:05,260
Since the founding of the nation,

616
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:07,480
no army has been able to capture it.

617
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,161
In the future,

618
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,161
the Zhenxi Army can leave its mark
in the annals of imperial history.

619
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,870
Now, the situation has shifted
from attack to defense.

620
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:15,921
So after this,

621
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,201
you'll only have to worry

622
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:19,240
about how to defend Tong Pass.

623
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,000
Shiqi,

624
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:26,320
is there another Zhenxi Army in this world?

625
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,220
There's also no other Shiqi
in this world.

626
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,361
Then, the world doesn't have

627
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,480
another courageous Pei Yuan.

628
00:28:33,641 --> 00:28:34,681
Don't flatter me.

629
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
But Shiqi,

630
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:37,760
I have a question.

631
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,601
You know it's impossible.

632
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,921
Why did you write letters

633
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:42,520
to Lord Kuaiji and Lord Linzi,

634
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:44,401
asking them to jointly encircle Xichang?

635
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,760
My two older brothers
are as stubborn as mules

636
00:28:48,881 --> 00:28:50,161
from being spoiled by my father.

637
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:51,921
If you want to go west,

638
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,681
they will insist on going east.

639
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,040
I don't want them
to act rashly and send troops

640
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,560
to cause trouble to fight over merits

641
00:28:57,961 --> 00:28:59,361
at a critical moment like this.

642
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,110
So of course, I have to write letters
to them to join the encirclement.

643
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:02,881
When I do this,

644
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,401
they're less likely to listen to me,

645
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:05,961
and naturally remain idle,

646
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:07,161
without taking any action.

647
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:09,361
This is called reverse psychology.

648
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,260
Saying one thing but doing the opposite.

649
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,972
(Luoyang)

650
00:29:15,274 --> 00:29:16,107
(Recipient, Brother.)

651
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:21,279
(Lord Linzi, Li Jun)

652
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,410
(Please lead the troops. I'll siege
and recapture the capital.)

653
00:29:23,493 --> 00:29:24,758
(Lord Kuaiji, Li Lai)

654
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:29,280
Jun, what did he write in the letter?

655
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,320
Read it yourself.

656
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,320
Li Ni has captured Tong Pass.

657
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:39,240
He wants us

658
00:29:39,441 --> 00:29:41,240
to deploy troops to surround Xichang?

659
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:43,520
Jun, what is he...

660
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:46,681
Li Ni dares

661
00:29:46,881 --> 00:29:48,441
to order us around

662
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:50,320
by relying on his achievement

663
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,841
in taking Tong Pass!

664
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,441
Jun, being ordered around is one thing.

665
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,641
But deploying troops to surround Xichang

666
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:01,841
is a serious matter.

667
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:04,121
I'm afraid he intends to use our troops

668
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:05,841
to help him achieve his goals.

669
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:13,000
I've long known

670
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,080
that Li Ni is treacherous.

671
00:30:15,961 --> 00:30:18,000
We can't

672
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
let his plans succeed.

673
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:25,121
Jun,

674
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,601
didn't Cui Li of the Cui Army

675
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,441
send a messenger here a few days ago?

676
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:31,480
You mean...

677
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,841
Jun,

678
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,361
I think

679
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,161
we can lend troops to Cui Li

680
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,760
because he's lending the troops
to kill Cui Lin

681
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:40,080
and put the blame on Li Ni.

682
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:40,961
That way,

683
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:41,641
he'll become

684
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:42,720
a sharp blade

685
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:44,040
in your hands.

686
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,760
Young Master.

687
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,320
You have returned.

688
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,641
It must be a rough journey.

689
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,800
How is Father's health?

690
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,019
Great General is doing well.

691
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,180
But when he heard Young Master Cui Li
came here without permission

692
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,460
and interfered with military affairs,

693
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,320
he was furious

694
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:01,240
and ordered me
to bring the command badge to you.

695
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,480
This is great.

696
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:06,961
With this command badge,

697
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,000
I can order Cui Li back to Yingzhou.

698
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,270
Then I no longer have to worry
about him causing trouble.

699
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,240
I can't believe

700
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:14,881
Cui Lin resorted to all means
to obtain Uncle's command badge

701
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,401
to order me to depart back to Yingzhou

702
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,881
and not to follow the main army.

703
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,601
Cui Lin, you jerk.

704
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:23,760
Am I that dreadful to you

705
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,320
that you try every means
to transfer me away?

706
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:28,520
Master, calm down.

707
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,280
We have received a reply from Luoyang.

708
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,560
Why don't we read what it says?

709
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:44,154
(Grant the title
of Grand General Weiyang)

710
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:47,841
Master, what does it say?

711
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,520
Li Jun has agreed to send troops

712
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,240
to help me kill Cui Lin.

713
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,560
Once I succeed,

714
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,961
he'll appoint me
as Great General Weiyang.

715
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,560
Congratulations, Master.

716
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,641
Congratulations, Great General.

717
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,560
As long as Cui Lin is dead,

718
00:32:08,881 --> 00:32:10,161
I will command

719
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,681
the Cui Army rightfully.

720
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,921
At that time,

721
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:14,520
we can blame Li Ni

722
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:16,121
for everything.

723
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,201
Two birds with one stone.

724
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,000
Absolutely flawless.

725
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,280
No wonder it was so difficult
to conquer this place.

726
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,881
Look at the city walls

727
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:38,201
and the surrounding terrain.

728
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:40,040
It's truly a fortress

729
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,641
that's hard to breach.

730
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,580
When we tried to capture it,
it was tough.

731
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,560
But now that our roles have switched
to defense,

732
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:47,480
these natural defenses

733
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:48,760
are indeed advantageous.

734
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:50,121
It is, isn't it?

735
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,601
If Laolan Pass had half
of this natural advantage,

736
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,441
we wouldn't need

737
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,641
so many troops to defend it.

738
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,641
Is it another letter?

739
00:33:07,121 --> 00:33:07,961
Mister Shiqi,

740
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,240
you must be eagerly awaiting news.

741
00:33:16,224 --> 00:33:18,458
(Tong Pass)

742
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,760
Report!

743
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:21,720
An envoy from Xichang has arrived!

744
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,681
Grand Governor sent me
to convey his order.

745
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,980
The Zhenxi Army must withdraw from Tong Pass
within three days.

746
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,760
Outrageous!

747
00:33:32,921 --> 00:33:34,881
Did Sun Jing send you here to die?

748
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,760
General Pei Yuan.

749
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,280
Since I dared to come,

750
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,441
I'm not afraid of losing my life.

751
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,280
Also, there's a letter from Lord Liang

752
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
for you.

753
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,450
What if I insist on
not withdrawing the troops?

754
00:33:57,121 --> 00:33:58,401
If you don't withdraw,

755
00:33:58,921 --> 00:34:00,961
then three days from now at noon,

756
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,080
Your Highness
should prepare mourning attire

757
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:05,161
to mourn Lord Liang.

758
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,320
I suppose my father

759
00:34:07,441 --> 00:34:08,680
must have written three letters.

760
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,000
The other two
have already been sent to Luoyang

761
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,200
for my two brothers, right?

762
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:15,640
Yes.

763
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,241
I wonder,

764
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,801
compared to Your Highness
and your brothers,

765
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:23,200
which one of you is more filial?

766
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,510
Lieutenant He,

767
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,520
you still haven't finished
these dried nuts?

768
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:37,921
These were quite popular
in Dongdu at that time,

769
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,441
and people said they were delicious.

770
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,120
Many people rushed to buy them.

771
00:34:42,361 --> 00:34:44,640
You're good at remembering
all these details.

772
00:34:46,841 --> 00:34:47,721
Originally,

773
00:34:47,881 --> 00:34:50,881
everyone just ate dried nuts
and kernels.

774
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:52,361
But you prefer

775
00:34:52,361 --> 00:34:54,600
eating them with preserved fruits.

776
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,640
How could I not remember
something like that?

777
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,600
Moreover, kernels are indeed crispy
and fill the stomach,

778
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,401
quite delicious.

779
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:02,040
But,

780
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,200
it's been days now,

781
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:05,401
and Tong Pass

782
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,801
hasn't sent a single letter.

783
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,721
Are you worried about a certain someone

784
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,600
or Tong Pass?

785
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:14,080
Lieutenant He,

786
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:15,961
I'm talking about serious matters.

787
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,460
Perhaps something has happened
in the capital.

788
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,110
So he might not have the time
to write letters.

789
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:28,361
Lieutenant He,

790
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:30,441
who are you talking about?

791
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,361
Who is he?

792
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:37,160
Who is he?

793
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:39,000
Who is he?

794
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,480
Even dried nuts

795
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,401
can't stop you from talking.

796
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,361
All right, I'll stop.

797
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,000
But who is he?

798
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:58,841
Shiqi, an urgent report from Luoyang.

799
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,359
Lord Linzi and Lord Kuaiji

800
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,540
have already decided
to withdraw their troops from Luoyang.

801
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,400
(No movement from the enemy.)

802
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:04,720
My two brothers have always been filial

803
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,620
(Provisions are being transported)
since they were young.

804
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:08,241
It's no wonder

805
00:36:08,361 --> 00:36:09,801
my father has always cherished them.

806
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:12,480
Luoyang was originally an advantage

807
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,640
they took from you.

808
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:15,000
They naturally won't feel the pinch.

809
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,600
But now,

810
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,160
we're in a difficult situation.

811
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
We absolutely cannot let go of Tong Pass.

812
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,321
If Luoyang falls,

813
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:23,881
our army will be cut off.

814
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:25,281
But Sun Jing

815
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:26,640
is truly ruthless.

816
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:28,120
If we don't withdraw the troops,

817
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
he might really harm Lord Liang.

818
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:32,921
Shiqi, what do we do?

819
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:37,921
Shiqi!

820
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,321
From the emperor
to the common people,

821
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,310
we all believe in
the importance of being filial.

822
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:43,761
If we don't withdraw the troops,

823
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:45,640
Sun Jing might really kill Lord Liang.

824
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:46,600
When that happens,

825
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:47,761
there will be an uproar.

826
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,921
Those senior officials and army loyalists

827
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,321
will all turn against us.

828
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:54,921
Shiqi,

829
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,040
what should we do now?

830
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,640
Miss, you can't go.

831
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:00,281
If you go,

832
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,780
you'll be walking into a death trap.

833
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,841
Qiucui,

834
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,361
please don't stop me.

835
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,560
I've never been favored

836
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:08,480
by my parents at home.

837
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,921
I almost lost my life in Bingzhou.

838
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:13,801
If it weren't for Li Ni saving me,

839
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,000
I might have become

840
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,480
a mound of earth by now.

841
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,560
When he saved me,

842
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,520
he seemed like a god descending
from heaven.

843
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,160
At that moment, I thought,

844
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:26,600
perhaps he was the one
I'd been waiting for.

845
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:28,560
To repay him,

846
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:30,761
I'm willing to give everything,
even my life.

847
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,560
But Miss,

848
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:34,441
you've had a tough life
from a young age.

849
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,120
If you really lose your life
because of this,

850
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:40,160
I'm afraid there won't be anyone left
who truly cares about you.

851
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
Miss,

852
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,241
I want to go with you
and make it back to Xichang alive.

853
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:48,520
Li Ni captured Luoyang

854
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,600
and Tong Pass after.

855
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,200
He advanced like the raging wind,

856
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,281
showing he was not an ordinary man.

857
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:56,480
He'll have a bright future.

858
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,480
He's a person who values loyalty
and righteousness.

859
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,120
If I help him in times of danger,

860
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,721
he'll surely remember

861
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:06,160
and repay me with gratitude.

862
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:09,241
If I can help him now,

863
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,801
do I have to worry

864
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,040
about having no place here?

865
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:14,921
If I don't strive now, when should I?

866
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,000
Miss,

867
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,321
why do you suddenly

868
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:22,361
seem like a different person?

869
00:38:23,241 --> 00:38:26,040
Before, you never sought to compete
or vie for anything.

870
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,110
Sometimes, when servants
were disrespectful to you,

871
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:30,321
you wouldn't allow me
to stand up for you.

872
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,961
Qiucui,

873
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:35,321
I didn't strive

874
00:38:35,721 --> 00:38:37,600
because I didn't have the strength

875
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:39,361
or the opportunity to compete.

876
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:42,200
So why bother if it's in vain?

877
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,921
In the future,

878
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,721
you'll be my trusted confidant.

879
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:50,921
You must also learn

880
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
to assess situations

881
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:54,160
and choose when to act wisely.

882
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:56,680
That's what smart people do.

883
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,160
Greetings, General.

884
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:11,640
Greetings, General Pei Yuan.

885
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,110
Miss Gu, no need to be formal.

886
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,841
I have a confidential matter

887
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:21,560
to discuss with you.

888
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:27,801
Miss Gu, please speak.

889
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:31,480
I heard Sun Jing

890
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,321
uses Lord Liang to threaten you.

891
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:35,160
I'm willing to go to Xichang

892
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:36,721
to act on your behalf

893
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:38,321
and find a way to rescue Lord Liang.

894
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Do you have any plans?

895
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:46,040
In the capital,
many influential and loyal families

896
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:47,801
still support the country.

897
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,841
However, Sun Jing is too powerful.

898
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,120
So they dare not speak out.

899
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,040
Please provide a token to me.

900
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,401
When I return to the capital,

901
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,640
in your name,

902
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,220
I'll contact these noble families
in secret,

903
00:39:57,241 --> 00:39:58,881
and bribe the palace guards.

904
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,950
Perhaps, by using a strategic approach,
we might be able to rescue Lord Liang.

905
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:02,480
No,

906
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,961
it's too risky.

907
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,480
If Sun Jing finds out,

908
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,881
or if someone betrays you,

909
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,961
it could cost you your life and implicate...

910
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,160
I'm not afraid of death.

911
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,961
If I die for righteousness,

912
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,520
it would be an honorable death.

913
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:16,080
Even my father,

914
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,480
I'm sure you know

915
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,480
that he won't yield
to that traitor, Sun Jing.

916
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,080
He will surely agree with my decision.

917
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:28,841
Thank you for your loyalty, Miss Gu.

918
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,910
I've already made an arrangement
in the capital.

919
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
So you can rest assured.

920
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,480
Jin'niang,

921
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,600
did you say this letter

922
00:40:58,721 --> 00:41:00,080
was placed on the table,

923
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,441
but you don't know who delivered it?

924
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:04,441
Your Highness,

925
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,600
could it be a trap set
by Grand Governor?

926
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,721
No, it doesn't look like it.

927
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,801
This letter is full of cryptic words.

928
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:17,321
This letter is full of cryptic messages.

929
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:18,921
But I understand

930
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,801
what he's asking for.

931
00:41:21,361 --> 00:41:22,281
I think

932
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:25,160
Li Ni wants to join forces with me.

933
00:41:26,281 --> 00:41:28,281
He must have been planning this
for a long time

934
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,321
and finally had the confidence
to rescue Lord Liang.

935
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:32,961
Your Highness, do we...

936
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,361
Of course, we'll help him.

937
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,120
Do as what was written in the letter.

938
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,600
Move the orchid under the window.

939
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,680
Yes, Your Highness.

940
00:41:53,321 --> 00:41:54,401
This is great, Miss.

941
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,320
You don't need to take risks
by going to Xichang anymore.

942
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:58,841
His Highness will surely have a way
to rescue Lord Liang.

943
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,160
Although he hasn't explicitly revealed
the plan to me,

944
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:03,721
through this incident,

945
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I have become someone he trusts.

946
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:08,321
Miss, are you planning...

947
00:42:11,921 --> 00:42:14,441
Li Ni and Lieutenant He of the Cui Army

948
00:42:14,441 --> 00:42:15,841
often have close contacts.

949
00:42:15,841 --> 00:42:17,210
They seem to share
a romantic connection.

950
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,000
It's a good thing the Cui Army
has returned to Yingzhou.

951
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:21,881
So they'll be far apart.

952
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,080
If I'm someone he trusts,

953
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,721
I'll naturally find a way

954
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:28,160
to create some distance
between him and Lieutenant He.

955
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:30,961
If you could marry His Highness,

956
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,640
it would be great.

957
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,110
Then, no one in the mansion
would dare to look down on you.

958
00:42:35,801 --> 00:42:37,680
But it's too early
to talk about this now.

959
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:40,761
I wonder if His Highness will be able

960
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,881
to rescue Lord Liang this time.

961
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,921
To be honest,

962
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:48,040
whether or not Lord Liang
can be rescued

963
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,321
is entirely beneficial

964
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:52,281
for Li Ni.

965
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:54,520
Miss,

966
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,841
I don't understand.

967
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
If he successfully rescues Lord Liang,

968
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:03,520
it would naturally be great.

969
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,721
After that, Li Ni would have unrestricted
military power.

970
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:10,080
If he failed to rescue Lord Liang,

971
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:12,000
and Lord Liang was killed by Sun Jing.

972
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,480
Even in his grief,

973
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,480
he won't need to fear consequences.

974
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:19,480
Even if there is public criticism,

975
00:43:19,921 --> 00:43:21,961
as long as Li Ni
holds military authority,

976
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:24,841
who will dare to blame Li Ni
in the future?

977
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,321
Since Li Ni likes intelligent people,

978
00:43:31,961 --> 00:43:33,600
I don't need to hide my cleverness

979
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:35,560
in front of him.

980
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,961
Do you think

981
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,841
Li Ni will withdraw from Tong Pass

982
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,281
like his brothers?

983
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,000
What do you think?

984
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:49,881
If a battle is lost,

985
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,241
they can make a comeback.

986
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,721
But once people's trust is lost,

987
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,120
it's hard to get it back.

988
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,321
His brothers

989
00:43:55,441 --> 00:43:56,801
are already leaving Luoyang.

990
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,801
If Li Ni doesn't move,

991
00:43:58,921 --> 00:44:00,401
he'll be the subject of criticism.

992
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,680
I think he'll withdraw.

993
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,961
Li Ni is a clever schemer.

994
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,400
He likely already has a plan
to rescue Lord Liang.

995
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,600
Sun Jing is vigilant
in guarding Lord Liang.

996
00:44:08,721 --> 00:44:10,600
It won't be easy to rescue him.

997
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,910
So, he needs to think carefully
and come up with a plan.

998
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:15,040
Plus, he needs favorable timing,
location, and cooperation.

999
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,281
But I think Li Ni

1000
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,080
already has an arrangement

1001
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,560
for everything.

1002
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:22,680
Favorable timing,
location, and cooperation?

1003
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,520
What is considered favorable timing,
location, and cooperation?

1004
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:26,841
Taozi,

1005
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,761
do you still remember

1006
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:30,921
the medicine you formulated for him?

1007
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:33,680
Lieutenant He!

1008
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,721
Lieutenant He!

1009
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,560
Lieutenant He!

1010
00:44:39,961 --> 00:44:40,680
Lieutenant He,

1011
00:44:40,881 --> 00:44:42,080
urgent report from Yingzhou.

1012
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,000
