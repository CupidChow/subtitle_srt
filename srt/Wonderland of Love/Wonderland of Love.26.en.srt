29
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:43,947
Shiqi.

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,808
Through my secret investigation,
I didn't notice anything strange

31
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:48,008
in Lord Xin's Residence.

32
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,849
The usage of vegetable oil, sesame oil,

33
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,288
firewood and coal

34
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:53,168
doesn't differ much
from the usual usage.

35
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:54,969
I also checked Lord Xin's account

36
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:56,329
with the oil and coal suppliers

37
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:57,928
in previous years

38
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:00,209
and compared it
with the kitchen and woodshed.

39
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,368
Everything seems normal.

40
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:05,969
If there was no fuel for combustion,

41
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:07,969
why would the fire be so strong?

42
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:09,968
This is so strange.

43
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:10,729
Exactly.

44
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,590
I also investigated
the servants in the residence.

45
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:13,289
However,

46
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:15,169
I still didn't find any clue.

47
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:19,088
Shiqi.

48
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:22,289
See what Wan'niang brought you.

49
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:25,928
Nanny, why are you here?

50
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:27,729
Next time, send someone to inform me.

51
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:28,648
I'll go over.

52
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:31,169
It's just a short distance.

53
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:32,408
I can still walk.

54
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:35,848
Wan'niang purposely
went to Xiangji Temple

55
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:37,368
and requested the Heart Sutra

56
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,368
which the abbot copied by hand.

57
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:40,769
It is believed

58
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:43,009
that offering the Heart Sutra
before ancestral tablets

59
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:45,009
is the best way to accumulate blessings

60
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:46,209
and eliminate karma.

61
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:48,049
We are here to give it to you

62
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,410
so that you can offer it
in front of Madam Liu's tablet.

63
00:02:56,408 --> 00:02:56,808
Thank you.

64
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,081
(Heart Sutra)

65
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:26,729
Nanny.

66
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:28,088
Let me put it for you.

67
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,889
Beware of the fire.

68
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:40,329
What happened?

69
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,688
I wasn't paying attention just now.

70
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,540
I accidentally burnt a hole
in the embroidered portrait.

71
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,609
What should I do?

72
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,368
This is all my fault.

73
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:47,810
It's all right.

74
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,489
It's just a tiny hole.

75
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:51,729
Miss Gu, you don't
have to blame yourself.

76
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:53,688
However, this is Madam Liu's portrait.

77
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,140
It's all my fault for being careless.

78
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:56,569
Miss.

79
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:58,368
Since you burnt
a hole in the embroidery,

80
00:03:58,528 --> 00:03:59,928
why don't you fix it?

81
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,648
You are such a nimble-fingered person.

82
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,049
Last time, I accidentally dirtied

83
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:04,528
the white silk fan.

84
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:06,609
Then, you embroidered a butterfly on it.

85
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:08,128
It was so exquisite.

86
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,609
The stain couldn't be seen at all.

87
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:10,528
Your Highness,

88
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,329
please allow me
to take the portrait down

89
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:13,848
and fix the embroidery.

90
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:15,769
Shiqi,

91
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:17,968
hurry up and take it down.

92
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:20,848
Let Wan'niang embroider it here.

93
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,488
Miss Gu, sorry to have troubled you.

94
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,488
Your Highness, why did you say so?

95
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,088
I'm just mending what I've done.

96
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:51,449
Your Highness.

97
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,728
General Han, it's time
to take your medicine.

98
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,329
Thank you, Your Highness.

99
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:09,929
Is your injury

100
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:10,968
getting better?

101
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:12,010
It's a lot better now.

102
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:13,929
To be honest,

103
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:17,769
from the moment I rescued Your Highness,

104
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:19,968
I felt my injury

105
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,889
was not serious at all.

106
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:25,009
I also didn't expect

107
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,608
that I would see you again.

108
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:27,288
When I was

109
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,209
taken captive by Sun Jing,

110
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,129
I thought

111
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:32,168
I must die with integrity
if I really had to.

112
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:32,689
I must not

113
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:34,488
bring disgrace to the Li's family.

114
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,689
I never thought that I would be rescued.

115
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,720
After we have rescued you,

116
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:46,889
we were in a hopeless dilemma.

117
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:49,569
Fortunately, Lord Qin's subordinates

118
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:52,088
found us and informed Consort Xiao.

119
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:55,689
Her Highness allowed us
to stay here for a few days.

120
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,048
The situation
in the capital is complicated.

121
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:01,569
The Cui family relied
on their military power

122
00:06:02,408 --> 00:06:04,528
just like how Sun Jing used to be.

123
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:08,449
Although His Majesty is your uncle,

124
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:11,408
there are also people
with vile characters around him.

125
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,648
Lord Xin and Lord Qi

126
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:17,168
are the current emperor's own sons.

127
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:20,009
How they would see you

128
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:25,048
is still unclear.

129
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:40,608
Humans are born intrinsically
with a good and similar nature.

130
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:46,009
However, their natures
will change based on what they learn.

131
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:51,249
If a child does not receive proper
education, his good nature will change.

132
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:56,449
The way to educate a child well is
through total commitment and devotion.

133
00:06:56,648 --> 00:07:01,929
Mencius' mother shifted three times to
find the best place to bring up her son.

134
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,048
Once Mencius was absent from school,
she cut the cloth she was knitting.

135
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,608
Have you got used to living here?

136
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,889
In the private school,

137
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,209
many children are coming in and out.

138
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:15,329
The fact that we are hiding here

139
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,009
won't be noticeable.

140
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,488
This place is good.

141
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,270
When I heard the sound
of reading yesterday,

142
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:21,569
I felt at ease.

143
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:23,369
I've been hearing about private schools.

144
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:25,288
Now that I'm here,

145
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,190
I finally know
what a private school looks like.

146
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:29,009
It is good that Your Highness

147
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,689
likes studying.

148
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:34,209
I want to study more
and learn more skills

149
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:35,968
so that my mother will feel happy

150
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,449
when she sees me.

151
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:38,968
I've grown taller.

152
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,809
I've also learned more knowledge
compared to the past.

153
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,369
It's all my fault for being careless.

154
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,809
This type of silk is highly flammable.

155
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,929
Just a short contact
with the incense stick could cause a hole.

156
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,288
Even the golden threads
beneath were damaged.

157
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:10,168
Authentic golden threads like this
would shrink to small beads

158
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:11,889
when they are burnt and broken.

159
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:13,488
They are not like silk threads

160
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:14,728
that can be connected again.

161
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,180
The entire thread has to
be removed to redo the embroidery.

162
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,610
No wonder you asked me to
get this type of golden thread.

163
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:23,088
I didn't know a small bundle like this
could weigh this much.

164
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,380
The golden threads taken from
the Department of Clothing

165
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:27,009
have premium quality.

166
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:28,648
That is why they weigh so much.

167
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:30,408
Speaking of this,

168
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,608
a few years ago, the late emperor

169
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,960
banned the commoners from
doing embroidery using golden threads.

170
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:36,809
Everyone didn't dare to break the law.

171
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:37,848
Hence, they pasted

172
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:38,929
gold foil

173
00:08:39,088 --> 00:08:40,329
on the silk.

174
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,470
These are not considered
embroidery using golden threads.

175
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,710
Instead, these are gilded clothes,

176
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:44,929
so, it wasn't against the law.

177
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:47,848
In recent years, it has been
quite popular in the capital.

178
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:56,128
Your Highness.

179
00:08:58,209 --> 00:08:59,289
You said

180
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:01,728
this type of silk is highly flammable.

181
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:03,449
Yes.

182
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:05,968
If a lot of such silk were put together,

183
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:06,888
wouldn't they be

184
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:08,329
as flammable

185
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:10,289
as the oil chamber?

186
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:11,888
Of course.

187
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,289
I heard that at silk fabric shops
in the capital, there are high walls

188
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:17,768
and large tanks filled with water
outside the storeroom

189
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,100
just in case their neighboring shops
catch fire.

190
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:21,630
Otherwise, everything would be burned

191
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:22,929
and nothing could be retrieved.

192
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:30,728
Your Highness, are you all right?

193
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,569
Just now, you also said

194
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,608
that people in the capital
usually wear gilded clothes

195
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:39,180
and they paste gold foils on the fabric.

196
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:40,209
Yes.

197
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,649
Although it's only a thin film,

198
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,809
having it on the clothes
gives it a brilliant look.

199
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:46,209
It looks really nice.

200
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:50,728
When a real golden thread catches fire,

201
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:53,128
it shrinks to a small size.

202
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,790
When a real gold film catches fire,

203
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:55,809
the same happens.

204
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:58,649
Your Highness, what are you thinking?

205
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:00,809
Nothing.

206
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:02,569
Miss Gu.

207
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:04,529
I just remembered that I need to

208
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,008
tell Pei Yuan something important.

209
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,488
Please excuse me.

210
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:28,248
Shiqi.

211
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:30,008
Why are there some golden beads

212
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:33,248
in the soil taken from the backyard
of Lord Xin's Residence?

213
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:35,088
Go and check

214
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,289
whether the people
in Lord Xin's Residence

215
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:39,968
bought gilded silk in bulk recently.

216
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:41,569
Gilded silk?

217
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:42,569
Also,

218
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:46,049
investigate the confidants

219
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:47,608
of Lord Xin.

220
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,488
Check whether they
have also purchased gilded silk.

221
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:51,809
All right.

222
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:06,128
Young Master.

223
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,860
A news from the secret agent.

224
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,710
Lieutenant He, with only a troop of men,

225
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,410
is coming in Xichang's direction.

226
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,000
Is she coming to the capital?

227
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,600
She doesn't look like she plans to.

228
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:17,640
They are moving quite slowly.

229
00:11:18,608 --> 00:11:19,608
It's as if she's waiting

230
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:21,449
for someone.

231
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,728
She's probably waiting for Li Ni.

232
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:27,809
Her infatuation for Li Ni

233
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:30,809
will most probably be left unanswered.

234
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:34,569
Li Ni is such a pedantic person.

235
00:11:35,248 --> 00:11:36,209
At this point,

236
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,929
he still doesn't dare to tell Ying

237
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:39,689
that he wants to marry her.

238
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:43,209
As for Lord Xin and Lord Qi,

239
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:45,409
who do they think they are?

240
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:47,728
How dare they imagine marrying Ying?

241
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:50,128
Young Master.

242
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,649
Shall we give them a lesson?

243
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:55,810
There's no need to give the game away.

244
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:56,929
Yes.

245
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:00,569
It's good that Ying is coming out

246
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:02,248
from Luoyang.

247
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:05,289
At least she's no longer
with the Cui Army.

248
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:06,809
Otherwise,

249
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,360
it will be difficult for us
to get in on the ground.

250
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:14,128
I have sent people
to follow Lieutenant He secretly.

251
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:16,088
Pick a good time

252
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,169
and set up the maze secretly.

253
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:22,008
Do not let Cui Yi realise.

254
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:22,809
Understand.

255
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:26,368
Everything is clear now.

256
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,488
Indeed, Lord Xin
wanted to harm Consort Xin.

257
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,230
He ordered people
to send numerous gilded silk

258
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:34,049
to Consort Xin's room
for the reason of making clothes.

259
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:34,970
Then, fire was set.

260
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,768
Furthermore, on the night of the fire,

261
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,670
they also delayed
the rescue process on purpose.

262
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,649
One of them admitted that

263
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:41,488
they drugged

264
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:43,008
the food for Consort Xin

265
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:44,248
and her servants.

266
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:45,409
Therefore,

267
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:46,848
none of them woke up that night.

268
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:49,368
All of them were burned to death.

269
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:51,169
Li Jun!

270
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:53,128
Li Jun!

271
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:57,289
How could he be so vicious?

272
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:01,649
How could he be so vicious?

273
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:07,649
Consort Xin was married
to him for many years.

274
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,510
They had been through
difficult times together.

275
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:11,968
Now, we have

276
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,649
witnesses, material evidence,

277
00:13:13,768 --> 00:13:14,449
and statements,

278
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,110
but we still need to
identify the witness

279
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:17,529
who knows about the drugging.

280
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:20,768
Lord Xin is indeed disappointing.

281
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:24,728
Shiqi.

282
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:27,008
Do you really plan to report him

283
00:13:27,368 --> 00:13:28,368
in front of His Majesty?

284
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:31,608
Ever since Consort Dong passed away,

285
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:36,649
only Consort Xin cared for me.

286
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,248
She died so unjustly.

287
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:44,128
I must seek justice for her

288
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:46,608
in front of His Majesty.

289
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,888
- Long Live Your Majesty!
- Long Live Your Majesty!

290
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:55,488
Please rise.

291
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,409
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

292
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:03,209
Where is Lord Qin?

293
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:07,768
Your Majesty,

294
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,768
Lord Qin said he had
urgent military affairs.

295
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:11,289
He left the capital
early in the morning,

296
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,810
so he could not make it
to the morning meeting.

297
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,049
He asked me to request
a day's leave from Your Majesty.

298
00:14:17,128 --> 00:14:19,289
He always claims to have
military affairs to handle,

299
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:21,449
as if he is the only

300
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:23,049
busy person.

301
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:29,209
Your Majesty.

302
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:30,329
Cui Yi submits a letter

303
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:32,910
stating that he is willing
to marry his daughter to the prince.

304
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:33,929
I think

305
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:36,608
this matter should be
confirmed as soon as possible.

306
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:42,329
It's not good to ask Cui Yi

307
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:44,488
whether he wants to

308
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:45,768
marry his daughter

309
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:47,209
to Lord Qi or Lord Qin.

310
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:50,248
Your Majesty,
since Lord Xin is a new widower,

311
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:53,289
he could marry Miss Cui as well.

312
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:56,888
You have a point.

313
00:14:58,368 --> 00:14:59,169
Your Majesty.

314
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:00,888
Consort Xin has just passed away

315
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:01,929
not long ago.

316
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:05,968
I do not have the intention to remarry.

317
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:11,768
Lord Xin

318
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:15,049
is indeed a man
with affection and loyalty.

319
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,280
Why would a man
with affection and loyalty

320
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:22,248
plot a murder against his own wife

321
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:23,600
and do something extremely tragic?

322
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:36,329
Your Majesty.

323
00:15:36,888 --> 00:15:38,449
Lord Xin first drugged

324
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:40,449
Consort Xin and her servants.

325
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,008
Then, he placed bundles of silk
that are highly flammable in her room

326
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,980
and set the room on fire,
making it like an accident.

327
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:46,689
This caused the death of Consort Xin

328
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,848
and everyone staying there.

329
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,888
This is an unfounded accusation!

330
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:54,128
Li Ni! What are you talking about?

331
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:54,929
Your Majesty.

332
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:56,929
I have all the witnesses and evidence.

333
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,810
I left the capital early in the morning
to investigate this matter.

334
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:01,728
The person who sent the silk

335
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,310
and Lord Xin's confidants
who did the drugging

336
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:04,529
have been captured by me.

337
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:07,410
The testimony of the confidants
of Lord Xin as well as the evidence

338
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,169
have been sent to Dali Temple.

339
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,649
Your Majesty.

340
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,409
He is making an unfounded accusation!

341
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:15,449
I didn't do it!

342
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,728
I really didn't do any of these!

343
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:20,329
Father, please seek justice for me!

344
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:21,689
Those witnesses

345
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:23,169
are all serving in your residence.

346
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,010
Many of them
were assigned by His Majesty

347
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,510
and have been with you
since you were young.

348
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:35,569
Jun.

349
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,449
Jun!

350
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:39,128
Father!

351
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,049
I really didn't do it!

352
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,809
Why did you do such actions?

353
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:42,888
Why?

354
00:16:43,008 --> 00:16:44,409
Someone set me up!

355
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:45,329
Father!

356
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:47,449
Please seek justice for me!

357
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:48,728
Consort Xin

358
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,559
was such a good child with filial piety!

359
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:53,768
Someone set me up!

360
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:54,449
Father!

361
00:16:55,008 --> 00:16:56,728
Please seek justice for me!

362
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,100
Father!

363
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,110
Do you think he could bribe
so many people to set you up?

364
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:00,128
Most of them

365
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:01,488
are even your confidants!

366
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:03,248
Do you think I'm stupid?

367
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:15,089
Your Majesty.

368
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:17,248
Lord Xin's action of
murdering his own wife

369
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,169
is totally against humanity.

370
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,968
Please give him a serious punishment.

371
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:21,409
Father.

372
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,070
- Please give him a serious punishment.
- Please give him a serious punishment.

373
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:26,889
Father.

374
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:29,409
Father.

375
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:30,929
Father.

376
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:32,889
Father.

377
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:34,288
Father.

378
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:40,129
Take this disobedient son out.

379
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:43,129
Lock him up in his residence.

380
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:45,209
He shall not leave the residence.

381
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:48,008
Let him chant sutras

382
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:51,568
and pray for Consort Xin every day

383
00:17:52,449 --> 00:17:55,568
to eliminate his karma.

384
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:59,008
Father!

385
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:00,169
I didn't do it!

386
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:00,929
I didn't!

387
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:02,048
Please seek justice for me!

388
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:03,328
I really didn't do it!

389
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:04,568
Fa... Father!

390
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:06,889
Father!

391
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,369
Father! I really didn't do it!

392
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:11,728
I didn't!

393
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:13,689
Please seek justice for me!

394
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:16,929
Father! I really didn't do it!

395
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:20,288
Father!

396
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,480
One day of married life
breeds days of enduring affection.

397
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,968
I never thought that Li Jun

398
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:32,248
would murder his wife.

399
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,070
Fights between husband and wife
and fights between brothers for property

400
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,169
are not uncommon in my hometown.

401
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:41,488
I didn't expect that
someone in the capital

402
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:43,129
would murder

403
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,248
his own wife

404
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:45,728
to fight for power and position.

405
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,528
How inhuman!

406
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,209
When Consort Xin first got married,

407
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:52,768
I was the most unwelcome person
in the residence.

408
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,870
She knew that I lost
my mother since young,

409
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:56,048
so she always treated me well.

410
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:58,768
How could Li Jun

411
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:00,808
kill a kind person like her?

412
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:04,568
Before I came to Xichang,

413
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:07,129
I thought this was
a lively and happening place.

414
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:09,089
I wanted to enrich my experience.

415
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,288
If I had known that I would
experience these incidents,

416
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,968
I wouldn't have come.

417
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,609
Now, I miss

418
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:25,889
the mound at Laolan Pass.

419
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:27,328
At that time,

420
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:28,409
we suffered

421
00:19:28,528 --> 00:19:29,528
so much.

422
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:30,540
We didn't have much money.

423
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:33,089
We even had to fight with one another

424
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,649
just to get a bite of the white bread,

425
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:36,528
but our life was so happy.

426
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:39,528
Yes.

427
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:41,568
Those days,

428
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:43,248
we were really happy.

429
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:51,889
Mister Shiqi.

430
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,008
People here in the capital
are so unpredictable.

431
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:56,768
You once said

432
00:19:57,288 --> 00:19:59,248
that we would go back
to Laolan Pass one day.

433
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:01,209
When will we be going back?

434
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:08,008
There are things unsettled yet.

435
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:09,889
When I settle them one by one,

436
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:11,528
we shall go back.

437
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:13,649
We won't need to care about

438
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:15,849
the intrigues in this capital.

439
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:20,568
Let's go.

440
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:25,728
(Your Highness, as time goes by,)

441
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:28,008
(perhaps you would realise)

442
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:30,328
that you cannot go back

443
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:31,609
to Laolan Pass

444
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:34,129
as you wish

445
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:35,849
and be Shiqi again.

446
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,008
As Lord Qin, you cannot escape

447
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:40,328
your role as the crown prince.

448
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:54,449
Mister Shiqi, Taozi sent a letter

449
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:57,000
stating that Miss Cui is waiting
to meet you at Wonderland.

450
00:21:33,498 --> 00:21:34,221
Ying.

451
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:35,768
Can you submit a report

452
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,110
to the emperor and marry me?

453
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:39,689
Shiqi.

454
00:21:40,328 --> 00:21:41,889
Don't you understand?

455
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:43,609
You shall be the crown prince

456
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:44,808
in order to marry me,

457
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:45,609
otherwise,

458
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:47,089
you are left with nothing.

459
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:58,248
Can't you trust me?

460
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,328
Can you stop forcing me
and give me some time?

461
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:02,649
Why are you deceiving
yourself and others?

462
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:04,060
Then why did you come and meet me?

463
00:22:04,568 --> 00:22:05,048
Indeed.

464
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,270
Everything went
like what you have expected.

465
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:08,889
What else do you want to do?

466
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,089
I'm not here to laugh at you.

467
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:14,008
I know that you must be upset

468
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,710
seeing your loved one
do something like this,

469
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,849
so I just want to check on you.

470
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:22,808
Indeed.

471
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,129
He could do that

472
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:27,209
to his wife.

473
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:29,768
It's the Eastern Palace,

474
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:31,528
it's the position of the crown prince.

475
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:33,929
Power can make a person frenzied.

476
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,728
That's why I don't want the position!

477
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,200
I've known
that it has been a cage since I was young.

478
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,209
Do you want our children

479
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:42,849
to be born

480
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:43,689
in this cage?

481
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:45,129
Right.

482
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:48,129
You do know
that power could make a person frenzied.

483
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,849
With this in mind,

484
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:50,409
do you still want our children

485
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:52,409
to fight with one another

486
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:54,328
for this position in the future?

487
00:22:55,288 --> 00:22:57,089
However, you are the emperor's son.

488
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,048
You are Lord Qin
who recaptured two capitals.

489
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,610
You are also the commander-in-chief
of the famous Zhenxi Army.

490
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:02,689
Don't you think

491
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:04,248
you are currently in a cage?

492
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,728
I don't mind making myself the bait.

493
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:08,849
Can't you tell?

494
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:14,369
I don't want to fight with you.

Come.

513
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,008
Would you like some pastries?

514
00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:05,129
I want to eat...

515
00:25:05,968 --> 00:25:06,889
I want two of these

516
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:08,089
and two of these.

517
00:25:08,248 --> 00:25:09,169
Sure.

518
00:25:13,488 --> 00:25:14,209
Ear.

519
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:15,689
In your opinion,

520
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:16,889
why did Young Lady

521
00:25:17,008 --> 00:25:18,288
go and meet Lord Qin alone

522
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,450
without bringing me with her?

523
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:21,409
Is she hiding something from me?

524
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:22,689
That can't be it.

525
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:24,209
Miss Cui treats you so well.

526
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,660
She won't hide any secrets from you.

527
00:25:26,248 --> 00:25:27,409
Needless to say,

528
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:29,488
she treats me very well.

529
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:32,609
Then why didn't she allow me
to go with her?

530
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:35,649
Could it be because

531
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:37,849
she just wants to meet Mister Shiqi alone?

532
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:39,968
It's just like

533
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:41,889
me wanting to be

534
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,089
with you alone.

535
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:43,968
If both Miss Cui

536
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:45,328
and Mister Shiqi were around,

537
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:46,488
wouldn't it be difficult

538
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:48,328
for us to talk?

539
00:25:49,288 --> 00:25:50,089
Perhaps

540
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,728
that's what she thought.

541
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:55,129
When did you

542
00:25:55,209 --> 00:25:57,169
become so honey-mouthed?

543
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:58,568
I'm not honey-mouthed,

544
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,328
I'm just telling the truth.

545
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:04,649
Taozi.

546
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:07,689
I want to ask you something.

547
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:08,849
Go ahead.

548
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:12,248
You haven't answered

549
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:14,768
the question I asked you

550
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:16,409
at Wonderland.

551
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:19,488
Are... Are you...

552
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,409
Are you willing to?

553
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:27,689
You're such a fool.

554
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:30,129
If I'm not willing to,

555
00:26:30,449 --> 00:26:31,609
will I still be sitting here

556
00:26:31,728 --> 00:26:33,089
and eating pastries with you?

557
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:37,609
That's true though.

558
00:26:41,488 --> 00:26:41,929
Eat this.

559
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:44,849
It's nice, right?

560
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:34,008
Ying.

561
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:37,008
You're awake.

562
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:44,849
Was it you?

563
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:51,169
I got someone to help you get changed
with clean clothes.

564
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:53,728
Ying.

565
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:55,528
It was me

566
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:56,849
who brought you here.

567
00:28:58,288 --> 00:28:59,089
Don't worry.

568
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:01,728
This place has beautiful scenery.

569
00:29:02,728 --> 00:29:04,689
It's just like a paradise.

570
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:06,008
Both of us

571
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:07,689
can live here.

572
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,528
We don't have to
care about worldly affairs and just relax.

573
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:11,409
There won't be

574
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:12,808
people coming to disturb us.

575
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:17,728
Isn't that a good idea?

576
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,409
What drug did you give me?

577
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:22,849
Ying.

578
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:25,288
You shall not get angry.

579
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,609
It's not good for your body.

580
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:33,328
Your current condition is perfect.

581
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:36,048
As long as you obey me,

582
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:38,889
I won't harm you.

583
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:41,409
I won't harm your father as well.

584
00:29:45,768 --> 00:29:48,248
You are a snob who colluded with Jieshuo.

585
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:50,609
You even wanted to harm my father.

586
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:53,209
You will be my sworn enemy!

587
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:54,209
Look at you.

588
00:29:54,528 --> 00:29:56,209
Speak nicely.

589
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:58,808
Why did you get angry?

590
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:05,288
Ying.

591
00:30:06,968 --> 00:30:08,248
What do you want to eat later?

592
00:30:09,568 --> 00:30:11,889
I got them to cook
some of your favourite dishes.

593
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:18,169
Later, shall we have a meal together?

594
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:20,728
Get out of my way.

595
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:27,849
Ying.

596
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,328
From now on,

597
00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:31,849
we will eat together

598
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:34,369
every single day.

599
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:37,728
I'll be by your side all the time.

600
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:40,528
All right?

601
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:44,528
You'll promise me,

602
00:30:45,528 --> 00:30:46,248
won't you?

603
00:30:50,436 --> 00:30:54,520
(Lord Qin's Residence)

604
00:30:54,528 --> 00:30:55,008
Lord Qin.

605
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:56,528
Young Lady is missing!

606
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,089
That day, after you said that she had left,

607
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,900
I searched along the route for fear
that I went a wrong way.

608
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,990
I didn't see her at all
even when I reached Luoyang.

609
00:31:02,008 --> 00:31:03,129
Great General was worried

610
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,110
and he sent people to search
for her everywhere but futile.

611
00:31:05,328 --> 00:31:07,248
That's why I came to see you with hope.

612
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:09,689
Where could she have gone to?

613
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,480
(Relief map)

614
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:11,968
Taozi.

615
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,728
How do you usually find her?

616
00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:16,169
She has been using
the same herbal spices since young.

617
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:18,260
I could find her
with just a special ingredient,

618
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:19,328
but this time,

619
00:31:19,488 --> 00:31:21,449
it didn't work no matter
how hard I tried.

620
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:23,488
This means

621
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:25,048
the person who took her

622
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:27,328
knows these details very well.

623
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,849
That's why he could prepare in advance

624
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,089
so that you wouldn't realise.

625
00:31:31,129 --> 00:31:32,528
Then this person is...

626
00:31:34,288 --> 00:31:35,169
It's Liu Chengfeng.

627
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:40,288
There is a vast terrain between Luoyang

628
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,689
and Wonderland.

629
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:43,768
There are many dense forests.

630
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,328
It's not difficult to hide

631
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:46,449
a person.

632
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:49,328
If it was really Liu Chengfeng

633
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,649
who held Miss Cui captive,

634
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,728
it would be a big trouble.

635
00:31:52,008 --> 00:31:53,410
He probably didn't stay here for too long.

636
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:55,889
He might have left for somewhere else
with Miss Cui.

637
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:57,929
They wouldn't be too far away.

638
00:31:58,248 --> 00:31:58,849
Why?

639
00:32:00,808 --> 00:32:02,209
Ying is way too smart.

640
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:05,488
If he wanted to go on a long journey
together with her,

641
00:32:05,808 --> 00:32:08,089
it would be very difficult
to not leave any clues behind.

642
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:12,849
Liu Chengfeng
is very obsessed with Ying.

643
00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:14,248
A scheming person like him

644
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,528
must have planned in advance

645
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,540
and found a place
near Luoyang to settle down.

646
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:20,449
On the map,

647
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,449
there are so many places
other than Luoyang.

648
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:23,568
Wouldn't it

649
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:25,449
take a long time to locate her?

650
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:26,609
The north.

651
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:28,089
Only the northern parts.

652
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:30,369
Since Liu Chengfeng
colludes with Jieshuo,

653
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:32,089
he will definitely choose somewhere

654
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,209
that he could get support
from the Jieshuo rangers.

655
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,929
Only the northern area is possible.

656
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,770
The northern area
is wide and scarcely inhabited.

657
00:32:37,808 --> 00:32:38,728
The forest is dense.

658
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:40,089
Most importantly,

659
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:41,180
going a little up north

660
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,968
is the grassland
where the Jieshuo rangers could support.

661
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,129
Since we have narrowed down
the search area

662
00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:47,288
to just this part,

663
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,700
it will be much easier to look for her.

664
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,048
Let's not waste time.

665
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,089
Let's depart now.

666
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,720
Without the military order,
I couldn't deploy the troops now.

667
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,328
Chang'er, Bao, we shall disguise ourselves
and depart first.

668
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:56,968
- Yes.
- Yes.

669
00:32:57,248 --> 00:32:57,808
Yuan.

670
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:01,048
Bring some people to the hunting ground
and then catch up with us.

671
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,110
If anyone asks, tell them we are going
hunting outside the city.

672
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:03,968
I'll do it right now.

673
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:20,929
How is it?

674
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,020
We have searched
the hills on both sides.

675
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,000
There's nothing strange.

676
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,929
There are high mountains
and it is sparsely populated.

677
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:28,980
It's not easy to find her.

678
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:29,968
Mister Shiqi.

679
00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:31,369
I have an idea.

680
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,288
What is it?

681
00:33:32,768 --> 00:33:35,008
Last time, we used to occupy a hill
and act as the lord.

682
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,409
We were also worried
about the soldiers coming after us.

683
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:39,840
Therefore, we would try our best
to be secretive in whatever we do.

684
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:40,968
However, there was

685
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:41,768
one thing

686
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:42,849
that we could never hide.

687
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:44,488
Every person needs salt

688
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:45,728
to survive.

689
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:47,328
People who sell salt

690
00:33:47,328 --> 00:33:48,248
wouldn't go

691
00:33:48,248 --> 00:33:49,609
deep into the forest.

692
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:51,528
To hold Cui Lin hostage,

693
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,210
Liu Chengfeng
must have many subordinates.

694
00:33:53,568 --> 00:33:54,649
This is a remote area.

695
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:57,609
Salt sold at townships nearby
definitely has a fixed amount.

696
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:58,328
Commoners

697
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,369
cannot afford salt.

698
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,089
Whenever they buy salt,
they would only buy little.

699
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:02,328
They won't buy a lot.

700
00:34:02,328 --> 00:34:04,110
Let's investigate
the townships nearby separately.

701
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,500
Ask them whether there were any outsiders
who came and bought salt

702
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:07,528
at a large amount.

703
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:08,720
We could follow up from there.

704
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:09,768
All right.

705
00:34:11,288 --> 00:34:11,848
Here.

706
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:14,169
Drink the medicine.

707
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:18,169
Don't worry.

708
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:20,288
This is not poison.

709
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:22,969
It's not poison,

710
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,169
but it's something
that could make me feel weak

711
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:26,489
so that you could detain me, right?

712
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:27,209
Ying.

713
00:34:27,728 --> 00:34:29,368
I'm doing this for your own good.

714
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,089
Don't be a hypocrite
and tell me all this.

715
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,529
If you had cared about my feelings,

716
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,510
you wouldn't have
colluded with the Jieshuo people,

717
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:37,209
let alone harming my father.

718
00:34:37,848 --> 00:34:39,368
I didn't have a choice.

719
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:42,489
If you had married me in the beginning,

720
00:34:42,808 --> 00:34:44,288
I surely wouldn't have been in contact

721
00:34:44,288 --> 00:34:45,368
with the Jieshuo people.

722
00:34:45,808 --> 00:34:46,609
I would've

723
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:48,049
cared for your father as well.

724
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,288
Anyway, it's all right.

725
00:34:53,448 --> 00:34:55,448
As long as you're
willing to be with me now,

726
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:57,609
I feel satisfied.

727
00:34:58,649 --> 00:35:01,328
No matter how you hit me and scold me,

728
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:03,529
I'll enjoy it.

729
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:12,768
If you refuse to drink it,

730
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:14,888
I'll feed it to you.

731
00:35:19,808 --> 00:35:21,689
This time, Youren
has made great contributions.

732
00:35:21,808 --> 00:35:23,368
We asked around in the county town.

733
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:25,368
They said no outsiders
ever came to buy salt.

734
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,550
However, at Huanshan County
located dozens of li away,

735
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:28,408
someone bought

736
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:29,768
a lot of salt not long ago.

737
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:31,009
Therefore, the salt in their county

738
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:32,810
had been sent to Huanshan
to be sold there.

739
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:34,848
Don't praise me like that.

740
00:35:34,848 --> 00:35:36,049
It was pure luck.

741
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:36,649
Look at him.

742
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:39,070
The salt in Huanshan County was not
necessarily bought by Liu Chengfeng.

743
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:40,609
How could you say you are lucky?

744
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,969
We haven't started investigating,

745
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:42,848
but what if it was him?

746
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:44,129
- What if it wasn't him?
- What if it was him?

747
00:35:44,129 --> 00:35:45,328
No, I said...

748
00:35:45,328 --> 00:35:46,009
Youde.

749
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:46,649
No.

750
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:47,649
Listen to Mister Shiqi.

751
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:49,209
Let's continue searching

752
00:35:49,368 --> 00:35:50,288
every hill separately.

753
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,740
This area is about a hundred li wide.

754
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:52,689
Each of us

755
00:35:52,768 --> 00:35:53,808
shall bring more people.

756
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,489
Bao, stay in the middle
as the contact point.

757
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:55,969
All right.

758
00:35:56,649 --> 00:35:57,129
Let's go.

759
00:35:57,129 --> 00:35:57,969
- All right.
- Yes!

760
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:17,848
Young Master.

761
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,710
There seem to be strangers
in villages nearby.

762
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:22,328
Our guards outside
also saw hoofprints on the ground.

763
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:26,848
Li Ni is blamed.

764
00:36:27,448 --> 00:36:28,848
Li Ni's nose so sensitive.

765
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:30,209
Now that

766
00:36:30,248 --> 00:36:31,728
he came to me himself,

767
00:36:32,848 --> 00:36:33,728
this is just right.

768
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:36,009
I shall capture him

769
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:36,969
and all his henchmen.

770
00:36:37,169 --> 00:36:39,368
Then I shall kill them in front of Ying.

771
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:05,368
This is the place.

772
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:07,689
Mister Shiqi, what do we do?

773
00:37:07,848 --> 00:37:08,969
Don't alert them first.

774
00:37:09,129 --> 00:37:10,220
You go and send the signal.

775
00:37:10,248 --> 00:37:11,410
I'll go in and check out the place.

776
00:37:11,448 --> 00:37:12,129
All right.

777
00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:41,169
Ying.

778
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:43,089
What are you looking at?

779
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,288
You seem to be deeply absorbed in it.

780
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:57,089
Look.

781
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:00,248
Look at what I've brought you.

782
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:05,009
I know

783
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:07,529
that you were also upset

784
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:09,888
when our wedding at Changzhou

785
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:11,848
was interrupted.

786
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,288
Therefore, this time,

787
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:14,969
I picked a few

788
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:16,248
wedding gowns for you.

789
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:19,009
Choose the one you like.

790
00:38:19,328 --> 00:38:20,888
Let's have our wedding

791
00:38:21,248 --> 00:38:22,609
happily.

792
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:23,928
Liu Chengfeng.

793
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:26,169
Do you know

794
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:27,288
what you are doing?

795
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:29,328
I'm getting ready to get married to you.

796
00:38:33,808 --> 00:38:35,248
You know very well

797
00:38:35,808 --> 00:38:37,689
that I won't ever marry you.

798
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:41,169
You and I grew up together.

799
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:42,768
I treat you

800
00:38:42,768 --> 00:38:44,248
like an elder brother.

801
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:45,808
To me,

802
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:47,448
you are my elder brother.

803
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:48,049
Stop it!

804
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:50,209
Stop saying things like this

805
00:38:50,209 --> 00:38:51,209
to prevaricate.

806
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:52,928
Your father

807
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,529
has never treated me like his son.

808
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:55,408
I'm also not

809
00:38:55,408 --> 00:38:56,288
your elder brother.

810
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,209
It was all because of Li Ni.

811
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,728
If Li Ni hadn't existed,

812
00:39:01,408 --> 00:39:03,049
you would've been married to me already.

813
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,248
You also wouldn't have said

814
00:39:04,248 --> 00:39:05,609
something so ruthless!

815
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:08,210
Whether there was Li Ni or not,
I wouldn't fall in love with you.

816
00:39:11,928 --> 00:39:14,009
Father has asked me a few times

817
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:15,728
whether I want to be married to you.

818
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,009
He felt that

819
00:39:18,009 --> 00:39:19,368
since we grew up together,

820
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,110
you've been caring
for me in every aspect.

821
00:39:22,649 --> 00:39:23,728
He was thinking

822
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,928
if he passed away

823
00:39:26,848 --> 00:39:28,529
one day,

824
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:30,928
would I be lonely

825
00:39:30,928 --> 00:39:32,049
when I was left all alone?

826
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:34,808
If you could take care of me,

827
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:37,009
he might not need to worry.

828
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:40,209
However, I told him

829
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:42,888
that I won't be married to you,

830
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:45,768
or perhaps

831
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:47,888
I didn't intend

832
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:48,888
to get married at all.

833
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:55,129
However, you submitted
a report to the emperor

834
00:39:56,368 --> 00:39:57,928
that you wish to marry

835
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:58,969
one of the three princes.

836
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:01,728
You're lying.

837
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:04,888
It's not that you don't want
to get married at all.

838
00:40:05,368 --> 00:40:07,328
You don't want to marry me at all.

839
00:40:07,328 --> 00:40:08,820
There's no need for me to lie to you.

840
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,110
At one point, I really didn't have
the intention to get married.

841
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:14,808
A female has to
face so many difficulties.

842
00:40:15,888 --> 00:40:17,328
I only live once.

843
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,009
If no one understands me
and knows me well,

844
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:20,489
why must I be married to someone?

845
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:24,689
Can't I live happily and freely alone?

846
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,288
Do I not understand you

847
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:27,689
and know you well?

848
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:32,808
You used to respect me

849
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:34,728
and treat me well,

850
00:40:35,928 --> 00:40:37,808
but that was neither understanding me

851
00:40:38,009 --> 00:40:39,569
nor knowing me well.

852
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:43,368
Before I met Li Ni,

853
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:45,649
I thought

854
00:40:45,808 --> 00:40:47,448
it's fine to be alone,

855
00:40:48,848 --> 00:40:50,529
but after I met him,

856
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:55,689
I only want to be with him.

857
00:40:58,248 --> 00:40:58,969
Ying.

858
00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:02,529
My love for you

859
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:03,848
has already reached this extent.

860
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:08,009
Why did you say something like this
to hurt me?

861
00:41:08,728 --> 00:41:09,649
Is it because

862
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:11,169
I'm associated with the Jieshuo people?

863
00:41:11,328 --> 00:41:13,049
Are you mad because of that?

864
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:14,248
Do you hate me?

865
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:16,848
I just want to survive.

866
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,448
If I die,

867
00:41:21,288 --> 00:41:22,529
will you remember me?

868
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,049
You won't!

869
00:41:25,209 --> 00:41:26,928
You'll forget about me immediately!

870
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,368
You'll put everything
about me behind you!

871
00:41:28,368 --> 00:41:29,328
You'll marry Li Ni

872
00:41:29,328 --> 00:41:31,408
and live happily ever after!

873
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:33,808
You'll forget about me forever.

874
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:35,888
You'll forget about me forever.

875
00:41:36,888 --> 00:41:38,288
Therefore, I mustn't die.

876
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,649
I mustn't die!

877
00:41:39,649 --> 00:41:41,209
I cannot allow you to marry Li Ni.

878
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:43,368
That's why I approached
the Jieshuo people.

879
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:46,928
Young Master.

880
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:52,089
This might be the last time

881
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:53,169
I'm calling you this.

882
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:57,240
It's because the elder brother
who used to care for me

883
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,328
and deserved my respect

884
00:42:00,529 --> 00:42:02,009
is dead.

885
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:05,808
He is dead.

886
00:42:07,768 --> 00:42:09,489
He died in that river.

887
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:12,768
Of course, you have the right

888
00:42:12,768 --> 00:42:14,448
to choose to survive,

889
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,288
but you approached the Jieshuo people
for your survival.

890
00:42:17,288 --> 00:42:18,009
You cannot say

891
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:19,649
that it was all for me!

892
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:24,768
After all is said,

893
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:28,689
now everything...

894
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:32,888
Now everything

895
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:36,368
seems to be

896
00:42:36,368 --> 00:42:37,689
all my fault.

897
00:42:41,169 --> 00:42:42,089
Ying.

898
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:46,169
How cruel you are.

899
00:42:47,888 --> 00:42:49,569
I've done so much for you,

900
00:42:50,649 --> 00:42:53,609
but now you make it sound like
I have only myself to blame.

901
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:56,089
To you,

902
00:42:56,248 --> 00:42:58,649
you see no one other than Li Ni!

903
00:43:02,408 --> 00:43:03,969
Anyway, it's all right, Ying.

904
00:43:04,969 --> 00:43:06,248
No matter what you say,

905
00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:07,969
you'll never

906
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:11,489
get to see Li Ni
anymore in your entire life.

907
00:43:13,209 --> 00:43:14,089
I won't

908
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:15,768
let him take you away from me.

909
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:19,569
You'll surely become my wife.

910
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:20,701
In your dreams!

911
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:23,129
Never will I marry you!

912
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:25,928
Not only Li Ni,
but also my father and his men

913
00:43:25,928 --> 00:43:27,089
will come and rescue me.

914
00:43:27,448 --> 00:43:28,808
You won't get away from this.

915
00:43:30,009 --> 00:43:31,808
The Cui Army has numerous cavalrymen.

916
00:43:32,169 --> 00:43:33,969
You've seen with your own eyes

917
00:43:34,129 --> 00:43:36,448
how the Cui Army's cavalrymen charge.

918
00:43:37,328 --> 00:43:37,928
My father

919
00:43:37,928 --> 00:43:39,569
will ride a horse here

920
00:43:39,888 --> 00:43:41,448
and crush your bones.

921
00:43:47,368 --> 00:43:48,209
Mister Shiqi.

922
00:43:48,328 --> 00:43:49,448
Bao is ready.

923
00:43:49,448 --> 00:43:50,480
Just wait for them to take the bait.

924
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,209
Get ready.

925
00:43:52,649 --> 00:43:53,049
Yes.

926
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:54,009
- Yes.
- Yes.

927
00:44:08,328 --> 00:44:09,049
Young Master,

928
00:44:10,129 --> 00:44:11,180
the rangers sent a message.

929
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,248
At a hundred li away,

930
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,870
they saw traces of
cavalrymen who might have passed by.

931
00:44:13,888 --> 00:44:16,060
Great General might be approaching
us with his cavalry.

932
00:44:16,328 --> 00:44:18,129
If he reaches here with his cavalry,

933
00:44:18,649 --> 00:44:21,728
all the decorations we've put up
will be useless.

934
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,009
Furthermore, the cavalry even
have armored horses.

935
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,240
When faced with them,
our strategy will not work.

936
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,300
They will reach here
at the latest by tomorrow noon.

937
00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:29,328
Young Master.

938
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,209
Please take our men
back to Jieshuo's territory first

939
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:32,570
using the trail over the mountain.

940
00:44:32,728 --> 00:44:33,808
I will stay here

941
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:36,009
as if you and Lieutenant He are still here.

942
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:37,100
I will hold the Great General off.
