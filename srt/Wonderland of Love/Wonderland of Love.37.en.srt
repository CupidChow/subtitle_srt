(Cui Yi's Wife, He Min)

Min.

31
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:42,574
Is that you, Min?

32
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:46,613
Min.

33
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:51,294
I never thought I'd see you again.

34
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:57,414
Is this a dream?

35
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:03,613
This is not a dream.

36
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:08,734
I finally got to meet you.

37
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:15,213
Do you blame me?

38
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:21,213
That I didn't come back
in time to save you.

39
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:26,093
You don't blame me,

40
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:30,494
but I've been

41
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:34,254
blaming myself.

42
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:23,213
Min!

43
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,973
Who are you?

44
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:52,014
Why am I here?

45
00:06:52,854 --> 00:06:54,173
Why could you let me

46
00:06:54,174 --> 00:06:55,814
see my wife?

47
00:06:57,174 --> 00:06:58,574
You can come in now.

48
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:04,934
Great General Cui.

49
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:06,934
What are you doing here?

50
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:08,532
Where is Ying?

51
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,694
Great General Cui, you've recovered.

52
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,653
Can you recognise us?

53
00:07:12,734 --> 00:07:14,493
His Highness has been trying

54
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:16,054
to cure you.

55
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:30,653
Father.

56
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:37,574
Father.

57
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:39,733
How are you?

58
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:41,213
Ying,

59
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:44,694
you've lost weight

60
00:07:45,254 --> 00:07:47,134
and you're looking pale.

61
00:07:48,174 --> 00:07:50,014
I've made you

62
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:53,454
worry about me.

63
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,134
Young Lady,

64
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:56,972
the imperial physician just came

65
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:58,933
and said Great General vomited
out the blood in his chest,

66
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:00,293
and he is in a clear state of mind now.

67
00:08:00,294 --> 00:08:02,413
He'll be fine after some time.

68
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:03,614
I got it.

69
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:05,814
I feel like

70
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:09,092
a big stone has been removed

71
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:10,614
from my heart.

72
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:14,293
You must've been terrified.

73
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:17,333
I've been

74
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:19,574
worried sick about you.

75
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:22,653
I'm fine, really.

76
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:25,373
I've been going through

77
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:28,733
a dreamlike life all these days,

78
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:31,653
and now I've finally come to my senses.

79
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,613
But Father,

80
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:35,414
your hair

81
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:38,093
is all gray.

82
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:41,493
Silly girl.

83
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,574
I'm old.

84
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:47,294
Of course my hair will turn gray.

85
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:50,453
I'm already an old man.

86
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:52,373
How could my hair not be gray?

87
00:08:58,173 --> 00:08:59,894
Are you feeling better?

88
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:01,733
I'm much better.

89
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:06,174
That's great.

90
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,493
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

91
00:09:17,454 --> 00:09:18,453
The imperial physician said

92
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:20,133
it would be risky

93
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:22,333
and might backfire.

94
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:25,253
In fact, I was very hesitant.

95
00:09:25,254 --> 00:09:26,934
If anything happens,

96
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,894
how will I face you?

97
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:32,573
But then I thought

98
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:33,772
that Great General Cui

99
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,652
is a very brave man.

100
00:09:35,653 --> 00:09:36,934
If he knew,

101
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:38,733
he'd be willing to take such a risk.

102
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:41,453
So I had Mu Xianhe

103
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:42,853
perform a trick.

104
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:43,692
As expected,

105
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:44,692
it provoked him

106
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,932
to vomit out the stagnant blood
in his body.

107
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:48,613
Then he gained his senses.

108
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:55,613
Shiqi,

109
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:57,654
thank you.

110
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:00,812
I've been working hard for so long,

111
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,534
and all you can do is saying thank you?

112
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,814
So how can I thank you?

113
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:10,654
I can't figure it out yet.

114
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:12,613
Maybe in a few hours

115
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:13,973
I'll figure it out.

116
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:17,093
Like you said,

117
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:18,894
you must thank me properly this time.

118
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:24,174
Right,

119
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:26,534
I have something important to tell you.

120
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:31,534
I find Liu Chengfeng's death odd.

121
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:33,613
After all, his collusion with Jieshuo

122
00:10:33,614 --> 00:10:35,013
didn't come to an end.

123
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:36,652
The leader of Jieshuo,

124
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:38,012
Wuyan, Wuluo's cousin,

125
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,012
disguised himself as a merchant

126
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,453
and infiltrated Xichang.

127
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:43,532
I've sent my men
to follow him for a while.

128
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:45,774
But Wuyan is so cunning.

129
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,654
They lost him by accident.

130
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,453
I think he

131
00:10:49,454 --> 00:10:50,853
must have ulterior motives

132
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:52,253
and is up to no good.

133
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:54,892
Jieshuo is probably

134
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:56,654
trying to take advantage of the chaos.

135
00:10:56,773 --> 00:10:58,534
If he's so brazen,

136
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,373
there might be someone
in the capital helping him.

137
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:03,172
I'll ask the constables

138
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:04,052
in Chang'an and Wan'nian

139
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,574
to check the entry pass

140
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:07,412
to see if they'll be alerted

141
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:09,054
and expose themselves.

142
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:54,333
A while ago, you sent someone

143
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:56,093
to say that you didn't
want to pass the word

144
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:57,574
through Liu Chengfeng,

145
00:11:57,773 --> 00:12:00,373
so you came to see me in person.

146
00:12:00,614 --> 00:12:03,373
I did everything Liu Chengfeng

147
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:06,174
promised you.

148
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:08,453
But Liu Chengfeng

149
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:10,133
has his own motive.

150
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:12,652
If you let him take advantage of this,

151
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:15,054
it'll affect Jieshuo's plans.

152
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:17,012
That's why I came in person today

153
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:18,534
to show my sincerity.

154
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,853
You're a high-ranking official
in the Central Plains.

155
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:23,692
And now,

156
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:25,774
you're willing to meet me in person.

157
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:27,292
Do you want us

158
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:28,613
to do something for you?

159
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,493
It's just a trifle.

160
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:35,654
I hope you can handle it for me.

161
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:38,493
If you help me with this,

162
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:40,772
I'll secretly get you

163
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:43,453
all the territory,

164
00:12:43,454 --> 00:12:46,493
salt, iron, rice and grain you want.

165
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:54,454
What's it?

166
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:01,973
Kill the crown princess, Cui Lin.

167
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,812
She's Cui Yi's daughter.

168
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:07,133
I'm sure you'd love to do this.

169
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:08,973
You're the prime minister of dynasty.

170
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:10,853
Aren't you afraid

171
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:11,772
of the consequences

172
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:13,454
of killing the crown princess?

173
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:33,574
Wuyan,

174
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:35,333
you won't fail, will you?

175
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,012
Of course I won't.

176
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:46,253
It's just killing a woman.

177
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,052
This time, I've brought along

178
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:49,814
two top martial artists.

179
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:52,534
Although Cui Lin is the crown princess,

180
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,733
it won't be difficult to kill her

181
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,133
if I arrange it carefully.

182
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,294
Good.

183
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:06,052
So from today onward,

184
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,733
Jieshuo and I are now allies.

185
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:11,692
I'll do my best to help Jieshuo.

186
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:12,973
I hope Jieshuo

187
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:15,333
will do the best to help me too.

188
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:23,412
But I still don't understand

189
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,373
why you're doing this.

190
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:29,093
In the eyes of the people,

191
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:31,772
the prime minister
is the most powerful official

192
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:33,253
and in the high position.

193
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:35,574
But what about
the former prime minister?

194
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:38,093
After the two major tasks of water control
and conquest of the West,

195
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,080
he became very sick,

196
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,573
not to mention the fact that
he was at odds with the emperor.

197
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:42,253
In the end,

198
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:44,574
he ended up with a broken reputation.

199
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:46,172
All of his family members

200
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:48,534
were sent back to their hometown
to work in the fields.

201
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:53,774
The current emperor is a foolish ruler,

202
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:56,333
useless, incompetent and indecisive.

203
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:58,932
Although I'm the prime minister

204
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:01,292
and my daughter is the lady of excellence,

205
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:04,333
the honor and future of the Gu family

206
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:07,894
cannot depend on such a foolish ruler.

207
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:16,772
What else do you want us to do

208
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:18,534
besides killing the crown princess?

209
00:15:18,574 --> 00:15:22,253
Of course, I'll discuss
and cooperate with you.

210
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:24,059
If there's any problem in the court,

211
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,613
I'll inform you secretly

212
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:28,133
so that you can send troops
to cause disturbance at the border.

213
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:29,772
If the general dispatched by the court

214
00:15:29,773 --> 00:15:30,932
is one of mine,

215
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:32,373
then you'll fake your defeat

216
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:34,054
and let him win the battle.

217
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,652
If someone who is not one of mine

218
00:15:35,653 --> 00:15:37,054
is dispatched,

219
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:41,294
I'll find a way for you to defeat them.

220
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:45,373
Good.

221
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:47,052
That's a very good idea.

222
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:49,414
After a few years of fighting,

223
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:50,412
all the generals

224
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:52,213
in the army who have been promoted

225
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:54,586
will be your men.

226
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:58,973
I'm a weak scholar.

227
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:01,493
If I want to take control of the army,

228
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:03,894
I'll have to think of other ways.

229
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:05,213
You're

230
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,892
bold and ambitious.

231
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:09,694
But I like you.

232
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:10,814
Don't worry.

233
00:16:10,974 --> 00:16:12,973
As long as you are willing to help us,

234
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:15,934
we will do our best to help you.

235
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:21,294
There's one more important thing.

236
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:22,932
Liu Chengfeng

237
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:25,172
is secretly in love with Cui Lin.

238
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,772
When you kill the crown princess,

239
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:30,733
watch out for Liu Chengfeng's interference.

240
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:34,172
Recently,

241
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:35,613
entry pass checks in Xichang

242
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:37,932
suddenly became stricter.

243
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,534
The situation is tough,
and we have trouble staying here.

244
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:42,772
That's why Liu Chengfeng proposed to me

245
00:16:42,773 --> 00:16:44,453
to abduct the crown princess.

246
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,052
He wants to take the crown princess

247
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:47,733
and run away with her.

248
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:49,640
So, in your words,

249
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,600
we might as well take advantage of it
by using his plan

250
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,174
to abduct Cui Lin and then kill her.

251
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:08,293
I've never

252
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,094
felt so relieved
since I returned to Central Plains.

253
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:12,454
It's a good way

254
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:14,252
to make use of Wuluo.

255
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:15,692
If I can take Ying,

256
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:17,492
I can run away with her.

257
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:18,492
Then,

258
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:20,654
we'll be free from all these troubles.

259
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:23,133
Here's to you

260
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,493
for achieving what you want

261
00:17:24,574 --> 00:17:25,854
and fulfilling your wishes.

262
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:34,053
Shu,

263
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,934
why don't you take my surname?

264
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:43,174
You're an orphan.

265
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:44,733
You have no name.

266
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:46,492
That's why I called you

267
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:47,973
Shu back then.

268
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:51,053
Actually...

269
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,293
Actually, I'm the same.

270
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:54,694
I don't have parents.

271
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,094
I'm also an orphan.

272
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:58,773
If you change your surname to Liu,

273
00:17:58,893 --> 00:18:00,694
then I'll have a family.

274
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:05,854
Thank you for giving me a surname.

275
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:14,533
Liu Shu.

276
00:18:15,854 --> 00:18:17,533
That's a nice name.

277
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:21,374
Come on.

278
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:28,654
Dig in now.

279
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:30,213
Okay.

280
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:34,894
Eat more.

281
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:49,972
I'd like to invite my father-in-law

282
00:18:49,973 --> 00:18:51,373
to stay at Qingyun Temple.

283
00:18:51,374 --> 00:18:54,253
It's a quiet place with guards.

284
00:18:55,173 --> 00:18:56,094
Besides,

285
00:18:56,253 --> 00:18:57,613
Xuanze is living there.

286
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:59,293
Then he can teach Xuanze

287
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:00,854
in his spare time.

288
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,134
With a kid by his side,

289
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:04,813
he'll be able to think less,

290
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:06,334
and refresh his mind.

291
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:08,533
This is a good idea.

292
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,412
I remember when I was a kid,

293
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:12,172
my father was most happy

294
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:13,694
when he taught me martial arts.

295
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:15,533
Alright.

296
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:18,213
You can go to the court now.

297
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:20,934
I've got one important task for you.

298
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:22,773
What's it?

299
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:25,973
The tub

300
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:29,013
in our back room is too small.

301
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:31,053
Get a bigger one.

302
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:41,614
Alright.

303
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:44,013
You should get going now.

304
00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:45,973
No.

305
00:19:50,614 --> 00:19:52,174
Well,

306
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:54,293
what's wrong

307
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:56,694
with Jieshuo?

308
00:19:57,134 --> 00:19:58,333
Why did they send troops

309
00:19:58,334 --> 00:20:00,733
to invade Yingzhou again?

310
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:03,573
Didn't we agree

311
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:06,533
that the Sang River
would be the boundary?

312
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:08,293
Your Majesty.

313
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:10,892
After disbanding Cui Army,

314
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,533
perhaps Jieshuo
thought they had a chance

315
00:20:13,534 --> 00:20:15,894
to attack Yingzhou again.

316
00:20:17,054 --> 00:20:18,533
Send the crown prince there then.

317
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:20,253
He likes to go to war, doesn't he?

318
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:21,652
But this time,

319
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,212
we must beat them up badly

320
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:26,573
so they'll remember the lesson.

321
00:20:27,014 --> 00:20:27,932
Your Majesty,

322
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:29,692
the crown prince
is in a position of honor.

323
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:31,053
He should not lead troops into danger.

324
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:34,732
I'll lead Zhenxi Army to Yingzhou.

325
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,374
Alright, go ahead then.

326
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:38,973
Yes.

327
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:41,333
Your Majesty,

328
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:42,492
I think

329
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,732
Great General Pei is getting old.

330
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:47,252
Why don't we send Pei Yuan with him,

331
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:49,694
so they can take care
of each other on the way?

332
00:20:55,893 --> 00:20:57,934
Prime Minister Gu has a point.

333
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:01,892
When a father gets old,

334
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:05,493
his son has to take care of him.

335
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:13,334
I can't talk anymore.

336
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,860
My whole body aches.

337
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:18,573
Let the crown prince

338
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:20,414
take care of

339
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:22,334
the rest of the public affairs.

340
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:27,973
Yes, Your Majesty.

341
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:00,894
You're back.

342
00:22:02,574 --> 00:22:04,493
Why are you back so late?

343
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:07,694
You know what?

344
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,573
Great General Pei is going to war

345
00:22:09,574 --> 00:22:11,694
and the Ministry of War
has a lot of things to be done at once.

346
00:22:11,814 --> 00:22:12,614
And

347
00:22:12,893 --> 00:22:14,293
I didn't go to the court

348
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:15,894
for a few days because of our wedding.

349
00:22:16,173 --> 00:22:19,726
My father actually also took the opportunity
to slack for a few days.

350
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,093
Now,

351
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:23,932
the papers of the three departments
and six ministries have been piled up.

352
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:25,613
I've only managed to deal with

353
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:27,414
a little bit of everything at this hour.

354
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:33,053
Have you had dinner yet?

355
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:35,894
I want to have hot pot.

356
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,253
The kind you eat with Taozi.

357
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:39,733
Besides,

358
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:41,172
whenever Taozi

359
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:42,892
comes up with something new and tasty,

360
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:44,614
she'll ask Ear to join her.

361
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:46,647
You never ask me to join you.

362
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:48,493
What's so hard about that?

363
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:50,614
I'll ask the kitchen to prepare it now.

364
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:53,853
It's already midnight.

365
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:55,613
It's late. Let's not eat anymore.

366
00:22:55,614 --> 00:22:57,414
Why don't we just go to bed?

367
00:22:58,014 --> 00:23:00,093
No, we'll have hot pot.

368
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:01,414
No, go to bed.

369
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:12,813
(Qingyun Temple)

370
00:23:12,814 --> 00:23:15,694
Are you the legendary Great General Cui?

371
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:18,412
I've heard so many stories about you.

372
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:19,773
Siege of Jieshuo on a snowy night,

373
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,654
and the battle of Qinshui Spring.

374
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:25,172
Who told you that?

375
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:26,573
It's General Han.

376
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:28,533
He reads me stories every night

377
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:30,374
when I can't sleep.

378
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:37,652
Great General Cui,

379
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:39,373
you're renowned
for your skills of playing blade.

380
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:41,252
General Han taught me
some skills with the sword.

381
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,934
Can I learn from you?

382
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,414
Of course you can. Come on.

383
00:23:46,814 --> 00:23:48,053
Look carefully.

384
00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:53,013
Come on.

385
00:23:59,294 --> 00:24:00,733
Correct. Again.

386
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:03,773
Once in Qingyun Temple,

387
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:04,813
Father's spirit

388
00:24:04,814 --> 00:24:06,174
has indeed improved a lot.

389
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:08,892
If Great General Cui can teach you well,

390
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:11,854
then he can teach Xuanze well too.

391
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:13,172
So

392
00:24:13,173 --> 00:24:15,053
that's what you were planning.

393
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,213
It's not a plan.

394
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:18,293
Great General Cui

395
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:19,732
has Xuanze at his side.

396
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:21,333
And Xuanze admires him so much

397
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,093
that he can learn many things from him.

398
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,134
Isn't this the best of both worlds?

399
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:28,973
Yes, you're right, Your Highness.

400
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:31,414
Will you stop addressing
me as Your Highness?

401
00:24:31,574 --> 00:24:33,573
It's been a long time
since you called me Shiqi.

402
00:24:33,854 --> 00:24:35,533
I just call you that last night.

403
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:36,293
That doesn't count.

404
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:37,373
That's because you lost

405
00:24:37,374 --> 00:24:38,813
and it's my reward.

406
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:41,614
Ying, I'm thinking

407
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:43,692
we should have two children first.

408
00:24:43,693 --> 00:24:44,692
One is called Zhen

409
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:46,013
and the other is called Dao.

410
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:47,853
The rest will be born slowly.

411
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:49,412
Who said I want to have babies with you?

412
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:51,452
You said you want to have four babies,

413
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:52,373
no one can be less.

414
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:54,053
When did I promise that?

415
00:24:54,054 --> 00:24:55,533
You went back on your word.

416
00:24:55,614 --> 00:24:57,133
You'll have to get your knees on abacus

417
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:58,333
if you don't keep your word.

418
00:24:58,334 --> 00:24:59,813
You set the rules yesterday.

419
00:24:59,814 --> 00:25:01,174
I didn't say that.

420
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:04,212
I don't care. I want four babies.

421
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:05,613
No way. I didn't promise you.

422
00:25:05,614 --> 00:25:07,973
Let's have six, eight
or ten babies then.

423
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:17,733
I can't get enough
of Fengying Pavilion's sizzling meat.

424
00:25:17,854 --> 00:25:20,093
The cook you sent to my residence yesterday

425
00:25:20,094 --> 00:25:21,333
made me a new dish

426
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:22,652
called Roasted Deer Tongue.

427
00:25:22,653 --> 00:25:25,334
It tasted too fresh to me.

428
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:27,053
But today, when I tried
this sizzling meat,

429
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:28,733
I think they're equally nice.

430
00:25:30,774 --> 00:25:32,452
You've worked very hard

431
00:25:32,453 --> 00:25:33,892
for my father's illness.

432
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:36,813
Here's a toast to you.

433
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:38,134
Don't mention it.

434
00:25:44,173 --> 00:25:44,934
Right,

435
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:49,212
I've heard that there's
a kind of large yellow croaker in Yingzhou

436
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:50,932
that comes from the coldest sea.

437
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:52,692
And it swims up the river

438
00:25:52,693 --> 00:25:54,134
in spring and summer.

439
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:57,174
This yellow croaker roe is very tasty.

440
00:25:58,173 --> 00:25:59,573
But in all these years,

441
00:25:59,653 --> 00:26:01,573
I've never eaten it.

442
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:05,134
Since you're surnamed Cui,

443
00:26:05,374 --> 00:26:07,813
why don't you get me
some yellow croaker roe?

444
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,053
I'll try my best.

445
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:13,533
Alright, it's decided then.

446
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:16,213
I'll gift you both a trick

447
00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:18,212
if you get me some yellow croaker roe,

448
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:19,013
okay?

449
00:26:19,014 --> 00:26:19,972
Really?

450
00:26:19,973 --> 00:26:21,212
That's great.

451
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,412
I've been asking Father

452
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:24,652
what kind of trick he saw Mister Mu do.

453
00:26:24,653 --> 00:26:26,773
He wouldn't tell me no matter what.

454
00:26:26,774 --> 00:26:30,373
People say Mister Mu's tricks
are like magic.

455
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:33,253
Today, we finally have a chance
to see what he's capable of.

456
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,493
Do you like fireflies?

457
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,694
How did you know?

458
00:28:24,294 --> 00:28:26,333
I'll use this little trick

459
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:28,654
to congratulate you both
on your marriage.

460
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,493
Thank you, Mister Mu.

461
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:47,654
Mister and Young Lady,

462
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:49,573
are you satisfied with today's meal?

463
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:52,212
Yes, very.

464
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:53,493
Thank you.

465
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:54,692
Nice live sea bass

466
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:56,172
just arrived from the south today.

467
00:28:56,173 --> 00:28:58,253
Would you like to take one home
to make fish filet?

468
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:00,174
Okay, give us one then.

469
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,412
You spent a lot of money

470
00:29:02,413 --> 00:29:03,412
on a fish last time.

471
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:05,333
Today, you've given us a lot of tips.

472
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:06,492
Our boss said

473
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:09,454
this fish is a gift from us.

474
00:29:09,893 --> 00:29:11,133
Last time, you said

475
00:29:11,134 --> 00:29:12,573
you don't have an abacus at home.

476
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:14,013
Our boss said

477
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:17,253
this abacus is also for you.

478
00:29:18,294 --> 00:29:19,293
Thank you.

479
00:29:19,294 --> 00:29:20,892
Tell your boss

480
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:22,692
he's a great businessman.

481
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:24,813
As expected of the best
restaurant in Xichang.

482
00:29:24,814 --> 00:29:26,932
It's bound to be successful.

483
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,174
Thank you.

484
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:32,454
Mister, your fish.

485
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:33,654
Thank you.

486
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:40,133
You really want the abacus?

487
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:41,973
We really don't have an abacus at home.

488
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,053
Besides, they specially gave it to us.

489
00:29:44,054 --> 00:29:44,972
It would be rude

490
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:46,334
not to accept it.

491
00:29:47,014 --> 00:29:48,452
What are you going to do

492
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,733
with the abacus?

493
00:29:50,014 --> 00:29:52,533
Why ask when you know?

494
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:55,613
Of course it's to save for a rainy day.

495
00:29:55,614 --> 00:29:57,533
Why would you have
to save for a rainy day?

496
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:59,212
Of course I don't need it.

497
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:01,293
I'm just afraid that you might need it.

498
00:30:01,294 --> 00:30:02,333
Are you that cruel?

499
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:03,573
This is an abacus.

500
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:04,652
Someone said

501
00:30:04,653 --> 00:30:05,652
that his lovely wife

502
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:07,492
would always make
him kneel on the abacus.

503
00:30:07,493 --> 00:30:09,093
So it's better to make it true

504
00:30:09,094 --> 00:30:11,813
rather than being falsely accused.

505
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:15,013
I was just kidding.

506
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:38,454
Young Lady.

507
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:42,053
Young Lady.

508
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:43,094
Taozi.

509
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,813
Young Lady, there's something

510
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:48,694
I think I have to tell you.

511
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:50,093
What's it?

512
00:30:50,094 --> 00:30:53,133
Cui Army has been disbanded gradually.

513
00:30:53,134 --> 00:30:56,172
There are only a few hundred men left
in Yingzhou waiting to be disbanded.

514
00:30:56,173 --> 00:30:57,573
Jieshuo invaded Yingzhou.

515
00:30:57,574 --> 00:30:59,452
The court ordered Great General Pei

516
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:01,613
to go to Yingzhou with Zhenxi Army

517
00:31:01,614 --> 00:31:02,972
and gave strict orders

518
00:31:02,973 --> 00:31:04,892
for the hundreds of Cui soldiers

519
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:05,853
to disarm immediately

520
00:31:05,854 --> 00:31:07,573
and go to Beizhou to build an aqueduct.

521
00:31:07,774 --> 00:31:08,573
It's said

522
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:10,613
that the state officers
in Beizhou are very strict.

523
00:31:10,614 --> 00:31:13,652
They treated the Cui soldiers
like criminals,

524
00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:15,093
not only cutting their food and drinks,

525
00:31:15,094 --> 00:31:17,533
but also beating them with sticks.

526
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:19,493
They couldn't stand it any longer,

527
00:31:19,574 --> 00:31:21,733
so they nominated General Tan

528
00:31:22,134 --> 00:31:24,972
to flee all the way
from Beizhou to Xichang

529
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:27,493
to meet Great General Cui or you.

530
00:31:29,294 --> 00:31:30,412
Don't let my father

531
00:31:30,413 --> 00:31:31,894
know about this.

532
00:31:32,294 --> 00:31:33,253
Yes.

533
00:31:35,014 --> 00:31:36,492
Where is

534
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:37,932
General Tan?

535
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:39,333
He escaped.

536
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:40,533
And he's still wounded.

537
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:42,013
He's been wandering around

538
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:43,972
Cui Residence since he got to Xichang.

539
00:31:43,973 --> 00:31:46,093
That day when I went back to
our residence to get something,

540
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:47,334
he recognised me

541
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:48,892
and followed me for a long time.

542
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:51,333
He didn't dare to talk to me

543
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:52,733
until he saw I was alone.

544
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:54,212
I recognised him.

545
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:55,892
He's a former deputy general
of the left battalion.

546
00:31:55,893 --> 00:31:57,813
He's a lot thinner

547
00:31:57,854 --> 00:32:00,374
and more emaciated than he used to be.

548
00:32:00,493 --> 00:32:01,773
He must have suffered a lot

549
00:32:01,774 --> 00:32:03,573
on the journey.

550
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:04,892
He doesn't have an entry pass

551
00:32:04,893 --> 00:32:06,414
and he doesn't dare to stay in an inn.

552
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:08,093
So he can only stay

553
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:09,172
in a broken temple

554
00:32:09,173 --> 00:32:10,773
outside the city for a few days.

555
00:32:13,693 --> 00:32:14,973
Young Lady,

556
00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:16,652
shall we tell His Highness

557
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:17,853
about this?

558
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:18,773
No.

559
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:20,333
This is about

560
00:32:20,334 --> 00:32:22,334
the disbandment of Cui Army.

561
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,813
Don't tell His Highness

562
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:25,414
so he won't be in a difficult position.

563
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:28,493
Let's do this.

564
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:30,333
Ask General Tan

565
00:32:30,334 --> 00:32:31,694
to go to Fengying Pavilion.

566
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:33,013
Then we'll

567
00:32:33,014 --> 00:32:34,454
pretend to go out for a drink

568
00:32:34,614 --> 00:32:35,932
and meet him first

569
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:37,212
and find out

570
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:39,334
what's going on in Beizhou.

571
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:40,213
Okay.

572
00:32:47,094 --> 00:32:48,533
It's been so many days

573
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:49,932
and I finally get to have hot pot.

574
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:51,252
Every day you came back,

575
00:32:51,253 --> 00:32:52,252
I said it was okay to have it,

576
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:53,492
but you said it was too late

577
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:54,613
and we shouldn't have it.

578
00:32:54,614 --> 00:32:56,692
It's really too late for it.

579
00:32:56,693 --> 00:32:57,732
Who eats hot pot

580
00:32:57,733 --> 00:32:59,533
in the middle of the night?

581
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:05,373
Today is a good day

582
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:06,614
to remember.

583
00:33:06,733 --> 00:33:07,813
Where's the drawing book?

584
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,293
Take out the drawing book.

585
00:33:09,294 --> 00:33:11,813
Draw us eating hot pot.

586
00:33:11,814 --> 00:33:12,894
No.

587
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:16,334
I'll look for it myself then.

588
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,454
Then it's not on this side.

589
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:26,973
It should be in that direction.

590
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:30,414
Don't take it.

591
00:33:32,374 --> 00:33:33,093
Give it to me.

592
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:33,694
I knew it.

593
00:33:33,973 --> 00:33:34,533
Give it.

594
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:35,213
No.

595
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,253
I won't give you.

596
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:45,613
No wonder you wouldn't let me see it.

597
00:33:45,614 --> 00:33:47,133
How could you draw this?

598
00:33:47,134 --> 00:33:49,013
I've never knelt on an abacus.

599
00:33:49,014 --> 00:33:50,212
If our kids

600
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:51,773
see you drawing like this,

601
00:33:51,774 --> 00:33:53,293
I'll be laughed out of the room.

602
00:33:53,294 --> 00:33:54,692
Just because you're not kneeling now

603
00:33:54,693 --> 00:33:56,333
doesn't mean you won't in the future.

604
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,573
I call it saving for a rainy day.

605
00:33:58,574 --> 00:34:00,093
No, it's called being prescient.

606
00:34:00,094 --> 00:34:01,692
This is called distorting facts.

607
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:03,293
No, I'm going to tear up this page.

608
00:34:03,294 --> 00:34:03,892
No.

609
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:04,813
- I must tear it up.
- No.

610
00:34:04,814 --> 00:34:05,373
I must.

611
00:34:05,374 --> 00:34:07,172
- I had a hard time drawing it.
- I must tear it up.

612
00:34:07,173 --> 00:34:08,732
Give it to me.

613
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:09,613
I must tear it up.

614
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,774
Give it...

615
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:49,493
Your Highness,

616
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:51,493
it's a quater to six.

617
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:54,732
Did you use to sleep till sunrise

618
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:56,454
in the army?

619
00:34:57,494 --> 00:34:59,013
Let me sleep a little longer.

620
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,453
Get up now.

621
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:02,334
Don't keep the officials waiting.

622
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,613
Come on, wake up.

623
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,334
I really feel like it is
going to be a long day.

624
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:14,973
It feels like years.

625
00:35:15,494 --> 00:35:16,372
What about you?

626
00:35:16,373 --> 00:35:17,533
Does it feel like years

627
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,374
when you don't see me?

628
00:35:20,213 --> 00:35:22,212
But you'll be back in the evening.

629
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:23,414
So

630
00:35:23,494 --> 00:35:25,414
the day isn't so bad.

631
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:27,053
But it's killing me

632
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:28,734
when I can't see you during the day.

633
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:29,692
Alright.

634
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:31,852
Finish your work quickly

635
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:33,372
so you can see me when you get back.

636
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:35,294
What are you going to do today?

637
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:38,814
I'm going with Taozi
to Fengying Pavilion for a drink.

638
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,732
Don't go to Fengying Pavilion.

639
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:42,252
Not only they gave us a fish,

640
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:43,372
but they also gave us an abacus.

641
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:45,013
They're so bad.

642
00:35:45,293 --> 00:35:47,334
Alright, get up and get changed.

643
00:35:47,454 --> 00:35:49,493
You'll see me in the blink of an eye

644
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:51,093
when you're done

645
00:35:51,094 --> 00:35:52,973
with all your work.

646
00:36:02,883 --> 00:36:05,899
(Fengying Pavilion)

647
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:31,854
Greetings, Young Lady.

648
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:33,573
General Tan.

649
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:35,414
I thought

650
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:37,533
I'd never see you again.

651
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:39,093
Young Lady.

652
00:36:39,293 --> 00:36:41,374
How is Great General Cui?

653
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:44,133
My father is fine.

654
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:47,973
I've been trusted
by over 400 former Cui soldiers

655
00:36:47,974 --> 00:36:50,254
in Beizhou

656
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,493
to come to the capital
to see Great General Cui.

657
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:53,734
Young Lady,

658
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:57,214
we... we have no way out.

659
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:04,772
Young Lady,

660
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:06,292
this is a joint letter of blood

661
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:07,774
from all 467 of us.

662
00:37:08,054 --> 00:37:09,854
Please take a look.

663
00:37:14,373 --> 00:37:17,093
From top to bottom,
all the officials in Beizhou

664
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:19,053
have never treated us as human beings.

665
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:21,252
We couldn't stand it any longer

666
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:23,053
and wrote this letter of blood.

667
00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:27,133
Our true misery is written in it.

668
00:38:06,773 --> 00:38:07,573
Your Highness,

669
00:38:07,574 --> 00:38:08,732
why are you back so early today?

670
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:09,960
Are you going back to Eastern Palace?

671
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,252
Don't you know
that my wife and Taozi

672
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:13,133
went to Fengying Pavilion
for a drink together?

673
00:38:13,213 --> 00:38:15,200
I have to finish my work quickly

674
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,573
and take you with me
to Fengying Pavilion.

675
00:38:16,574 --> 00:38:18,573
Seriously? Taozi didn't tell me.

676
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:19,493
Let's go.

677
00:38:19,494 --> 00:38:21,093
Let's go and surprise them.

678
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:21,973
Alright.

679
00:38:57,414 --> 00:38:58,093
Let's go.

680
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,013
Yao,

681
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:10,053
why are you so drunk?

682
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:12,254
How can I explain to your wife later?

683
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:16,372
Your wife did come over

684
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:17,292
with a servant.

685
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:19,133
They're meeting a guest today,

686
00:39:19,134 --> 00:39:20,413
but they didn't order any food.

687
00:39:20,414 --> 00:39:22,732
They sat in a private room for a while
and then left.

688
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:24,172
They just stayed for a while?

689
00:39:24,173 --> 00:39:25,652
Yes, but not for long,

690
00:39:25,653 --> 00:39:27,172
about half an hour.

691
00:39:27,173 --> 00:39:28,652
I went in to refill their tea

692
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:30,493
and found they'd gone

693
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:32,693
and left some money on the table.

694
00:39:33,494 --> 00:39:34,613
Which room they were in?

695
00:39:34,614 --> 00:39:35,573
Take me there to have a look.

696
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,454
Okay, I'll take you up.

697
00:39:43,574 --> 00:39:45,652
Mister Shiqi, could it be that
the crown princess and Taozi

698
00:39:45,653 --> 00:39:46,973
returned to Eastern Palace?

699
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:48,573
- I'll go back and check it out.
- No.

700
00:39:49,213 --> 00:39:50,613
Search this room.

701
00:39:51,094 --> 00:39:51,774
Yes.

702
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:20,414
Mister Shiqi!

703
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:31,973
Chang'er,

704
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:34,893
go back

705
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:35,893
and take my seal now,

706
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:36,692
and tell Imperial Army

707
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:38,894
to close all the gates
of Xichang immediately.

708
00:40:39,014 --> 00:40:40,453
No one is allowed to leave the city,

709
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:42,013
even by decree.

710
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:43,854
Get imperial guardians here.

711
00:40:44,054 --> 00:40:44,854
Yes.

712
00:41:04,733 --> 00:41:06,613
So this is Cui Lin,

713
00:41:07,094 --> 00:41:08,573
Cui Yi's daughter

714
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:10,254
as well as Li Ni's wife?

715
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:11,374
Wuyan,

716
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:13,653
we had a deal.

717
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:16,814
I use General Tan to lure Cui Lin out

718
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:18,332
and you help me

719
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,973
bring Cui Lin here

720
00:41:19,974 --> 00:41:21,573
to stay for a while.

721
00:41:22,054 --> 00:41:23,214
Then,

722
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:25,493
I'll take Cui Lin with me.

723
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:26,732
When Li Ni

724
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,653
finds out Cui Lin is missing,

725
00:41:28,773 --> 00:41:30,894
he'll look for her everywhere.

726
00:41:31,693 --> 00:41:34,133
Whether or not you'll be able
to get what you want

727
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:36,214
and take this opportunity to kill Li Ni,

728
00:41:36,414 --> 00:41:38,973
it's up to you to make it work.

729
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:41,372
Yes, I promised you.

730
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,852
You also promised

731
00:41:42,853 --> 00:41:46,093
to give me the real divine medicine
when I'm done

732
00:41:46,494 --> 00:41:48,214
so that even if I don't take

733
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:49,973
any more medicine in the future,

734
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,573
I won't die of broken tendons and bones.

735
00:41:54,574 --> 00:41:56,533
Yes, I promised you that.

736
00:41:56,534 --> 00:41:58,653
Give me the divine medicine now

737
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:01,173
and I'll take Cui Lin away.

738
00:42:03,934 --> 00:42:05,294
What about her?

739
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,493
Do whatever you want.
