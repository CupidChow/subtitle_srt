(Fengying Pavilion)

30
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:56,191
Your Highness.

31
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:57,149
All gates in Xichang

32
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,351
have been ordered to close.

33
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,791
I lead a troop to the east,

34
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,110
and you lead another to the west.

35
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,791
The remaining will split into two
and head to the south and north.

36
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,069
Search every nook and corner.

37
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,870
Yes.

38
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,070
Move.

39
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,190
Wrap her up with a rag

40
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,790
and throw into the mass grave

41
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,111
when the sky darkens.

42
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:30,989
That place is strewn

43
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,790
with beggars' bodies.

44
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:37,910
No one will notice hers.

45
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:41,190
Brilliant.

46
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:43,271
Take her out.

47
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:52,831
Where's my medicine?

48
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,271
Not this one.

49
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,670
What's wrong with that?

50
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:15,551
I saw it at Wuluo's place.

51
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,551
It's different.

52
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:23,151
In that case,

53
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:27,151
don't blame me then.

54
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,190
What are you up to?

55
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:30,790
At first,

56
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,390
I wanted to give you a dignified death,

57
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:34,190
considering you a helpful lackey.

58
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:35,511
Sadly,

59
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,989
you refuse to take the poison.

60
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,269
I have to take your life

61
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,991
in another way.

62
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,431
You want to kill me?

63
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,991
Why?

64
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,190
You're greedy.

65
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:52,149
You're merely a lackey serving us,

66
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,511
but many of our warriors sacrificed
because of you.

67
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:55,670
And now,

68
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:57,149
you're trying to take Cui Yi's daughter

69
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,190
and run away.

70
00:03:58,191 --> 00:04:00,469
If so, the netherworld
should be your destination.

71
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,030
Just now, you asked me

72
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,070
why Shu wasn't with me.

73
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:06,429
I told you

74
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,350
Shu went out to keep watch.

75
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:10,750
But in fact,

76
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,431
he didn't.

77
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,830
So what?

78
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:15,549
He doesn't know

79
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,269
where we are now.

80
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,030
Can he come and save you?

81
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,430
But he knows

82
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,310
that Prime Minister Gu and Sun Jing

83
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:24,831
had conspired.

84
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,669
Besides, he knows that I used
Prime Minister Gu

85
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,269
to frame Cui Yi
and disband the Cui Army.

86
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,870
Not only that,

87
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,750
he knows all your spies in Xichang

88
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:35,109
and those hideouts

89
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,271
along the way to the north.

90
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:40,191
Too many people want to kill me.

91
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:44,110
I can never trust you Jieshuo people,

92
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:46,030
right?

93
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:48,990
Where's Shu?

94
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:49,990
Out with it.

95
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:54,951
Give me the divine medicine

96
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:56,831
and let me take Cui Lin away.

97
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,090
Your Majesty, the crown prince
instructed the Imperial Army

98
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,350
to close all gates in Xichang.

99
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:06,030
What?

100
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:07,789
Besides,

101
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,589
no one is allowed to leave the capital,

102
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,470
even with your decree.

103
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:18,110
Is he

104
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,191
planning a rebellion?

105
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,070
Your Majesty, we must come up
with a solution.

106
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:25,550
The crown prince

107
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,709
is behaving strangely.

108
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,269
His sudden action

109
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,151
doesn't make any sense.

110
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,590
Too bad.

111
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,350
Too bad.

112
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,430
Ever since we arrived at Xichang,

113
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,511
the Imperial Army

114
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:50,151
has been replaced with the Zhenxi Army.

115
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:54,550
If this wayward son intends to kill me,

116
00:05:56,551 --> 00:06:00,191
there are no soldiers under my command.

117
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,350
No matter how you torture me,

118
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,470
I won't tell you Shu's whereabouts.

119
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,071
Shu and I made a deal.

120
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:22,669
If anything happens,

121
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,310
and he loses contact with me

122
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:26,271
for 24 hours,

123
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,071
he will take moves

124
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,669
and bring all the evidence I collected

125
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,670
to Li Ni.

126
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:34,711
To think

127
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,870
that you ungrateful lackey

128
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:39,550
turns against your master.

129
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:43,151
You turn your back on me first.

130
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,230
I would've died a long time ago

131
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,511
if I hadn't guarded against you.

132
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:50,110
Give me the divine medicine!

133
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,350
Free Cui Lin and I.

134
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:54,029
Prepare enough horses

135
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,870
along the way

136
00:06:55,871 --> 00:06:57,751
and ensure our safety.

137
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,590
Don't follow us.

138
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,670
All of us here

139
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,951
are from Jieshuo.

140
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:05,870
They are the most courageous warriors
in Jieshuo

141
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:08,149
who can kill wolves

142
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,191
and tear the enemy's limbs off
barehanded.

143
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,190
Don't think for a second

144
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:14,590
you can haggle with us.

145
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:16,750
If you still refuse to tell us

146
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:18,550
Shu's whereabouts,

147
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:20,469
I'll kill her immediately.

148
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,310
Never!

149
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,350
Ying.

150
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,470
No, you don't.

151
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,151
Ying.

152
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,430
Move away.

153
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:40,709
Your Highness, we've searched through
the streets around here.

154
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,560
Nothing suspicious.

155
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,120
Three imperial armies
are on their way here.

156
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,580
They're searching southward
from the north.

157
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,109
Let's meet at the next street.

158
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,871
Yes.

159
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:47,630
Move.

160
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:48,711
Yes.

161
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:55,109
Greetings, Your Majesty.

162
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,909
At ease.

163
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,151
Prime Minister Gu, rise.

164
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,951
The crown prince

165
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,029
closed all gates of Xichang.

166
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,109
Besides,

167
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,190
anyone with my decree
isn't allowed to leave the capital.

168
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:09,790
Now, he mobilizes the Imperial Army.

169
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:11,430
Prime Minister Gu,

170
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,910
what to do now?

171
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:14,909
Your Majesty.

172
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,029
The crown prince's action

173
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,709
seems unusual.

174
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,709
By right,

175
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,190
he needs your decree

176
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:22,110
before mobilizing the Imperial Army.

177
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,109
Besides,

178
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,909
closing the city gates

179
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,870
will create a stir among the people

180
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:28,191
and cause unrest.

181
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,070
Perhaps His Highness
encounters an emergency

182
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:32,830
that he has to act

183
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:34,550
before obtaining your approval.

184
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,589
What would it be

185
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,430
to make him close the city gates?

186
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:45,270
Your Majesty, you should summon
His Highness and find the answer

187
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:47,151
from him in person.

188
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,190
Prime Minister Gu.

189
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:59,070
Do you think the crown prince

190
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:02,591
is planning a rebellion?

191
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,349
Your Majesty,

192
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,389
the priority now

193
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,869
is to summon him back for questioning

194
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,751
to solve unnecessary confusion.

195
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,231
Fine.

196
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:21,991
Ask the crown prince
to come to my palace.

197
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:23,070
Yes.

198
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:50,591
Lady Gu.

199
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,151
Lady Gu.

200
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:55,389
Lady Gu.

201
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,070
Why are you yelling?

202
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,190
I apologize.

203
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:02,320
Prime Minister specially delivered

204
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,700
this Ruyi Cake for you.
[*Ruyi means wishes fulfilled]

205
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,550
It's so delicious.

206
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,109
Your Highness.

207
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,550
We've searched through this area.

208
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:29,629
Nothing suspicious.

209
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,589
Keep searching.

210
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,229
Yes.

211
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:31,950
Move.

212
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:45,511
I told you

213
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,070
if you dare to lay your finger on her,

214
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,271
I'll take my life immediately.

215
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,190
That way,

216
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:54,749
you'll never find out

217
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,310
the whereabouts of Shu.

218
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,190
Tomorrow,

219
00:10:58,311 --> 00:10:59,270
you and your men

220
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:01,271
will be smashed by Li Ni's rage

221
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,111
before you run away.

222
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,910
Do you think

223
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,950
we came here unprepared?

224
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,830
Do you really believe

225
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:14,710
that we share
all our escape routes with you?

226
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,351
You!

227
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:23,150
What you and Shu know

228
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:24,589
is merely scratching the surface

229
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,229
of our arrangement.

230
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,871
We won't give a fig
if those spots are exposed.

231
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,111
I can let you go.

232
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:32,790
But this woman

233
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,950
must die.

234
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,720
(Missing Person)
Have you seen this person?

235
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,109
No.

236
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,910
- Have you seen this person before?
- No.

237
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:42,070
Have you seen this person before?

238
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:42,910
No.

239
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,231
- Have you seen this person before?
- No.

240
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,391
Excuse me. Have you seen
this person before?

241
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,351
Have you seen this person before?

242
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,550
Your Highness, we can't find her.

243
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,229
Your Highness. We can't find her.

244
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,111
Your Highness.

245
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,910
Your Highness.

246
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:58,790
His Majesty summons you

247
00:11:58,791 --> 00:11:59,989
to attend an audience right now.

248
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,430
I can't meet His Majesty now.

249
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:02,151
Go away.

250
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,109
Your Highness.

251
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,231
His Majesty demands to see you.

252
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,509
Do you want

253
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,511
to end your life with her?

254
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:28,749
What's so special about this woman?

255
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,310
Will she leave with you

256
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:32,070
when she wakes up?

257
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,670
She will.

258
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,070
I can tell that's your wishful thinking.

259
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,070
Does she love you?

260
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:44,589
If she does,

261
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,109
why did she marry Li Ni?

262
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,629
Li Ni forced her.

263
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,670
She loves me.

264
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:50,670
No, she doesn't love you.

265
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:52,589
Stop lying to yourself.

266
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,030
That's only your wishful thinking.

267
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:02,430
No.

268
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,830
It isn't.

269
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:06,910
Ying loves me.

270
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,351
Ying.

271
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,790
You love me, right?

272
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,710
Ying.

273
00:13:20,151 --> 00:13:21,471
Ying.

274
00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:23,871
Your Majesty.

275
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:25,271
Your Majesty.

276
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,469
Where's the crown prince?

277
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,989
Please forgive me.

278
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,790
His Highness said...

279
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,589
What did he say?

280
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,869
His Highness said

281
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,190
he has urgent matters

282
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:38,310
and can't come to the palace.

283
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,231
I

284
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,030
expected this.

285
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,030
(Missing Person)
Excuse me. Have you seen this person?

286
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:00,800
- No.
- Your Highness.

287
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,600
We've searched through
the residences around here.

288
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,349
Nothing suspicious.

289
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,150
Continue the search.

290
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:04,790
Yes.

291
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,709
Have you seen this person?

292
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,550
No.

293
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:09,749
Have you seen this person?

294
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,950
No.

295
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,509
Have you seen this person?

296
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,070
No.

297
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:15,190
- Have you seen this person?
- No.

298
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,310
What's your decision?

299
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,830
Only one survivor between you.

300
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:28,190
I think it's not worth dying for her.

301
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:30,190
She doesn't love you, after all.

302
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,351
It's best to kill her now.

303
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,389
Anyway,

304
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,469
you took the divine medicine.

305
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,351
You won't harm Jieshuo.

306
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,469
However, this woman

307
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,111
must die.

308
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,591
All right.

309
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,871
As long as you fulfill

310
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,591
all my requests,

311
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,030
you can kill her.

312
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,471
But...

313
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,391
But

314
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:04,351
I want to kill her myself.

315
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,709
Sure.

316
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,991
Great.

317
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,469
Hunters in Jieshuo kill the mares

318
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,629
if we can't tame them.

319
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,790
I hate seeing blood.

320
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,111
I want her body to be in one piece

321
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,710
with no bleeding.

322
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,151
Sure.

323
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:27,469
This is the best poison in Jieshuo.

324
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,550
She won't suffer.

325
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:31,391
Instant death and no bleeding.

326
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,511

This poison won't make you suffer.

330
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:55,550
You won't be in pain.

331
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:03,391
We're parting today.

332

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,149
to enter the palace immediately.

385
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,791
I told you I'm busy.

386
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,869
Your Highness.

387
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,750
His Majesty wants to see you right now.

388
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:11,550
If you refuse to come,

389
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,310
I can only use some force

390
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:14,750
as His Majesty directed.

391
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:22,109
Someone's here.

392
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,391
Ying.

393
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:25,710
Ying.

394
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,430
Ying.

395
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,750
We should leave now.

396
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,270
Don't touch me!

397
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,510
Ying.

398
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,190
Ying.

399
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:39,910
Ying.

400
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:43,311
Ying.

401
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,418
Tell His Majesty

402
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,739
you couldn't talk me out.

403
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,140
Or I'll kill you now.

404
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:52,380
Go away.

405
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:54,499
I said go away.

406
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:57,660
Hurry up.

407
00:19:57,939 --> 00:19:59,100
Leave.

408
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,710
Your Highness.

409
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:27,869
Your Highness.

410
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,109
The search squad
on the southern side reported

411
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,228
that a young lady

412
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:32,948
resembling the woman

413
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:34,349
we've been searching for

414
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,988
was seen in the almshouse.

415
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:37,200
Besides, the cuts on her body

416
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,850
seem to be similarly inflicted
by Jieshuo's blade.

417
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:40,669
Go to the almshouse.

418
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,829
Come on. Go

419
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:42,990
Let's go.

420
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,589
Ying.

421
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,670
Your Highness.

422
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,708
Wait.

423
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:14,829
I heard something.

424
00:21:19,229 --> 00:21:20,549
Ying.

425
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,629
(Ying.)

426
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,549
(I'm so sorry.)

427
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,789
Help...Ying.

428
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:23,990
Ying.

429
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,269
Ying.

430
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,430
Ying.

431
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:30,789
Ying.

432
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:31,948
Ying.

433
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:33,029
Ying.

434
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,230
Ying.

435
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,869
I bring Ying back first.

436
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,748
Chang'er, you keep searching for Taozi.

437
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,670
Yes.

438
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,320
Imperial physician.

439
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,880
- What has happened, Your Highness?
- Where are the imperial physicians?

440
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,268
Why haven't they come yet?

441
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:45,429
Send for them now.

442
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,750
Right now.

443
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,910
Ying.

444
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:51,829
Ying, you're not injured.

445
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,948
It'll be all right, Ying.

446
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:53,829
Don't scare me.

447
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,750
Ying.

448
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,788
Ying, wake up.

449
00:23:57,789 --> 00:23:58,670
Ying.

450
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,149
Ying.

451
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,390
Ying.

452
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,560
Your Highness.

453
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,760
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

454
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:57,389
Your Highness.

455
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,549
Your Highness.

456
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,109
Your Highness.

457
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:02,669
I can't feel

458
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,670
the crown princess's pulse.

459
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:07,190
Her Highness's breath has stopped.

460
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,950
She has passed away.

461
00:25:26,229 --> 00:25:27,710
Nonsense.

462
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,349
She won't die.

463
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,629
She just lost her consciousness.

464
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,268
All the physicians here have already

465
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:36,629
taken Her Highness's pulse.

466
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,829
There's no sign of her pulse.

467
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:41,269
She has passed away.

468
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,390
She has passed away.

469
00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:44,988
No.

470
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:45,748
Your Highness.

471
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:48,230
- She won't die.
- My condolences.

472
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,028
Come here.

473
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:51,508
- Please spare me, Your Highness.
- Save her.

474
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,510
-Save her.
- Please spare me, Your Highness.

475
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:55,389
Your Highness, you've been
in the army for years.

476
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,228
You should've known when you carried

477
00:25:57,229 --> 00:26:00,029
Her Highness back just now.

478
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,629
Get up.

479
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,268
What did you say?
What should I know?

480
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:05,069
What's it it? Tell me.

481
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,869
Your Highness.

482
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,948
What should I know?

483
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:08,028
- Your Highness.
- She won't die.

484
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:09,150
She won't.

485
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,748
She won't die.

486
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:11,788
Please spare me.

487
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:12,760
Why are you kneeling there?

488
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,748
I want you to save her.

489
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:14,788
Heal her.

490
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:15,508
Please spare me.

491
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:17,190
I said, heal her.

492
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,308
Bring her back.

493
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:19,268
Please, Your Highness.

494
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:20,629
Your Highness.

495
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,629
I don't care what methods you use.
Bring her back.

496
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,910
Spare me.

497
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:25,309
- Your Highness.
- Save her.

498
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,789
Save her.

499
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,429
- Please spare me.
- Come on.

500
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,389
Save her.

501
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,109
Come on.

502
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,029
Your Highness.

503
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,430
Your Highness.

504
00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:40,990
Save her.

505
00:26:43,989 --> 00:26:45,548
Spare me, Your Highness.

506
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:47,189
I beg of you, Your Highness.

507
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,150
Your Highness.

508
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,308
Please spare me.

509
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,228
Please.

510
00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:52,829
Your Highness.

511
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:56,309
Please.

512
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,069
I beg of you, Your Highness.

513
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,670
Please spare me, Your Highness.

514
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,228
Please.

515
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:06,150
Leave.

516
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,710
Leave this place.

517
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:10,948
Thank you.

518
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:12,269
Thank you.

519
00:27:12,709 --> 00:27:13,670
Go.

520
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,910
Ying.

521
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:00,789
Wake up.

522
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:04,750
If you don't wake up,

523
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,109
I'll tear this sketchbook up.

524
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,710
I'm going to tear it.

525
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:44,909
What do you want me to do

526
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,309
for you to wake up?

527
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,349
As long as you wake up,

528
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,869
I can do anything.

529
00:29:19,989 --> 00:29:21,309
Wake up, please.

530
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:24,629
I can kneel on the abacus.

531
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,309
We promised

532
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,269
that we'd fill this sketchbook full.

533
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,670
Please wake up.

534
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,029
Why are you still sleeping?

535
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:51,750
Why won't you wake up?

536
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,589
Just why?

537
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:03,789
I know it.

538
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,829
You don't wake up

539
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,029
because of the Eastern Palace.

540
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,910
Right.

541
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,549
I don't like this place either.

542
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:20,349
I'll take you to Wonderland.

543
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,109
Ying.

544
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:26,069
Let's go to Wonderland, all right?

545
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,510
But you promise me...

546
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,869
Promise me

547
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,589
you'll wake up when we reach there.

548
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,430
Deal.

549
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:41,789
Pinky promise.

550
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:53,269
Lady Gu.

551
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:56,189
Lady Gu, the crown princess
has passed away.

552
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,990
Lady Gu, the crown princess
has passed away.

553
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,548
The crown prince carried her back

554
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:04,149
and summoned many imperial physicians.

555
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:04,988
All of them said

556
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:06,589
the crown princess
has already passed away.

557
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,160
But the crown prince
refused to believe them

558
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,109
and insisted that she just fainted.

559
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,748
He drove all imperial physicians away

560
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:12,988
and scolded them

561
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:14,268
for being incompetent

562
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:15,670
to diagnose the crown princess.

563
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:19,069
It seems

564
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,789
that the crown prince is going to grieve
for some time.

565
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:23,669
I was surprised

566
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,309
upon hearing of her death.

567
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,869
Drop the smile.

568
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:34,468
The crown princess has passed away,

569
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:36,750
while the crown prince is devastating.

570
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,988
We shouldn't

571
00:31:38,989 --> 00:31:40,869
be celebrating here.

572
00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:43,710
Yes.

573
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:56,470
Ying.

574
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,230
Do you remember

575
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:01,389
we were sitting here

576
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,750
