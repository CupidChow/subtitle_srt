00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,000
It is not the grace
of a benevolent ruler

30
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:46,501
to wrong his officials

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,980
and persecute the loyalists.

Great General Cui...

Great General Cui

34
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,021
saved His Majesty's life.

35
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,941
Can I be called throwing a tantrum?

36
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,381
How could His Majesty

37
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:01,741
do such a foolish thing

38
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:04,301
and fall for the enemy's trick?

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,710
How can he rule
in such a way as an emperor?

40
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,341
How can he rule
in such a way as an emperor?

41
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:40,820
Your Highness.

42
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,500
Your Highness, what's wrong with you?

43
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,020
Your Highness, I beg you.

44
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,540
Please get up, Your Highness.

45
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:48,320
Your Highness,

46
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,700
it's raining so heavily.

47
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,740
Your Highness.

48
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,860
You've got a nosebleed, Your Highness.

49
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,420
Please get up, Your Highness.

50
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,260
Your Highness.

51
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,901
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

52
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,501
Are you alright, Your Highness?

53
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,061
Your Highness,

54
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,101
please get up now.

55
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,781
Let's think of something

56
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,020
and maybe we'll be able
to turn it around.

57
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,901
Shiqi. Get up, Shiqi.

58
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:12,820
His Majesty's just mad.

59
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,661
If I can persuade His Majesty,

60
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,300
there may be a chance
to turn things around.

61
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,860
Your Highness.

62
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,341
Your Highness, I beg you.

63
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:23,740
Please get up.

64
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,700
You have to take care of yourself.

65
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:28,901
Your Highness.

66
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:34,540
Your Highness!

67
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,300
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

68
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,860
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

69
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,580
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

70
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,140
Your Highness!

71
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:09,980
It's late

72
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,860
and you're still up?

73
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,501
I suddenly thought of something.

74
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,020
What's it?

75
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,180
Nothing.

76
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:20,300
Taozi,

77
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,821
go to the door and see

78
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:23,180
if General Pei Yuan is there.

79
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:26,261
If he is,

80
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:28,300
tell him you want to see him
and ask him to come?

81
00:04:30,781 --> 00:04:32,221
But it's so late

82
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:33,461
and it's raining so heavily.

83
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,101
What if he's not there?

84
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,620
I've been feeling uneasy.

85
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:41,300
I wonder if

86
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,461
it's raining too much.

87
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,021
It'll be fine.

88
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,461
The other day,

89
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:52,581
my father came home alone.

90
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:54,221
These days,

91
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:56,300
Li Ni hasn't sent anyone,

92
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,141
and he hasn't come himself.

93
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:01,620
I think he's too embarrassed
to come here.

94
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,740
After all,

95
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:04,420
he chased Great General back,

96
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:06,980
and he's the one
who got Great General and you

97
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,940
stuck in this residence.

98
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,980
This place is surrounded
like an iron barrel now

99
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,221
and we can't even get out.

100
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:18,180
I am thinking

101
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,420
that not long ago

102
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,620
he was seriously injured.

103
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,141
He must have traveled

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,570
more than a thousand li
in pursuit of my father

105
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,500
and he hasn't rested for a day

106
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,380
since he came back.

107
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,021
Taozi, you know

108
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,310
that his internal injuries
are really serious.

109
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,380
You'd better help me to see

110
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,540
if General Pei Yuan is here.

111
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,101
I'm feeling uneasy.

112
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,820
I feel like something's going to happen.

113
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:44,940
Don't worry.

114
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,901
I'll get going now.

115
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,101
How's it?

116
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,781
His Highness has exhausted his strength.

117
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,940
After suffering such a serious injury,

118
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:26,901
he should have been recuperating properly
for the past six months.

119
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,740
But he has been working so hard,

120
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:30,300
getting so upset,

121
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:33,021
and kneeling in the rain for so long.

122
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,620
He's weakened internally
and depleted externally.

123
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,141
His condition is not good.

124
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,620
I'll report to His Majesty right away.

125
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:43,701
I'll write a prescription first.

126
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:45,701
I remember

127
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:47,380
there was a girl called Taozi

128
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,221
who was good with acupuncture.

129
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,740
His Highness was treated by her

130
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,221
at that time.

131
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:54,380
Why don't we ask her

132
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,141
to treat him with acupuncture now?

133
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:56,901
Father.

134
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,540
Yuan.

135
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,300
I'll go and get Taozi.

136
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,821
Okay.

137
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:00,180
Yuan.

138
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:02,420
Yuan.

139
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:04,341
Come here.

140
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,341
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

141
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:09,021
Don't tell Taozi about this.

142
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,380
Your Highness,

143
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,420
but you're already...

144
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:12,540
Your Highness,

145
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,101
His Majesty has granted your request

146
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,940
and believes General Cui is innocent,

147
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:17,661
but...

148
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,341
But...

149
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,141
Your Highness,

150
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,370
Lady Gu is asking for an audience.

151
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:28,461
Go.

152
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:31,500
Don't worry.

153
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,661
Lady Gu.

154
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,261
I heard that His Highness
is not feeling well

155
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:07,141
from the palace

156
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,640
and called the imperial physician,

157
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,781
so I made a bowl of soup for him.

158
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,701
It's just a recurrence of an old wound.

159
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,810
It's not a big deal.

160
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:17,180
General Pei Yuan,

161
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:20,021
let me go in and see His Highness.

162
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,461
I'll leave after feeding him the soup.

163
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:23,781
Is it okay?

164
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,901
His Highness said

165
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,581
he's a bit tired
and doesn't want to see anyone.

166
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:31,021
Lady Gu,

167
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:32,221
you'd better go back early.

168
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:35,140
General Pei Yuan,

169
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,620
this is Eastern Palace.

170
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,810
My young lady is
His Highness's Lady of Excellence.

171
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,140
Is it really His Highness's order

172
00:08:40,181 --> 00:08:41,581
for you to stop her from entering?

173
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:42,821
Qiucui,

174
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,181
stop it.

175
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,110
Since General Pei Yuan said
His Highness doesn't want to see anyone,

176
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,421
so it's definitely His Highness's order.

177
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,660
General Pei Yuan,

178
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,941
Qiucui is rude.

179
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:58,541
I'll punish her severely
when I get back.

180
00:08:59,260 --> 00:08:59,941
It's alright.

181
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,341
The soup's gotten cold.

182
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,980
It's awful.

183
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,380
Young Lady.

184
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:06,140
Didn't I tell you

185
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,140
to call me Lady Gu?

186
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,461
I'm the crown prince's Lady of Excellence.

187
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,380
In the future,

188
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,380
I will be the crown princess.

189
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:31,120
(Cui Residence)

190
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,541
Young Lady,

191
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,980
it's been several days

192
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:39,821
since General Pei Yuan has been away.

193
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,620
I asked the imperial guards outside

194
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,410
to send him a message,

195
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:44,780
but he has not come,

196
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:45,941
and there is

197
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:47,221
no any reply from him.

198
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:48,740
Do you think

199
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:51,500
they will convict Great General?

200
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,541
No.

201
00:10:58,221 --> 00:10:59,260
Li Ni won't do so.

202
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:04,380
You don't even call him Shiqi anymore.

203
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,221
Are you angry?

204
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,301
Miss Taozi.

205
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:25,341
Chang'er is here too.

206
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,840
But he can't come in without an order.

207
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:29,181
Why don't you come out with me
and have a word with him?

208
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,301
Why do you look so pale?

209
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:44,980
Did something happen?

210
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,221
No.

211
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,181
Ying,

212
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:54,780
His Majesty and the ministers think

213
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:56,620
Great General Cui is innocent.

214
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,101
His Majesty has agreed

215
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,110
to let me marry you
as the crown princess.

216
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,380
But on one condition.

217
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:09,340
Cui Army has to be disbanded.

218
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:19,701
Cui Army has to be disbanded?

219
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,740
I can't agree to that.

220
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,341
Don't worry.

221
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,470
Cui Army will retire
and return to their hometowns.

222
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,780
Ministry of War
will take care of the aftermath.

223
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,221
If the imperial court thinks

224
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:42,581
there are too many members in the army,

225
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,341
it can be cut down,

226
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,221
but it cannot be disbanded.

227
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,660
Do you know

228
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,780
that Cui Army is my father's life work,

229
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,740
the lifeblood of the Cui family?

230
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,980
If Cui Army must be disbanded,

231
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,210
then I'd rather not marry you.

232
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,260
No way.

233
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:16,110
You must marry me
to be the crown princess.

234
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,900
Otherwise, it'll be difficult for me
to keep you and your father safe.

235
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,541
Then why did you

236
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,461
chase my father back?

237
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,061
If you hadn't stopped him,

238
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,900
he'd be back in Yingzhou by now.

239
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:28,780
If he had returned to Yingzhou,

240
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,581
we wouldn't be in such extreme danger

241
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,461
and at risk of being executed

242
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:33,380
as we are now,

243
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:36,181
and we wouldn't need you

244
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:38,541
to keep us safe.

245
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,870
Ying, do you still not understand?

246
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,701
The disbanding of the Cui Army

247
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:43,500
is inevitable.

248
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,000
If Great General Cui had returned
to Yingzhou,

249
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,701
the imperial court would be

250
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:49,701
more wary of Cui Army.

251
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
By then,

252
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,701
a war will break out.

253
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,061
Jieshuo is still waiting for
an opportunity to attack.

254
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:00,461
If Cui Army is disbanded,

255
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,500
what will happen to
the people of Yingzhou?

256
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,581
What will happen

257
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,061
to the 100,000 soldiers of Cui Army?

258
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,101
So the imperial court
doesn't care about these

259
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:10,061
just because
they're wary of the Cui family?

260
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,101
Cui Army isn't
the only army that can fight.

261
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:37,181
I see.

262
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:41,941
You're kicking us down the ladder.

263
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:44,900
Ying,

264
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,941
as I said,

265
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,110
Cui Army will retire
and return to their hometowns

266
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,860
and Ministry of War
will take care of the aftermath.

267
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,941
The soldiers won't be mistreated.

268
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:55,581
So it's my father and I
who have ulterior motives

269
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:56,810
and don't care about the big picture?

270
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:01,941
Yes.

271
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,710
I know you're trying to save everything.

272
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,541
But you can't always have the best
of both worlds.

273
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,240
I've done everything I can
to protect you and Great General Cui.

274
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,260
That's why the imperial court agreed

275
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:18,680
that you can be the crown princess

276
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:21,380
if Cui Army is disbanded.

277
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,140
And Great General Cui

278
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:24,900
will be my father-in-law.

279
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,980
If Cui Army must be disbanded,

280
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,500
and my father must be

281
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,581
forced into such a dead end,

282
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,181
then I'd better not marry you.

283
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,020
Talk to Great General Cui

284
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:12,421
and see what he chooses.

285
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,620
Disband Cui Army

286
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,040
and you'll be the crown princess.

287
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,720
If you don't become the crown princess,

288
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,370
Cui Army will still
have to be disbanded.

289
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,341
Otherwise,

290
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:33,740
I can't keep Great General Cui safe.

291
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,781
I knew everything.

292
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,061
Great General Pei has come in person.

293
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:45,501
He's made

294
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:49,620
a lot of things clear to me.

295
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,981
Father,

296
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,220
there's always a way.

297
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:00,821
I've had some arguments

298
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:02,140
with Li Ni,

299
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:04,021
but he's always

300
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,541
gone soft on me for a moment.

301
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:08,180
In a couple of days...

302
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,541
In a couple of days,

303
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,940
I'll trick him into coming here

304
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:13,101
and take him as a hostage.

305
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,341
So we

306
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,720
can find a way

307
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,261
to escape from the capital
and flee far away.

308
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:19,420
No need, Ying.

309
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,341
Like your mother,

310
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:23,460
in my life

311
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,380
I just want you to be well.

312
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,821
You and he are in love,

313
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,660
why should I

314
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,900
break you up?

315
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:41,660
Father,

316
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,061
I'd rather not get married then.

317
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,501
Cui Army is the life work

318
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:49,680
of generations of our family.

319
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,180
When I was a child,

320
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,180
you and Mother used to tell me

321
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,000
that the Cui family has been
defending Yingzhou for long.

322
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,101
Jieshuo repeatedly attacked the border,

323
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,380
so our ancestors

324
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,420
recruited warriors

325
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:08,940
primarily from the Cui family

326
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,460
to build Cui Army.

327
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,940
The title, Army of Victory,

328
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,140
was earned with the blood

329
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,090
of the Cui family's men

330
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,420
led by you.

331
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,341
Mother died defending the city.

332
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,101
Cui Army is the pride of you and mother

333
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,380
for the whole life.

334
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,180
No, Ying.

335
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:37,900
You're the greatest pride

336
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,940
of your mother and me.

337
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,900
Father,

338
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,061
I don't want to get married.

339
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,180
Let's flee far away.

340
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,860
Silly girl,

341
00:19:58,341 --> 00:19:59,620
I'm old.

342
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,301
Even when I return to Yingzhou,

343
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:06,140
I won't have

344
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,581
many days of peace and quietness.

345
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,741
I did

346
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,101
have the ambition to take down

347
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,220
Jieshuo for the imperial court.

348
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,180
But look,

349
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:27,660
Li Ni who has thousands of troops
in his heart.

350
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:30,940
He's younger than me,

351
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,821
and he'll do a better job than me.

352
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,821
With him,

353
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:42,420
Jieshuo will definitely be defeated.

354
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,301
Why do you think

355
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:47,821
I have to be

356
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:49,140
a stumbling block?

357
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,660
But Father,

358
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,420
I feel bad about it.

359
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:04,501
I feel bad to let it go too.

360
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,781
At first...

361
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:13,140
At first,

362
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:17,981
I was going to leave Cui Army to you.

363
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,460
If you're willing to get married,

364
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,821
this is the best dowry.

365
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,981
If you don't want to get married,

366
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,261
you can do

367
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,301
whatever you want

368
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:39,301
in this life.

369
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,021
Now,

370
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:46,581
you're going to be the crown princess.

371
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,101
This dowry is useless

372
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,101
and has become a hindrance.

373
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,061
Just let

374
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:04,061
my army of 100,000 men retire
and return to their hometowns.

375
00:22:51,386 --> 00:22:52,219
(Victory)

376
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,417
(Cui)

377
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:34,202
(Cui)

378
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:06,264
(Cui)
General Cui!

379
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,100
- General Cui!
- General Cui!

380
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,460
- General Cui!
- General Cui!

381
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,720
- General Cui!
- General Cui!

382
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:15,981
- General Cui!
- General Cui!

383
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,860
- General Cui!
- General Cui!

384
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,741
General Cui!

385
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:22,981
- General Cui!
- General Cui!

386
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:40,746
(Cui)

387
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:01,616
(Cui)

388
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:34,061
Father.

389
00:26:34,653 --> 00:26:36,240
(Victory)

390
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:37,494
(Cui)

391
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:18,059
(Victory)

392
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:45,301
Father.

393
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,940
Father.

394
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,341
What's with your hair?

395
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:08,940
Father.

396
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,981
Why is your hair all gray?

397
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,501
Ying,

398
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,981
I'm old.

399
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,341
I'm useless.

400
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,301
Not only can't I save your mother,

401
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:33,821
I can't even remember

402
00:28:33,821 --> 00:28:35,021
the way home.

403
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:39,380
I didn't even get to see

404
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:43,380
your mother before she died.

405
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:46,940
Am I useless?

406
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,220
Father, come on.

407
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:53,061
Let's not stay here.

408
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,581
Let's go home.

409
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,821
Let's go home, okay?

410
00:28:59,261 --> 00:29:02,261
No, you go home first.

411
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,981
I'm going to do a head count.

412
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,380
I'm going to do a head count.

413
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,900
- Father.
- I can't be late.

414
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,341
- Great General.
- Father.

415
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:11,341
Father.

416
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,581
Father.

417
00:29:12,741 --> 00:29:14,821
Father, where are you going?

418
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,541
Do a head count.

419
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,341
- Great General.
- Father.

420
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:18,420
I can't be late.

421
00:29:19,101 --> 00:29:20,021
I'm old.

422
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:21,000
- Great General.
- Father.

423
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,781
Let's go home, Father.

424
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,301
Where is Cui Army's camp?

425
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:28,460
Why can't I find it?

426
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:29,860
Father!

427
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,021
Where's the military camp?

428
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:34,341
Where's the military camp?

429
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,860
The military camp?

430
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,180
Where's the military camp?

431
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,341
Father!

432
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,710
I'm going to do a head count.

433
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:48,620
Do a head count.

434
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,700
Escort the bride in!

435
00:30:04,341 --> 00:30:07,021
- Escort the bride in!
- Escort the bride in!

436
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:32,420
Get into position!

437
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:36,860
Get the bride out of the litter!

438
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,940
In this auspicious time

439
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,301
of the month,

440
00:30:59,061 --> 00:31:00,981
the bride and groom

441
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,781
are to pay homage to the ancestors,

442
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,781
and to carry on the rite of passage

443
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,821
to the next generation.

444
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:29,380
Bow to heaven and earth,
ancestors and the nation,

445
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,821
in honor of blessings.

446
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,741
Bow down.

447
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,101
The second bow to the emperor
and the empress as great respect.

448
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,940
Bow down.

449
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,261
Husband and wife
pay homage to each other

450
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:52,581
for harmony inside and out,
and for the continuity of the lineage.

451
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,140
Bow down.

452
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,741
Have a drink together with
a thread tied to the cups.

453
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:42,380
The crown prince's
wedding ceremony is complete.

454
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,301
Time to receive
congratulations from all ministers.

455
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:54,270
- Long live, Your Highness!
- Long live, Your Highness!

456
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,480
- Long live, Your Highness!
- Long live, Your Highness!

457
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:58,700
- Long live, Your Highness!
- Long live, Your Highness!

458
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:22,055
(Double happiness)

459
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:01,900
Crown Prince,

460
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:03,180
Crown Princess,

461
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,940
it's your wonderful first night.
Please go to bed early.

462
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,720
I promised you to give in three times.

463
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,220
This is the first.

464
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,061
Kill me if you can.

465
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,000
You don't have to give in to me.

466
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:07,861
Crown Prince,

467
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:08,941
Crown Princess,

468
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,140
it's almost 7 AM. Time to get up.

469
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:37,700
Crown Prince,

470
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,981
Crown Princess,

471
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:40,700
please go to the Fengzhang Hall

472
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,021
to greet the emperor and empress.

473
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,300
The new daughter-in-law serves tea.

474
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,501
Father.

475
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:22,901
Mother.

476
00:38:31,941 --> 00:38:32,901
Rise.

477
00:38:34,581 --> 00:38:35,570
Thank you, Father.

478
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:38,101
Thank you, Mother.

479
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,180
Since, the crown prince
has taken a bride,

480
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,101
from now on, you two

481
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,700
must be of one heart and one mind,
and respect and love each other,

482
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,340
that's the way of being
husband and wife,

483
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,110
and that's the basis
of a good relationship.

484
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,810
- Yes, Father.
- Yes, Father.

485
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,541
The crown princess is new to the palace.

486
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,650
There are rules and
regulations in the palace,

487
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,740
and there are many affairs
to be attended to in Eastern Palace.

488
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,861
I have a very capable servant with me,

489
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:06,981
Madam Zhao.

490
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,501
I'd like to send her to Eastern Palace

491
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:11,220
to serve the crown princess.

492
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,170
Thank you for your kindness, Mother.

493
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:21,501
Mother,

494
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,300
there are many people in Eastern Palace.

495
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:25,061
The crown princess is served by

496
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,700
no less than a hundred servants.

497
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,620
Since she is such a capable person,

498
00:39:28,941 --> 00:39:31,061
it is better for her
to keep staying with you.

499
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,101
You men

500
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:35,250
don't know what it's like
to be a newly married woman.

501
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:36,941
If she doesn't have a

502
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,421
capable servant to help her,

503
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:40,300
she'll have to spend

504
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,700
a lot of energy and effort.

505
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,420
Since I've given her
to the crown princess,

506
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,981
you mustn't refuse.

507
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:51,461
Yes.

508
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:01,340
Your Highness.

509
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:02,861
You guys stay here.

510
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:04,140
Yes.

511
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:06,901
Ying.

512
00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:08,901
Ying.

513
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,910
What's the matter, Your Highness?

514
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,110
Obviously, the empress
gave you a servant

515
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,620
with the intention of spying on you.

516
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:17,861
Why did you agree without any excuses?

517
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,101
Her Highness has good intentions.

518
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,000
Your Highness, you're overthinking it.

519
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:23,941
Ying.

520
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:26,660
Don't do this to me, okay?

521
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:28,421
Are you trying to make me smile?

522
00:40:30,021 --> 00:40:30,941
I can.

523
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:34,660
If you hate me,

524
00:40:35,421 --> 00:40:36,820
stab me like you did last night.

525
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:38,541
Why should I stab you?

526
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,461
I can't beat you.

527
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,340
You will only give it to me three times,

528
00:40:43,981 --> 00:40:45,421
and now there are only two left.

529
00:40:45,981 --> 00:40:47,180
What if you

530
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:47,820
really kill me?

531
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,061
My dad is like

532
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:53,220
a child now.

533
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:56,101
He can't remember the way home

534
00:40:58,941 --> 00:41:00,381
and doesn't know that there is

535
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,381
no more Cui Army.

536
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,061
Every day, he still wants to

537
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,581
go back to the camp to take a look.

538
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,780
If I die,

539
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,140
my father won't survive either.

540
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:24,180
You wanted to marry me,

541
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,340
and now you have.

542
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,061
You wanted me to be the crown princess,

543
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:31,421
and I am now

544
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:32,180
the crown princess.

545
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:37,021
If you want me

546
00:41:39,941 --> 00:41:41,941
to love you the way

547
00:41:41,941 --> 00:41:43,061
I used to love Shiqi,

548
00:41:48,101 --> 00:41:49,381
I'm afraid I can't.

549
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:11,780
Young Lady.

550
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:13,220
Taozi.

551
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:14,780
Young Lady,

552
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,021
they just wouldn't let me in.

553
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,260
I've finally got to see you.

554
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,660
Why do you look so pale?

555
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,820
You seem to have

556
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:24,260
lost some weight in one night.

557
00:42:24,421 --> 00:42:25,381
Ying has no appetite.

558
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,240
She hasn't eaten anything
since last night.

559
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:28,700
Go and make some sweet soup

560
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,110
