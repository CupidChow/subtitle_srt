=Episode 10=

29
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:50,728
So, Miss Taozi?

30
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,928
Did I buy the correct ones?

31
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,320
The simulated death medicine
Lieutenant He asked

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,607
for His Highness is quite complicated.

33
00:01:57,607 --> 00:01:58,247
If we can't find

34
00:01:58,247 --> 00:01:59,487
all of the ingredients,

35
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:01,168
we won't be able to make it.

36
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:04,448
We're still missing a few ingredients.

37
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:07,848
But I've searched all the apothecaries

38
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:09,087
in the market.

39
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:10,927
I still couldn't find

40
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:12,568
the medicinal herbs you need.

41
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:15,767
Why don't I

42
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,927
accompany you to the mountain
to gather the herbs?

43
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:20,688
Some time ago,

44
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,528
I formulated a poison.

45
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:23,927
If it gets on your skin,

46
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:25,327
it'll be really itchy.

47
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,487
I've also developed the antidote.

48
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:28,487
It's just

49
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,408
that no one can help me try it yet.

50
00:02:30,607 --> 00:02:31,728
I'm not sure if it works.

51
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:33,207
Then let me try.

52
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,248
It's going to be very itchy.

53
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:36,807
I'm not joking about this.

54
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:38,688
If the antidote doesn't work,

55
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:39,568
you'll itch

56
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:40,848
for three days three nights.

57
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:42,688
It's all right, Miss Taozi.

58
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:43,487
I trust you.

59
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:44,848
Fine, then.

60
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:45,940
It's decided, then.

61
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:47,767
Since you're helping
me test the antidote,

62
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:50,408
I'll prepare the herbs
for Mister Shiqi as soon as possible.

63
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,448
All right.

64
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,568
I know you have a sweet tooth.

65
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:59,848
Try this flaky pastry.

66
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:02,968
Which store did you buy this from?

67
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:04,008
These weren't bought.

68
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:05,367
Miss Gu just brought them over.

69
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:09,367
Did she make them specially for you?

70
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,008
Of course not.

71
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:12,728
Yuan, Bao, and the rest got some too.

72
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,980
I remember you liking them.

73
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,470
So I especially brought them for you.

74
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:16,288
Have a bite.

75
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:18,008
Leave them here.

76
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:19,010
I'll enjoy them later.

77
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:19,887
All right.

78
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:22,288
By the way,

79
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,510
we made contact with the people
in the capital.

80
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:25,568
Everything is in place.

81
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,670
Just wait for the right moment.

82
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:29,119
The medicine is with Taozi.

83
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,110
But it's not formulated yet.

84
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:30,728
I know.

85
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:32,600
I have Chang'er following her every day

86
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:33,688
to see if he can help.

87
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:35,848
You asked Xie Chang'er
to give Taozi a hand?

88
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:37,607
He better not cause trouble.

89
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:38,848
Causing some trouble is not bad.

90
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:40,528
Lest she keeps staying by your side.

91
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,670
I'm also scared she'll prick me
with poison needles.

92
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:45,448
Why would she prick you
with poison needles for no reason?

93
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:50,968
Because...

94
00:03:57,848 --> 00:03:58,848
Let's break camp.

95
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,807
It's extremely not convenient

96
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,968
to stay with the Zhenxi Army.

97
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,207
We're moving out no matter what,

98
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,110
even if we have to camp outside.

99
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:09,568
Yes.

100
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:18,247
I suddenly remembered

101
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,328
it was our Young Master's favorite snack.

102
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,920
I'll go and deliver these
to him right now.

103
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,710
How could you give others the pastries

104
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:24,927
I brought especially for you?

105
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:27,888
You also gave me

106
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,208
what others gave you.

107
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:52,367
Grand Governor,

108
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:54,888
the Zhenxi Army and the Cui Army

109
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:56,567
joined hands to capture Dongdu.

110
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:59,768
Fu Yuan'er sacrificed himself
for the city.

111
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:00,607
What?

112
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:02,528
The Cui Army didn't go

113
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:03,528
to Yingzhou's rescue.

114
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,020
Instead, they joined forces
with the Zhenxi Army to attack Luoyang?

115
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:09,328
Based on Cui Yi's son,

116
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,567
Cui Lin's usual disposition,

117
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:14,088
it's clear that he can keep
his composure very well.

118
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,567
If I were in his shoes,

119
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:19,367
I'd also attack Luoyang first

120
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:21,047
and then save Yingzhou.

121
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,520
But Luoyang's defenses are solid
with plenty of food supplies.

122
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,840
Fu Yuan'er only needed to defend
instead of deploying the troops.

123
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,340
Even if the Zhenxi Army and the Cui Army

124
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:29,807
were ten times stronger,

125
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:32,600
it was still impossible
to capture the city in a short time.

126
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:35,127
Besides, Fu Yuan'er
is an experienced military commander.

127
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:37,487
How could he be defeated
by two young kids?

128
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:39,687
This time we lost

129
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:42,288
because I appointed an inappropriate man.

130
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:47,288
Luoyang's fall

131
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:49,848
reminds me of something.

132
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:53,328
A formidable enemy
is merely an external factor.

133
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:55,927
What truly has the power
to lead to one's downfall

134
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:57,728
is often an internal factor.

135
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:01,768
Xichang may appear strong and secure.

136
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:04,328
But I'm afraid it has weaknesses.

137
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:09,640
I'll send our men to look into
the noble families in the capital

138
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:12,127
to prevent any secret alliances
with the rebels.

139
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:14,367
Those conspirators

140
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:17,648
aren't limited
to just the noble families.

141
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:22,367
Mister Shiqi, the Cui Army breaks camp.

142
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:24,567
What? They're breaking camp?

143
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:25,247
Yes.

144
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:34,687
Lieutenant He,

145
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:36,528
everything is almost packed up.

146
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,247
I'll go for a stroll by the river.

147
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:39,447
I'll come with you.

148
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:40,047
No need.

149
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,910
Get back to your task.

150
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:41,567
All right.

151
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,780
Pack all the things inside quickly.

152
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:45,728
- Yes.
- Yes.

153
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:54,567
Why didn't you say anything

154
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,570
and suddenly broke camp
and move out of the city?

155
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:00,687
Does the Cui Army need to report

156
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:03,088
to you what they're doing?

157
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:06,447
Of course not.

158
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:08,848
But you're leaving in a hurry.

159
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,367
I thought I couldn't see you off

160
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:13,208
and also thought

161
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,247
about you returning to Yingzhou soon.

162
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,487
We'll be separated by a great distance.

163
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:19,567
I don't know when we will meet again.

164
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:26,408
Then, I promise

165
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:29,927
that I'll bid a proper farewell

166
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,687
before I return to Yingzhou.

167
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,260
Remember what you said.

168
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:47,047
How do you throw this?

169
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:52,728
There are many wolves in Laolan Pass.

170
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,970
Every time we encountered a wolf
while leaving the city,

171
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,328
we would pick up a stone
and throw it at the wolf.

172
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:58,408
Over time,

173
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:00,528
everyone mastered this skill.

174
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:02,687
In our free time,

175
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,110
we often go to the Laolan Pass riverbank
to play skipping stones.

176
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:06,447
The winner

177
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,687
gets the first piece of roasted lamb.

178
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:11,768
That sounds like fun.

179
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,247
Do you want to have a try?

180
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:15,247
Here.

181
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:27,408
Not far enough.

182
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:28,607
I'll teach you.

183
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,288
I'll show you.

184
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:32,750
Hold this.

185
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:12,207
I did it!

186
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,608
So that's how you do it.

187
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,044
(Virtuous and Blessed)

188
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:43,847
Shiqi,

189
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:50,207
Cui Li came to see me.

190
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:51,368
Cui Li?

191
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:56,608
He's ambitious

192
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,128
and unscrupulous.

193
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:00,288
He would do anything for power.

194
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:02,288
So,

195
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:03,807
what does he want from you?

196
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:06,567
He wants us to join hands
to kill Cui Lin.

197
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:08,768
(General Pei Yuan,)

198
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:11,967
I intend to ally with the Zhenxi Army

199
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,248
to eliminate Cui Lin.

200
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:18,008
Aren't you afraid I'll tie you up

201
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:19,727
and hand you over to Young Master Cui?

202
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:22,087
Forgive my bluntness.

203
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,567
But shouldn't we

204
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,207
be on the same side

205
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:29,008
when it comes to killing Cui Lin?

206
00:10:32,727 --> 00:10:34,608
From Wangzhou to Luoyang,

207
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:38,447
I'm sure my younger cousin
has caused you quite a bit of trouble.

208
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:40,168
Without him,

209
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,967
you would have gotten the food supplies,

210
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:44,168
and you would have taken this city
long ago.

211
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:45,168
General Pei Yuan,

212
00:10:45,768 --> 00:10:47,047
haven't you ever considered

213
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:49,807
eliminating this large threat
once and for all?

214
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:54,648
I can assure you

215
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:56,047
after Cui Lin is dead,

216
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,008
the Cui Army will be under my control.

217
00:10:58,168 --> 00:11:00,300
At that time, I'll pledge my loyalty
to Imperial Grandson,

218
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:03,168
and the Zhenxi Army
will be at the forefront.

219
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:08,727
Once we succeed,

220
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:10,727
let me control Luoyang.

221
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:11,750
What do you think?

222
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:14,967
You ask for Luoyang?

223
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:17,047
You sure are greedy, huh?

224
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:19,727
General Pei Yuan.

225
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:22,168
After Luoyang falls under my control,

226
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:24,248
the Zhenxi Army can march directly

227
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:25,528
to Xichang without delay.

228
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,207
Then you will be able
to kill Sun Jing, that traitor.

229
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:31,807
Then, the whole world
will belong to Imperial Grandson

230
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:34,008
and the Dayu Dynasty
will naturally be restored.

231
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:37,768
By then, will you still care
about a small city like Dongdu?

232
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:39,927
Is that so?

233
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,207
In that case, it's a deal, then.

234
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:47,327
If I may be bold enough

235
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:49,888
to request a token?

236
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:52,327
What kind of token?

237
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:56,447
I kindly ask Imperial Grandson
to write a letter stating

238
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:57,847
that after our success,

239
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,768
Luoyang will be mine.

240
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,528
What do you think?

241
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:04,888
General Pei Yuan,

242
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,528
what is the meaning of this?

243
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:08,288
Young Master Cui Li,

244
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:11,207
if you want His Highness's letter,

245
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:13,408
it depends on
whether you can kill Cui Lin.

246
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:15,528
You haven't done anything yet,

247
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:16,967
and you already want the letter?

248
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:18,888
Isn't that a little inappropriate?

249
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:21,008
Ah, yes.

250
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:22,087
It is.

251
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:23,248
You're right.

252
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:25,168
How about this?

253
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,807
Then I'll go and deal with
Cui Lin's subordinates...

254
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:29,768
After we succeed,

255
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,700
I'll request the token
from Imperial Grandson.

256
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:32,847
Does that work for you?

257
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,368
We'll discuss it when the time comes.

258
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:40,447
We must warn Cui Lin

259
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:41,888
about this kind of person.

260
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,248
So he can be on guard.

261
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:44,168
Shiqi.

262
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:45,488
I know what you want to say.

263
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:49,567
But I still want to face him head-on

264
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:51,847
on the battlefield openly.

265
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:53,847
I'm not willing to see him harmed

266
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,768
by unscrupulous tactics.

267
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,771
(Luoyang)

268
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,248
Miss Taozi.

269
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:07,807
Miss Taozi.

270
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:10,408
This one is from Mister Shiqi
to Lieutenant He.

271
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:14,047
And this one,

272
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:15,888
this is from me to you.

273
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:19,207
What's this?

274
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:20,727
Pig ears.

275
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:22,500
I went quite a distance to buy them.

276
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:23,368
It's still warm.

277
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:25,648
I don't want it.

278
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:28,687
Didn't you say you liked them

279
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,047
the other day?

280
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:32,768
I don't feel like eating them now.

281
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:38,967
What's wrong?

282
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,110
I've been staying outside the city
with Lieutenant He these past few days.

283
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:45,008
Do you feel

284
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:46,687
any discomfort?

285
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:48,168
No, not at all.

286
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:49,368
Your medicine worked well.

287
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:50,888
I only itched for two days.

288
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:58,288
Here, take this.

289
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:00,927
Apply it three times a day.

290
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:02,888
This medicine should work well.

291
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:04,447
Thank you, Miss Taozi.

292
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:13,288
What is it?

293
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,368
The pig ears.

294
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,807
I suddenly felt like eating them again.

295
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:19,528
Here you go.

296
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:30,847
Young ladies sure are strange.

297
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:33,927
Lieutenant He!

298
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,608
A letter from Imperial Grandson.

299
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:39,927
You look pretty happy.

300
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:42,447
No, I'm not.

301
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,910
What's there to be happy about?

302
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:46,807
Aren't you happy because of Ear?

303
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:50,047
What... What ears?

304
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:51,488
Aren't those pig's ears?

305
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:53,368
Lieutenant He,

306
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,648
I won't share them with you
if you tease me.

307
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:57,967
(Ying,)

308
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,488
(I heard there's a traitor
in the Cui Army)

309
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:02,128
(who's plotting)

310
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:03,927
(to kill Mister Cui.)

311
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,248
(You and Mister Cui should keep watch)

312
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:08,047
(and stay vigilant.)

313
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:09,567
From today onward,

314
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,510
we'll add an extra guard unit
to protect Young Master.

315
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,608
The march route to Yingzhou
may not be smooth.

316
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,207
We must ensure Young Master's safety.

317
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:15,807
Yes, ma'am.

318
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,967
I'll make the arrangements.

319
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:19,488
Ying,

320
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:20,807
why did you suddenly

321
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,087
increase the number of my guards?

322
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:24,168
Young Master, I received information

323
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,648
that Cui Li may pose a threat to you.

324
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:27,220
Our army is about to break camp,

325
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:28,168
and your safety

326
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:29,327
is our top priority.

327
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:31,248
Ying, don't worry about me.

328
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,168
The continuous march has been tough.

329
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,610
You already have a lot
on your mind lately.

330
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,888
You should take care of yourself more.

331
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:37,888
Considering your well-being
is my duty.

332
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:39,348
Persistent as always.

333
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:42,488
Taozi,

334
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,640
please deliver this letter

335
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:44,847
to Xie Chang'er.

336
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:48,168
What's wrong?

337
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:50,288
You've been teasing me lately.

338
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,888
I don't deliver letters
for you anymore.

339
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:55,300
Are you not in the mood
to deliver letters,

340
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:56,888
or are you avoiding seeing Xie Chang'er?

341
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,047
I...

342
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:00,567
If it's the latter,

343
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,248
then here's what I'll do.

344
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,368
I'll add a line to the letter,

345
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:04,248
telling them

346
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:06,087
to have Bao deliver future messages

347
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:08,008
to avoid upsetting Miss Taozi.

348
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:11,248
Look at you.

349
00:16:11,288 --> 00:16:13,488
They're all the same.

350
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:15,300
It doesn't matter
who delivers the letters.

351
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,447
I'll do it.

352
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,608
Go and return soon.

353
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:19,008
And don't bully Ear.

354
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:22,207
Who's bullying him?

355
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:25,727
How stubborn.

356
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:03,648
Are you asleep, Your Highness?

357
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:05,767
If you don't come,

358
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:06,848
I'm afraid I'll sleep

359
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:07,808
until the evening.

360
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,408
On the ground under the open sky,

361
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:12,168
you sure can feel at ease and carefree

362
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:13,608
wherever you go, Shiqi.

363
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,888
It's probably the gentle breeze

364
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:17,420
and natural fragrance from the plants.

365
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:46,128
Are you asleep?

366
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:47,727
Yes.

367
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:53,168
Why did you warn me

368
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:54,687
about Cui Li

369
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:56,648
trying to harm our Young Master?

370
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:00,808
Because if I warn you about it,

371
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,808
you'll definitely reply to my letter
and meet with me.

372
00:18:07,408 --> 00:18:08,967
What if I chose

373
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:10,687
not to ask to meet you?

374
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:13,848
In that case, I'll ask you out.

375
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,207
I'm returning to Yingzhou.

376
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:48,568
I promise
I'll give you a proper farewell.

377
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:15,927
It's raining.

378
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:18,640
I'll take you somewhere.

379
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:19,888
Sure.

380
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:34,287
I didn't expect

381
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:36,048
you to prepare such a house.

382
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:38,648
Of course.

383
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,820
Luckily, we have this house
to take shelter.

384
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:53,207
Or else we'll be soaking wet.

385
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:56,207
Well, it's not like I've never seen
you soaking wet before.

386
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:57,927
Funny enough,

387
00:19:58,088 --> 00:19:59,368
I've seen you soaking wet

388
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:00,687
a few times too.

389
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:23,048
A refreshing taste
with a hint of bitterness.

390
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:24,447
It has a unique flavor.

391
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,447
Is this bamboo leaf tea?

392
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:28,408
That's right.

393
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:29,808
Among the country folk,

394
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:32,328
they often use bamboo leaves
to make tea.

395
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:35,527
Despite your high status,

396
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:38,447
you seem to know a lot
about rural living.

397
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:41,287
In life,

398
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,720
things like social status
are hardly worth mentioning.

399
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:45,888
So what if one is an emperor?

400
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,408
They still need to eat and drink.

401
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:49,287
Actually I think

402
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,687
that living as a country bumpkin here

403
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:52,408
is more enjoyable.

404
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:54,727
But have you ever thought

405
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:56,967
that if the ruler is corrupt,

406
00:20:57,608 --> 00:20:59,408
the country folk will suffer?

407
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:01,007
Even plain meals

408
00:21:01,207 --> 00:21:02,447
will become a luxury.

409
00:21:03,088 --> 00:21:04,648
What's so enjoyable about that?

410
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,207
I wonder

411
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,447
if there's a meal here

412
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:18,848
to fill this country folk's stomach.

413
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:20,408
Well, I have it prepared.

414
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:23,727
This is also good.

415
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:29,810
This won't do.

416
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:33,727
I'm not a great cook.

417
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:35,207
If you don't mind it,

418
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:36,408
I can cook for you.

419
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,687
I wouldn't dare to complain

420
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:40,270
if you're taking charge of cooking.

421
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:41,608
But

422
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:44,608
I don't know much about cooking.

423
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:47,220
Oh, I can start a fire.

424
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:48,568
I think I'm able to do that.

425
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:50,168
All right. You'll do it, then.

426
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:52,648
Let me see.

427
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:02,608
I didn't expect you to prepare
such a selection of ingredients.

428
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:05,287
I was afraid you'd go hungry.

429
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:10,088
You can really cook!

430
00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:11,487
This is nothing.

431
00:22:11,888 --> 00:22:13,048
We wash clothes, hunt,

432
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:15,048
sew, and cook all by ourselves

433
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:16,207
back at Laolan Pass.

434
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:19,328
Didn't you bring any maids

435
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:20,687
to Laolan Pass with you?

436
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:22,687
If I had brought maids,

437
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,168
what would be the difference
from my life

438
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,470
at the lord's residence
in the capital?

439
00:22:27,368 --> 00:22:28,687
Despite being an imperial grandson,

440
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,568
you don't enjoy the luxurious life
at the lord's residence.

441
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:33,088
That's quite interesting, indeed.

442
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:39,687
You see.

443
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,700
I'm an ill-fated child born
in an inauspicious month.

444
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,970
Since young,
the late emperor and my father

445
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:45,048
never liked me.

446
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:47,088
I'd rather do

447
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,687
without such a luxury life.

448
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:03,767
Go and get the fire started.

449
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:05,808
All right.

450
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:08,168
Starting and setting up fire

451
00:23:08,328 --> 00:23:09,527
is what I'm good at.

452
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:19,767
Using the bellows to control the fire

453
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,527
requires some skill.

454
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:24,007
You have to slowly push it in

455
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:25,408
and pull it out

456
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:27,287
and do this slowly.

457
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:27,848
Also...

458
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:28,447
Let me try.

459
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,967
We have to control the heat carefully.

460
00:23:30,128 --> 00:23:31,247
It can't fluctuate too much,

461
00:23:31,447 --> 00:23:32,727
or the dishes won't turn out tasty.

462
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:34,128
Don't worry about it.

463
00:23:36,687 --> 00:23:37,207
Here.

464
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,808
The food is ready!

465
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:20,368
Eat it.

466
00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:24,608
It's just a simple meal.

467
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,110
Yet, you went out
to pick some wildflowers.

468
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:29,207
It may be a humble abode,
but it's filled with virtue.

469
00:24:29,527 --> 00:24:30,287
Shiqi,

470
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:32,608
you've prepared this meal
with such care.

471
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,568
How can we just rush through it?

472
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:38,767
The dishes are simple.

473
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:40,060
Sorry for bearing with them.

474
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:45,247
How is it?

475
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,368
It's delicious.

476
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:48,648
Then eat some more.

477
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:56,368
Aren't you afraid I poisoned the food?

478
00:24:56,848 --> 00:24:57,710
Of course, I'm scared.

479
00:24:58,608 --> 00:24:59,447
That's why

480
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:00,687
I added poisonous smoke

481
00:25:01,648 --> 00:25:02,910
while starting the fire just now.

482
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:05,700
Your Highness,

483
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,328
you're already poisoned now.

484
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:14,927
This is good.

485
00:25:16,727 --> 00:25:18,007
This is my specialty.

486
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:18,687
Here.

487
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:21,608
Eat more of these.

488
00:25:24,447 --> 00:25:24,948
Delicious.

489
00:25:26,168 --> 00:25:26,687
Here.

490
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:54,888
Destroy this place!

491
00:25:55,048 --> 00:25:56,487
Destroy this vixen's den!

492
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,860
Stop it!

493
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,300
Stop it!

494
00:26:06,128 --> 00:26:06,927
Madam of Wei,

495
00:26:07,088 --> 00:26:08,128
this is the imperial harem.

496
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:09,527
How dare you act so recklessly here?

497
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:11,527
So you know this is the imperial harem.

498
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:13,527
Then why is the former Crown Princess

499
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:15,447
still living in the imperial harem?

500
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:19,147
It was you
who seduced the Grand Governor

501
00:26:19,147 --> 00:26:20,727
and brought disaster
to our country and people!

502
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:22,848
It was because of you
my brother was captured!

503
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,088
Today, I must tear you apart,

504
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:25,487
you crazy woman!

505
00:26:25,648 --> 00:26:26,687
Give me back my brother!

506
00:26:26,848 --> 00:26:27,487
Let go!

507
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,447
I'll kill you!

508
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:30,787
- Give Grand Governor back to me!
- Let me go!

509
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:31,848
- Give me back my brother!
- Let me go!

510
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:33,727
I'll kill you today!

511
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,247
Grand Governor has arrived!

512
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:38,527
Let me go!

513
00:26:55,168 --> 00:26:55,808
Someone.

514
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,767
Madam of Wei is ill.

515
00:26:58,247 --> 00:26:58,967
Bring her away

516
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,368
and call for the physician right away.

517
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:01,128
Yes.

518
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,007
Grand Governor.

519
00:27:02,927 --> 00:27:03,527
Let me go!

520
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:04,247
Grand Governor!

521
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:06,727
- Grand Governor!
- Everyone, leave!

522
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:08,368
Grand Governor!

523
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:10,487
Are you all right?

524
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:12,767
You're injured.

525
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:18,808
Sorry that you have to go through this.

526
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,247
It's all right.

527
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:28,128
I knew this
would happen sooner or later.

528
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:30,648
Why would I feel sad?

529
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:37,888
I've been thinking
for the past several days.

530
00:27:39,247 --> 00:27:42,007
If I took you away back then,

531
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,487
how would our lives turn out?

532
00:27:47,608 --> 00:27:48,888
Back then,

533
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:52,408
I waited at Shili pavilion

534
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:55,007
for you all day.

535
00:27:56,328 --> 00:27:57,808
Until the sun had set,

536
00:27:58,247 --> 00:27:59,687
you didn't show up.

537
00:28:01,328 --> 00:28:02,088
So I knew

538
00:28:02,287 --> 00:28:03,848
you would never come.

539
00:28:08,168 --> 00:28:11,287
Even though I was selected
as Crown Princess at that time,

540
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:15,687
if you were willing to take me away,

541
00:28:16,408 --> 00:28:18,767
I would have gladly run away with you.

542
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:20,848
We could live under different names.

543
00:28:21,808 --> 00:28:24,088
Even if we had to live
as a humble and poor couple,

544
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:26,687
I would have been content.

545
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,767
I've let you down.

546
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:37,648
No, you did not.

547
00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:39,808
I know

548
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:42,287
you had a mother

549
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:44,408
and younger siblings at home.

550
00:28:45,568 --> 00:28:47,767
If you had truly taken me away,

551
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:51,447
your whole family
would have been executed.

552
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:54,888
I have committed a grave sin.

553
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:58,088
But whenever I think of the days

554
00:28:58,207 --> 00:28:59,967
I had spent with you,

555
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,927
even if they were stolen moments,

556
00:29:02,368 --> 00:29:04,128
as long as I could be with you,

557
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,007
no matter if others cursed me

558
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:07,247
or scorned me,

559
00:29:07,927 --> 00:29:09,888
I'd still be happy.

560
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:39,247
General Han,

561
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:44,007
are we very far

562
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:46,447
from Xichang now?

563
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:51,447
We're already
several thousand miles away.

564
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:53,687
Even with fast horses,

565
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:55,687
it will still take over ten days.

566
00:29:58,848 --> 00:30:00,888
Mother's last words to me

567
00:30:01,088 --> 00:30:02,808
was to escape

568
00:30:03,007 --> 00:30:04,287
as far as I can.

569
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,487
But General Han,

570
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:08,048
I don't want to escape anymore.

571
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:10,088
I'm Crown Prince's eldest son,

572
00:30:10,247 --> 00:30:11,727
the country's great imperial grandson.

573
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:13,287
But now,

574
00:30:13,568 --> 00:30:15,927
I'm hiding like a mouse,

575
00:30:16,287 --> 00:30:18,048
scurrying in all directions every day.

576
00:30:25,128 --> 00:30:26,808
Remember the stories

577
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:28,848
about General Han Xing

578
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,687
and King Yue Goujian I told you?

579
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:34,207
Your Highness, you're avoiding danger.

580
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,820
You have to endure
the humiliation and hardship

581
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:37,207
so that there's a future for you

582
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:38,967
to reclaim the land one day.

583
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:40,328
You once said

584
00:30:40,527 --> 00:30:42,168
that General Li Ni,
who leads the Zhenxi Army

585
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:43,888
is my seventeenth cousin.

586
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:46,727
The Zhenxi Army has already advanced
from Laolan Pass

587
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,368
all the way to Wangzhou.

588
00:30:49,168 --> 00:30:50,368
Ni is quite formidable

589
00:30:50,568 --> 00:30:51,808
in leading the troops.

590
00:30:52,048 --> 00:30:53,648
I really wish to be like him

591
00:30:53,848 --> 00:30:55,247
where he stands against the enemies

592
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:56,648
and engages in battle.

593
00:30:58,487 --> 00:31:01,687
The seventeenth imperial grandson
does achieve remarkable military feats.

594
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:06,007
But the Zhenxi Army
was originally a local garrison.

595
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:08,927
General Pei Xian was not close
to the former crown prince.

596
00:31:09,687 --> 00:31:11,408
Your Highness, you have a noble status.

597
00:31:11,808 --> 00:31:13,368
Even blood relatives

598
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:15,527
should not be trusted that easily.

599
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:18,168
Furthermore, Lord Liang

600
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:20,487
is still detained by Sun Jing
in Xichang.

601
00:31:21,487 --> 00:31:23,568
Li Ni likely has concerns

602
00:31:24,328 --> 00:31:25,727
and things to consider about.

603
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:28,088
General Han,

604
00:31:28,447 --> 00:31:29,888
when can we return

605
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,808
to Xichang?

606
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:33,767
The day will come.

607
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:36,608
I will ensure

608
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:38,410
Your Highness's safe return to Xichang

609
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:42,207
with dignity and honor.

610
00:31:45,568 --> 00:31:47,128
Since Sun Jing's uprising

611
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,088
and leaving Pingliang,

612
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,927
I haven't enjoyed

613
00:31:52,648 --> 00:31:54,128
such a peaceful afternoon.

614
00:31:56,527 --> 00:31:58,568
Being able to enjoy the rain

615
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,967
with a kindred spirit under the eaves

616
00:32:00,328 --> 00:32:01,287
is rare.

617
00:32:06,328 --> 00:32:07,287
A few days ago,

618
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:09,088
I even dreamt of returning
to Laolan Pass

619
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,447
and caught a particularly plump sheep.

620
00:32:11,927 --> 00:32:12,687
I was roasting it

621
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:13,967
when I woke up.

622
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:18,767
I'm truly curious.

623
00:32:19,128 --> 00:32:22,408
Is Laolan Pass truly that wonderful?

624
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,328
Is it worth your constant nostalgia?

625
00:32:26,207 --> 00:32:27,648
Going about without any paths

626
00:32:28,088 --> 00:32:29,287
and houses without walls.

627
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:30,808
Isn't that contentment?

628
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:33,848
In the future, I plan to invite you

629
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:34,767
to Laolan Pass with me.

630
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:36,020
Are you willing to come with me?

631
00:32:43,368 --> 00:32:45,048
You know that was just a dream.

632
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:49,927
Things may look peaceful.
But there are still hidden issues.

633
00:32:52,447 --> 00:32:53,408
Shiqi.

634
00:32:54,568 --> 00:32:56,207
With your current identity,

635
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,520
do you still think
you can leave everything behind

636
00:32:59,328 --> 00:33:00,727
and return to the border

637
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:03,007
to live that kind of life?

638
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,408
We don't always have rain

639
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:25,927
to trap both of us here.

640
00:33:26,368 --> 00:33:27,247
After the rain stops,

641
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:28,967
we'll have to part ways again.

642
00:33:29,568 --> 00:33:30,608
Let's talk about something else.

643
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:39,207
All right, then.

644
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:40,767
Tell me about yourself.

645
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,048
Were you really naughty

646
00:33:43,247 --> 00:33:44,808
when you were a kid?

647
00:33:47,007 --> 00:33:48,007
Not only naughty,

648
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:49,328
I was downright unruly.

649
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,420
I've lost count of how many bamboo rods

650
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:52,967
my father used to whip me had broken.

651
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:55,608
It seems that Lord Liang's

652
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:57,128
diligent discipline

653
00:33:57,247 --> 00:33:59,287
doesn't have much effect.

654
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:01,408
I'm not afraid of getting beaten.

655
00:34:01,687 --> 00:34:02,767
I'm afraid of nagging.

656
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:05,687
My mother passed away

657
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,128
while giving birth to me.

658
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:09,088
In the residence,

659
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:09,968
only Consort Dong

660
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:11,327
took really good care of me.

661
00:34:12,247 --> 00:34:13,767
My father despises me.

662
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:16,168
My two older brothers

663
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:18,247
always took advantage of Father's favor

664
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:20,088
and made me take the fall
and take a beating.

665
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:22,088
Over time,

666
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:23,887
my father hated me even more.

667
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,687
He would frown whenever he saw me.

668
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:28,048
I never expected

669
00:34:28,968 --> 00:34:30,448
you would still be treated this way.

670
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:34,327
Both my older brothers

671
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:36,367
were born to Consort Dong.

672
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:38,247
My mother

673
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,608
was Consort Dong's maidservant.

674
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:41,608
She was not favored at first.

675
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,648
But fortunately, Consort Dong
treated my mother very well.

676
00:34:45,568 --> 00:34:47,048
After my mother passed away,

677
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:49,488
Consort Dong looked after me.

678
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:51,528
For her,

679
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:54,608
I just tolerated my brothers.

680
00:34:59,608 --> 00:35:01,327
You are a kind-hearted person.

681
00:35:02,207 --> 00:35:03,887
When someone treats you well,

682
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:07,327
you repay them tenfold.

683
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:09,168
Later,

684
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,648
Consort Dong passed away.

685
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:18,608
I no longer have anyone I cherish

686
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:21,407
and I've grown tired of life
in the capital.

687
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:25,367
I'd rather serve at the border
to protect the country.

688
00:35:27,247 --> 00:35:28,807
So, I came up with an idea

689
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,247
and left for Laolan Pass.

690
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:33,407
The day I left,

691
00:35:35,407 --> 00:35:36,407
my father and brothers

692
00:35:36,528 --> 00:35:37,687
were exceptionally happy.

693
00:35:39,327 --> 00:35:40,128
Only my wet nurse

694
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:41,608
was crying as she sent me off.

695
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:43,608
What about your wet nurse?

696
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:45,727
Is she still at the lord's residence?

697
00:35:47,727 --> 00:35:48,807
She was already old.

698
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,247
After I left the lord's residence,

699
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:51,767
I sent her back to her hometown

700
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:52,928
to enjoy her retirement.

701
00:35:54,928 --> 00:35:56,488
Thankfully, I left the capital.

702
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:59,928
However, it's been a long time
since I last saw her.

703
00:36:00,807 --> 00:36:02,807
I hope she is well.

704
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:11,367
You won't feel lonely

705
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:14,048
when you have someone to care about.

706
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,968
My mother passed away a long time ago.

707
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:22,207
I can hardly remember

708
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:23,407
what she looked like.

709
00:36:25,128 --> 00:36:26,727
But every time I think of her,

710
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:29,448
I feel like she's still with me,

711
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:32,648
and I don't feel alone.

712
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,168
What were you like as a child?

713
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:39,807
I really can't imagine it.

714
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:41,367
I'm guessing

715
00:36:41,528 --> 00:36:43,128
you were probably quite mischievous

716
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:44,648
and stubborn, right?

717
00:36:49,327 --> 00:36:49,847
(I was raised)

718
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:51,448
(as a boy from a young age.)

719
00:36:52,207 --> 00:36:53,568
(I studied and practiced martial arts)

720
00:36:53,968 --> 00:36:55,687
(just like the boys.)

721
00:36:56,687 --> 00:36:57,928
(Whatever the boys learn,)

722
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:00,407
(I want to be better
than them at everything.)

723
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:05,687
Did your parents force you?

724
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:06,867
No,

725
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:08,767
I did it willingly.

726
00:37:10,165 --> 00:37:11,240
(Victory)

727
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:12,767
(I'm a girl.)

728
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,220
(But my aspirations were no different
from men's.)

729
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:17,568
(It's only normal
to put in more hard work.)

730
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:20,887
- Excellent!
- Remarkable!

731
00:37:47,168 --> 00:37:50,128
- Awesome!
- Bravo!

732
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:52,327
(I woke up before dawn
and slept late at night.)

733
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:54,008
(I sweat more)

734
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:55,528
(and shed more blood than others.)

735
00:37:56,847 --> 00:37:58,008
(Sometimes, I would be too exhausted)

736
00:37:58,207 --> 00:37:59,207
(or injured.)

737
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:00,968
(Even if it was really tough,)

738
00:38:01,088 --> 00:38:02,327
(I would quietly bear it,)

739
00:38:02,687 --> 00:38:04,448
(not wanting anyone to know.)

740
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:18,608
What are you thinking about?

741
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:24,287
I was thinking

742
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:27,008
it would be great if we had met earlier.
