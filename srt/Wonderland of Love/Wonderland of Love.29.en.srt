Great General.

30
00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:48,542
During the battle today,

31
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,542
we captured the leader
of the Fanggong Troops of Jieshou.

32
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,861
He claims to know
Liu Chengfeng's whereabouts

33
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,942
and wants to trade
this information for his life.

34
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:56,861
After thorough interrogation,

35
00:01:56,862 --> 00:01:58,063
he said

36
00:01:58,262 --> 00:01:59,261
after Liu Chengfeng

37
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:01,462
captured Baishui Pass for Jieshuo,

38
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:03,061
Chief Wuluo of Jieshuo deployed

39
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:04,542
another group of soldiers

40
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:06,703
to re-enter the Central Plains.

41
00:02:07,422 --> 00:02:09,102
But their destination is unknown.

42
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:14,783
Wuluo is a cunning and ruthless man.

43
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:16,783
He's skilled in making
the most of any situation.

44
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:19,702
Since he invested so much

45
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:21,022
and deployed his men

46
00:02:21,023 --> 00:02:23,382
to follow Liu Chengfeng
and infiltrate the Central Plains,

47
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:25,183
he must be up to something.

48
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:28,341
Interrogate the leader

49
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:30,303
of the Fanggong Troops carefully.

50
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:32,862
Find out the whereabouts

51
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:35,023
of those from Jieshuo.

52
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:36,063
Yes, sir.

53
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,343
Lord Qi.

54
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,621
Mr. Liu,

55
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,542
you're indeed bold.

56
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:56,341
After the Baishui Pass incident,

57
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,142
everyone wishes

58
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,381
to devour your flesh
and sleep in your skin.

59
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:00,381
You still have the courage

60
00:03:00,382 --> 00:03:02,303
to come and see me in Xichang?

61
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,022
The trouble caused by Jieshuo

62
00:03:04,023 --> 00:03:06,142
is merely a minor inconvenience.

63
00:03:06,382 --> 00:03:08,223
But your troubles lie

64
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:10,583
within reach.

65
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:13,463
You're right.

66
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:16,022
Lord Qin has been
quite aggressive lately.

67
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:17,341
And my troubles

68
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:19,343
are urgent indeed.

69
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:21,781
Thank you for lending me your troops.

70
00:03:21,782 --> 00:03:22,902
This time,

71
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,742
I've brought a significant force with me,

72
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:27,542
ready to serve Your Highness at any time.

73
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:34,142
As the Lord Qi of the current dynasty,

74
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:36,302
it might not be appropriate for me

75
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:37,583
to use Jieshuo's troops.

76
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:40,982
Your Highness, if there are matters

77
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:42,743
you need to handle discreetly

78
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:48,623
or secretly,

79
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:51,821
we're all willing to follow your orders

80
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:53,583
and serve you.

81
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:55,781
No matter what happens,

82
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:57,341
we will never reveal

83
00:03:57,342 --> 00:04:00,262
our connections with you.

84
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:03,902
Mr. Liu, you're offering me such help.

85
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:05,702
What exactly are you after?

86
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,023
Your Highness is straightforward.

87
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:09,942
So, I'll be frank.

88
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,661
Marrying only Cui Lin is not enough.

89
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:14,341
Only when Li Ni is dead,

90
00:04:14,342 --> 00:04:16,383
then can we eliminate future troubles.

91
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:21,422
I only want Li Ni dead.

92
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:29,622
Ni surely has offended many people.

93
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:33,181
Rest assured, Your Highness.

94
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:35,142
Lord Qin has many enemies.

95
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:37,422
So, he won't be able to live long.

96
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:44,981
Ni always loves to be in the limelight.

97
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:47,662
If he meets an untimely death,

98
00:04:47,782 --> 00:04:50,102
it would be a pity.

99
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:59,143
Time passes so quickly.

100
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:01,662
When I was young,

101
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:04,263
I thought time passed very slowly.

102
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,502
But now that I'm grown up,

103
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:08,302
I realize

104
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:11,143
that happy moments

105
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:13,703
always pass quickly.

106
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,102
Are you happy today?

107
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:22,182
Today

108
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,263
should be the happiest day

109
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:27,823
of my life.

110
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:30,422
Me too.

111
00:05:36,742 --> 00:05:38,662
Unfortunately,
no matter how happy we are,

112
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,502
this day has to end.

113
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,542
How I desire to make
this moment last longer.

114
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:49,383
No matter how reluctant I feel,

115
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,583
this day

116
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:55,903
still needs to end.

117
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:00,742
You're right.

118
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:13,182
Shiqi,

119
00:06:13,383 --> 00:06:14,981
if one day

120
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:15,902
I do something

121
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:17,462
that angers you,

122
00:06:17,463 --> 00:06:19,903
will you stop liking me?

123
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:22,783
Will you remove me from your heart?

124
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,142
Originally,

125
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,421
I wanted to lie to you

126
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:33,182
and say yes.

127
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,542
But I can't bear to do that.

128
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:38,583
I like you very much.

129
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:42,622
Maybe I will like you for a very long time.

130
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,823
I think

131
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:46,981
I won't be able to like someone else

132
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:48,463
the way I like you.

133
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:51,383
So, no matter how you treat me,

134
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:53,943
I still like you.

135
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:04,343
I also know

136
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:08,143
there is a limit to tolerating others.

137
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,823
How about we make another bet?

138
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:15,742
What are we betting on?

139
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,062
Close your eyes and count to ten.

140
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:21,661
If you can keep

141
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:23,262
your eyes closed,

142
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:24,862
you win.

143
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:26,783
Then after this,

144
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,583
if we become enemies,

145
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,583
I will yield to you three times.

146
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,742
But if you open your eyes,

147
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:36,463
then if we become enemies

148
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:38,343
in the future,

149
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:40,903
you have to yield to me three times.

150
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:42,343
How about that?

151
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:48,383
All right.

152
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:50,223
Let's start counting.

153
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:54,102
One.

154
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:57,383
Two.

155
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:00,783
Three.

156
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:04,143
Four.

157
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:40,343
I lost.

158
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:44,543
From now on,

159
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:46,982
I owe you three concessions.

160
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:21,943

190
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,020
and preventing any further trespassing.

191
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,982
I, Cui Yi,

192
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:57,421
will personally escort the seven leaders

193
00:11:57,422 --> 00:11:59,541
of Jieshuo's Shenli Troops,
and Fanggong Troops

194
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,102
to present them in triumph
to the court

195
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:02,461
in congratulations to our Emperor!

196
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:06,862
Long live the Emperor!"

197
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:11,022
I always knew

198
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,222
I was destined

199
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:14,622
for great achievements

200
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:16,463
and invincibility in battles.

201
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:21,142
Your Majesty,

202
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:23,262
the success of Cui Yi

203
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:24,622
in reclaiming Baishui Pass

204
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:26,941
is also a result
of Your Majesty's wise decisions

205
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:28,821
and proper appointments.

206
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:30,742
Without the imperial decree
from Your Majesty,

207
00:12:30,743 --> 00:12:33,222
granting support
from the six ministries,

208
00:12:33,223 --> 00:12:35,061
such a triumph
would not have been achieved.

209
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:37,022
Official Pei is correct.

210
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:41,063
Although I issued the decree,

211
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:44,701
it is due to the diligence

212
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:46,102
and support of the officials

213
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:47,782
from the six ministries

214
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:50,022
that the Cui Army succeeded.

215
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:54,301
Thanks to the recent return
of Official Pei to the court.

216
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:56,461
Otherwise, I wouldn't know

217
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:57,742
whom to entrust with the task

218
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,543
of presenting the captives.

219
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:02,622
According to the usual procedures,

220
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:04,982
the Ministry of Rites will handle it
with the Ministry of War.

221
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:06,102
No matter.

222
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:07,661
They may be the ones handling it.

223
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,382
But Official Pei,

224
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:12,663
you need to oversee it on my behalf.

225
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:14,142
Yes, Your Majesty.

226
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:18,142
Since the offering of the captives
to the ancestral temple is significant,

227
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:20,622
we should immediately grant
a general amnesty to the entire nation.

228
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:24,142
Issue an edict

229
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,541
to release Lord Xin from confinement.

230
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,301
So, he can join

231
00:13:28,302 --> 00:13:30,463
in the offering of captives with me.

232
00:13:30,782 --> 00:13:32,421
- Yes.
- Is that appropriate?

233
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:33,223
Exactly.

234
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:38,463
Your Majesty.

235
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:40,343
The victory of the Cui Army,

236
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:41,982
what did Lord Xin contribute
to the victory?

237
00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:43,821
Lord Xin intentionally set fire,

238
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,502
causing the death of dozens of lives.

239
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,063
How long has he been imprisoned?

240
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:49,463
Do you intend to pardon him?

241
00:13:50,182 --> 00:13:52,541
He's your brother.

242
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,742
Why are you not letting this go?

243
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:57,343
Is the death

244
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,982
of Consort Xin just?

245
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:02,102
He's right.

246
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:06,541
Your Majesty.

247
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,061
Besides the urgent report,

248
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:09,181
the Great General Cui

249
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,581
also submitted a memorial

250
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:12,982
that arrived together.

251
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:15,663
Attendant Yuan,

252
00:14:15,702 --> 00:14:17,502
read the memorial.

253
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:18,661
It looks like

254
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:20,902
Cui Yi made too many accomplishments

255
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,821
that he submitted another memorial

256
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:24,782
because one urgent report is not enough

257
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,421
to commend

258
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:28,502
the contributors for this achievement.

259
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:29,543
Yes, Your Majesty.

260
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,303
Read it.

261
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,480
"I respectfully implore
Your Majesty's peace and well-being.

262
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,581
I, Cui Yi, serving as the Great General
of Pingliang, and Weiyang,

263
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:43,862
Commander-in-chief of the Shuozhou,

264
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:46,301
and the Great General of the Left,

265
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,541
submit this memorial in selecting
the Crown Prince.

266
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:49,862
I humbly request

267
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:53,280
to appoint Lord Qin, Li Ni,
as the Crown Prince

268
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,760
to secure the foundation
of the nation..."

269
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,862
Stop reading!

270
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,342
This Cui Yi

271
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:03,543
is truly reckless!

272
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:07,343
Your Majesty.

273
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:09,943
You're known for being understanding.

274
00:15:10,023 --> 00:15:11,701
But you're also a wise
and virtuous ruler.

275
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,160
It's crucial to choose words carefully

276
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,781
so as not to demoralize

277
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:17,541
the commanders on the front lines.

278
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,181
Does he think winning battles

279
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:20,541
gives him the right to meddle

280
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:22,142
in my family affairs?

281
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:24,781
This old man

282
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:27,742
truly lacks understanding and respect!

283
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:29,301
Your Majesty,

284
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:31,742
the matter of selecting an heir
is not a personal affair

285
00:15:31,743 --> 00:15:34,181
but a significant national concern.

286
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:36,342
As a Great General stationed
at the border,

287
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:37,742
it's reasonable for Cui Yi

288
00:15:37,743 --> 00:15:39,663
to submit this memorial.

289
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:41,502
Prime Minister Gu, are you saying

290
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:44,663
that old man makes sense?

291
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:46,982
Although Your Majesty's reign
is flourishing,

292
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:48,502
the matter of succession

293
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:50,982
is fundamental
to the nation's stability.

294
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,742
Appointing a Crown Prince sooner

295
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,862
can ensure the stability
of the entire country.

296
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:57,022
Don't lecture me

297
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,581
with such grand principles!

298
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,703
The decision to appoint a Crown Prince
is mine to make!

299
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,760
No matter what,

300
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,502
he's neither the legitimate heir
nor the eldest.

301
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:07,423
So, Li Ni has no claim to the position.

302
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:12,022
Your Majesty,

303
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:13,622
forgive my lack of knowledge.

304
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:15,502
- I am not fit for the position.
- Shut up!

305
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:16,382
On your knees!

306
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:29,063
Your Majesty,

307
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,502
while conflicts are settling,

308
00:16:31,503 --> 00:16:34,061
there are potential threats
from Jieshuo in the north

309
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:36,461
and unrest caused by Baiyue
in the south.

310
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,461
Lord Qin led the Zhenxi Army
to quell unrest,

311
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:41,180
supporting Your Majesty's ascension
to the throne

312
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,000
without unnecessary interference
in state affairs.

313
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,222
For the long-term prosperity
and stability of the country,

314
00:16:45,223 --> 00:16:48,181
it's appropriate to appoint Lord Qin
as the Crown Prince.

315
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:51,262
I second the motion to appoint Lord Qin
as the Crown Prince.

316
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:54,022
I support the proposal
to designate Lord Qin as the Crown Prince.

317
00:16:54,023 --> 00:16:57,581
I second the motion to appoint Lord Qin
as the Crown Prince.

318
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,541
I second the motion to appoint Lord Qin
as the heir!

319
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:04,461
- I second the motion.
- I second the motion.

320
00:17:04,462 --> 00:17:06,663
Leave! Leave the court!

321
00:17:21,662 --> 00:17:23,221
Can we still intercept

322
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:24,863
Father's memorial?

323
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:26,863
The Great General said

324
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:29,342
he knows your emotional attachment

325
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:31,461
and doesn't want
to pressure Lord Qin too much.

326
00:17:31,462 --> 00:17:32,782
So, he decided

327
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:34,502
to be the bad person.

328
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:36,701
Great General also said

329
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:39,423
he knew you would try and stop him.

330
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:43,582
So, he took the preemptive measure
and submitted the memorial to the court.

331
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,902
If you want to stop him now,

332
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:46,463
it'll be too late now.

333
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:50,663
Father is sacrificing himself for me

334
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:54,822
by plunging into difficulties.

335
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:57,021
I fear Shiqi

336
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:58,822
will be furious with me and Father

337
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,663
over this matter.

338
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:06,302
What?

339
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,102
Did you say Cui Yi submitted a memorial
to appoint Lord Qin as the Crown Prince?

340
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:09,943
Yes.

341
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:12,902
That's why I sent the servant
to call you to the study

342
00:18:12,903 --> 00:18:15,062
after the court adjourned.

343
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:16,223
What do you think?

344
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,582
I naturally second the motion.

345
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:21,021
Exercising restraint

346
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:22,943
was the former Lord Qin.

347
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:24,822
Since he reclaimed two capitals,

348
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:25,701
Lord Qin

349
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:28,142
has been a suitable choice for an heir.

350
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:29,623
As a subject,

351
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:31,941
speaking frankly to the Emperor
is my duty.

352
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,383
What about Great General Pei Xian?

353
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:34,982
He also seconded the motion.

354
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:41,302
Father, do you think

355
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:43,982
His Majesty will appoint Lord Qin
as the Crown Prince?

356
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:48,661
Cui Yi is the Great General
of Pingliang and Weiyang

357
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,103
with significant military power

358
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:51,943
and also just won the battle.

359
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:54,461
Advising to appoint Lord Qin
as the Crown Prince

360
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:56,223
is a wise move.

361
00:18:57,222 --> 00:18:58,382
Pei Xian

362
00:18:58,383 --> 00:19:00,223
is the Great General of the Zhenxi Army.

363
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:01,822
He also commands substantial forces,

364
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:02,941
and Lord Qin

365
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,582
sees him as a crucial support.

366
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,262
With both of them recommending,

367
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,183
can His Majesty not listen?

368
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:11,663
The officials in court view Father
with great respect.

369
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:12,902
Father's stance

370
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,982
in favor of Lord Qin

371
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:17,183
will surely face no opposition
from the civil officials.

372
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:20,461
Cui Yi played

373
00:19:20,462 --> 00:19:23,461
this move cleverly,

374
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,223
targeting the heart of the matter.

375
00:19:25,502 --> 00:19:27,701
Well, Father's response
by going with the flow

376
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:29,183
is also brilliant.

377
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:34,782
Jun!

378
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,822
Jun, calm down.

379
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:37,342
Calm down, Jun.

380
00:19:38,063 --> 00:19:38,822
Jun,

381
00:19:38,823 --> 00:19:41,262
I sense a shift of power

382
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:43,183
in the court.

383
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:44,902
Lai,

384
00:19:44,903 --> 00:19:46,501
it was due to my momentary oversight

385
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,302
that I fell victim to Li Ni's plot.

386
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:49,903
Li Ni had planned this in advance.

387
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:52,261
I must see Father.

388
00:19:52,262 --> 00:19:53,501
Even if it costs me my life,

389
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:55,463
I want to see Father!

390
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:56,822
Lai,

391
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,862
help me think of a way

392
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:00,782
to persuade Father

393
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,463
to pardon me.

394
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:04,742
If you want to leave,

395
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:07,342
how about a ruse?

396
00:20:09,182 --> 00:20:11,623
A ruse?

397
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:15,342
Young Master,

398
00:20:16,502 --> 00:20:17,623
what should we do now?

399
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:19,022
Jieshuo suffered a major defeat.

400
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:19,822
Cui Yi managed

401
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:21,342
to reclaim the Baishui Pass.

402
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,382
Cui Yi boldly submitted a memorial

403
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:24,903
to the Emperor,

404
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,582
recommending Li Ni as the Crown Prince.

405
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:37,703
In that case,

406
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:40,982
this puts Li Jun and Li Lai

407
00:20:41,702 --> 00:20:43,582
in a precarious situation.

408
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,623
Shu,

409
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:48,223
go and ask Li Lai

410
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,582
if he needs

411
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,862
our assistance

412
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:53,663
in this critical moment.

413
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:58,062
I'm willing to help Lord Qi

414
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:00,143
to remove his troubles.

415
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:02,223
Yes, Young Master.

416
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:26,383
Give it back to me.

417
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:28,623
What?

418
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:29,582
My mother's pearl.

419
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:40,782
Return it to me.

420
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:45,262
Now.

421
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:23,423
Now, you've gotten it back.

422
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:24,502
You can leave now.

423
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:32,062
Please take care, Lord Qin.

424
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:44,582
We owe each other nothing from now on.

425
00:23:28,702 --> 00:23:30,143
Seventy-five.

426
00:23:30,303 --> 00:23:30,782
Seventy-five?

427
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:32,022
Eighty.

428
00:23:32,182 --> 00:23:33,383
Eighty?

429
00:23:33,502 --> 00:23:34,902
Eighty-five.

430
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:36,663
That's a lot.

431
00:23:36,942 --> 00:23:38,501
Ninety-five.

432
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,262
- It's five qian short.
- It's for Madam Qin.

433
00:23:41,623 --> 00:23:42,822
This month,

434
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:44,782
we're sending 1,500 qian

435
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:47,022
to Madam Qin.

436
00:23:47,063 --> 00:23:48,863
What? 1,500 qian?

437
00:23:49,143 --> 00:23:49,741
It's 1,500 qian.

438
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:51,261
How many ducklings
can we buy with 1,500 qian?

439
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:51,741
That's great.

440
00:23:51,742 --> 00:23:52,622
Goslings too.

441
00:23:52,623 --> 00:23:54,220
When goslings become adults,
they can lay eggs.

442
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,242
They can watch the house too.

443
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:56,561
Look at you. All of you lack ambitions.

444
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,461
Wait, didn't we agree not to buy geese?

445
00:23:58,462 --> 00:23:59,261
Why not?

446
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:00,022
Wait.

447
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,463
Mister Shiqi, you're back.

448
00:24:04,303 --> 00:24:05,181
Mister Shiqi!

449
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:05,782
Mister Shiqi?

450
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:06,782
Mister Shiqi!

451
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:07,741
Mister Shiqi!

452
00:24:07,742 --> 00:24:08,582
Mister Shiqi!

453
00:24:09,942 --> 00:24:11,623
- What's wrong with him?
- Did anything happen?

454
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:02,103
We owe each other nothing from now on.

455
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:16,582
Young Lady.

456
00:25:20,702 --> 00:25:21,741
What's the matter?

457
00:25:21,742 --> 00:25:22,981
Why are you sitting

458
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:24,223
in the dark?

459
00:25:26,182 --> 00:25:27,742
I got lost in thought for a moment.

460
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:30,982
Then, I'll go and get the torch.

461
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:33,342
Taozi,

462
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:35,703
no need to light up the room.

463
00:25:36,783 --> 00:25:39,223
I just want to sit here for a while.

464
00:25:40,182 --> 00:25:41,582
What's wrong?

465
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,661
Your voice sounds a bit hoarse.

466
00:25:43,662 --> 00:25:45,542
Are you feeling unwell?

467
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:48,623
I'm fine.

468
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:51,223
I just want to stay like this
for a while.

did you stay up all night?

496
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:47,982
I'm fine.

497
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:50,262
Fetch some water for me to wash up.

Lord Xin has arrived!

500
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:06,703
Your Majesty,

501
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:10,383
Lord Xin is here.

502
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:23,021
Father...

503
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:24,021
Jun...

504
00:29:24,022 --> 00:29:26,941
how did you get so ill?

505
00:29:26,942 --> 00:29:29,022
Father, Father...

506
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:33,502
I thought I would never see you again.

507
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:35,502
I'm innocent.

508
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,062
I'm innocent.

509
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:42,902
I didn't kill Wang.

510
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:44,302
I don't know why Li Ni

511
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:48,062
repeatedly tried to push me
into a desperate situation.

512
00:29:49,182 --> 00:29:52,181
Li Ni will become the Crown Prince soon.

513
00:29:52,182 --> 00:29:55,261
In the future,
he'll surely not spare me.

514
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:56,701
Being able to see you today,

515
00:29:56,702 --> 00:29:58,703
I can now die without regrets.

516
00:29:59,462 --> 00:30:00,062
Father,

517
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:02,062
order someone to send me back
to my residence.

518
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:05,062
Do not provoke Lord Qin.

519
00:30:05,063 --> 00:30:06,822
Li Ni is my son.

520
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:09,302
Am I supposed to be afraid of him?

521
00:30:11,662 --> 00:30:12,703
Jun,

522
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:14,183
don't worry.

523
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:16,822
I'll issue a decree

524
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:19,703
to lift your confinement.

525
00:30:20,022 --> 00:30:22,302
If Li Ni dares to speak out of turn,

526
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:24,342
I'll personally punish him.

527
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,623
Your Highness is indeed insightful.

528
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,221
As soon as Lord Xin wrote a letter,

529
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:34,442
he couldn't resist sending people

530
00:30:34,442 --> 00:30:36,463
to inquire information
about Lord Qin's Residence.

531
00:30:36,783 --> 00:30:37,862
It seems

532
00:30:37,863 --> 00:30:39,982
he's planning to take action
against Lord Qin.

533
00:30:40,343 --> 00:30:41,502
How will he do it?

534
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:43,302
Lord Xin's trusted aides

535
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:45,981
were all captured
by Lord Qin last time and imprisoned,

536
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:47,143
where they died in captivity.

537
00:30:47,182 --> 00:30:48,102
Now,

538
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:49,663
the only person Lord Xin can trust

539
00:30:49,742 --> 00:30:51,302
is the son of Steward Zhang,

540
00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:52,223
Zhang Erlang.

541
00:30:52,662 --> 00:30:54,782
I've already followed your instructions

542
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:57,022
and sent someone to point the direction
to Zhang Erlang.

543
00:30:57,262 --> 00:30:59,383
The personnel in Lord Qin's Residence
are straightforward.

544
00:30:59,662 --> 00:31:01,863
The only person Lord Qin treats very well

545
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:04,221
is his nanny, Madam Meng.

546
00:31:04,222 --> 00:31:07,423
But she has several useless sons.

547
00:31:07,462 --> 00:31:08,782
They're greedy

548
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,062
and opportunistic.

549
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:14,423
Maybe

550
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:17,062
we can find a way to do something

551
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:19,022
to Lord Qin's food and drink.

552
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:22,382
It won't trace back to us, right?

553
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:23,903
Your Highness, you can rest assured.

554
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:25,903
It absolutely won't.

555
00:31:28,942 --> 00:31:30,941
My eldest brother,

556
00:31:30,942 --> 00:31:32,943
to say he's reckless,

557
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,663
he's reckless enough.

558
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:36,342
To say he's bold,

559
00:31:36,343 --> 00:31:38,103
he's also bold enough.

560
00:31:38,303 --> 00:31:40,382
I just hope that this time,

561
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:42,703
he has good enough luck

562
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:46,103
to succeed.

563
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:56,461
You also know my son,

564
00:31:56,462 --> 00:31:58,862
Zheng Wulang,

565
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:01,022
is utterly disappointing.

566
00:32:01,383 --> 00:32:04,062
Besides eating and drinking,
all he does is gamble.

567
00:32:04,103 --> 00:32:05,862
Back home,

568
00:32:05,863 --> 00:32:08,223
he always scolded me as an old geezer.

569
00:32:08,502 --> 00:32:09,461
Now,

570
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:11,461
seeing His Highness's prosperity

571
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,703
and bringing me to the residence
to enjoy life,

572
00:32:14,143 --> 00:32:16,663
he actually came to curry favor today.

573
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:20,501
Every family has its troubles.

574
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:22,502
Nanny, don't be upset.

575
00:32:22,903 --> 00:32:24,342
It's also rare

576
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,941
for my useless son Zheng Wulang

577
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:28,221
to suddenly do something useful.

578
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:30,863
He especially brought
these dried bamboo shoots.

579
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:32,663
Mister Shiqi

580
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:35,742
likes to eat bamboo shoot buns.

581
00:32:36,182 --> 00:32:38,382
It's not even a fine delicacy.

582
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:40,663
But who would know

583
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:42,102
what he likes

584
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:43,421
and specially prepare it

585
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:45,943
for him back then
in Lord Liang's Residence?

586
00:32:46,623 --> 00:32:47,941
At that time,

587
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:49,822
I always brought bamboo shoots from home

588
00:32:49,823 --> 00:32:51,142
to make buns for him.

589
00:32:51,143 --> 00:32:52,302
Back then,

590
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,302
he was still a young boy.

591
00:32:54,303 --> 00:32:55,663
He could eat four buns

592
00:32:55,742 --> 00:32:58,223
in one meal.

593
00:32:59,182 --> 00:33:01,582
I was afraid of overfeeding him.

594
00:33:03,903 --> 00:33:06,461
Look, we need to add more fillings.

595
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:08,742
All right, I'll help you.

596
00:33:09,903 --> 00:33:11,102
Nanny, look.

597
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:12,463
Am I wrapping it correctly?

598
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,742
You're such a quick learner.

599
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:18,062
Someone as gentle,

600
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:20,701
considerate, and skilled as you,

601
00:33:20,702 --> 00:33:22,661
I wonder who is fortunate enough

602
00:33:22,662 --> 00:33:25,623
to marry you.

603
00:33:32,003 --> 00:33:32,382
Let's go.

604
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:33,782
Mister Shiqi!

605
00:33:34,543 --> 00:33:35,822
Mister Shiqi!

606
00:33:35,823 --> 00:33:37,502
Guess who's back.

607
00:33:41,262 --> 00:33:42,221
He's been having trouble

608
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:43,863
with his ears these days.

609
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:46,022
Shiqi?

610
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:50,822
Why are you back here?

611
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:53,383
Your Highness,
what's wrong with your complexion?

612
00:33:54,343 --> 00:33:55,502
Are you ill?

613
00:33:57,182 --> 00:33:58,461
Maybe there's no battle to fight,

614
00:33:58,462 --> 00:34:00,703
and high spirits have relaxed.

615
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:02,700
It would be odd
if he had a good complexion

616
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,680
when he practices swordsmanship
in the middle of the night.

617
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,080
Why did he do that?

618
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,423
Why did you suddenly return?

619
00:34:08,823 --> 00:34:11,501
Isn't it the time for reporting duties
in the capital annually?

620
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:12,702
After I arrived in the capital,

621
00:34:12,703 --> 00:34:13,941
I went to see His Majesty.

622
00:34:13,942 --> 00:34:16,421
Unexpectedly, he sighed after seeing me,

623
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:17,703
saying that Bizhou is too far.

624
00:34:17,903 --> 00:34:19,302
So, he asked me to stay in the capital

625
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:20,501
to rest for a few more days,

626
00:34:20,502 --> 00:34:21,983
treating it as a break.

627
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:23,742
Come on.

628
00:34:25,142 --> 00:34:27,941
I'll take you to Fengying Pavilion
for a drink to welcome you back.

629
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,503
Are you really all right?

630
00:34:29,663 --> 00:34:30,462
I'm fine.

631
00:34:31,183 --> 00:34:32,262
I'll get going, then.

632
00:34:42,303 --> 00:34:43,063
(Cui Residence)
Taozi,

633
00:34:43,622 --> 00:34:44,581
what's wrong?

634
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,822
You look distraught.

635
00:34:45,823 --> 00:34:47,503
Are you not feeling well?

636
00:34:47,743 --> 00:34:49,422
I'm fine.

637
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:51,382
But my young lady

638
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:52,942
seems to be unwell.

639
00:34:53,823 --> 00:34:55,141
How did she get sick?

640
00:34:55,142 --> 00:34:56,822
She's not eating well

641
00:34:56,823 --> 00:34:58,662
and lacks sleep.

642
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,981
She told me she was fine.

643
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:03,063
But she doesn't look fine to me.

644
00:35:03,223 --> 00:35:05,183
It's all because of Lord Qin.

645
00:35:05,502 --> 00:35:07,183
She said

646
00:35:07,263 --> 00:35:08,983
Lord Qin must be upset...

647
00:35:11,622 --> 00:35:12,902
Actually, Mister Shiqi

648
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,583
has been acting strangely these days.

649
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:16,262
He's always in a daze.

650
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:18,983
Sometimes, when I ask him something,
it seems like he can't hear me.

651
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:19,981
By the way,

652
00:35:19,982 --> 00:35:22,023
didn't they release Lord Xin
a few days ago?

653
00:35:22,142 --> 00:35:24,702
Mister Shiqi wanted to enter the palace
to argue with His Majesty.

654
00:35:24,703 --> 00:35:26,663
But Great General Pei stopped him.

655
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:28,262
So, he has become

656
00:35:28,263 --> 00:35:30,262
even more moody these days.

657
00:35:32,462 --> 00:35:34,902
They must have had a big fight.

658
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:36,302
A fight that was more intense

659
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:37,703
than the previous one.

660
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:41,983
Taozi,

661
00:35:42,383 --> 00:35:43,581
you're clever.

662
00:35:43,582 --> 00:35:44,302
Is there anything

663
00:35:44,303 --> 00:35:46,023
you can do this time?

664
00:35:47,102 --> 00:35:49,422
I have no idea.

665
00:35:49,903 --> 00:35:50,862
My young lady is such

666
00:35:50,863 --> 00:35:52,503
a clever person.

667
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:55,702
She's even helpless against Lord Qin.

668
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:57,501
Mister Shiqi too.

669
00:35:57,502 --> 00:35:59,103
He's such a clever person.

670
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:01,662
This time, he seems to be
a completely different person.

671
00:36:01,663 --> 00:36:04,183
I'm sure he's also helpless
against Miss Cui.

672
00:36:05,102 --> 00:36:06,742
Well,

673
00:36:07,022 --> 00:36:08,862
two enemies.

674
00:36:26,743 --> 00:36:29,581
Why hasn't His Highness returned today?

675
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:32,103
I think he must be busy
with something outside.

676
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:37,061
Usually,

677
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:38,862
he should be the first

678
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,061
to taste the first basket

679
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:42,103
of steamed buns.

680
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:43,702
But I haven't made steamed buns

681
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:45,382
for many years.

682
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:46,541
I don't know

683
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:48,902
if it's properly seasoned.

684
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:51,462
Never mind.

685
00:36:51,982 --> 00:36:53,422
Today,

686
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:56,101
I'll put aside our status.

687
00:36:56,102 --> 00:36:57,581
I'll take the liberty

688
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,342
and try one first.

689
00:37:00,663 --> 00:37:01,822
Miss Gu,

690
00:37:01,823 --> 00:37:03,822
when His Highness returns,

691
00:37:03,823 --> 00:37:05,742
you can eat with him.

692
00:37:05,743 --> 00:37:08,461
It'll taste better that way.

693
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:09,822
Oh, Nanny.

694
00:37:20,343 --> 00:37:21,279
It's delicious.

695
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,941
(Lord Qin's Residence)

696
00:37:22,942 --> 00:37:24,103
Mister Shiqi,

697
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,941
I was just about to go out and find you.

698
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:26,862
What happened?

699
00:37:26,863 --> 00:37:28,742
Your nanny suddenly fell seriously ill.

700
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:52,342
I can't do anything.

701
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:54,503
I can't feel

702
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,223
her pulse anymore.

703
00:37:57,462 --> 00:37:58,583
Your Highness,

704
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,782
please accept my condolences.

705
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:09,103
What was the serious illness?

706
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:11,583
How did the illness develop so quickly?

707
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,462
Your Highness,

708
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:17,182
she was already of advanced age

709
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:18,862
and suddenly fell ill.

710
00:38:19,622 --> 00:38:21,262
When I arrived,

711
00:38:21,303 --> 00:38:23,583
she had already passed away.

712
00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:29,063
It might have been a heart condition.

713
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:30,742
Now, it's impossible

714
00:38:30,863 --> 00:38:32,822
to diagnose the exact cause.

715
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:37,983
Mister,

716
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:39,902
this way, please.

717
00:38:48,303 --> 00:38:49,543
Miss Gu,

718
00:38:50,942 --> 00:38:51,981
you were by my nanny's side

719
00:38:51,982 --> 00:38:53,503
when she fell ill.

720
00:38:55,022 --> 00:38:56,662
What exactly happened?

721
00:38:56,663 --> 00:38:58,302
Did she mention any discomfort?

722
00:39:00,022 --> 00:39:02,141
In the afternoon, she was fine.

723
00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:03,623
She was laughing and talking.

724
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,141
Suddenly, she complained of chest pain

725
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:07,782
and then fainted.

726
00:39:08,502 --> 00:39:10,061
I quickly went to find Bao

727
00:39:10,062 --> 00:39:11,223
and called the physician.

728
00:39:11,502 --> 00:39:12,981
Soon, the physician arrived

729
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:14,583
and you also returned.

730
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:18,663
Thank you.

731
00:39:19,303 --> 00:39:20,983
You're too kind, Your Highness.

732
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:24,063
Nanny treated me like family.

733
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:25,342
I also considered her

734
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:27,862
as my family.

735
00:39:28,823 --> 00:39:30,302
It's just that I didn't expect

736
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:34,143
the separation to happen in an instant.

737
00:39:35,263 --> 00:39:36,862
In the afternoon,

738
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:39,063
she made dried bamboo shoot buns
for Your Highness.

739
00:39:39,263 --> 00:39:41,382
She said it was your favorite.

740
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,902
She wanted to wait for you
to come back and eat together.

741
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:45,742
She was afraid
the taste might not be good.

742
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:48,023
So, she tasted it herself.

743
00:40:02,263 --> 00:40:03,742
Mister Shiqi,

744
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:07,942
I'll send Miss Gu out first.

745
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:11,462
We have to take care
of your nanny's funeral.

746
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:22,302
Miss Gu, this way, please.

747
00:40:55,982 --> 00:40:57,703
I never realized it before.

748
00:40:58,303 --> 00:40:59,742
Now, that I look at it,

749
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:02,302
it looks so ugly.

750
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,900
But why do I feel reluctant
to throw it away?

751
00:41:10,422 --> 00:41:11,543
Young Lady.

752
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:15,662
Young Lady.

753
00:41:15,663 --> 00:41:16,663
What's the matter?

754
00:41:16,703 --> 00:41:17,981
Lord Qin's nanny suddenly died

755
00:41:17,982 --> 00:41:19,742
from an acute illness.

756
00:41:26,303 --> 00:41:28,503
He must be devastated.

757
00:41:28,942 --> 00:41:30,183
Yes, he is.

758
00:41:31,383 --> 00:41:32,342
Young Lady,

759
00:41:32,343 --> 00:41:33,983
do you want to go and see him?

760
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:37,663
I...

761
00:41:53,422 --> 00:41:54,663
Mister Shiqi,

762
00:41:54,863 --> 00:41:56,742
I saw a coffin

763
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:58,461
and made the decision for you.

764
00:41:58,462 --> 00:42:00,302
Once it's painted,
they'll deliver it over.

765
00:42:00,743 --> 00:42:02,222
I've also made arrangements

766
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:03,941
for your nanny's dressing.

767
00:42:03,942 --> 00:42:05,621
The Master did some readings.

768
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:07,421
He said we should keep the body
for seven days.

769
00:42:07,422 --> 00:42:09,223
But not at home.

770
00:42:09,582 --> 00:42:11,222
So tonight, we'll send her

771
00:42:11,223 --> 00:42:13,583
to Yufo Temple outside the city.

772
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:20,822
Don't be too heartbroken.

773
00:42:45,783 --> 00:42:47,421
(In the afternoon,)

774
00:42:47,422 --> 00:42:49,663
Nanny made dried bamboo shoot buns
for Your Highness.

775
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:51,782
She said it was your favorite.

776
00:42:52,142 --> 00:42:53,800
She was afraid
the taste might not be good.

777
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,822
So, she tasted it herself.

778
00:43:14,502 --> 00:43:15,421
Mister Shiqi,

779
00:43:15,422 --> 00:43:17,061
I've brought in the coroner

780
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:18,800
and also called in
a military physician skilled

781
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,942
in detecting poisons.

782
00:43:21,102 --> 00:43:22,663
Are you sure about opening the coffin?

783
00:43:24,942 --> 00:43:25,862
Open the coffin.

784
00:43:27,422 --> 00:43:28,342
All right.

785
00:44:38,982 --> 00:44:39,983
Young Lady.

786
00:44:42,383 --> 00:44:43,543
Young Lady?

787
00:44:46,422 --> 00:44:47,543
Young Lady.

788
00:44:50,502 --> 00:44:52,583
That's weird. Where did she go?

789
00:44:52,903 --> 00:44:54,021
Young Lady, where did you go

790
00:44:54,022 --> 00:44:55,382
at this late hour?

791
00:44:56,102 --> 00:44:58,302
Taozi, tell Xie Chang'er this.

792
00:44:58,303 --> 00:44:59,581
If Lord Qin

793
00:44:59,582 --> 00:45:01,183
tries to go out in an angry state

794
00:45:01,263 --> 00:45:03,382
or do anything impulsive,

795
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:05,143
tell him to inform you right away.

796
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,183
Did anything happen?

797
00:45:08,942 --> 00:45:09,862
Not yet.

798
00:45:10,263 --> 00:45:11,902
It's just a precaution.

799
00:45:12,663 --> 00:45:14,262
All right, I'll go right now.

800
00:45:34,462 --> 00:45:37,302
The dried bamboo shoots
were brought by Nanny's son, Zheng Wulang.

801
00:45:37,303 --> 00:45:39,662
The person who poisoned
the bamboo shoots is Zhang Erlang.

802
00:45:39,663 --> 00:45:40,902
We've already caught him.

803
00:45:41,223 --> 00:45:42,101
Zhang Erlang

804
00:45:42,102 --> 00:45:43,862
is the son of Lord Xin's steward.

805
00:45:43,863 --> 00:45:45,021
He confessed

806
00:45:45,022 --> 00:45:47,501
that Zheng Wulang had heard
from his mother

807
00:45:47,502 --> 00:45:49,503
that Your Highness liked
to eat this food.

808
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:51,222
So, he bribed Zheng Wulang's friend

809
00:45:51,223 --> 00:45:53,382
from the gambling den, Wang Si,

810
00:45:53,422 --> 00:45:54,702
to instigate Zheng Wulang

811
00:45:54,703 --> 00:45:56,742
to send the bamboo shoots
to the residence

812
00:45:56,743 --> 00:45:58,262
to curry favor with Your Highness.

813
00:45:58,502 --> 00:45:59,782
Zhang Erlang confessed

814
00:45:59,783 --> 00:46:02,342
that Zheng Wulang was unaware
that the bamboo shoots were poisoned.

815
00:46:02,502 --> 00:46:05,541
However, he has been silenced
by Lord Xin's people.

816
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:06,800
(His body was thrown into the river.)

817
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,560
(Lord Qin's Residence)
(The local authority)

818
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,942
(is currently salvaging the corpse.)

819
00:46:11,703 --> 00:46:14,302
Why is my eye twitching
so early in the morning?

820
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:15,702
I wonder if it's an ominous

821
00:46:15,703 --> 00:46:16,983
or auspicious sign.

822
00:46:17,863 --> 00:46:19,342
It's all that nanny's fault.

823
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:20,862
Why are you craving

824
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:22,662
the buns at that old age?

825
00:46:22,663 --> 00:46:24,262
Why did you have to eat the bun?

826
00:46:24,542 --> 00:46:26,902
Otherwise, Li Ni would have died
from being poisoned

827
00:46:27,663 --> 00:46:29,422
and everything would be over.

828
00:46:29,982 --> 00:46:31,541
- Lord Qin, let me announce...
- Move aside!

829
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:32,520
- Out of the way!
- Move aside!

830
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,120
(Lord Xin's Residence)
Get out of the way!

831
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,240
Your Highness!

832
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,541
We're in trouble, Your Highness!

833
00:46:36,542 --> 00:46:37,800
Why are you panicking? What is it?

834
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,462
Lord Qin has brought his men
and barged into the residence.

835
00:46:40,903 --> 00:46:41,583
What?

836
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,981
Killing sister-in-law is not enough.

837
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:46,702
Now, you dare to poison my residence!

838
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,503
Why are you making baseless accusations?
You're spouting nonsense!

839
00:46:50,903 --> 00:46:51,461
Move aside!

840
00:46:51,462 --> 00:46:52,822
What are you trying to do?

841
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:54,541
Do you think
by silencing my nanny's son,

842
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:56,143
I won't be able to trace it back to you?

843
00:46:56,183 --> 00:46:58,782
You bribed someone to let her son
bring the poisoned bamboo shoot.

844
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,623
You caused the death of my nanny.

845
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:02,222
This is nonsense.

846
00:47:02,223 --> 00:47:03,782
Why are you spreading false rumors?

847
00:47:03,783 --> 00:47:04,141
Why...

848
00:47:04,142 --> 00:47:05,662
Why would I want to harm your nanny?

849
00:47:05,663 --> 00:47:07,382
Because you wanted to poison me!

850
00:47:12,823 --> 00:47:14,662
Your Highness! Your Highness!

851
00:47:14,663 --> 00:47:16,382
Your Highness,
we have concrete evidence.

852
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:17,581
Why don't we go to the court

853
00:47:17,582 --> 00:47:20,461
to demand justice in front
of His Highness and the officials?

854
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:21,262
Justice?

855
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:24,021
He plotted against Consort Xin
and killed so many innocent people.

856
00:47:24,022 --> 00:47:26,141
He was pardoned after being confined
for several days.

857
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:27,262
There's no justice.

858
00:47:27,263 --> 00:47:28,139
Get out of my way!

859
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:28,981
Your Highness!

860
00:47:28,982 --> 00:47:29,742
Your Highness!

861
00:47:29,743 --> 00:47:31,702
Please don't act recklessly,
Your Highness!

862
00:47:31,703 --> 00:47:32,981
Lord Xin intended to poison you.

863
00:47:32,982 --> 00:47:34,941
We must make him explain himself

864
00:47:34,942 --> 00:47:36,662
in front of His Majesty
and the officials.

865
00:47:36,663 --> 00:47:38,623
But if you kill him now,

866
00:47:38,703 --> 00:47:40,902
what about the laws and order
in the court?

867
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:43,061
Everything was originally
a clear-cut case.

868
00:47:43,062 --> 00:47:44,141
If you kill him,

869
00:47:44,142 --> 00:47:45,862
it will become your wrongdoing.

870
00:47:45,982 --> 00:47:49,662
Your Highness. If you kill him,
how will His Majesty deal with you?

871
00:47:49,663 --> 00:47:50,782
He will resent us even more

872
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,063
for not stopping you!

873
00:47:57,102 --> 00:47:58,262
Shiqi,

874
00:47:58,823 --> 00:47:59,941
you must calm down

875
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:01,103
for the Zhenxi Army's sake.

876
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,862
