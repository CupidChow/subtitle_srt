Young Master.

30
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,679
Ying.

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,399
Be careful.

32
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,440
Ying, how's your wound?

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,598
Don't worry. I'm fine.

34
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,240
It's just a minor wound.

35
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,679
You are the one

36
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,080
with a more serious injury.

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,800
Come. Take your medicine first.

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Hurry up.

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,879
Ying, you don't have
to worry about my injury.

40
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:35,480
We should rendezvous
with our main army at once.

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,118
Let's go back to Yingzhou, okay?

42
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,199
No.

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,078
I already asked Taozi

44
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,078
and those physicians

45
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,278
about your injury.

46
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,999
All of them told me that you'll need

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,278
to rest properly for some time.

48
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,200
Ying.

49
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:46,960
Even if I have to recuperate,

50
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:49,360
I can't recuperate here.

51
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:51,360
Look.

52
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:54,360
This is where the Zhenxi Army is.

53
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,119
And we are both detained by Li Ni.

54
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:59,280
I'm afraid that this is
just a part of his plan.

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,279
Yingzhou is in a dire situation now.

56
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:03,399
You know that.

57
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,678
With Luoyang under
the Zhenxi Army's thumb,

58
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,960
he owns half of the country now.

59
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,040
And he holds a grudge
against the Cui Army.

60
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,159
I'm afraid that he...

61
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,279
The Zhenxi Army will not do that.

62
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,879
Is it because you trust

63
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,119
the Zhenxi Army

64
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,879
or is it because you trust Li Ni?

65
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,480
Sun Jing has yet to be eliminated.

66
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,999
And the Zhenxi Army
is the loyalist army.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,320
No matter what,

68
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:25,278
the Zhenxi Army

69
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:27,199
will not do that to the Cui Army.

70
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,358
Sun Jing is already
in a precarious situation.

71
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:31,639
He lost Dongdu and
Tong Pass has been breached.

72
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,360
And his army of 100,000 soldiers
is at war with Baiyue in the South.

73
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,439
If Li Ni attacks Xichang right now,

74
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,879
Sun Jing can do nothing

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,279
other than be on the defensive.

76
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,719
He can only rely
on his Imperial Army right now.

77
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,879
If Li Ni conquers Xichang,

78
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,040
he will

79
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:48,320
hold us hostage

80
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,639
to threaten Father and the Cui Army.

81
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,800
You are overthinking this.

82
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,039
Not only that Xichang

83
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,999
is impregnable right now,

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,879
even if Li Ni manages

85
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,398
to conquer Xichang,

86
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,439
he will not harm the Cui Army.

87
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,358
You have fallen

88
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,599
into Li Ni's honey trap.

89
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,759
Are you going

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,518
to act arbitrarily with no regard

91
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,558
for the Cui Army's safety

92
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:06,119
and Father's safety?

93
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,559
Are you going

94
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,398
to trust a frivolous person so easily?

95
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,439
Young Master.

96
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,200
I'm just stating the facts.

97
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:18,078
Ying.

98
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,320
You have not recovered.

99
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:21,200
It's better for you
to recuperate in peace.

100
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,520
Ying.

101
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:25,239
Young Master.

102
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,359
Lieutenant He.

103
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,518
Although this secret medicinal cream
is very effective,

104
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,359
you still have to be careful
with your wound.

105
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,879
Remember to control what you eat.

106
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,319
Otherwise, you'll have a scar.

107
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,599
Okay. I got it.

108
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,200
Why do you use the window
when you can do it the easy way?

109
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,319
I ran into Taozi when I came in just now.

110
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,980
She refused to let me bring you
any outside food.

111
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,398
So, I had to use the window.

112
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:01,880
Look at what I got for you.

113
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,799
You are the imperial grandson.

114
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,319
I thought that you brought me treasure.

115
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,960
But you just brought me some flatbread.

116
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,999
Actually, I brought another bowl of meat
for you to eat with the flatbread.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,280
But I heard Taozi saying that you needed
to control your diet

118
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
when I was waiting outside.

119
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,999
You can't eat meat.

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,319
So, I ate the meat.

121
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,679
As for you,

122
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,960
you can only eat the flatbread.

123
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,119
What's so special about this flatbread
that it has to be delivered specially?

124
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,718
It's not that special.

125
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:25,319
But I know
that you don't have an appetite.

126
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,640
So, I baked it for you.

127
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,239
Since you can't eat meat,

128
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,120
you can eat it with honey.

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,078
This is not easy to get.

130
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,799
Where did you get the honey from?

131
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,478
This afternoon,

132
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:40,799
I found a bee hive

133
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,159
under a rock on the mountain.

134
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,599
So, Bao and I went to harvest it.

135
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,158
This bowl of honey

136
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,599
can last you many days.

137
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,640
You need to take your medicine
since you are injured.

138
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,679
If it's too bitter,

139
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,399
drink it with some honey.

140
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,000
By the way,

141
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,839
I have something to ask you.

142
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,598
What is it?

143
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,200
I'll tell you anything
that you want to know

144
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,159
if I have the answer.

145
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,560
How are you

146
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:12,680
going to reclaim Xichang?

147
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:21,520
If I tell you that I'm at a loss,

148
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,559
will you believe me?

149
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,718
I do.

150
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:25,000
If it were me,

151
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,520
I would be at a loss too.

152
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,120
Xichang is the country's capital.

153
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,759
The founding emperor spent 16 years
building it with 100,000 people.

154
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,039
It's an impregnable fortress.

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,320
Sun Jing

156
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,760
used to be a great general.

157
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,479
He fought against Gaoji three times.

158
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,038
He can defend the city

159
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,918
better than we can attack it.

160
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:41,999
Moreover, attacking a city

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,039
is essentially harder
than defending a city.

162
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,639
Besides,

163
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,520
Sun Jing is a heartless
and vicious person.

164
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,120
He has almost no chink in his armour.

165
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:51,919
How can I not be at a loss?

166
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,679
Now, his army is at war with Baiyue

167
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,958
and he has sent another troop
to Yingzhou.

168
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,918
Actually,

169
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,799
he doesn't have many soldiers with him.

170
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,720
But he still has 100,000 soldiers
in the Imperial Army

171
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,879
who will be guarding the city.

172
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,799
The Imperial Army is the personal guard
of the previous emperor.

173
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,280
Can we convince them to switch sides?

174
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,260
The Imperial Army
turned against us in the first place.

175
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,838
Otherwise, Sun Jing would not be able

176
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,159
to overturn the imperial regime,
murder the previous emperor

177
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,720
and kill all the other lords by himself.

178
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,640
What if we trap him in the city?

179
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,640
Trap him in the city?

180
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:29,560
Trapping him in the city

181
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,440
is the worst plan.

182
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,919
Sun Jing is hoarding food supplies again

183
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,560
in case the city is besieged.

184
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,479
For a city like Xichang,

185
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,278
even if we surround the city for a year,

186
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,039
there's no guarantee
that we can breach it.

187
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,879
By then,

188
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,279
Sun Jing will have already summoned
his army that's fighting Baiyue

189
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,000
to sandwich us between his forces.

190
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,120
Even if we fight his forces together,

191
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,560
we may not be able to win the battle.

192
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,599
If

193
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,799
I have a strategy

194
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,960
that can breach the city,

195
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,679
are you willing

196
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,200
to promise me something?

197
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,040
Are you willing to stay
and attack Xichang together with me?

198
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,639
You want to use this opportunity

199
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,239
to save Yingzhou, right?

200
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,359
If we can breach Xichang

201
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,639
or force Sun Jing

202
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,960
to summon back his army
that is trapping Yingzhou from the outside,

203
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,880
Yingzhou will be saved.

204
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,799
I promise you.

205
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,239
Even if you have 10,000 requests,

206
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,680
I'll fulfill them for you.

207
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,199
You are indeed a calculative person.

208
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,080
If I don't have a way
to breach the city,

209
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,119
are you not going to promise me anything?

210
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,639
That's not true.

211
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,119
If you can't breach the city,

212
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,879
I can promise you

213
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,639
to fulfill 9,999 of your requests.

214
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,639
But you have
to promise me something too.

215
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,879
What is it?

216
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,359
I don't have an idea yet.

217
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,719
You can give me your promise
when I've made up my mind.

218
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:52,119
That sounds suspicious.

219
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,560
I think

220
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,560
that you are plotting something.

221
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,879
Don't worry.

222
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,759
I won't make things hard for you,
Lieutenant He.

223
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,719
I will not

224
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,440
make things hard for you too.

225
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,680
Master.

226
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,200
We have news from our scouts.

227
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,278
Cui Lin and He

228
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,359
are recuperating in Tong Pass

229
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,960
after being rescued by Li Ni.

230
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,040
It wasn't easy for us

231
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,880
to forge the secret letter
about my uncle being ill

232
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,879
to trick Cui Lin and He
into leaving the army

233
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,080
so that we could kill them.

234
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,320
I didn't expect that my planned
would be ruined by Li Ni.

235
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,879
We can't do anything

236
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,200
now that they are in Tong Pass.

237
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,320
Blast that Li Ni

238
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,599
for ruining my plan again.

239
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,680
Calm down.

240
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,879
Cui Lin and He

241
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,200
have lost most of their soldiers.

242
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,680
And the main Cui Army
is unable to come to their rescue.

243
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,959
They can't

244
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,759
hide in Tong Pass forever.

245
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:15,479
We just have to wait patiently

246
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,280
and I'm sure we'll find a chance
to kill them.

247
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,198
Pass down my order

248
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:24,920
to station a troop near Tong Pass.

249
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,879
Plus,

250
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,119
ask our scouts

251
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,198
to keep a close eye
on Cui Lin and He.

252
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:31,440
As soon as they leave Tong Pass,

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,800
it'll be the end of their lives.

254
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,879
Roger that.

255
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,599
Young Master.

256
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,398
Young Master.

257
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,400
Young Master.

258
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,719
You might as well...

259
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,278
You might as well kill me

260
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,079
with a knife.

261
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,438
Listen to me.

262
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:53,879
If we can breach the city

263
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,359
together with the Zhenxi Army,

264
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,918
we'll be able to save Yingzhou.

265
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,800
We can't trust the Zhenxi Army.

266
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,879
Besides...

267
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,800
Besides, if someone in Xichang

268
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,999
finds out about your identity,

269
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,678
it'll be extremely dangerous for you.

270
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,639
Young Master.

271
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,158
Sun Jing is a formidable villain.

272
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,560
But he's arrogant and full of himself.

273
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,639
He wouldn't expect me and Li Ni

274
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,680
to sneak into Xichang by ourselves.

275
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,479
I can't allow you to do that.

276
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,560
What if...

277
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,239
If Xichang is in trouble,

278
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,198
Yingzhou will not be besieged anymore.

279
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:24,599
If this is the deciding round,

280
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,080
then, this is the winning move
that we have to take.

281
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,960
Stop it.

282
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,400
I won't let you do that.

283
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,239
You are worried about Yingzhou.

284
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,680
And you are concerned
about my safety as well.

285
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,479
But I've made up my mind.

286
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,479
Don't worry.

287
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,198
Even if things don't go our way,

288
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:52,359
I'll be back in one piece.

289
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
Ying.

290
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,999
I beg you.

291
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,599
Can you not leave?

292
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,759
Young Master, I...

293
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,479
Ying, I'm really worried about you.

294
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,960
If you...

295
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,200
If you fall into
the enemy's hand in Xichang,

296
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,719
how am I going to face Father?

297
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,440
If you fall into the enemy's hand
in Xichang,

298
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,240
I'll never be able to atone for it
even with my death.

299
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,680
Young Master.

300
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,160
I've already made up my mind.

301
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,359
Shu, take good care of Young Master.

302
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,759
Ying.

303
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:39,239
Young Master.

304
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,879
You might as well kill me right now

305
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,519
and spare me from it.

306
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,400
You are overreacting.

307
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,960
Fine.

308
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,839
Just now, you told me

309
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,398
that you plan to disguise yourself

310
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,158
together with He
to sneak into Xichang

311
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,800
in order to take down the city.

312
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:00,999
Yes.

313
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,119
Yes?

314
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:03,960
You said yes?

315
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,879
Fine.

316
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,438
I'll find a rope

317
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:07,678
and tie myself up right now.

318
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,520
I don't have to wait
for my father to come to me.

319
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,518
I'm just going to turn myself in.

320
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,719
I'll do that now.

321
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,719
No.

322
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,879
I should tie you up instead

323
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,079
and send you to the back
of the Zhenxi Army.

324
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,239
When you are with my father,

325
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,759
you can do whatever you want

326
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,239
and it'll not be my problem.

327
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,918
Great General Pei's rear detachment
is far away from us.

328
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,759
If you don't say anything,
he won't find out.

329
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,920
There's no need to panic.

330
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,519
Shiqi.

331
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,560
Think about it carefully.

332
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,560
You are the marshal
of the Zhenxi Army now.

333
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,879
But you and He plan to sneak

334
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,198
into Xichang bare-handed.

335
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,918
What if Sun Jing's men catch sight of you?

336
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,278
You are walking into the lion's den.

337
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,960
You may not come back alive.

338
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,839
It won't be just the two of us.

339
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,479
I plan to bring Bao

340
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,518
and Chang'er with me.

341
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,038
And we are not going to be bare-handed.

342
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,518
We'll bring our weapons with us.

343
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,639
I don't want to listen to that.

344
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,040
I won't allow you to do that.

345
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,639
If you are worried about us,

346
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,518
you can come with us.

347
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,639
I can't go.

348
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,239
Yes.

349
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,680
You can't go.

350
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,519
You have to stay here
and guard Tong Pass.

351
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,879
Just wait here

352
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,639
and wait for my good news.

353
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,879
Fine.

354
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,599
What's your plan

355
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,080
after sneaking

356
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,239
into Xichang?

357
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,119
I have no plans.
I'll just play it by ear.

358
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,160
What?

359
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:24,519
I was just joking with you.

360
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,879
Don't worry. I have a plan.

361
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,999
Even if things go wrong,

362
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,479
I'll find a way to escape.

363
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,560
But Tong Pass needs you here.

364
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,280
Guard this place well
and don't worry about other things.

365
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,798
Do you know

366
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,880
that if you fall into the enemy's hand
in Xichang,

367
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,599
I'll have no way to rescue you?

368
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,639
If that happens, they'll use you

369
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,400
to threaten the Zhenxi Army.

370
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,879
Of course.

371
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,280
Don't worry.

372
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,239
Even if Sun Jing

373
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,398
manages to capture me,

374
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,759
I already have a solution for you.

375
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,519
Just tell him that you've been wanting
to get rid of me.

376
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,599
Tell him that you'll claim to be the emperor
and thank him sincerely.

377
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,719
I promise you

378
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,359
that you'll frustrate him to death.

379
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,639
Before you can frustrate
Sun Jing to death,

380
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,519
you'll frustrate me to death.

381
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,119
Young Lady, His Highness is here.

382
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,759
Greetings, Your Highness.

383
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,360
Miss Gu, there's no need
to be so courteous.

384
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,920
Qiucui, pour His Highness a cup of tea.

385
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,239
Miss Gu, I'm here today

386
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,800
because I have a favour to ask.

387
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,678
You are too courteous.

388
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,280
Your wish is my command.

389
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:49,839
Prime Minister Gu is in the capital.

390
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,079
I hope that you can give me

391
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,239
something of yours.

392
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,639
I want to sneak into the capital

393
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,479
to form an alliance
with Prime Minister Gu

394
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,599
to reclaim Xichang.

395
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,798
It'll be hard

396
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,440
for me to gain his trust
without a proof.

397
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,599
Since you want to sneak
into the capital,

398
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,479
you need someone you trust.

399
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,198
If that's the case,

400
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,839
I don't have to give you something.

401
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,759
I'm willing to come with you.

402
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,920
No.

403
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,840
We want to meet Prime Minister Gu
because we have no other choice.

404
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,400
We can't risk your life like that.

405
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,398
You've been fighting for the country.

406
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,798
Now that you want to reclaim Xichang,

407
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,160
it's my duty to help you.

408
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,038
Although I'm a woman,

409
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:24,960
I'm willing to help
in any way that I can for the country.

410
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,918
My father is loyal to the throne.

411
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,600
And he has been tortured by Sun Jin
for a long time.

412
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,318
No matter what your plan is,

413
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:32,440
I'm sure my father
will do his best to help you.

414
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,519
Sneaking into Xichang
is a risky business.

415
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,160
If someone finds out,

416
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:39,759
we'll be in grave danger.

417
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,639
I'm sure you'll bring Xie

418
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,479
and Bao with you into the capital.

419
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,239
They are smart and courageous men

420
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,759
who have years of experience in battles.

421
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,558
I'll just dress up as a family member

422
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,999
and I'll be set.

423
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,680
Even if something goes wrong,

424
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,599
I'll take my own life

425
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,639
so that I won't be a burden.

426
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,198
I've tried this liquor.

427
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,279
It's fragrant and smooth.

428
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,239
It's really not bad.

429
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:15,998
The liquor is from Luzhou.

430
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:17,678
Why do you want to transport it

431
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,240
to Xichang that is so far away
from Luzhou?

432
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,198
My master has a liquor shop
in the capital.

433
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,520
His business has been slow these years
and he is no longer young.

434
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,530
So, he ordered young master
to personally transport the liquor

435
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,839
and take over the liquor shop.

436
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,960
The family of our young master's wife
is in the capital.

437
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,198
Thus, she's here with him

438
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:36,200
to pay her family a visit.

439
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,758
Mister Shiqi.

440
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,478
For our plan before this,

441
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:41,319
Lieutenant He

442
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,758
was the only female family member.

443
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,879
Now, we have another lady, Miss Gu.

444
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,719
What should I say?

445
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,319
You can only say that she's my sister.

446
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,519
Have you told Lieutenant He

447
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,198
that Miss Gu will be going with us?

448
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:58,839
Yes.

449
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,718
Have you told her

450
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:01,039
that Miss Gu will be acting

451
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,759
as your sister?

452
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:03,840
Yes.

453
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:07,479
Did Lieutenant He say anything?

454
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,079
She said

455
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,519
that she could be her sister.

456
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,559
But it doesn't matter

457
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,519
whose sister Miss Gu is.

458
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,319
It matters.

459
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,198
You

460
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:17,678
better ask Miss Gu

461
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,680
to act as Lieutenant He's sister.

462
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:43,400
Lieutenant He, are you coming along too?

463
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,440
Yes.

464
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:45,799
His Highness said

465
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,600
that you volunteered
to join us on this mission.

466
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,999
How admirable.

467
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,238
It's just my duty.

468
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,799
You really flatter me.

469
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,478
Since we are acting as sisters,

470
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,799
there's no need to worry too much.

471
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,200
We'll just play it by ear.

472
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,239
We are going to depart now.

473
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,680
Are you going to be
in the carriage with us?

474
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,998
No. I'll ride.

475
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:06,479
The two of you will take the carriage.

476
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,080
(General's Residence)

477
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,120
Mother, we can finally donate food to the army
while having enough food for ourselves.

478
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,238
Otherwise, we would be bullied
by the soldiers again.

479
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:20,918
Luckily,

480
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:22,918
you are engaged to Sanlang
from the Xu family.

481
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,799
As soon as the food supply order came in,

482
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,639
Madam Xu wrote us a letter
at once to tell us

483
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,398
about the food
that she had prepared for us.

484
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:31,758
She even said that if Xu Sanlang

485
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,540
didn't have to travel
to Tuzhou to sell his fabric,

486
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,238
she would've asked Sanlang

487
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:36,758
to deliver the food
into the city for us.

488
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,958
Madam Xu treats you so well.

489
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:41,680
She'll be a doting
mother-in-law in the future.

490
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,440
Mother.

491
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:45,958
Qi'niang.

492
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:47,400
There are soldiers heading this way.

493
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,119
According to Madam Xu,

494
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,400
the Grand Governor Sun's men
are robbing food from people everywhere.

495
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,279
What should we do?

496
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,758
How can we cover this up?

497
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,920
Where can we hide it?

498
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,398
Here. Take my outerwear.

499
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,238
- Come. Hurry up.
- This side. Hurry up.

500
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,599
There are people ahead of us!

501
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,360
Okay.

502
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,519
Let's go!

503
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,079
Hurry up!

504
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:21,319
Miss Gu, if you have something to ask,
just do it.

505
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,479
Are the needles in your sleeves
coated with poison?

506
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,360
Yes.

507
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,920
But I have the antidote too.

508
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,079
I'm just curious.

509
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,079
I'm sure there are many challenges
for you, as a woman, to travel with the army.

510
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,839
But you look as freeing
and as poised as ever.

511
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,440
How do you do that?

512
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,918
You can never hide

513
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,799
who you really are.

514
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,039
This is how I am usually.

515
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,360
I never hide myself.

516
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:53,039
So, it's freeing for me.

517
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,719
When you ask for a lot of things in life,

518
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,840
you'll be trapped by them too.

519
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,239
You are a smart woman, Miss Gu.

520
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,120
I'm sure you understand.

521
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,680
Thank you for your advice,
Lieutenant He.

522
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,398
Please spare us.

523
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:12,680
I beg you.

524
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:13,799
No.

525
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,759
Mother.

526
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,640
What's wrong?

527
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,998
Someone is calling for help ahead of us.

528
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:19,718
Please spare us.

529
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:21,198
I beg you.

530
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:23,279
Mother!

531
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,678
Mother.

532
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,398
Mother, wake up. Mother.

533
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:28,039
You wench.

534
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,599
Mother.

535
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,198
How dare you bite me

536
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,479
for a few bags of food.

537
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:35,400
If I don't cut you into pieces today,

538
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
it won't be enough to quench my hatred.

539
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,559
Who is that?

540
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,719
Hey, here I am!

541
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,200
Here comes my palms.

542
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,198
Mother, wake up.

543
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,039
Mother.

544
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,718
Mother.

545
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:11,639
Mother, wake up.

546
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,438
They are Sun Jin's men.

547
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:15,039
No wonder they are so cruel.

548
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,039
They either plunder or kill.

549
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,839
Mother.

550
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,880
Mother, wake up.

551
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,840
Mother.

552
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,200
Mother, you are awake.

553
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:31,600
Mother.

554
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,198
Mother.

555
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:35,920
Old Lady, are you okay?

556
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,158
Yes.

557
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:38,238
These brave men

558
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:39,920
saved us.

559
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,440
Thank you for saving our lives.

560
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,319
There's no need to thank us.

561
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,599
We were passing by.

562
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,438
And we just wanted
to help out those in need.

563
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:50,160
Those people are so evil.

564
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,839
Not only they robbed you,

565
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,440
they killed innocent people
with no remorse.

566
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,039
They are soldiers.

567
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,999
I'm afraid
that it'll lead to more trouble.

568
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,440
You should leave at once.

569
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,079
I'll tell them

570
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,758
that I hurt these soldiers

571
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,079
because I went crazy.

572
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,478
Mother, you'll be fine.

573
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,998
Those bad people are dead.

574
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,918
These kind men have buried them

575
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:16,559
and put a layer of grass on them.

576
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,519
Old Lady, it'll be fine.

577
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,880
Don't worry about it.

578
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,920
You killed the soldiers

579
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,559
to save me and my daughter.

580
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,360
If someone finds out about it,

581
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,718
you'll be arrested

582
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:34,120
and put to death by dismemberment.

583
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,238
Old Lady, don't worry.

584
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:38,119
If none of us say anything about it,

585
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,400
no one will find out.

586
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,238
It's late already.

587
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:44,040
You should hurry up and
go home with your daughter.

588
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,440
Please accept

589
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,039
my kowtow as gratitude.

590
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,599
There's no need to do that. Please rise.

591
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,960
Please rise, Old Lady.

592
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,559
Sirs and Madam.

593
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,799
That cart is full of food supplies.

594
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,079
Since you've saved our lives,

595
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,719
you can have those food supplies.

596
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:05,039
It's fine. Thank you, Old Lady.

597
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,520
We have our own food.

598
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,040
You should hurry up and enter the city.

599
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,400
Otherwise, it'll be too late to get in.

600
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,319
Here, Mother.

601
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:16,880
Thank you for saving our lives.

602
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:18,880
Thank you.

603
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,000
(Xichang)

604
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,600
(Gu Residence)

605
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,600
Sixth Lady?

606
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,400
Why are you back already?

607
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,478
It's a long story.

608
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,000
Hurry up and inform
my father about my arrival.

609
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,718
Sixth Lady.

610
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,238
Prime Minister Gu
is feeling unwell today.

611
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,519
It's better not to disturb him.

612
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,690
I have something urgent to report.

613
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,040
If anything goes wrong, can you
bear the responsibility for it?

614
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,200
How urgent can it be?

615
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:56,238
I rushed back after going to Bingzhou
to pay respect to our ancestors

616
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,759
because I have
something urgent to report.

617
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,639
You are just a servant.

618
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,800
But now, you are locking me out
and refuse to announce my arrival.

619
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,070
According to the family rules, you are

620
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,660
neglecting your duties
and disrespecting Master.

621
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,740
Do you think you'll get punished?

622
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,039
(Sixth Lady has always
been docile and timid.)

623
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,479
(Why is she so fierce today?)

624
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,519
That's not true.

625
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,799
Please come in, Sixth Lady.

626
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,799
I'll announce your arrival at once.

627
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,238
Are you saying

628
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:35,759
that the seventeenth imperial grandson
has recruited someone capable

629
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,440
(Prime Minister Gu)
and wishes to see me?

630
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:40,079
I've been traveling
with the Zhenxi Army lately.

631
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,438
I've personally seen

632
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,718
how charismatic and valiant

633
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,079
the seventeenth imperial grandson is.

634
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,840
He's respected by everyone
in the Zhenxi Army.

635
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:50,079
Now that he has taken over Tong Pass,

636
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,639
he rules over half the country now.

637
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,400
He has the support
of the people in this country.

638
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,479
And soon, he'll reclaim Xichang.

639
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,480
Although Sun Jing
managed to overthrow the throne,

640
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,120
he can do nothing now that he's trapped.

641
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,079
Wan'niang.

642
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,799
You had never talked like this

643
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,198
in front of me before this.

644
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,079
And you had never

645
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,799
said so many things before.

646
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:14,319
In the past, you were the prime minister
of a peaceful country.

647
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,400
As your daughter, of course
I acted differently at that time.

648
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,279
But everything has changed now.

649
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:20,839
What has changed?

650
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,239
Tell me.

651
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,680
When the country was at peace,

652
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:26,599
I just needed to obey my parents,

653
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,400
respect my elders and protect my family.

654
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:33,799
I just needed to do some embroidery,
enjoy the flower, the moon,

655
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,559
listen to songs and write poems.

656
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:39,519
What about now?

657
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,758
You refused to bow
to Sun Jing even though

658
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,960
you were imprisoned by him.

659
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:45,880
You've become the role model
of many imperial families in the capital.

660
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,000
Even the imperial grandson
is full of admiration

661
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,799
when he talks about you.

662
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,678
At this time, as your daughter,

663
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,800
I need to be aware
of the current political situation

664
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,079
and the national affairs.

665
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,198
I need to provide as much information

666
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,640
as I can for you.

667
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,478
If you think

668
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:02,880
that I can be of use to you,

669
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:05,239
then, I'll be happy enough
to provide my assistance.

670
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,279
Wan'niang.

671
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,200
I had misjudged you in the past.

672
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,639
You were focused on the national affairs

673
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,479
and had no time to take care
of the family affairs.

674
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,639
Otherwise, with your wisdom,

675
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
you would never misjudge someone.

676
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,479
Tell me then.

677
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,759
Why does
the seventeenth imperial grandson

678
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,160
want to send someone to meet me?

679
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,319
Please forgive me, Father.

680
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,880
I lied to you just now.

681
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:36,119
Actually,
the seventeenth imperial grandson

682
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,438
did not send someone here.

683
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:39,119
He's here in person

684
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,880
and wishes to talk to you.

685
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,039
Miss Gu.

686
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,238
Greetings, Your Highness.

687
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,478
You are too kind, Miss Gu.

688
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,599
Did you invite me here

689
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,400
because Prime Minister Gu
has agreed to see me?

690
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:07,238
Yes.

691
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:08,519
As soon as I got home,

692
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,158
I told my father

693
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,599
that you had entered the city.

694
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,319
He was pleasantly surprised

695
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,920
and wanted to meet you at once.

696
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,639
But after he was released from prison,

697
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,160
he's under the watchful eyes
of Sun Jing's men.

698
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,279
Although he can leave
the mansion once in a while,

699
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,479
he's always followed
by Sun Jing's spies.

700
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,079
And I'm sure there are even more spies

701
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,519
in our mansion.

702
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,158
I pretended to leave the city
to visit this temple today

703
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,880
so that I could ask you out.

704
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:34,039
Please come up with a way

705
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,079
to free my father from the spies

706
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,920
so that he can meet up with you.

707
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:39,718
Miss Gu, don't worry.

708
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:40,840
Of course I'll do that.

709
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,599
I'll go back

710
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,960
and come up with a way.

711
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,158
I won't

712
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,920
rouse the suspicion of Sun Jing's spies.

713
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,958
Thank you, Your Highness.

714
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:48,998
You are too kind.

715
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:50,880
I should thank you instead.

716
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:55,920
Your Highness, is everything okay

717
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,840
ever since you entered the city?

718
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,360
We are used to the battlefields.

719
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,239
Although dangers
are lurking everywhere in this city,

720
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:05,799
it's not as ominous as you think.

721
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,200
I can be rest assured then.

722
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:13,279
I have another favour to ask.

723
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:14,440
What is it?

724
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,478
I pretended to come here

725
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:17,960
to pray today.

726
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,200
I heard that the sacred tree
in Qingyun Temple is quite effective.

727
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:23,918
If you take a bath with its branch,

728
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,640
you can be rid of any illnesses.

729
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:27,279
If I don't bring a branch back with me,

730
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,559
I'm afraid that spies in the mansion
will suspect me.

731
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:32,079
Can you accompany me

732
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,759
to get it?

733
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,920
Of course.

734
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,319
Thank you, Your Highness.

735
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,120
They say that if you are sincere,
your wish will be granted.

736
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:45,758
We have to pray sincerely

737
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,519
before we get the branch.

738
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,079
May everyone I care for

739
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,479
stay safe and healthy.

740
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,999
Is this the branch?

741
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:25,400
Maybe the one on the side.

742
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,999
The one on the side.

743
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,400
Thank you for today.

744
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,319
Thank you, Mister.

745
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:44,999
You are welcome.

746
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:45,999
Miss Gu.

747
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,719
You can just call me Shiqi after this.

748
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,200
Okay. Shiqi.

749
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,279
Shiqi.

750
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,158
Although the scared tree
is very effective,

751
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,559
if you take the branch today,

752
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,559
you'll have to take a bath
with it today.

753
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:13,918
If you want to take it back

754
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,600
for Lord Liang,

755
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,678
I'm afraid that it'll be too late.

756
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,160
The person I want to give this to

757
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,719
is in this city.

758
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:25,840
They say that the sacred tree
in Qingyun Temple is very effective.

759
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,800
When I take a look at it,

760
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,359
it's the chestnut tree.

761
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,480
Its branch can indeed ease the pain and
get rid of the toxins.

762
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,639
I've asked the innkeeper

763
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,359
to prepare a hot tub of water for you.

764
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,478
Take a bath with it later.

765
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,960
It'll soothe your arrow wound.

766
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,680
You left the city?

767
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,519
Gu Wan'niang asked me
to meet her at Qingyun Temple.

768
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,640
She said that Prime Minister Gu
can leave the mansion now.

769
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,700
But he can't leave the city.

770
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,680
And there are spies
everywhere around him.

771
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:49,158
Whenever he goes out,

772
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:50,640
he'll be followed.

773
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,319
So, if we want to meet him,

774
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,840
we need to come up with a solution.

775
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,640
I think I have the perfect solution.

776
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,960
You already have a solution?

777
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:03,998
I need to come up with a solution quickly

778
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:05,999
so that I can repay you for this branch.

779
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,478
I never thought that Li Ni

780
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:14,319
would succeed in rescuing our father.

781
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:15,840
Now,

782
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,279
he has defeated Dongdu
and taken down Tong Pass.

783
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,999
And he's approaching Xichang right now.

784
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,200
Looks like he's going

785
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,998
to achieve unbeatable merits soon.

786
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:26,119
Although we've lost our chance,

787
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,559
I have a solution

788
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,360
that can turn the tide around.

789
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,198
Tell me about it.

790
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,039
Jun.

791
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,879
Our father is the last bloodline

792
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,839
of the previous emperor

793
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,158
and he is a Lord.

794
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,119
It is perfectly justifiable

795
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,880
for our father to take over the throne.

796
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,359
Our father can become the emperor
in Dongdu.

797
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,359
This is not unprecedented.

798
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,559
The one who helps him

799
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,918
become the emperor at the right time

800
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,599
will be more important to him
than the one

801
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,519
who takes down Tong Pass
and reclaims Xichang.

802
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,440
You'll have the merit
of making him the emperor.

803
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,519
Jun.

804
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,119
You are the eldest son.

805
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,678
Once he becomes the emperor,

806
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,438
you'll be the one with the most merits.

807
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:01,960
And you'll automatically
be the crown prince.

808
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:02,918
Moreover,

809
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:04,478
Li Ni is in charge of a huge army

810
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,799
and has won many battles.

811
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,238
But once our father becomes the emperor,

812
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:07,958
the imperial court

813
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:10,160
will be wary of Li Ni's power.

814
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,600
Your suggestion has enlightened me.

815
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,158
But our father is in Tong Pass now.

816
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:23,238
And Li Ni is a cunning man.

817
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:24,319
What should we do

818
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,519
if Li Ni doesn't allow our father

819
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,478
to travel to Luoyang?

820
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:30,319
You'll have to go
to Tong Pass personally

821
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,879
to escort him back.

822
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,758
He dotes on you the most.

823
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,559
If you go there personally
to escort him,

824
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,198
I'm sure he'll agree to come with you.

825
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:39,958
If Li Ni tries to stop,

826
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:42,640
he'll be considered unfilial.

827
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,039
You are right.

828
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:47,400
That makes sense.

829
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:49,279
Don't worry.

830
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,079
I'll ask our father

831
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,319
to appoint you as the lord.

832
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,079
Jun.

833
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,359
The most important thing now

834
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,120
is to bring Father back and help him
ascend to the throne as soon as possible.

835
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,918
As for the rest,

836
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,158
we can talk about it later.

837
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:00,998
I know that you have good intentions.

838
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,079
But I'm afraid that others
will make things difficult for you

839
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,600
out of jealousy for me.

840
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,240
You are really sensible.

841
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:11,119
Greetings, sister-in-law.

842
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,238
Greetings.

843
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,960
I've asked the kitchen
to cook some soup for you.

844
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,760
(Consort Linzi, Wang)
You've been working the whole day.

845
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,700
You should drink some soup.

846
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,358
Thank you.

847
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,119
It's late already.

848
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,039
I will not disturb
both of you any longer.

849
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,079
Drink some soup.

850
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,800
You were talking to Lai
for so long tonight.

851
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,519
Did something happen?

852
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,678
No.

853
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,400
You don't have to worry.

854
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,199
If only your third brother was here.

855
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:51,599
Then, the three of you

856
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,999
could've helped each other out.

857
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,599
And you could have a discussion together
if there was an issue.

858
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,838
You kept talking about Li Ni.

859
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,520
Even if you treat him
like a real brother,

860
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,240
it doesn't mean
that he'll treat you kindly.

861
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,559
Actually, your third brother

862
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,158
has always respected you.

863
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,198
Otherwise,

864
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,079
he would not have given you Luoyang.

865
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,039
Do you think he did that willingly?

866
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,640
He only did it because he wanted
to take down Tong Pass and attack Xichang.

867
00:35:17,879 --> 00:35:20,039
He looks humble and respectful.

868
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,718
But in reality,

869
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,920
he's just trying to steal
all the merits for himself.

870
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,798
You took care of him for just a few days

871
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:29,358
when you were first married to me.

872
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,639
Don't be fooled by him.

873
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:34,039
Okay now. You can leave now.

874
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,559
I still have things to do.

875
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,639
Go back to your room.

876
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:47,718
Shiqi.

877
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,559
A message from Tong Pass.

878
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,400
Something has happened.

879
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,280
What is it?

880
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:51,599
Lord Linzi

881
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,838
personally led a troop

882
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:55,039
to Tong Pass to escort Lord Liang.

883
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,559
General Pei Yuan couldn't stop them.

884
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,119
So, he sent a letter to us instead.

885
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,959
My eldest brother is all about

886
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,519
showing how filial he is.

887
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:13,280
It won!

888
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,599
What a fierce general.

889
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,399
Lord Linzi said

890
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,678
that this is a rare cricket.

891
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,919
Here.

892
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,960
Let me give you a slice of cucumber.

893
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,599
What did you say
about Lord Linzi just now?

894
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,919
What about him?

895
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,679
Lord Linzi

896
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:30,919
told me that after he finds out

897
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,878
about you having trouble sleeping,

898
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:35,080
he has been looking
for physicians everywhere to treat you.

899
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,079
He even asked Advisor Wu

900
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,800
to pray for you every day.

901
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,599
Jun

902
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,718
really cares about me.

903
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,800
Your Highness,

904
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:48,240
Advisor Wu said

905
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,439
that you are someone
who's destined for greatness.

906
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,399
Among all the imperial members,

907
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,599
you are the only one
who managed to survive this ordeal.

908
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,278
As soon as you ascend to the throne,

909
00:36:58,279 --> 00:37:00,158
that traitor, Sun Jing,

910
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,999
will be defeated at once.

911
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,439
For the safety of the people,

912
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,760
you have to ascend to the throne.

913
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:08,720
You are right.

914
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:12,559
I have to do that

915
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:15,320
for the people of this country.

916
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,679
It's my duty to do so.

917
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,599
Why did you bring me here?

918
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,760
This is the Soy Sauce Garden.

919
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:29,039
Whenever I felt upset

920
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,439
or when I was hit by my father,

921
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,278
I would sneak out

922
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:32,599
from the mansion and come here.

923
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,200
Then, I would hide on top of this tree.

924
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,999
When I was standing on the tree,

925
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,680
I would look at the sky, the clouds,
and listen to the chirping of birds.

926
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,679
During summer,

927
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,479
the cicadas would emerge
from their shells here.

928
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,639
And they would leave
their empty shells behind.

929
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,959
So, I picked up a shell

930
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,198
and painted it with ink.

931
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,320
And it looked like a real cicada.

932
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,079
Then, you must have used that fake cicada

933
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,479
to scare others.

934
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,880
Yes.

935
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,679
Li Jun

936
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:01,360
was afraid of bugs the most.

937
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,399
One time,

938
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,238
he blamed me for knocking over the ink
when he was the one who did it.

939
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,999
In the end,
I was beaten up by my father.

940
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:08,399
I was so mad at him.

941
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
So, I put that empty shell

942
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,999
on his study table.

943
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,999
In the end,

944
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,599
he screamed like a baby.

945
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,360
So,

946
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,878
he complained to my father again.

947
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,559
And I got beaten up once more.

948
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,639
In Yingzhou,

949
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,479
we have a small hill

950
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,880
behind the forest.

951
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,358
In spring,

952
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,679
the hill will be decorated
with wildflowers.

953
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,238
When I was young, I would ride there

954
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,679
and lie down on the hill.

955
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,439
I would look at the clouds

956
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,079
while they drifted by.

957
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,599
If only I had known you

958
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,199
when we were little.

959
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,798
I'm not sure about that.

960
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:46,959
Maybe you would

961
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,439
hate me when you were little.

962
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,919
When you first met me,

963
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,278
you hated me so much, right?

964
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:54,199
You were so evil at that time.

965
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:55,718
You pushed me into the well.

966
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,520
And I was immersed
in the cold water for so long.

967
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,599
But you kicked me into the river too.

968
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,999
Should I let you hit me now

969
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,999
so that you can vent out your anger?

970
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,679
Move your face closer.

971
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,599
You promised to hit me instead of
flicking my forehead.

972
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,238
Why can I only hit you
instead of flicking you?

973
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,278
I don't care.

974
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:20,119
Since you've flicked my forehead,
it's payback time.

975
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:22,639
Look.

976
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,039
How dare you flick my head.

977
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,039
Young Lady.

978
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,519
Young Lady.

979
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,599
Qiucui.

980
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,198
Young Lady.

981
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,919
Finally, we are together again.

982
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,158
Why did you come back?

983
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:46,678
I asked you to stay in Tong Pass

984
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,039
to take care of Lord Liang, right?

985
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,838
Lord Liang

986
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,238
was escorted to Luoyang

987
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,919
by Lord Lin or something.

988
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,678
It's Lord Liang's son.

989
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:56,959
He personally went to Tong Pass

990
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,198
to take him away.

991
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,199
Lord Linzi?

992
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,119
Lord Linzi took Lord Liang away?

993
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,639
Yes. Lord Linzi.

994
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,119
I'm afraid

995
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:10,199
that trouble will arise again.

996
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,278
It doesn't matter now.

997
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:15,519
As long as you are back at home already.

998
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,280
This incense burner is so exquisite.

999
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,240
It was given by my father.

1000
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:26,079
Master?

1001
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,838
He's treating you so well now.

1002
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,919
That way,

1003
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,320
no one will look down on you anymore.

1004
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,840
For him,

1005
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:36,240
only a useful daughter

1006
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,999
is a good daughter.

1007
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,920
(We've talked to Prime Minister Gu.)

1008
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,158
(Tomorrow, Miss Gu)

1009
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,519
(will leave the mansion with him.)

1010
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,599
(Ask Prime Minister Gu
to enter the silk shop)

1011
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,880
(to get his measurements taken.)

1012
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,639
We have many types of fabrics and silk
to choose from.

1013
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,399
Please come in.

1014
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,278
Zhuzi.

1015
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:16,400
Take care of our customers.

1016
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,120
Let me get your measurements for you.

1017
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,559
My father doesn't like to
be touched by others. I'll do it instead.

1018
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,079
Okay.

1019
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,718
Please come here

1020
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:24,919
to get your measurements taken.

1021
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,639
(After Prime Minister
enters the private area,)

1022
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,798
(he'll be blocked off
by the dressing screen)

1023
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:30,039
(to take his measurements.)

1024
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,838
(The Cui Army knows)

1025
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,399
(an old friend, a musician)

1026
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,800
(who's a good impersonator.)

1027
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,170
(He can mimic the voice
of Prime Minister Gu and Gu Wan'niang.)

1028
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,198
Do they have any fabric here

1029
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,758
that looks more solemn?

1030
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:41,559
Take a look.

1031
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,559
Choose something for your mother too.

1032
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,318
Father.

1033
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,360
I think this is not bad.

1034
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:48,718
But I think this pattern

1035
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,880
looks a bit old-fashioned.

1036
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:52,798
Father.

1037
00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:54,039
Take a look at this.

1038
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,440
You can make a lined robe with it.

1039
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,880
That's great.

1040
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,240
Let's choose this one then.
