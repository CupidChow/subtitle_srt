=Episode 7=

29
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,970
- Lieutenant.
- What's the situation?

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,900
The garrison of Bingzhou
is about to crumble.

31
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,520
Some soldiers abandoned the city
and escaped to Jianzhou.

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,820
The rest have mostly surrendered.

33
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,320
Now we are counting the prisoners,
food supplies, seals, letters

34
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,480
and many other urgent things.

35
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,559
Did you catch Han Li?

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,700
When Han Li saw the situation,

37
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,520
he escaped with the help
of his personal guards.

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,319
But I've sent out our men
to search for him.

39
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,670
The city gate is closed.

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,039
I'm sure he's still in Bingzhou.

41
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:19,520
Listen.

42
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,999
We have to capture Han Li
before the Zhenxi Army.

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,839
Roger that.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,556
(Cui)

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,640
Guards!

46
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:34,920
Guards!

47
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,159
Mister Lv.

48
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,900
Mister Lv passed out all of a sudden.

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,999
Mister Lv.

50
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,400
Someone is escaping!

51
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,640
Mister Shiqi.

52
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,319
This time, I've brought many men.

53
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,640
Where's Han Li?

54
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,510
Have you caught him?

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,080
I made a deal with the Cui family.

56
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,370
Whoever catches Han Li first
will take over Bingzhou.

57
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,420
Han Li ran away
as soon as the battle started.

58
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,170
But Bao is chasing after him.

59
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,999
Let's go and catch that cunning man.

60
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,240
Chen Xing.

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,879
Lieutenant,
Han Li is not in the carriage.

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,080
He's indeed cunning.

63
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,800
Qiucui, don't worry.

64
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,200
Our servants

65
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,680
are standing guard downstairs.

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,520
No one can barge in.

67
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,220
Miss, they say

68
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,220
that the army breaking into the city
will plunder

69
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
and do all kinds of evil.

70
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,240
Will our servants be able to stop them?

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,839
If they can stop them,

72
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,599
we'll be safe and sound.

73
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,400
If they can't stop them,

74
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,960
what's the point
of being scared right now?

75
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,240
This is Third Lady's fault.

76
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,839
If she didn't bad-mouth you to Master,

77
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,749
you wouldn't have to volunteer to come

78
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,260
to Bingzhou
for the ancestor worship.

79
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,800
If it wasn't for Third Lady,

80
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,639
we wouldn't be here in Bingzhou

81
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,275
(Daughter of Prime Minister Gu,)
and we wouldn't be in danger now.

82
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,720
(Gu Wan'niang)
Qiucui, that's not true.

83
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,639
Third Sister is right.

84
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,840
My father has six daughters.

85
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,280
I'm the only one who is not smart

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,800
and has no redeeming qualities.

87
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,840
If I don't work myself harder,

88
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,840
I'll be even more useless.

89
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,639
Third Lady
was just spouting nonsense.

90
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,879
Don't take it to heart.

91
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,319
Grand Governor Sun wanted to appoint
my father as the prime minister.

92
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,999
My father refused.

93
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,720
So, he was sent to jail.

94
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,600
All of the royal families
in the capital city

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,999
admired him
for his incorruptible integrity.

96
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,160
Now that he is finally free,

97
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,810
he's unable to leave the capital city.

98
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,840
I'm fortunate to be able

99
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,260
to travel to Bingzhou to pay respect

100
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,720
to our ancestors on behalf of him.

101
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,639
If you are always like this,

102
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,040
when can you live
with your head held high?

103
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,360
Even those servants in the residence

104
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,079
dare to treat you rudely now.

105
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,040
Don't worry, Master.

106
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,870
Pursuers have been lured away
by that carriage.

107
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,959
Is there anywhere to hide in here?

108
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,399
If you can barge into
someone's private residence

109
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,360
in broad daylight,

110
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,710
why don't you look
for a place to hide yourself?

111
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:40,280
Lord Han has always been a hero.

112
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,920
Miss.

113
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,079
But now, you are hiding
in a lady's room.

114
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,639
Don't you feel ashamed?

115
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,519
Lord Han.

116
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,559
Don't you think you've fallen too low

117
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,110
if you have to hold a weak lady hostage?

118
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,160
You won't be able to goad me.

119
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,600
Since you are Young Master Cui's
study partner,

120
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,399
now that Bingzhou has fallen,

121
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,000
the Zhenxi Army is holding more power.

122
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,840
Since you are worthless
to Young Master Cui,

123
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,079
maybe you should join
the Zhenxi Army instead.

124
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,999
You are already

125
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,480
in such a dire situation.

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
And yet,
you are worried about my future.

127
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,519
I'll never regret

128
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,480
knowing you.

129
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,319
And thank you

130
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,360
for putting me in your good graces.

131
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,879
What's the point of me putting you
in my good graces?

132
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,480
Will you let me go?

133
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,510
You've misunderstood me, Lord Han.

134
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,280
I can't thank you enough.

135
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,559
Why would I bring you harm?

136
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,519
Everyone in the city says

137
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,959
that you are good at business.

138
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,559
And that you are a wealthy man.

139
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,390
Now that I've been abandoned
by the Cui family,

140
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,360
I have nothing.

141
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:35,999
Please be understanding

142
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,040
and give me a hand.

143
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,519
Take them out.

144
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,079
These pieces of jewellery
are very valuable.

145
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,840
Take them

146
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:53,519
and join the Zhenxi Army.

147
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,439
Miss!

148
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:09,199
Stay away!

149
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:09,840
Miss.

150
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,160
If you come here, I'll kill her.

151
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,879
Miss.

152
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:13,600
Miss!

153
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,519
Miss.

154
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,920
Miss, please forgive me.

155
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,639
Thank you for saving my life.

156
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,439
Don't move!

157
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,600
Lieutenant He,
should we fight them for him?

158
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
I concede defeat.

159
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,600
I'm not someone
who can't admit defeat.

160
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,480
Are you okay, Miss?

161
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,240
Miss.

162
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,999
Hurry up.

163
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,959
Come here.

164
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,519
Mister Shiqi.

165
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,420
Finally, we managed
to catch this cunning man.

166
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,959
It's too late for the Cui Army.

167
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,680
Han Li belongs to us now.

168
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,040
Congratulations, Li Ni.

169
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,840
Since you've managed to capture Han Li,

170
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,840
I'll honor our deal.

171
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,319
Bingzhou belongs to the Zhenxi Army now.

172
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,480
Thank you.

173
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,770
Han Li has been captured
by the Zhenxi Army.

174
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,240
According to our deal,
Bingzhou belongs to them now.

175
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,039
What?

176
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,560
When did you make that deal

177
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,639
with the Zhenxi Army?

178
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,679
How could you do that?

179
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,960
Lieutenant He,
why didn't you tell me about it?

180
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,799
She already informed me
about it beforehand.

181
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,919
She was just following my command.

182
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,440
The Zhenxi Army is low on food supplies.

183
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,279
I already

184
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,840
informed Young Master about it.

185
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,360
As soon as we entered the city,

186
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,300
we sent our men to clear out
the food supplies.

187
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,320
Now, even though the Zhenxi Army
has taken over Bingzhou,

188
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,159
they are still out of food supplies.

189
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,840
I see.

190
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,560
I'd like to ask you
for a favour, Li.

191
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,039
Are you finally going
to let me help you?

192
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,840
We are a family.

193
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,880
There's no need to be polite.

194
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,320
You are the commander of our army.

195
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,279
Just give me your order.

196
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,120
Now that our army is in the city,

197
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,080
we need to stay alert
in case the Zhenxi Army

198
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,440
has an ulterior motive.

199
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,440
I hope that you can

200
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,890
station a troop
outside of the city.

201
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,519
If something happens in the city,

202
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,519
you can back us up from the outside.

203
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,080
Just in case.

204
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,560
Station...

205
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,440
Station a troop outside?

206
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,919
I'm sure you have your reason
for this decision.

207
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,110
I'll lead a troop and station
outside of the city at once.

208
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,200
Thank you.

209
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,759
We are a family.

210
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,010
There's no need to be polite.

211
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,560
I know that you don't like him.

212
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,519
That's why

213
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,480
I sent him away from the city.

214
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,200
Thank you, Young Master.

215
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,080
No wonder Shu is nowhere to be seen.

216
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,560
You've sent him to the outside of the city
early in the morning

217
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,679
to keep an eye on Cui Li.

218
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,759
You know me well, Ying.

219
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,820
Drink some tea.

220
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,320
Let me pour it for you.

221
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,879
Say it again if you dare.

222
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,960
Fine.

223
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,879
Since you are slightly deaf,
I'll say it again.

224
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,679
The Cui Army

225
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,720
should hand over

226
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,240
the food supplies that you've taken

227
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,879
and leave the city.

228
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,200
The Zhenxi Army

229
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,919
is magnanimous and kind.

230
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,879
Since both of us

231
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,799
are fighting for the same throne,

232
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,720
we'll let you rest in Bingzhou

233
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,679
for one night before your departure.

234
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,480
What do you think?

235
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,200
The Zhenxi Army
is generous enough, right?

236
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,440
We are the ones who took down Bingzhou.

237
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,390
The food supplies belongs
to the party entering the city first.

238
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,039
Although we made a deal with you,

239
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,440
you've now taken over Bingzhou.

240
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,420
Why do we have to
give you the food supplies?

241
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,600
Do you think I'll be scared of you

242
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,320
just because you slapped the table?

243
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,759
We took down Bingzhou together.

244
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,159
Without the Zhenxi Army,

245
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,840
Han Li would've escaped to Jianzhou

246
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,200
and tried to reclaim Bingzhou.

247
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,200
How dare you say that.

248
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,039
I said it!

249
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,310
Give us back our food supplies!

250
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,279
Say it again!

251
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,039
Are you really deaf?

252
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,250
If we didn't attack the city,

253
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,720
you wouldn't have time
to catch Han Li.

254
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,679
Return us our food supplies

255
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,080
and get out of Bingzhou!

256
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,320
Darn you.

257
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,240
You brat.

258
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,480
I'll kill you.

259
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,320
I'll kill you.

260
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,520
Han Li doesn't have the tiger tally.

261
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,770
Continue to look for it.

262
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:39,560
Roger that.

263
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,799
- That's utter nonsense.
- You brat.

264
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,919
I'll kill you, you brat.

265
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,519
They are searching

266
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,080
Han Li's residence thoroughly.

267
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,039
Looks like

268
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,440
the tiger tally is not with Han Li.

269
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,960
Young Master Cui over there

270
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,720
has a fierce reputation
on the battlefield.

271
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,200
But now that I've seen him in person,

272
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,120
he's just a frail and weak man.

273
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,420
Never judge a book by its cover.

274
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,799
He's just a pretty boy.

275
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,679
How dare you say
that I didn't join the fight.

276
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,080
You were just a baby

277
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
when I was fighting in battle!

278
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,200
Let's fight if you dare!

279
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,320
- Come on then!
- Come on!

280
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,070
I'm not a coward who's afraid of you.

281
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,639
Come.

282
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,999
I'll teach you a lesson,

283
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,159
you brat.

284
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:20,999
(Tang's Confection)

285
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:24,799
Are you hungry?

286
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,110
I asked someone to buy these
early in the morning.

287
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,399
They are your favourite.

288
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,360
Thank you, Young Master.

289
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,480
You are quite strong.

290
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,720
It's delicious.

291
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,879
Where are you hitting?

292
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,320
I...

293
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,440
Let me help you wipe.

294
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,120
Stop it!

295
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:58,919
I'm hungry.

296
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,110
Let's go and eat first.

297
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,320
Eat?

298
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:02,960
I'm not hungry.

299
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,360
I say that I'm hungry.

300
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,200
Lieutenant He.

301
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,480
Looks like Li Ni found

302
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,080
the hairpin that you lost.

303
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
I never thought

304
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,200
that Imperial Grandson,

305
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,600
the marshal of the Zhenxi Army,

306
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,080
would be so greedy.

307
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,620
He found your hairpin
but refused to return.

308
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
And he even wears it on his head blatantly.

309
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,960
How shameless of him.

310
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,420
I'll go and get it back for you.

311
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,159
No.

312
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,840
Don't cause trouble.

313
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,370
Look at the big picture.

314
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,600
I thought Lieutenant He

315
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,799
lost her hairpin.

316
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,200
Why does Li Ni have it?

317
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,320
Lieutenant He gave it to him.

318
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,420
The Qixi Lantern Festival

319
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,470
has always been an important festival
in Bingzhou.

320
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,440
Now, we have
two major armies in Bingzhou.

321
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,919
Who do you think

322
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,999
will accept our invitation?

323
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,720
I hope that there won't be a fight.

324
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,519
Ask that pretty face of yours

325
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,440
to come out.

326
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,440
Who is a pretty face?

327
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,320
The Zhenxi Army is the pretty face
who wants a free ride.

328
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,039
Both armies quarrel so much.

329
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,480
A fight will break out eventually.

330
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,159
If the city can't be at peace,

331
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,120
we are the ones
who will be affected by it.

332
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,240
Sorry for the wait.

333
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,759
There's no need to apologise.

334
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,159
According to our Young Master,

335
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,910
Bingzhou has just started
to settle down.

336
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,360
Everyone is still living in fear.

337
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,560
We need to hold a lively celebration
of the Lantern Festival.

338
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,519
Life can only continue

339
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,039
when the people feel safe.

340
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,440
And bringing peace to the people

341
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,240
is why we fight for the throne.

342
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,080
Everyone in the Cui Army,

343
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,100
including Young Master,
will attend the festival.

344
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,399
Please take care of us on that day.

345
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:01,879
Of course.

346
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:05,679
Looks like

347
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,720
the Zhenxi Army
is not going to attend it.

348
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,639
No. That's not true.

349
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,399
Young Master Cui has said everything

350
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,440
that my general conveys.

351
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,840
The Zhenxi Army
will attend the festival too.

352
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,279
Thank you.

353
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:16,919
Thank you.

354
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,919
What's the point of having good ears?

355
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,639
You talk so slowly.

356
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,200
Why are you here, Imperial Grandson?

357
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,320
I need to ask something
with Lieutenant He.

358
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,159
She's just a lieutenant.

359
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,620
If it's about military affairs,

360
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,159
you can just talk to me about it.

361
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,519
Just a minor matter.

362
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,279
There's no need to bother you.

363
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,080
I heard that Lieutenant He

364
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,279
was stranded in Han Li's residence
a few days ago.

365
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,519
And that she only got out alive

366
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,560
because she was under your care.

367
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,240
I should set up a banquet

368
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:05,279
to thank you

369
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,840
for your help.

370
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,870
The Cui Army is the leading army
fighting for the throne.

371
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,470
It's my duty.

372
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,080
You are too kind.

373
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,440
I grew up

374
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,799
with Lieutenant He since young.

375
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,639
We have a special relationship.

376
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,159
So, by taking care of Lieutenant He,

377
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,560
you've taken care of me too.

378
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,159
I knew that you would come.

379
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,360
Why are you here, Young Master?

380
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,679
I just want to pay you a visit.

381
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,080
Greetings, Your Highness.

382
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,240
You may be at ease.

383
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,399
It was urgent today.

384
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,840
You are not injured, right?

385
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,600
Do you need a physician?

386
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,840
Just now, General Pei Yuan

387
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,620
has already sent a physician
to check on me.

388
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,279
Luckily, I just have some minor cuts.

389
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,200
Nothing serious.

390
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,799
I'm here to thank you.

391
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,720
If it wasn't for you today,

392
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,679
I would've died.

393
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,279
There's no need.

394
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,799
It's not a big deal.

395
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,280
Don't address me as His Highness.

396
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,080
Just call me by my title in the army.

397
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,520
Come in.

398
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,320
The weather has turned cold.

399
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,120
And you are not dressed properly
for the cold.

400
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,220
No wonder you are coughing.

401
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,719
If Taozi finds out about this,

402
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:24,239
she'll lecture you again.

403
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:25,959
I'm fine.

404
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:31,000
Today, after keeping a close eye on Li Ni,

405
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:34,600
he's indeed an outstanding commander
as you said he is.

406
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,770
We should never underestimate him.

407
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:42,280
Li Ni is indeed a wise strategist.

408
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,360
The Zhenxi Army is a formidable force.

409
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,399
If we can fight alongside each other,

410
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,420
we can achieve victory
with half the effort.

411
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,479
But if we become enemies,

412
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,120
to be honest,

413
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,239
with an opponent like Li Ni,

414
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm afraid

415
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,640
that we won't be able to defeat them.

416
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,520
The Zhenxi Army is tied down
by fighting for the throne.

417
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,120
No matter what,

418
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,679
they won't become our enemies.

419
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:09,919
It's better to be safe than sorry.

420
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,719
Do you have any family in this city?

421
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,959
I can ask Bao to send someone
to take you home.

422
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,399
I haven't introduced myself yet.

423
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,879
My surname is Gu.

424
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,080
Named Wan'niang.

425
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,719
I'm from the capital city.

426
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,639
Last month, I came to Bingzhou

427
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,800
to pay respect to my ancestors
on behalf of my father.

428
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,630
The Gu family in Bingzhou.

429
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,300
I remember that Prime Minister Gu

430
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:33,080
is from the Gu family in Bingzhou too.

431
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,239
I heard that he called Sun Jing out
for being a traitor in court.

432
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,959
Then, he was sent to jail.

433
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,520
That's my father.

434
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,879
In the end, in order to gain
the people's support,

435
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,719
my father was released from prison

436
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:48,080
and confined at home.

437
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:51,159
So, I traveled to Bingzhou
to pay respect to our ancestors

438
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,840
and pray for my father.

439
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,399
So, you are
Prime Minister Gu's daughter.

440
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,639
Our country was overturned

441
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,479
and my father almost lost his life.

442
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,439
Luckily, I ran into
the Zhenxi Army today.

443
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,879
And our army is indeed impressive

444
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,159
and formidable.

445
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:10,080
I'm willing to donate our family's
food in Bingzhou to the Zhenxi Army.

446
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,800
May the victory be yours

447
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,399
and reclaim
the capital city soon.

448
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,110
That way, not only can you
save the people from this peril,

449
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,199
you can save my father too.

450
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,000
Prime Minister Gu is loyal

451
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:23,239
and now, you are donating
your food to our army.

452
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,110
You're indeed the offspring
of loyal family.

453
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,000
I have a favour to ask.

454
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:29,919
I hope that you can give me a hand.

455
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,159
Go ahead.

456
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,000
The nation is in chaos now.

457
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,940
And Bingzhou is far away
from the capital city.

458
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,310
I'm afraid that I won't be able
to return to the capital city by myself.

459
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,239
Please agree

460
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:42,840
to let me travel with the army.

461
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,870
That way, I'll be fortunate
enough to witness

462
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,919
the reclaiming of Xichang
by the Zhenxi Army.

463
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,040
It's not easy to march with the army.

464
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,000
It's not convenient
to bring ladies with us.

465
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:54,000
No matter how difficult it is,

466
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,560
I can take it.

467
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,040
If you are worried about us,

468
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:58,600
Qiucui and I can dress up as men.

469
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,239
We won't cause you any trouble.

470
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,360
It's better for me to send a team

471
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,840
to escort you back to the capital city.

472
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,239
You are busy with military affairs.

473
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,719
I don't want you to cut down
the size of your army to protect me.

474
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:11,199
You just need to allow me

475
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,199
to follow the army from behind.

476
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,439
Okay then.

477
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,360
You can dress up as a man

478
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:27,760
and join the army.

479
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,280
Thank you, General.

480
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,600
Stop right there!

481
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:37,280
Stop her.

482
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,399
You uneducated wench.

483
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,760
Madam Shen. Educate them
about proper etiquette.

484
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,510
Yes, Your Highness.

485
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:48,199
The crown princess
is from the internal court,

486
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:49,040
in the top rank.

487
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,820
Lady of the country
is from the external court,

488
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,560
in the first rank.

489
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:54,040
The crown princess has a higher rank.

490
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,879
The lady of the country should greet
the crown princess with a kowtow.

491
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,280
What?

492
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,320
Are you saying that I should
show my respect to her?

493
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,639
Lady of Wei is Grand Governor's wife.

494
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,600
Grand Governor
has achieved great merits.

495
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,719
So, Her Highness

496
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:11,479
has exempted you from having
to greet her with a kowtow.

497
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,080
I am Her Highness's personal maid.

498
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,000
I am in the sixth rank.

499
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,800
You are Lady of Wei's maidservant.

500
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:18,760
You have no ranking.

501
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:19,600
What is it?

502
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,719
A maidservant who has no ranking wants

503
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,439
to hit a personal maid
in the sixth rank?

504
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:25,600
Looks like you are confused
about where you stand.

505
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,000
You have no manners at all.

506
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,320
What a sharp tongue you have.

507
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,020
Thank you for the compliment, Lady of Wei.

508
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:34,199
Grand Governor is humble and polite.

509
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,320
Now that you've entered the palace,

510
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:38,959
you have to follow the rules
and proper etiquette as well

511
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:40,720
so that you won't be a laughing stock.

512
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,639
A laughing stock.

513
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,040
I want to see

514
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,120
who dares laugh at me now.

515
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,679
You'll be taught a lesson
if you have no manners.

516
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,080
You...

517
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,399
You crazy!

518
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,159
Stop crying.

519
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,520
To be honest,

520
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:10,280
(Duke Zheng)
the rumors are indeed quite unpleasant.

521
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,120
However, Xiao

522
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,840
is still the former crown princess.

523
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,810
Since the former crown prince
took his own life,

524
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,919
she should've followed him

525
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,360
if she was sensible.

526
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,040
Even if she didn't,

527
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:21,679
she should've become a nun to stay loyal
to the former crown prince.

528
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,159
Grand Governor

529
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,719
is a wise man.

530
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,320
Why is he

531
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:28,000
so taken with this woman?

532
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:31,719
She must have put a spell on him.

533
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:35,520
Think about it.

534
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:37,520
Over the years,

535
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,959
he had married

536
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,280
so many wives and concubines.

537
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,399
But he had never doted on anyone before.

538
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,040
I can't let this continue.

539
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,320
Don't panic.

540
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,040
There are still countless battles
ahead of us.

541
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:53,479
Grand Governor still needs
the Yuan Clan from Chenjun

542
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,030
to fight for him and
supply him with food.

543
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,479
He won't treat us badly.

544
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,399
But this Xiao

545
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,560
is adamant about staying in the palace.

546
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,840
Maybe

547
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,840
she has an ulterior motive.

548
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,600
We'll find out what it is eventually.

549
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,239
Then,

550
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,879
I'll discuss this with our relatives

551
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,800
and convince Grand Governor
to kill this woman

552
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,360
for what she did to you.

553
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,360
You may leave.

554
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,320
The river looks clear and shallow.

555
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:53,120
But how far apart the river banks are?

556
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:00,600
The Qixi Festival will be here soon.

557
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,479
We met for the first time

558
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,040
on the night of Qixi.

559
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:12,400
If I had known that this would happen,

560
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:14,800
we should've never met.

561
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:17,520
Why are you saying something
so negative again?

562
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:19,439
Are you

563
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,919
still mad because of Lady of Wei?

564
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:31,360
I've lived in the palace for so long.

565
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,360
This kind of thing happens often.

566
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,560
It's only normal for others

567
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:37,010
to favour the one with power.

568
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:40,479
Once you lose power,
they'll step all over you.

569
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,120
Today,

570
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:44,879
Lady of Wei slapped my personal maid.

571
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:46,560
If I didn't retaliate,

572
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
one day,

573
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,959
she would kill me with poison.

574
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,560
Do you think you will

575
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,159
punish your legal wife

576
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,280
for me?

577
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,320
I don't think she'll do that.

578
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,919
The Yuan Clan from Chenjun

579
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,520
is your wife's clan.

580
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,600
And you've always relied on them.

581
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,800
I've offended Lady of Wei today.

582
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,719
I should leave the palace
and become a nun.

583
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:11,800
That way,

584
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,199
I won't be a thorn in someone's flesh.

585
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:17,239
You are trying to goad me.

586
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,959
I wouldn't dare.

587
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,439
I'm just afraid that
if I continue to stay here,

588
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,610
I'll die one day without knowing
what killed me.

589
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,399
I better become a nun

590
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,959
and stay away from all the curses.

591
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,040
I want to see

592
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,399
which monastery

593
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,600
can handle you.

594
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,320
You can build a monastery for me.

595
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,280
At a tranquil and beautiful place.

596
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,800
I want it to be near to Xichang.

597
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:54,520
That way,
it'll be easy for you to visit me.

598
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:59,120
But maybe after I leave the palace,

599
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:01,040
you'll forget all about me

600
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,320
in just a few days.

601
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,360
Do you really want to be a nun?

602
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,710
I don't want to stay in the palace anymore.

603
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:18,040
Lady of Wei

604
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,959
is not a magnanimous person.

605
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,280
She likes to make things
difficult for me.

606
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,360
Moreover, everyone in the palace

607
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,959
has a sharp tongue.

608
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:29,320
I don't want

609
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:31,000
to be gossiped by them anymore.

610
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,080
Forget about being a nun.

611
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,159
But

612
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,199
your personal maid, Madam Shen,

613
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:47,439
looks like someone with great fortune.

614
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,879
Maybe she can become
a nun in your stead.

615
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,399
Finally, you've said the truth.

616
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,400
In order to preserve Lady of Wei's dignity,

617
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,010
you want to send my personal maid away

618
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:02,239
to become a nun.

619
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:04,320
Just give me
a glass of poisoned liquor.

620
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:05,600
Madam Shen and I

621
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,320
will drink that poisoned liquor at once.

622
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:11,560
She's your personal maid.

623
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,479
She offended Lady of Wei.

624
00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:14,959
I have no choice but to punish her.

625
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,840
What about Lady of Wei's maidservant?

626
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,159
She offended me.

627
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:20,040
Are you going

628
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,479
to ask her to become a nun too?

629
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,399
Look at you.

630
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:25,239
You are

631
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:26,719
so eager to win in everything.

632
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,560
If you act fairly and punish
that maidservant too,

633
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:34,120
I'll send Madam Shen away
to become a nun.

634
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,719
Otherwise, not a chance.

635
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,710
Are you patching up your robe?

636
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:02,959
Let me help you.

637
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,879
Forget it.

638
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,600
I'm better at this than you.

639
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,200
When you patched up
your torn socks last time,

640
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,010
those stitches
were as long as centipedes.

641
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,570
I want to ask you something.

642
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:16,280
I heard

643
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:17,840
that you are going to let Miss Gu

644
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,730
travel with our army
in men's clothes, right?

645
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:20,639
Yes.

646
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:22,000
She's alone

647
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,080
with her maid.

648
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,470
She wants to return
to the capital city.

649
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:26,320
It's a battlefield everywhere.

650
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:28,320
She can't survive the journey alone.

651
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:29,280
Instead of that,

652
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:30,879
she can travel along with our army.

653
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,080
This is the first time.

654
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,959
This is my first time seeing you
treating a lady so kindly.

655
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,320
Are you going to become

656
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,919
a nagging old woman
when there's no war?

657
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,199
No.

658
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,120
I really think

659
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,760
that Miss Gu is a nice woman.

660
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:44,919
She's good enough for you.

661
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,000
She's good for you.

662
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,360
Looks like you've fallen for Miss Gu.

663
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:54,719
Me?

664
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,520
This is easy.

665
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,479
I'll write a letter to Great General Pei

666
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:58,320
to propose for you.

667
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:58,800
No.

668
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,340
What nonsense are you talking about?

669
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,239
You are the one who likes her.

670
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,290
For the first time ever,

671
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,080
you allowed a woman

672
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,360
to travel with our army.

673
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,320
So, stop dragging me into this.

674
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,040
What's wrong with being a woman?

675
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,560
Look at Lieutenant He
from the Cui family.

676
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
She's smart and cunning.

677
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,720
And she's good at commanding her troops.

678
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,080
She's way better than
so many men out there.

679
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:27,000
From what you said,

680
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,120
looks like
you are in love with Lieutenant He

681
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:31,320
instead of Miss Gu.

682
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:34,000
Nonsense.

683
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,199
Nonsense?

684
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:50,679
Lieutenant He.

685
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:52,239
Lieutenant He.

686
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:53,679
The paper windmill.

687
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,080
I retrieved the paper windmill
that you left in the inn.

688
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,520
Show it to me.

689
00:29:58,919 --> 00:29:59,520
But wait.

690
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,879
This is just a paper windmill.

691
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,399
Why did you leave it
on the counter of the inn

692
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,439
if you were going
to send me to retrieve it?

693
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,399
Look.

694
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,679
This is just a toy

695
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:09,840
that's sold in a market.

696
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,959
It's not unique and it's worthless.

697
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,040
And it's broken.

698
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,959
Why do you keep it?

699
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:14,760
It's broken?

700
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:16,080
Look.

701
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,159
It wasn't broken

702
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,520
when I gave it to the innkeeper.

703
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,560
Looks like

704
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,879
he didn't take good care of it.

705
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,320
It's broken here too.

706
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:50,080
This is not how you fix it.

707
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,959
You'll get cut by the bamboo strip.

708
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:53,479
Let me do it.

709
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,390
This kind of labor work is not for you.

710
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:54,800
It's fixed.

711
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:02,479
Let's attend the Lantern Festival
tomorrow night together.

712
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,620
Don't you have
to run the show tomorrow?

713
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,879
I already appointed someone else

714
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,360
to do that kind of boring task.

715
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,280
What about you?

716
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,520
Do you have to accompany
Young Master Cui?

717
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,120
No.

718
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:15,760
It's a deal then.

719
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,159
See you then.

720
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,439
Lieutenant He.

721
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,919
You fixed the windmill?

722
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,239
Yes.

723
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:37,919
Lieutenant He.

724
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,040
Let's enjoy the Lantern Festival
together at night.

725
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,479
I have things to do tonight.

726
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:42,239
I'll pass.

727
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,810
Are you going to accompany

728
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,320
Young Master to the Lantern Festival?

729
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,040
Sitting under the well-lit shed

730
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:48,040
for people to gossip?

731
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:48,959
I'll pass.

732
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,800
What is it that you have to do then?

733
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,639
I...

734
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,520
I'm afraid that the Zhenxi Army

735
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,710
will do something in secret.

736
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,990
So, I have to keep an eye on them

737
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,239
to find out what their plan is.

738
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,360
Okay. I'll go with you

739
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,239
to help you.

740
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,080
You don't have to.

741
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,600
You can keep an eye on Xie Chang'er
from the Zhenxi Army for me.

742
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:08,639
Not only is he

743
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,159
Li Ni's trusted man,

744
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,720
he can gather intel
from the sound of wind.

745
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,159
You have to keep a close eye on him.

746
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,879
Don't give him any chance
to act in secret.

747
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,000
Ear.

748
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,919
Why are you pulling such a long face?

749
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,080
Mister Shiqi has ordered us
to behead Han Li in public

750
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,190
during the Lantern Festival

751
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,510
to make a name for the Zhenxi Army.

752
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,159
Yes.

753
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:39,040
We've done everything

754
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,560
according to Mister Shiqi's order.

755
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,360
But he asked me

756
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,479
to lure Miss Taozi away

757
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:44,919
from Lieutenant He.

758
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,840
Why?

759
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Since someone

760
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:50,320
doesn't want Taozi
to follow Lieutenant He,

761
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:52,959
it means that someone else
wants to follow her instead.

762
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,199
Just do as he said.

763
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:56,600
But how can I

764
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,280
lure Miss Taozi away?

765
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,679
Knock her out?

766
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,159
She uses poison and she's cunning.

767
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,560
If I were to fight with her,
I couldn't win.

768
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,759
Your brain

769
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,440
is made out of wood.

770
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,120
You can just invite her

771
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:13,080
to enjoy

772
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:14,480
the Lantern Festival with you.

773
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,199
Here you go.

774
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,719
Think about it.

775
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,839
Miss Taozi.

776
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,040
Miss Taozi.

777
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,400
How about we enjoy

778
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,000
the Lantern Festival today together?

779
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,880
Why are you inviting me?

780
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,080
Because I'm alone today.

781
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,719
Others have other things to do.

782
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,400
And it looks like

783
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,319
you are alone too.

784
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,319
How about we...

785
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,839
So, you are inviting me

786
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,880
because you are bored.

787
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,520
No.

788
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:02,440
No. Miss Taozi.

789
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,440
It's not what I meant.

790
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:06,199
Forget it.

791
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,319
Forget what I said.

792
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:08,839
Stop right there.

793
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,880
Since you wanted to invite me,

794
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,880
you invite me then.

795
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,510
Why are you changing your mind now?

796
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,120
Who do you think I am?

797
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,799
No. Miss Taozi.

798
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,110
- Let me explain.
- I'll go with you.

799
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,120
Let's enjoy
the Lantern Festival together.

800
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,759
Thank you, Miss Taozi.

801
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,120
No need to thank me.

802
00:35:30,319 --> 00:35:32,239
After all, you've saved me from trouble.

803
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,359
What trouble?

804
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,560
Come and take a look.

805
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,520
Be careful.

806
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:52,440
Why are you dressing up like this today?

807
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,639
You look beautiful.

808
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,239
Since I'm here to spy on someone,

809
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,759
of course I need to get changed.

810
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,319
This is a trick

811
00:35:58,319 --> 00:35:59,799
to make others lower their guard.

812
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,480
You are indeed wise.

813
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,319
Let's get down to business.

814
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,810
You are so beautiful today.

815
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,440
I almost couldn't recognise you.

816
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,319
Come on in.

817
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Awesome!

818
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,719
Again!

819
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,279
Amazing!

820
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,440
That's great!

821
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Windmills.

822
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,719
Pretty and fun windmills.

823
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,400
Again!

824
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,040
Great.

825
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,000
Give me one windmill, please.

826
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,400
Choose one.

827
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,679
I'll take this.

828
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:05,920
Okay.

829
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,359
Pay for it.

830
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,120
You like windmills?

831
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,560
Not really.

832
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,759
But our lieutenant has a windmill

833
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,759
on her book rack.

834
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,299
Great!

835
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,560
And she's always in a good mood

836
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,880
when she looks at it every day.

837
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:24,159
She refused to throw it away

838
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:25,400
when it broke that day.

839
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,239
She even fixed it herself.

840
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,400
But paper windmills are not expensive.

841
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,440
Only two copper coins.

842
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:31,600
That's right.

843
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,440
I said the same thing to her.

844
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,639
I told her that we could
buy a new one together.

845
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:39,319
But she said that I wouldn't understand.

846
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,239
She said

847
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,639
that buying a windmill yourself

848
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,960
was not as fun as getting
a windmill as a present.

849
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:47,319
So, when I saw that person just now,

850
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,199
I said to myself

851
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,370
that I wanted someone

852
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,199
to give me one too.

853
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,319
I want to see

854
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,359
how fun a windmill can be

855
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,279
when it's a gift from another person.

856
00:38:56,799 --> 00:38:58,639
Is that why
you asked me to buy it for you?

857
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:01,920
I'm sure you feel honored

858
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,080
to buy something for me.

859
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,359
Yes, I do.

860
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,880
But what's so fun

861
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,520
about getting a windmill as a gift?

862
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,319
Why don't I feel the same?

863
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,759
Am I dreaming
or is the river full of stars?

864
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:41,199
This place is beautiful.

865
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,199
The stars in Laolan Pass

866
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,600
are way bigger

867
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,000
and nearer.

868
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,820
When you lie down on the desert
at midnight,

869
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:51,159
the sky is as dark as silk.

870
00:39:51,799 --> 00:39:52,920
As if you can touch the star

871
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,560
just by reaching out.

872
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,759
We have steppe

873
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,639
as far as the eyes can see in Pingliang.

874
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,120
When I was young,

875
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:01,960
my father would go hunting with me.

876
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,120
Sometimes, I would fall asleep
on the back of the horse.

877
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,480
When I woke up and opened my eyes,

878
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:09,279
I could see every single star

879
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,600
in the sky.

880
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,410
They looked like sugar crystals
that were about to fall.

881
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,920
I grew up in the capital city.

882
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,839
After I learnt how to ride,

883
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,880
I would always ride alone to go

884
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,839
to the Wonderland.

885
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,300
The Wonderland is a famous spot
in the capital city.

886
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,080
It's located on high land.

887
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,410
Standing on top of it,

888
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,880
you can overlook the whole capital city.

889
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,440
Hear the buzz and chirp in the forest,
look at the rainbow on the other side.

890
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:39,239
Feel the breeze from the west
in Wonderland.

891
00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:42,679
Keep riding deep into the sunset.

892
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,920
May the sun never set.

893
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:48,440
So, you like this poem.

894
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,639
But I like the other one.

895
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:50,920
Wait.

896
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,279
I know which one you like.

897
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,199
What?

898
00:40:55,279 --> 00:40:57,080
There's grass everywhere
in the grassland.

899
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,279
Every year, it'll wilt during Autumn.

900
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,080
But you can never burn it down.

901
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:03,040
It'll come back again
when Spring is here.

902
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,639
Is that the one?

903
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,040
How do you know
I like that poem?

904
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,920
Know your enemies well
so that you can defeat them.

905
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:15,839
I know

906
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,159
that Li Ni is someone like that.

907
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,560
That's why I know

908
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,639
that you like this poem.

909
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,719
You are amazing, Lieutenant He.

910
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,839
You are my bosom friend.

911
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,639
I like that.

912
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:29,480
Nonsense.

913
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,960
I didn't say

914
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,210
that I'm your bosom friend.

915
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,040
I didn't say

916
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:34,239
that you said that.

917
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,839
Why is my dress wet?

918
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,239
This is bad. The boat is leaky.

919
00:42:23,385 --> 00:42:27,655
♪If I forget the fleeting of time♪

920
00:42:28,895 --> 00:42:30,905
♪Waiting for memories♪

921
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:34,075
