29
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:50,987
Lieutenant He,

30
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,668
did you plan all this?

31
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:57,347
Would you believe me

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,280
if I told you I know nothing of this?

33
00:01:59,347 --> 00:02:00,428
How can I believe you?

34
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:11,588
Stop right there!

35
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:37,187
- Charge!
- Charge!

36
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:38,868
Stop!

37
00:02:38,988 --> 00:02:39,708
Stop fighting!

38
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,227
I said, stop fighting!

39
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:56,280
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

40
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,747
I know no matter what I say,

41
00:03:36,747 --> 00:03:37,708
you won't believe me.

42
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:39,667
But this time,

43
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,227
I truly had no knowledge

44
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:44,787
and never plotted against you.

45
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:49,388
Take your Cui Army and leave.

46
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:52,388
If they dare to appear
in front of me again,

47
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:54,148
I will kill one

48
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,187
as I see one.

49
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:58,588
Release them!

50
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:43,948
Since we left Laolan Pass,

51
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:47,388
I never expected our devastating defeat

52
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:49,068
was because that Cui

53
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:50,467
sold us out.

54
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:54,307
Gather our forces

55
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:56,628
and retreat towards Luoyang.

56
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:00,948
Yes.

57
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:27,068
Lieutenant He, it's time to eat.

58
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:46,748
Tong Pass lost.

59
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:49,388
Young Master must have planned for it.

60
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:53,107
I've interrogated them all day.

61
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:54,948
The leader is tight-lipped,

62
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,068
only saying

63
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,427
that he was sent by Young Master

64
00:05:58,068 --> 00:05:59,427
and was told

65
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:00,588
to go far away

66
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:02,347
to lure us far away.

67
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:04,068
He refused

68
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:05,748
to divulge about the rest

69
00:06:06,188 --> 00:06:08,110
and insisted on saying
he didn't know anything.

70
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:11,787
Lieutenant He,

71
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:13,388
eat some.

72
00:06:13,828 --> 00:06:14,588
After you finished,

73
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:15,867
we can make a plan.

74
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:22,748
Li Ni is really something.

75
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,667
He accused you

76
00:06:24,828 --> 00:06:25,667
without any proof.

77
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,268
Clearly, you don't know anything.

78
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:30,508
Yet, he insisted
that you colluded with Young Master.

79
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:32,227
This is so upsetting.

80
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:38,419
It's is a fact

81
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,340
that the Cui Army caused
the Zhenxi Army to lose Tong Pass

82
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,628
and heavy casualties

83
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,188
for the Zhenxi Army.

84
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,148
If I were in his shoes,

85
00:06:50,948 --> 00:06:52,347
I may not be calm-headed too.

86
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:57,787
But I always thought

87
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:03,068
he would believe me.

88
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:07,828
All right.

89
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,427
Stop thinking about it already.

90
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,188
Well,

91
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,667
he's a clever person.

92
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,867
I think he'll come around.

93
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,028
Look at you.

94
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:55,268
Mister Shiqi,

95
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:56,987
why didn't you wake me?

96
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,028
Did you keep watch all night?

97
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:01,188
I'm not sleepy.

98
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,867
Keeping watch is nothing.

99
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:05,708
I'm sure you know

100
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:07,227
no matter

101
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:09,148
how cunning Lieutenant He is,

102
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:10,667
she

103
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,107
is straightforward.

104
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:14,388
Even if she deceived us,

105
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:16,867
she wouldn't hesitate
to admit it, right?

106
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:42,148
Ying,

107
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:43,907
I finally reached you.

108
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:47,348
You sold Tong Pass out.

109
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:50,028
Ying,

110
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,067
Sun Jing agreed

111
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,787
that as long as we cooperate with him

112
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:56,339
to take control of Tong Pass
and drive out the Zhenxi Army,

113
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,820
he'll immediately withdraw the large army
deployed towards Yingzhou.

114
00:08:58,947 --> 00:08:59,907
This way,

115
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,348
Father's situation will be relieved.

116
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,628
How could you do this?

117
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:04,028
Why not?

118
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:05,148
Do you want me

119
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,667
to watch helplessly as Father is besieged
by Sun Jing's forces?

120
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:09,947
Don't you know
we and the Zhenxi Army are allies?

121
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:11,827
It's just a temporary alliance.

122
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:14,148
You've always known what Li Ni is like.

123
00:09:14,348 --> 00:09:15,388
He is unpredictable.

124
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:16,427
Who knows

125
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:18,187
after he captures Xichang in the future,

126
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:20,307
he will immediately march on Yingzhou

127
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:21,988
and pressure the Cui Army and Father?

128
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,560
How could you act without consulting me

129
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:24,348
beforehand?

130
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:26,628
Everything I did was
for the good of the Cui Army!

131
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:30,028
The Zhenxi Army only suffered some losses

132
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:31,028
and lost Tong Pass.

133
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:32,868
Since Li Ni is so capable,

134
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:34,907
he can definitely recapture it again!

135
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:37,427
The siege of Yingzhou is imminent.

136
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,268
Shouldn't I save Father?

137
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:40,587
Of course, we should save him.

138
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:43,108
But the Zhenxi Army
took in the Cui Army out of goodwill.

139
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:45,108
Morally, you shouldn't
have sold Tong Pass!

140
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:45,787
I did it

141
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:47,187
to lift the siege on Yingzhou!

142
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:52,748
Ying,

143
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:56,067
if your questioning comes
from favoring Li Ni

144
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,388
and not being objective

145
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:58,947
in this matter,

146
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,028
do you think that is fair to me?

147
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:07,947
Young Master,

148
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:09,787
should I go after them?

149
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:14,307
Taozi is with her.

150
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,787
She won't go far.

151
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:19,348
After she comes around,

152
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,067
she'll naturally return.

153
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:55,667
Lieutenant He,

154
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:59,228
why don't we go back first?

155
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,228
To be honest,

156
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:04,028
Young Master did it for Yingzhou.

157
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:10,547
I know.

158
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,067
But the way he handled this

159
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:14,707
is clearly unrighteous.

160
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:19,547
Don't be upset.

161
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:25,827
I'm not upset.

162
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:27,067
I'm just...

163
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,868
Are you worried

164
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,680
that His Highness will never come around

165
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:35,110
and continue to misunderstand you?

166
00:11:40,547 --> 00:11:41,108
Forget it.

167
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,108
Let's not talk about him anymore.

168
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,468
Since he refuses to trust me,

169
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:47,587
we'll be strangers

170
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:50,388
the next time we meet.

171
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:56,748
The next time we meet,

172
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:59,468
it might only be on the battlefield.

173
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,787
Don't be afraid
that we meet on the battlefield.

174
00:12:04,187 --> 00:12:05,707
No matter how capable His Highness is,

175
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:06,907
he can't beat

176
00:12:07,148 --> 00:12:08,947
Great General
in leading troops into battle.

177
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:15,787
To be honest,

178
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,067
when we left Yingzhou,

179
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:19,587
I was thinking

180
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:22,748
how innocent the people
in this world are.

181
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:24,707
Sun Jing

182
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:27,067
extorts and exploits, seeks glory,

183
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,520
and wastes military resources
to conquer the Baiyue region,

184
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:30,988
exhausting the resources.

185
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:32,907
Only by resisting Sun Jing

186
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:34,667
until we pacifies the world

187
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,468
can the people live a good life.

188
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:41,228
But I didn't expect

189
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,748
the Li Family to have someone
talented like Li Ni.

190
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:48,468
In fact,

191
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:52,628
in terms of reputation,

192
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:54,868
character, and ability,

193
00:12:58,547 --> 00:13:00,587
he's the person
who can pacify the world

194
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:03,508
and ensure a good life for the people.

195
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:05,868
Lieutenant He,

196
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:08,348
didn't you always think

197
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:09,707
that besides yourself

198
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:11,307
and the Cui Army,

199
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:13,348
no one else could pacify the world?

200
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:19,667
I did.

201
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:22,388
But I never expect

202
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,028
to encounter someone like him.

203
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:31,108
But,

204
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:40,148
we might end up as enemies
in the future.

205
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,547
Why don't we return first.

206
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:52,628
Young Master must be worried about you.

207
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:57,547
At the moment,

208
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:00,427
we need to hurry back to Yingzhou.

209
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:03,427
If we return to see Great General,

210
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:05,268
he'll definitely be very happy.

211
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:09,947
All right.

212
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,640
In a while, I'll get you something to eat.

213
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:25,148
Recently,

214
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:27,587
the Zhenxi Army and those
who withdrew from Tong Pass

215
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:28,748
are all here.

216
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,380
But if we go back to Luoyang
in such a sorry state,

217
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:33,028
Lord Linzi might become suspicious.

218
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:37,587
My eldest brother

219
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:39,348
is ambitious but lacks talent,

220
00:14:39,827 --> 00:14:41,028
and he's narrow-minded.

221
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:42,587
My second brother

222
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:44,028
is sly.

223
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:45,988
Who knows what lousy ideas

224
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,028
he might come up for my eldest brother?

225
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,388
So why are we retreating to Luoyang?

226
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,388
We've lost Tong Pass

227
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:54,228
and only gathered this small force.

228
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,748
Lord Linzi might indeed

229
00:14:56,748 --> 00:14:57,707
disregard us.

230
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,400
But as long as your father leads

231
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:01,427
the Zhenxi Army's rear forces,

232
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,108
he won't dare disrespect us.

233
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:05,028
Just watch.

234
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:06,947
He'll probably send someone over

235
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:08,707
to feign concern and offer assistance.

236
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:10,508
Mister Shiqi.

237
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:11,787
Mister Shiqi.

238
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,299
What is it?

239
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,067
Lord Linzi heard
that we withdrew from Tong Pass.

240
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,810
He quickly sent reinforcements
from Luoyang

241
00:15:15,868 --> 00:15:17,187
to deliver provisions and supplies

242
00:15:17,388 --> 00:15:18,228
as a show of support.

243
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:19,388
Shiqi,

244
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:20,707
he did what you just said.

245
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:23,868
In that case,

246
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:25,787
we'll accept them.

247
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:27,508
Spread my order.

248
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,187
We'll set up camp here for a few days

249
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,348
before heading to Luoyang.

250
00:15:32,187 --> 00:15:32,508
Yes.

251
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:36,947
Jun.

252
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:40,508
Last time, you said to send supplies

253
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:42,468
as a gesture of goodwill

254
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,530
because Li Ni suffered a major defeat.

255
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,710
So, I sent my men to deliver them.

256
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:45,667
Unexpectedly,

257
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,508
he accepted everything.

258
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:48,748
Jun,

259
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:49,827
this shows

260
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:51,148
how cunning Li Ni is.

261
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:53,067
He knew he suffered a major defeat

262
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:54,028
and it will be you

263
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,907
who'll take him
and his remaining forces in.

264
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:58,108
But he shamelessly accepted your supplies.

265
00:15:58,468 --> 00:16:00,468
This is a blatant attempt

266
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:02,067
to openly seek refuge with you.

267
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:04,268
Jun, you must seize this opportunity well.

268
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:08,228
But, the Zhenxi Army still has tens
of thousands of troops led by Pei Xian.

269
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,988
They're all waiting in the rear.

270
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,468
What do you have to fear?

271
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:13,787
As long as Li Ni enters Luoyang,

272
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,508
you can discuss with the court officials

273
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:17,827
and hold him accountable
for the defeat at Tong Pass.

274
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:18,587
In this way,

275
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:19,787
won't it be easy

276
00:16:19,988 --> 00:16:21,508
to strip him of his military power?

277
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,228
But what if Pei Xian refuses to comply?

278
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:26,868
Father has ascended the throne

279
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:27,868
and is the monarch.

280
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,307
If Pei Xian refuses,

281
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:30,907
it's deceiving the monarch.

282
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:32,307
Those who deceive the monarch

283
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:33,988
should be punished.

284
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:37,468
Your words make sense.

285
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:39,667
I'll have someone write
a letter to Li Ni.

286
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,920
Since he suffered a major defeat,

287
00:16:40,947 --> 00:16:42,427
he should quickly return to the court

288
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:43,947
with his remaining forces

289
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:45,547
and await the court's orders.

290
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,228
Why not take this opportunity

291
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:50,268
to eliminate a potential threat?

292
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:52,427
Do you mean

293
00:16:53,508 --> 00:16:54,508
the Cui Army?

294
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:55,628
Precisely.

295
00:16:56,587 --> 00:16:59,108
Didn't you lend a unit of light cavalry
with heavy crossbows

296
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:00,427
to Cui Li?

297
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,587
Unfortunately,
Cui Li's impulsive actions

298
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:03,827
allowed Cui Lin to escape.

299
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:05,948
He ended up being saved by Li Ni.

300
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:08,067
I was worried that Cui Li
might be tactless

301
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,147
and expose this matter.

302
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:10,787
Wouldn't that be a headache?

303
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:12,028
Jun,

304
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:15,268
now is the best opportunity

305
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,827
for Cui Li to kill Cui Lin.

306
00:17:18,107 --> 00:17:20,107
Just think about it.
Cui Lin sold them out.

307
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:22,347
Li Ni must harbor deep hatred for him.

308
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:23,268
Moreover,

309
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:24,908
if Cui Lin dies at this moment,

310
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:26,908
Cui Yi won't suspect anything.

311
00:17:27,107 --> 00:17:29,468
He'll surely think it's Li Ni's doing.

312
00:17:30,268 --> 00:17:31,468
This is Cui Yi's only son.

313
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:32,908
If he loses his son at this age,

314
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:34,268
he'll surely seek revenge

315
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:35,587
against Li Ni relentlessly.

316
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,280
That's a brilliant idea.

317
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:47,428
(Ni,)

318
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:49,028
(my heart broke upon hearing)

319
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:50,228
(the defeat at Tong Pass.)

320
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,700
(I have been worry day and night.)

321
00:17:51,948 --> 00:17:54,307
(The provisions I sent earlier
might not be sufficient.)

322
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:57,347
(Hurry back with the remaining troops
to rest and recover in Dongdu.)

323
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:58,307
(Jun.)

324
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,410
Lord Linzi wants us to return
to Luoyang quickly?

325
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,827
What is his intention?

326
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:07,000
He probably thinks

327
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,188
that the defeat at Tong Pass

328
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,547
is a good opportunity
to strip me of my military power.

329
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,700
This person is not good at warfare,

330
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:14,787
but always scheming.

331
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,107
The troops deployed by my father

332
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,468
should arrive in a few days.

333
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,820
We'll prioritize our food supplies
over the troops' action.

334
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:23,948
We need to plan for the food supplies.

335
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:29,627
Li Ni has sent a message.

336
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:38,508
Send someone to respond to him.

337
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:41,748
If he can keep his promise

338
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,780
and ensure the return
of the great imperial grandson,

339
00:18:44,028 --> 00:18:45,948
guarantee his growth,

340
00:18:46,428 --> 00:18:47,668
his succession,

341
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,800
and restore his position

342
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,700
as the direct lineage
of the late Crown Prince,

343
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:54,627
I will agree to his request.

344
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:56,307
Yes.

345
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:58,581
(Gu Residence)

346
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:04,188
May I know

347
00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:05,468
why Father suddenly ask for me?

348
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:08,028
I just received news

349
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:11,428
that army in the Baiyue expedition
has lost.

350
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:16,428
They said, Grand Governor
is extremely angry

351
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,620
and has ordered
to keep the matter in secret.

352
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:19,827
But in such matter,

353
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,440
the more they try to keep it a secret,

354
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:23,347
the faster the news spreads.

355
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,110
What do you think about this, Father?

356
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:26,827
In my opinion,

357
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:28,547
if they really lost,

358
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:29,708
the news

359
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:30,867
won't spread this quickly.

360
00:19:35,147 --> 00:19:36,307
Do you think

361
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:38,268
it's part of Sun Jing's strategy?

362
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:39,107
That's right.

363
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,228
This is Sun Jing's ploy

364
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:41,708
to lure the snake out of its hole.

365
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:42,748
If anyone dares to act recklessly

366
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:44,468
at this time,

367
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:46,428
they'll fall right into his trap.

368
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:05,228
Ying.

369
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:08,268
Young Master.

370
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:12,268
Taozi,

371
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:14,347
I need to talk to Ying.

372
00:20:15,908 --> 00:20:16,347
Yes.

373
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:21,867
Ying,

374
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:25,468
there's news from a military informant

375
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:27,948
that Sun Jing's expedition to Baiyue
has failed.

376
00:20:35,347 --> 00:20:35,748
Ying,

377
00:20:36,508 --> 00:20:37,280
are you still angry

378
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:39,508
with me?

379
00:20:40,468 --> 00:20:41,508
This time,

380
00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:43,028
you even deceived me.

381
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:47,228
I was just disappointed.

382
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:48,988
It was because Sun Jing promised

383
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:50,547
to withdraw from Yingzhou.

384
00:20:50,787 --> 00:20:52,107
That's why I used Tong Pass

385
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:52,988
as a bargaining chip.

386
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:56,668
Why did you keep it from me

387
00:20:57,228 --> 00:20:58,428
and lied to me?

388
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:00,787
Ying,

389
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:03,228
both of us

390
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:04,587
grew up together.

391
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:06,508
No matter what you think,

392
00:21:07,748 --> 00:21:08,428
I see you

393
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:09,748
as my closest family.

394
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:11,028
I...

395
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,787
I never wanted to hide it from you.

396
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:15,708
Lying to you

397
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:18,948
was only because you went out with Li Ni.

398
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,188
I didn't want him to find out
about this.

399
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:25,708
You have schemed well this time.

400
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,147
You managed

401
00:21:27,268 --> 00:21:28,988
to predict that Li Ni would come along

402
00:21:29,347 --> 00:21:31,028
as long as I go and join the Cui Army.

403
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:33,307
Then, you can take action.

404
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,547
I truly did it
for the Cui Army's interest.

405
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:36,387
Now,

406
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:37,948
I really want to know

407
00:21:38,668 --> 00:21:39,627
whose interest

408
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:41,228
you care about

409
00:21:41,787 --> 00:21:42,627
and why you're upset

410
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:43,468
at this moment.

411
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,200
Are you going to forget
where you come from

412
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:46,867
all because of Li Ni?

413
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:47,787
And forget

414
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:49,028
why we set out from Yingzhou?

415
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:52,668
Ying.

416
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,268
Go back and rest.

417
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,228
It's futile

418
00:21:59,508 --> 00:22:00,827
to keep talking about this.

419
00:22:37,827 --> 00:22:38,867
If all is planned well,

420
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:42,067
we can break through Xichang
with the ten thousand troops we have.

421
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,380
Do you want to defeat a 100 thousand
with ten thousand soldiers?

422
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Didn't Sun Jing want
to lure the snake out of its hole?

423
00:22:47,787 --> 00:22:49,510
So, we'll retaliate with a similar strategy.

424
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,760
Since he pretends to be defeated,

425
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,587
I'll make it a real defeat.

426
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:54,067
Mister Shiqi,

427
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,860
I have urgent matters
to discuss with you.

428
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:56,468
What's the matter?

429
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:57,948
Come over here.

430
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:00,627
Can't you say it in front of me?

431
00:23:01,587 --> 00:23:04,188
Lieutenant He, did you have a quarrel
with Young Master?

432
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:07,708
It's nothing.

433
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:09,827
By the way,

434
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:12,347
there's news from the capital

435
00:23:12,787 --> 00:23:14,668
that the expedition
to Baiyue has failed.

436
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:17,627
Sun Jing is currently blocking the news.

437
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:19,988
So, that means

438
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,627
Sun Jing won't have many soldiers
around his side.

439
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:23,827
Lieutenant He,

440
00:23:24,107 --> 00:23:25,867
should we quickly inform Great General

441
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:28,028
and besiege him from both sides?

442
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:29,627
Not for now.

443
00:23:31,228 --> 00:23:33,107
This matter seems quite complex.

444
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:35,668
It might be Sun Jing's plot.

445
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,710
Then, His Highness, Li...

446
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:40,908
I mean the person

447
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:42,827
whom you forbid to mention.

448
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:44,268
Will he fall for it?

449
00:23:45,347 --> 00:23:46,347
Of course, he won't.

450
00:23:47,147 --> 00:23:48,587
He's bold and cautious,

451
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:50,867
rarely tempted by gains.

452
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,810
If Sun Jing pretends to be defeated,

453
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:54,428
I think he'll see through it.

454
00:23:55,188 --> 00:23:57,307
And this matter

455
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,908
should be an opportunity for him.

456
00:23:59,228 --> 00:24:00,668
He won't let this chance slip away.

457
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:02,228
Really?

458
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:04,228
Then, what will he do?

459
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:06,908
He will retaliate

460
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:09,387
with a similar strategy.

461
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:12,387
You mean Cui Li is still patrolling
and ambushing by the river?

462
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:13,028
Exactly.

463
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:15,700
We need to join forces with the troops sent
by Great General Pei.

464
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:16,908
That's why we're setting up the camp.

465
00:24:17,508 --> 00:24:18,347
I'm sure you know

466
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:20,387
it's Zhenxi Army's usual practice

467
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:21,827
to send out a team

468
00:24:22,188 --> 00:24:23,468
to patrol several tens of li

469
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,787
before choosing a campsite.

470
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:27,307
My squad went far
and coincidentally encountered

471
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:29,067
Cui Li and his troops marching.

472
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:31,908
It seems like they are preparing
an ambush overnight.

473
00:24:32,508 --> 00:24:33,880
Since Cui Li is setting up an ambush...

474
00:24:33,908 --> 00:24:36,028
It's definitely aimed
at Young Master Cui, right?

475
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:37,387
But,

476
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,508
Lieutenant He

477
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:41,228
is currently with that Mister Cui.

478
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,307
Should we rescue or not?

479
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:43,708
No.

480
00:24:44,307 --> 00:24:45,067
Are you sure?

481
00:24:45,228 --> 00:24:45,627
Yes.

482
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:05,268
Young Master,

483
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,468
Cui Lin and his party

484
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:07,908
will arrive in about 15 minutes.

485
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:10,668
Convey my orders.

486
00:25:11,147 --> 00:25:12,468
Order the men to prepare

487
00:25:12,587 --> 00:25:13,508
and stay alert.

488
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:15,188
Once Cui Lin is killed,

489
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:17,310
there will be hefty rewards
for everyone.

490
00:25:17,468 --> 00:25:17,948
Yes.

491
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:42,748
Lieutenant He!

492
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:01,547
Mater,

493
00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:03,387
we didn't succeed last time.

494
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:04,908
This time,

495
00:27:05,228 --> 00:27:06,668
we must succeed.

496
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:09,787
If we fail to kill Cui Lin this time,

497
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,040
we'll lose the support
of Lord Linzi, Li Jun,

498
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:13,067
a powerful reinforcement.

499
00:27:13,748 --> 00:27:15,908
And once Cui Lin returns to the army,

500
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:17,067
he and Uncle

501
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:18,028
won't spare me.

502
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:19,787
No matter what,

503
00:27:21,028 --> 00:27:22,908
Cui Lin must die.

504
00:29:25,428 --> 00:29:27,307
I thought you were going
to shoot Lieutenant He.

505
00:29:27,468 --> 00:29:29,827
You just act tough, but has a soft spot.

506
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:39,867
Young Master!

507
00:30:52,748 --> 00:30:54,067
Ying...

508
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:55,067
Young Master!

509
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:02,988
Young Master!

510
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:06,228
Young Master!

511
00:31:18,188 --> 00:31:19,307
Young Master!

512
00:31:33,468 --> 00:31:34,428
Let's go.

513
00:32:13,387 --> 00:32:15,988
Why didn't you wait until I was killed
before showing up?

514
00:32:17,307 --> 00:32:18,587
You've been here for a while.

515
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:21,307
But you only rushed down now.

516
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,468
You did it on purpose!

517
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,307
Yes.

518
00:32:25,387 --> 00:32:26,428
I did it on purpose.

519
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:56,067
I didn't expect

520
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:58,668
you succeeded in one move.

521
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:00,508
Your Highness,

522
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:02,387
the attempt to kill Cui Lin

523
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:04,708
was indeed a huge risk.

524
00:33:05,827 --> 00:33:06,508
But

525
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,708
for Your Highness's great cause,

526
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:10,307
taking the risk was worth it.

527
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,508
Mister Cui Li,
thank you for your hard work.

528
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:14,988
I'll remember your contribution.

529
00:33:15,347 --> 00:33:16,690
I gave you my word about rewarding you.

530
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:18,307
So not a penny less

531
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:22,748
I shall remember
Your Highness's great kindness.

532
00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:25,347
From now on, I swear my allegiance
to Your Highness.

533
00:33:27,183 --> 00:33:30,362
(Cui)

534
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,488
(Great General Pingliang, Cui Yi)

535
00:33:47,587 --> 00:33:49,307
I'm the commander of the Cui Army,

536
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:51,867
Great General Pingliang, Cui Yi.

537
00:33:53,228 --> 00:33:54,067
Come up.

538
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:56,107
If you surrender, I'll spare you.

539
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,587
Grand Governor ordered us
to attack Yingzhou.

540
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,948
Those who flee and surrender

541
00:34:01,188 --> 00:34:02,347
will be executed.

542
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:03,827
My entire family

543
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,268
is under a local official's watch.

544
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:06,748
If I surrender,

545
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:09,067
my whole family will die!

546
00:34:13,508 --> 00:34:14,187
General,

547
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:15,028
we've ambushed

548
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:16,227
half of Sun Jing's troops.

549
00:34:16,508 --> 00:34:17,868
The other half fled in panic.

550
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:19,707
We should take the opportunity

551
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:21,147
to pursue them

552
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:22,667
straight to Xichang.

553
00:34:24,308 --> 00:34:25,067
General!

554
00:34:26,067 --> 00:34:26,948
General!

555
00:34:27,508 --> 00:34:28,187
General!

556
00:34:28,988 --> 00:34:29,747
General,

557
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,800
Young Master was ambushed
on his way back to Yingzhou

558
00:34:31,828 --> 00:34:32,587
with the army.

559
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:35,110
He fell into the water with heavy wounds
and is now missing.

560
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:36,627
What about the people around him?

561
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:38,627
Where is Lieutenant He?

562
00:34:39,147 --> 00:34:40,339
When Young Master was attacked,

563
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,810
the Zhenxi Army happened to be nearby

564
00:34:41,828 --> 00:34:42,707
and saved some people.

565
00:34:43,028 --> 00:34:45,310
The commander of the Zhenxi Army,
Li Ni, wrote a letter,

566
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:46,988
and sent someone to deliver it to you.

567
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,028
(Great General Cui,)

568
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:53,508
(we happened to be nearby)

569
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,800
(when the Cui Army was ambushed.)

570
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,227
(It's a pity we were too late.)

571
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,400
(Cui Lin fell into the river.)

572
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,110
(But it's fortunate, we rescued Ying.)

573
00:34:59,508 --> 00:35:00,747
(You can rest assured now.)

574
00:35:01,388 --> 00:35:02,508
(Ying is safe and sound.)

575
00:35:02,508 --> 00:35:04,010
(She's currently recuperating
at my camp.)

576
00:35:04,308 --> 00:35:05,988
(We hope General Cui will lead the army)

577
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:07,880
(to jointly take Xichang
with the Zhenxi Army.)

578
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:10,147
Li Ni, this shameless fellow,

579
00:35:10,147 --> 00:35:11,508
is extremely arrogant.

580
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:14,227
How dare he use...

581
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:17,428
How dare he pressure me?

582
00:35:41,868 --> 00:35:43,428
Ying...

583
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:10,948
Lieutenant He, take your medicine.

584
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:20,428
It's too hot. I'll drink it later.

585
00:36:23,428 --> 00:36:24,988
Don't be too sad.

586
00:36:25,908 --> 00:36:26,788
Young Master...

587
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:29,147
Perhaps someone
has rescued Young Master.

588
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:31,747
It's been so many days.

589
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,107
There's still no news.

590
00:36:37,707 --> 00:36:39,828
I'm afraid he might be dead.

591
00:36:44,227 --> 00:36:46,028
There's a chance he was rescued.

592
00:36:46,227 --> 00:36:47,948
But he was being cared for.

593
00:36:48,348 --> 00:36:50,147
That's why he couldn't come back.

594
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:52,747
Enough, Taozi.

595
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:54,908
Stop comforting me.

596
00:36:57,267 --> 00:36:58,948
His body was already weak,

597
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:01,380
and he fell into the strong current
of the river

598
00:37:04,028 --> 00:37:05,627
with such a severe injury.

599
00:37:07,788 --> 00:37:08,468
I'm afraid...

600
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:12,828
I'm afraid he'll never come back.

601
00:37:18,187 --> 00:37:20,147
He grew up with me.

602
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:25,028
In my heart,

603
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,948
he's like

604
00:37:31,788 --> 00:37:33,147
my biological brother.

605
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:35,988
But I didn't expect...

606
00:37:41,988 --> 00:37:42,788
I didn't expect

607
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:44,747
he would die without a proper burial.

608
00:37:46,908 --> 00:37:47,988
There, there.

609
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:50,267
You must be facing

610
00:37:50,428 --> 00:37:51,868
a lot of grief now.

611
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:54,428
But you're also injured.

612
00:37:54,587 --> 00:37:56,547
How can you not take your medicine?

613
00:37:57,028 --> 00:37:58,667
After we get you all recovered,

614
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:01,107
we still need to head back to camp
to see Great General.

615
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:11,227
Li Ni is such a jerk.

616
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:13,147
He has us confined in the Taiqing Palace

617
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:14,868
and refuses to let us out.

618
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:17,187
He's locking us up like we're prisoners.

619
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:19,468
Didn't I tell you

620
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:21,828
not to bring him up in front of me?

621
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:26,547
Go and find some candied
and preserved fruits.

622
00:38:26,828 --> 00:38:27,908
When you come back later,

623
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,360
the medicine won't be so hot anymore.

624
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:30,948
Then I can drink it all in one go.

625
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:34,747
There might not be any here

626
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:36,988
in the Taiqing Palace,

627
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:38,508
and we can't go out to buy.

628
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:41,067
Maybe

629
00:38:41,227 --> 00:38:43,028
I can ask them to give me some wheat

630
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:44,308
and malt,

631
00:38:44,747 --> 00:38:46,428
I can make malt candy for you.

632
00:38:48,107 --> 00:38:48,868
I'll go now.

633
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,910
Why did you throw away the medicine?

634
00:39:08,028 --> 00:39:09,788
I caused harm to the Zhenxi Army.

635
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,310
I'd die faster
if I don't take the medicine.

636
00:39:11,468 --> 00:39:13,107
It would be better for you, wouldn't it?

637
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:14,747
In fact,

638
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:16,348
you didn't need to save me that day.

639
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,187
If both Young Master and I had died,

640
00:39:19,788 --> 00:39:21,310
it would have satisfied your vengeance.

641
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:22,468
I won't let you die.

642
00:39:22,948 --> 00:39:24,267
I don't need your rescue,

643
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:25,468
not then

644
00:39:25,627 --> 00:39:26,627
and not now.

645
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:27,707
Are the Zhenxi Army

646
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:29,267
so enraged

647
00:39:29,587 --> 00:39:31,610
that they must kill me and Taozi
to seek revenge?

648
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,547
That's why you're confining
the both of us in the Taiqing Palace.

649
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,110
We're guarded by your personal guards.

650
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:37,547
Isn't that because you're afraid

651
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:39,267
that your men might come to kill us?

652
00:39:40,107 --> 00:39:40,587
Ying,

653
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,340
I've come around
what happened at Tong Pass.

654
00:39:42,348 --> 00:39:43,428
You didn't know in advance.

655
00:39:44,107 --> 00:39:45,308
You're proud

656
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:46,948
and always use honorable tactics.

657
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:49,028
You won't use such despicable means

658
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,420
and disregarding the bigger picture
isn't how you do things.

659
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:52,707
If it were really you,

660
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:54,508
you would admit it openly.

661
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:57,067
So, I misunderstood you.

662
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:58,587
You did not.

663
00:39:59,587 --> 00:40:00,388
It was me.

664
00:40:00,788 --> 00:40:01,747
It was me who harmed

665
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:03,468
your soldiers.

666
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,267
Just kill me with a single blow.

667
00:40:05,828 --> 00:40:06,388
No need

668
00:40:06,388 --> 00:40:07,667
to pretend to save me here.

669
00:40:08,147 --> 00:40:08,908
I'm sorry.

670
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:11,147
I shouldn't have doubted you.

671
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:12,747
But, it was too sudden

672
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:15,710
and many soldiers
from the Zhenxi Army had died.

673
00:40:16,508 --> 00:40:17,788
That's why I lost my reason

674
00:40:19,147 --> 00:40:20,187
and misunderstood you.

675
00:40:26,267 --> 00:40:27,707
Go out. I don't want to see you.

676
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:58,901
(Taiqing Palace)

677
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:08,308
Lieutenant He,

678
00:41:08,587 --> 00:41:09,788
what are the odds?

679
00:41:09,908 --> 00:41:10,948
Originally,

680
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:13,348
I was in a dilemma

681
00:41:13,627 --> 00:41:14,707
because making malt candy

682
00:41:14,828 --> 00:41:16,267
will take two days to finish.

683
00:41:17,428 --> 00:41:18,308
I didn't expect

684
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,267
to discover some snacks

685
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:20,828
from Luoyang in the kitchen.

686
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:22,267
They said it was for Li Ni.

687
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:23,747
Without hesitating,

688
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:24,828
I took some over.

689
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:26,468
I've tried it.

690
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,348
It's not poisoned.

691
00:41:27,508 --> 00:41:28,627
It tastes pretty good too.

692
00:41:34,227 --> 00:41:35,308
What's wrong?

693
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:39,788
Nothing.

694
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,988
I finished the medicine just now.

695
00:41:43,308 --> 00:41:44,908
A rat came into the room just now.

696
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:47,107
So, I grabbed things and threw at it.

697
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:48,587
I missed the rat.

698
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,370
But, things are scattered
all over the floor.

699
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:06,308
Can you believe it?

700
00:42:07,187 --> 00:42:09,627
The mighty commander of the Zhenxi Army

701
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:11,948
doesn't do anything good.

702
00:42:12,388 --> 00:42:13,868
Why is he behaving like a rat?

703
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:16,388
This rat brought some preserved fruits,

704
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:18,308
and even upset you.

705
00:42:18,627 --> 00:42:20,308
Wasted a bowl of medicine for nothing.

706
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:24,948
All right.

707
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,107
I'll decoct another bowl
of medicine for you.

708
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,820
Did you go to Taiqing Palace again?

709
00:42:43,468 --> 00:42:44,508
Any news from Yingzhou?

710
00:42:46,388 --> 00:42:48,707
Cui Yi is truly cunning.

711
00:42:49,227 --> 00:42:51,570
Half of the troops Sun Jing sent over
was ambushed by him.

712
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:53,908
Cui Yi pursued the other half.

713
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:56,267
Fighting and retreating,
almost reaching Fuzhou.

714
00:42:56,547 --> 00:42:57,348
What did Cui Yi say?

715
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:58,667
He agreed readily

716
00:42:58,828 --> 00:42:59,988
to our conditions.

717
00:43:00,547 --> 00:43:01,828
But, this cunning man wants us

718
00:43:01,988 --> 00:43:03,227
to capture Cui Li alive.

719
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,428
He probably wants
to personally take revenge for his son.

720
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:10,468
Jun is not capable of handling
any responsibility.

721
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,267
If Cui Li seeks refuge with him,

722
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,370
it would be fine
if everything is peaceful.

723
00:43:14,547 --> 00:43:15,948
But at the slightest disturbance,

724
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:17,547
he'll surely hand over Cui Li.

725
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:19,348
You're right.

726
00:43:20,028 --> 00:43:20,587
Shiqi,

727
00:43:21,428 --> 00:43:22,667
since those in Taiqing Palace

728
00:43:22,828 --> 00:43:24,388
didn't conspire with Cui Lin

729
00:43:24,508 --> 00:43:26,908
and were specifically named
by Cui Yi for protection,

730
00:43:27,067 --> 00:43:28,028
I'll explain the reasons

731
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:29,747
to our comrades

732
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:30,428
in the army.

733
00:43:30,828 --> 00:43:31,388
Also,

734
00:43:31,707 --> 00:43:33,067
since Cui Yi has now agreed

735
00:43:33,227 --> 00:43:34,428
to march with us,

736
00:43:34,828 --> 00:43:37,428
it's considered as avenging
for our brothers.

737
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:44,828
But Shiqi,

738
00:43:45,868 --> 00:43:48,067
you must not visit
Taiqing Palace that often.

739
00:43:48,187 --> 00:43:48,868
Lieutenant He

740
00:43:48,988 --> 00:43:50,028
is from the Cui Army.

741
00:43:50,147 --> 00:43:51,710
You're the commander of the Zhenxi Army.

742
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:53,348
Your close relationship

743
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,667
is inappropriate.

744
00:43:57,227 --> 00:43:58,468
Yuan, I've told you

745
00:44:00,547 --> 00:44:01,667
I owed her this.

746
00:44:01,788 --> 00:44:03,267
But you must remember this, Shiqi.

747
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:05,308
His Majesty has ascended the throne now.

748
00:44:05,587 --> 00:44:06,868
You're now His Majesty's son

749
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,107
and the commander of the Zhenxi Army.

750
00:44:08,267 --> 00:44:08,819
In the future,

751
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,360
you can't marry a woman
from the Cui Army.

752
00:44:10,388 --> 00:44:11,508
Even as a concubine,

753
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:12,868
it's still impossible.

754
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:14,988
Since you already know it's impossible,

755
00:44:15,308 --> 00:44:16,788
why not end it sooner?

756
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:25,227
Shiqi,

757
00:44:27,028 --> 00:44:28,948
you know it in your heart too.

758
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:30,428
Your future marriage

759
00:44:30,707 --> 00:44:32,267
will be bestowed by His Majesty.

760
00:44:32,428 --> 00:44:33,627
The chosen person

761
00:44:33,747 --> 00:44:35,800
will undoubtedly be a noble lady
from the capital.

762
00:44:35,908 --> 00:44:37,587
Even if you beg His Majesty,

763
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,187
he will find someone suitable

764
00:44:39,348 --> 00:44:40,788
to be your consort.

765
00:44:42,067 --> 00:44:42,868
Shiqi,

766
00:44:44,468 --> 00:44:46,187
you can never marry her.

767
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:50,508
