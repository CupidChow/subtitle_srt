29
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,580
Your Majesty, don't worry.

30
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:58,700
I've prepared a fast horse.

31
00:01:58,725 --> 00:01:59,764
If the war goes badly,

32
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:00,404
I will

33
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:01,964
escort you to retreat south.

34
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,010
If we enter Jiangnan bank,

35
00:02:03,044 --> 00:02:05,764
we'll be safe with Yangtze River trench
as our defense.

36
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:06,420
Your Majesty,

37
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:07,525
if the war goes badly,

38
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:08,764
I'd like to stay behind

39
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,484
and lead the rearguard
against the enemy.

40
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:13,685
Jun, please escort His Majesty
to retreat by then.

41
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:17,044
Lai,

42
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,260
your loyalty and courage are commendable.

43
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:21,204
You're the imperial eldest son.

44
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:23,644
In the future,
the country and His Majesty

45
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:25,565
will depend on you.

46
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:27,725
If I can stay here
to defend His Majesty and you

47
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:29,324
from the enemy,

48
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:31,445
it's worth dying for.

49
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:36,245
Lai, you're really

50
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,885
my filial son.

51
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:41,885
Lai.

52
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,204
Lai, you can't...

53
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:44,845
Your Majesty!

54
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:45,965
Your Majesty!

55
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:47,364
Your Majesty,

56
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:48,604
we have news from the front.

57
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:49,245
Speak.

58
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,285
Lord Qin has broken into Xichang!

59
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,110
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

60
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,324
Lord Qin has defeated Sun Jing

61
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:56,924
and led the attack on Xichang.

62
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,565
What?

63
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,565
- Congratulations, Your Majesty!
- Congratulations, Your Majesty!

64
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:03,924
Only with your blessing

65
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:05,685
will Lord Qin be able to recover Xichang.

66
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,820
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

67
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,300
Because you appointed Lord Qin,
so he's able to recover Xichang.

68
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:10,604
It's a blessing for the world

69
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:11,685
that you're so wise.

70
00:03:11,804 --> 00:03:12,364
Good.

71
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:13,484
Very good.

72
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:17,604
Advisor Wu's right.

73
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:20,604
I am the rightful emperor.

74
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:23,324
Only when I become the emperor

75
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:27,125
can I save the world.

76
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:29,505
- Congratulations, Your Majesty!
- Congratulations, Your Majesty!

77
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:13,660
(Chaoqian Hall)

78
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:30,805
That year, I was 16 years old.

79
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,680
As is customary, I entered the palace
to bid farewell to the late emperor

80
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:36,485
and set off for Laolan Pass.

81
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:40,485
I made a mistake at that time

82
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,724
and the late emperor was so angry

83
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,820
that he didn't want to see me.

84
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:47,485
He ordered someone to send me a message

85
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:50,045
telling me to behave myself

86
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,925
and not to discredit
the Li family anymore.

87
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:54,964
Now that you

88
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,324
have recovered Xichang.

89
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,084
The late emperor will
be able to rest in peace.

90
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:08,245
What about those chasing

91
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:09,805
Sun Jing?

92
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:12,764
They couldn't stop them

93
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:14,204
after a few short encounters.

94
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,360
Sun Jing's trusted right-hand men
are committed to protecting him.

95
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:18,644
It seems Sun Jing

96
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:20,164
is still unconscious.

97
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,005
They're retreating while fighting

98
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:23,764
all the way to Tong Pass.

99
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:25,805
How about Great General Cui?

100
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:27,319
After we broke into Xichang,

101
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,079
Great General Cui led his troops
into the palace.

102
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,485
They dismounted
in front of Jianyuan Hall

103
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,565
and entered Yunxiao Tower.

104
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:32,885
And he said,

105
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:34,964
"The fun is gone.
That's all there is to it."

106
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,190
Then he led his troops out of the palace
to the Cui Army's camp

107
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,284
outside the city.

108
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:41,324
That's all there is to it?

109
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:44,445
I'd like to be like him

110
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,445
breaking into the city
and killing the enemy,

111
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,900
and at the end of the day, saying,

112
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,960
"That's all there is to it,"

113
00:05:48,964 --> 00:05:50,164
and walking away.

114
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,885
That's the true way of a great general.

115
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:56,724
Your Highness,

116
00:05:57,685 --> 00:05:59,844
you're different from him.

117
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:01,605
But I envy him

118
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:03,284
at the moment.

119
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,365
You led troops from Laolan Pass

120
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:10,605
to rescue the emperor
and pacify the world.

121
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:12,565
Now you've recovered Xichang.

122
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,284
So from now on,

123
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:16,324
you're not the same as everyone else,

124
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:17,925
and you can't say

125
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:19,365
you envy someone anymore.

126
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:22,284
Yes.

127
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:23,724
How boring.

128
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:29,125
Where is Ying?

129
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,685
Did she leave the city
with Great General Cui?

130
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:39,445
So this is the palace.

131
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:41,125
Lieutenant He,

132
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:44,084
except for the taller buildings

133
00:06:44,164 --> 00:06:45,365
and bigger houses,

134
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:46,644
it's not much different here.

135
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:48,125
Look,

136
00:06:48,404 --> 00:06:49,925
the place we're in now

137
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,844
is called Yuhui Tower.

138
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:53,045
In front of us

139
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:54,404
is Jianyuan Hall,

140
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,045
Qianzheng Hall,

141
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:57,204
and Jingde Hall.

142
00:06:58,644 --> 00:07:00,964
Those are the places
where the former emperors worked.

143
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:04,324
Behind that high wall

144
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:05,644
is Eastern Palace.

145
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:07,605
Beyond this

146
00:07:07,764 --> 00:07:08,644
Yuhui Tower

147
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:09,844
is the harem.

148
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:13,964
How many people

149
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:15,404
are living in such a big place?

150
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:17,964
The emperor had a dozen sons

151
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:19,324
and hundreds of grandchildren.

152
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:20,685
The family is large.

153
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,940
If the palace can't accommodate,

154
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:23,685
the princes will be allocated residences

155
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:24,685
outside the palace

156
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:25,964
when they get married.

157
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:28,005
Unfortunately,

158
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:29,764
Sun Jing rebelled

159
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:31,644
and wiped out almost

160
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:33,844
all of the descendants of the Li family.

161
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:40,964
Lord Qin is here.

162
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:46,045
Ying,

163
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:47,524
I have a favour

164
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:48,524
to ask of you.

165
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:49,724
What's it?

166
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,720
The former crown princess, Consort Xiao,

167
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:53,445
endured much humiliation

168
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,164
in order to poison Sun Jing,

169
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,844
and she herself was severely poisoned.

170
00:07:57,764 --> 00:07:59,125
Now her life is at stake.

171
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,324
I'd like to ask Taozi to cure her.

172
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,910
As men and women should remain distance,

173
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:04,284
please take care of her for me.

174
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:10,445
So it was she who poisoned Sun Jing.

175
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:16,245
Don't worry.

176
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,480
I will definitely take care of the upright woman
as you have asked of me.

177
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,365
Here's the lip balm.

178
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:31,724
Her Highness said

179
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:33,804
that if the poison was put in the food,

180
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:36,725
Sun Jing would notice,

181
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:38,804
so she put it in the lip balm.

182
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:40,764
Her Highness also said

183
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:43,605
the poison has a sweet smell.

184
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,790
Only the fragrance
of the flowers in the lip balm

185
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:47,885
can mask its smell.

186
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:50,205
And there's only one chance.

187
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,284
When the day of
the city siege finally came,

188
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:55,284
she immediately
put the poison on her lips,

189
00:08:55,564 --> 00:08:58,564
not caring that it would also
penetrate her heart and veins.

190
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:00,644
Her Highness

191
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:04,564
was planning to die together
with Sun Jing.

192
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:39,352
(Luoyang)

193
00:09:56,404 --> 00:09:58,644
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

194
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:00,885
Rise.

195
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:02,425
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

196
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,764
Lord Qin sent his troops

197
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:06,284
out to escort me.

198
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:09,524
As the emperor,

199
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,684
I will return to Xichang

200
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:13,444
in grandeur

201
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:16,205
and be honored by all the officials.

202
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:19,125
Your Majesty,

203
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:21,644
I have something to tell you,

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,740
but I am not sure
if it is appropriate to say it.

205
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:25,205
There's nothing inappropriate.

206
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:25,845
Go ahead.

207
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,404
Now that Lord Qin has recovered Xichang.

208
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:30,924
He's made a great achievement.

209
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,404
I wonder how you intend

210
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:34,284
to reward him.

211
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:35,404
No.

212
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:38,325
He's my son.

213
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:39,885
No. Besides,

214
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:41,524
isn't it his duty

215
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:43,564
to share my concerns?

216
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,284
What's the point of rewarding him?

217
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:48,325
Your Majesty,
you've granted Li Ni the title of Lord Qin.

218
00:10:48,644 --> 00:10:50,085
Of all the princes,

219
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:51,524
Lord Qin's title

220
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:53,125
is the most prestigious.

221
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:55,325
If there's any further reward,

222
00:10:55,644 --> 00:10:57,885
Li Ni can only be made the crown prince.

223
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:02,284
You mean to make him the crown prince?

224
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:05,524
He's not even the first in line
for the throne.

225
00:11:05,924 --> 00:11:07,044
Just tell me

226
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:08,845
why he should be the crown prince.

227
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,605
Your Majesty, if you

228
00:11:12,725 --> 00:11:14,444
don't want to make
Li Ni the crown prince

229
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:16,444
and he's made a great achievement,

230
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:18,125
without a reward,

231
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,284
I'm afraid that someone
with ulterior motives

232
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,250
will instigate the army.

233
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:22,965
It would be terrible

234
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:24,164
if there's a mutiny.

235
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:28,044
Well, mutiny?

236
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:29,845
Well...

237
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:30,764
This...

238
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,885
Your Majesty, don't panic.

239
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:33,564
When you return to the palace,

240
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,005
you can open the imperial treasury.

241
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:36,845
It's said that Sun Jing left in a hurry

242
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:39,764
and didn't take the valuables
in the treasury with him.

243
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:41,885
Treasury?

244
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:43,564
Yes, Your Majesty.

245
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:45,965
You may open the imperial treasury

246
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:46,725
to reward

247
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:48,605
the soldiers who recovered Xichang.

248
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:51,885
The soldiers will be grateful
for Your Majesty's grace.

249
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,325
Even if they are incited,

250
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:55,485
they won't cause any trouble.

251
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:59,564
What a good idea.

252
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:02,365
When I return to Xichang,

253
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,524
I'll open the imperial treasury

254
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:06,365
to reward the army.

255
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:11,919
For your great achievements

256
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,720
and for the grace to be shown
to all generations,

257
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:16,644
long live Your Majesty!

258
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:17,164
(Chaoqian Hall)

259
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:19,519
(Chaoqian Hall)
For your great achievements

260
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,280
and for the grace to be shown
to all generations,

261
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,524
long live Your Majesty!

262
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:24,325
Your Highness.

263
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,684
Your Highness, you're awake.

264
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,400
Your Highness, you're finally awake.

265
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:29,260
I'm glad you're awake.

266
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:31,005
It means the poison
is cleared up a bit.

267
00:12:31,804 --> 00:12:37,284
Long live Your Majesty!

268
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:45,684
What's...

269
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,284
What's that noise out there?

270
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:49,605
Your Highness,

271
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:51,804
you've been unconscious for days.

272
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:53,524
Lord Qin

273
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:55,684
has led Zhenxi Army to recover Xichang

274
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,660
and escorted His Majesty
back to the Palace.

275
00:12:57,885 --> 00:13:01,125
Today, His Majesty is receiving congratulatory
greetings from all the officials.

276
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:02,644
The noise outside

277
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:05,725
is the sound of the army
thanking His Majesty.

278
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:08,524
We...

279
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,605
We won.

280
00:13:11,845 --> 00:13:13,284
Your Highness, be careful.

281
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:14,444
We...

282
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,245
We won.

283
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:20,085
We won.

284
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:22,125
Your Highness, don't worry.

285
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:25,005
We won.

286
00:13:37,564 --> 00:13:40,965
Who are these two girls?

287
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:42,485
Your Highness,

288
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:45,005
she's Lieutenant He of the Cui Army.

289
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:47,005
She was sent by Lord Qin

290
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:48,684
to take care of you.

291
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:50,485
Thanks to Lieutenant He

292
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:51,725
who brought Miss Taozi

293
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:53,365
to prepare the medicine every day,

294
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:56,444
your poison is finally cleared.

295
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:08,044
Thank you, Lieutenant He.

296
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:12,005
Your righteousness

297
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,090
has saved the people, Your Highness.

298
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:16,444
I should thank you

299
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:18,164
on behalf of them.

300
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:20,965
I don't deserve your thanks.

301
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,444
This is a nice chamber.

302
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:40,605
It's just that these curtains
are a bit old.

303
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,245
Replace them with new ones.

304
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:42,965
Yes.

305
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:58,924
Greetings, Your Majesty.

306
00:14:59,245 --> 00:14:59,965
Rise.

307
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:02,965
You're just in time.

308
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:04,965
You've made a great contribution

309
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:06,965
to the recovery of Xichang.

310
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:08,164
Tell me,

311
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,764
what reward do you want?

312
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:12,325
Money or a fiefdom?

313
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:13,365
Your Majesty,

314
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:15,404
I don't want any reward.

315
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,340
I want to ask for a permission.

316
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:19,644
Please grant me permission to bring back

317
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:20,845
the great imperial grandson

318
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:22,205
after he is found by my men.

319
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:23,725
Great imperial grandson?

320
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:25,564
Sun Jing killed the late emperor

321
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,564
and the late crown prince
during the rebellion.

322
00:15:28,005 --> 00:15:29,684
Luckily, General Yunchang, Han Chang

323
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,360
escorted the great imperial grandson
to escape.

324
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:32,444
Your Majesty,

325
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,000
the great imperial grandson

326
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:35,845
is a direct descendant
of the late emperor.

327
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,360
Please grant me
to bring back the great imperial grandson

328
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:39,764
and make him the crown prince.

329
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:43,485
I'll have to consider

330
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:45,845
such a big matter.

331
00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:46,444
Your Majesty,

332
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,164
as the late emperor
and the late crown prince passed away,

333
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:52,404
the great imperial grandson
should succeed the throne.

334
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:55,164
As I said,

335
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:57,404
I have to consider it.

336
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:03,845
You may go back now.

337
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:06,044
You've been busy.

338
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:07,764
Go home and get some rest.

339
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,300
You shouldn't enter the palace

340
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:10,885
if there's nothing urgent.

341
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:16,365
Yes.

342
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:27,005
Your Highness,

343
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:29,404
please have more.

344
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:36,605
Jin'niang,

345
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:41,965
is Sun Jing still alive?

346
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:53,740
Your Highness.

347
00:16:57,605 --> 00:16:58,044
Yes.

348
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:01,524
I'm supposed

349
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,325
to be worried

350
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:08,125
because the threat

351
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,484
is still present.

352
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:14,525
But when I think of

353
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:18,285
the moment he rushed to the palace

354
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,605
covered in blood and held my hand,

355
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:26,004
what were I thinking?

356
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:31,004
I am the former crown princess.

357
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:34,004
Your Highness.

358
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:36,924
During my time in Eastern Palace,

359
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:40,484
I was alive

360
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,724
but only a shell.

361
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:48,805
Only when I was with him

362
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:51,525
did I feel like

363
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:53,805
I was a human being.

364
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,365
But I'm the former crown princess.

365
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:03,365
I shouldn't have fallen for him.

366
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:05,444
Your Highness.

367
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:08,404
I know.

368
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:12,164
I won't say it again.

369
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:15,964
No one will ever know

370
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:20,204
what happened between me and him.

371
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:24,805
No one will ever know

372
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:26,004
that at this moment

373
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:31,924
I'm still in love with him.

374
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,540
Your Highness.

375
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:47,244
Your Highness.

376
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,204
I had a fake bond

377
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,684
with Sun Jing.

378
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:08,644
My reputation is ruined.

379
00:19:11,204 --> 00:19:13,285
I deserve nothing more than to die.

380
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:15,004
Your Highness,

381
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:18,125
don't say that.

382
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:24,164
Don't worry.

383
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:29,885
I won't die now.

384
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,444
I have to make sure my son

385
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:38,765
comes back safely.

386
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:42,924
I want to see him

387
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:46,244
grow up.

388
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:51,885
Only then

389
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:58,004
will I be able to face
the late crown prince

390
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:02,125
in afterworld.

391
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:07,805
Your Highness,

392
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:10,805
no.

393
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:14,507
(Lord Qin's Residence)

394
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:22,273
(Biography of Jiang Ziya)

395
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:45,805
You finally came to see me?

396
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:47,204
I thought you'd

397
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:48,724
forgotten about me.

398
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:50,964
Why are you so forgetful?

399
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:51,964
You told me

400
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,845
to take care of Consort Xiao.

401
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,565
Consort Xiao is finally

402
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:56,644
feeling better today.

403
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,164
She finished half a bowl of congee
and is able to speak.

404
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,365
That's why I had time
to come out to see you.

405
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,960
I came to see you as soon as
I got out of the palace,

406
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:04,239
even before going to see my father,

407
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,565
and you still don't appreciate it.

408
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:06,710
I'll get going then.

409
00:21:06,964 --> 00:21:07,964
I'm going out of the city

410
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:08,845
to meet my father.

411
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:11,885
I was just kidding.

412
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,325
How about this?

413
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,684
Stay with me for a while
and I'll go with you

414
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:16,885
to see Great General Cui.

415
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:17,525
Okay?

416
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:19,085
Aren't you afraid my father

417
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:21,565
will tie you up
and stuff you in a box again?

418
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:23,285
You'll save me anyway.

419
00:21:23,404 --> 00:21:24,644
I'm not so sure about that.

420
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,085
What's wrong with you?

421
00:21:28,404 --> 00:21:30,244
Is there something
you're not happy about?

422
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:31,964
Why else would you be

423
00:21:31,964 --> 00:21:33,125
lying here alone?

424
00:21:34,444 --> 00:21:35,365
No.

425
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:36,805
I was bored and read a book.

426
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:39,285
I was so bored that I almost fell asleep.

427
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:41,365
I've heard that His Majesty

428
00:21:41,484 --> 00:21:45,325
has opened the imperial treasury
to reward the army.

429
00:21:45,644 --> 00:21:46,484
Logically,

430
00:21:46,644 --> 00:21:47,805
with your great achievement,

431
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:48,924
your residence

432
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:50,565
should be crowded with people.

433
00:21:50,805 --> 00:21:52,444
Why is it so quiet?

434
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:55,285
I don't like those officials.

435
00:21:55,404 --> 00:21:56,244
Moreover,

436
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:57,404
I'm Lord Qin

437
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:58,845
and I'm leading Zhenxi Army.

438
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:01,045
It's not nice
to get in touch with officials.

439
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,684
Making friends with generals

440
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,320
is even more likely to arouse suspicion.

441
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:06,045
That's why I don't want

442
00:22:06,484 --> 00:22:07,684
any visitors.

443
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,004
All the officials

444
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:09,805
know how I am,

445
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,340
so they won't dare come to disturb me.

446
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:14,404
It's fine for others.

447
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:15,244
But shouldn't you

448
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:16,204
pay a visit to

449
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:17,045
Prime Minister Gu?

450
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:20,085
The day before yesterday,

451
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:21,644
Prime Minister Gu was reinstated

452
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:23,924
and granted a title by His Majesty.

453
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:26,085
But Prime Minister Gu
refused on his knees.

454
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:28,204
He's a man of great character.

455
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:29,724
He helped a lot

456
00:22:29,845 --> 00:22:31,285
in recovering Xichang.

457
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:33,684
So after the meeting that day,

458
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:35,125
I went to his residence

459
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:36,285
to thank him.

460
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:38,644
That's all you did?

461
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:41,565
Well,

462
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:44,404
he didn't even want
His Majesty's reward.

463
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:45,525
What else could I do?

464
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:49,724
Since you went to
Gu Residence,

465
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:52,724
didn't you meet Gu Wan'niang?

466
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:59,684
Why would I go to see Gu Wan'niang?

467
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:02,644
It's none of my business

468
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:04,365
why you're going to see her.

469
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:11,805
Ying, are you jealous?

470
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:13,325
No.

471
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,605
You're jealous.

472
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:15,805
No.

473
00:23:16,484 --> 00:23:18,565
I'm going out of the city
to see my father.

474
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,404
I'll stay with you
so you won't be worried.

475
00:23:22,845 --> 00:23:24,365
No.

476
00:23:24,484 --> 00:23:25,404
Don't be jealous.

477
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,660
Mister and miss, please have a look
and take your pick.

478
00:23:35,684 --> 00:23:37,285
Our nuts

479
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:38,684
are nice and crispy,

480
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,805
and they're all very tasty.

481
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:41,125
I'm sure you'll like them.

482
00:23:41,484 --> 00:23:42,885
(Wolong)
I'll have one of each.

483
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:44,724
Mister, please wait a minute.

484
00:23:45,285 --> 00:23:46,644
You said in your letter

485
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,790
that you'd bring me
to this dried fruit and nut shop

486
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:49,720
when we get to the capital.

487
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:50,805
Today,

488
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:52,525
you've fulfilled your promise.

489
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,484
I've bought enough for you

490
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:55,924
to eat for a while.

491
00:23:57,404 --> 00:23:58,484
Why do you sound

492
00:23:58,484 --> 00:23:59,765
so reluctant?

493
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:02,565
It's not that I'm reluctant,

494
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:04,484
I just think I don't know

495
00:24:04,805 --> 00:24:05,845
when I'll see you again

496
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:07,605
after today.

497
00:24:09,444 --> 00:24:10,325
I'm surprised

498
00:24:10,484 --> 00:24:11,924
you're suddenly

499
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,765
acting like a child.

500
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:17,125
At first, I wanted to buy less

501
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,125
so you'd think of me

502
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,325
every time you finish them.

503
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:21,004
But then I thought

504
00:24:21,444 --> 00:24:22,565
I'd buy more

505
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:24,644
so you'd think of me
when you eat them.

506
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:25,244
That's better.

507
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,605
Who would think of you
when they eat dried fruits and nuts?

508
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:28,964
Me.

509
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:31,525
I think of you when I eat them.

510
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:33,045
After all,

511
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:34,565
I like

512
00:24:35,244 --> 00:24:36,404
what you like.

513
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:42,404
(Wolong)
Mister, here you go.

514
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:42,924
Thank you.

515
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:46,924
Let's go.

516
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:56,045
You are getting better.

517
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:57,605
You're walking more steadily.

518
00:24:57,845 --> 00:25:00,285
Miss Taozi said
that with the right treatment,

519
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:02,125
you'll be fine soon.

520
00:25:04,765 --> 00:25:07,204
Lieutenant He has arrived.

521
00:25:13,484 --> 00:25:14,125
Your Highness.

522
00:25:17,164 --> 00:25:18,325
Are you

523
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,045
feeling better today?

524
00:25:21,325 --> 00:25:22,365
Yes.

525
00:25:24,045 --> 00:25:25,244
Come and have a seat.

526
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,924
Thank you, Your Highness.

527
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:35,644
You look

528
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:36,644
much better.

529
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,565
Taozi told me

530
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:39,924
that after the poison is removed,

531
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:41,325
you will be very weak

532
00:25:41,845 --> 00:25:43,365
and will need some snow ginseng

533
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:44,365
to replenish your body.

534
00:25:44,964 --> 00:25:46,085
I told Lord Qin about it.

535
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:48,484
So Lord Qin chose some good snow ginseng

536
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,085
and asked me to bring it to the palace
to give it to you.

537
00:25:53,444 --> 00:25:54,924
Please thank Lord Qin for me.

538
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:56,565
Don't mention it.

539
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:05,444
The other day,

540
00:26:05,644 --> 00:26:06,924
I heard you say

541
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,964
you're a member of the Cui Army

542
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:11,565
and were asked by Lord Qin

543
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:14,085
to look after me in the palace.

544
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:19,045
Thank you for your hard work.

545
00:26:19,964 --> 00:26:20,644
No.

546
00:26:21,085 --> 00:26:22,285
Don't mention it.

547
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,660
They say I've been looking after you,

548
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,204
but it's all been handled by Jin'niang
and the servants.

549
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:27,605
I'm just here

550
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:29,525
to talk to you.

551
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:35,325
You're

552
00:26:35,684 --> 00:26:37,565
Lord Qin's beloved, aren't you?

553
00:26:46,684 --> 00:26:48,565
I've never met Lord Qin,

554
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:51,125
but I wrote to him when I was in

555
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:53,004
the worst of times.

556
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:55,525
There are details of his character

557
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:57,285
that give me a glimpse

558
00:26:57,404 --> 00:26:58,724
of what he is like.

559
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:01,964
I know he has no women in his residence,

560
00:27:02,444 --> 00:27:04,365
so you must be his beloved

561
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:06,204
to make him feel at ease

562
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:08,365
in entrusting me to you.

563
00:27:11,724 --> 00:27:13,484
You're really perceptive.

564
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:21,684
I am a woman

565
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:24,365
who has lost my honor.

566
00:27:25,565 --> 00:27:26,765
My only way

567
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:29,085
to end this life is to die.

568
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:32,644
Lord Qin promised

569
00:27:33,684 --> 00:27:35,765
to help me find my son.

570
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:38,605
I know Lord Qin

571
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:41,845
is a man who keeps his promises.

572
00:27:44,004 --> 00:27:46,045
I'm the former crown princess.

573
00:27:46,805 --> 00:27:48,125
My presence in the palace

574
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:49,244
is awkward

575
00:27:49,404 --> 00:27:50,724
and inappropriate.

576
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,085
I'd like to leave the palace

577
00:27:55,805 --> 00:27:57,605
and live in

578
00:27:58,204 --> 00:27:59,924
a quiet place.

579
00:28:00,724 --> 00:28:03,085
Please tell Lord Qin

580
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:05,085
to fulfill my wish.

581
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,605
Your Highness, don't worry.

582
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,280
Lord Qin will certainly agree
to make arrangements for you.

583
00:28:20,085 --> 00:28:21,605
Is your surname really He?

584
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:44,325
What a beautiful flower arrangement.

585
00:28:45,004 --> 00:28:46,164
So you have a talent

586
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,724
for flower arranging.

587
00:28:54,805 --> 00:28:56,404
Lord Qin came the day before yesterday.

588
00:28:56,765 --> 00:28:57,924
I was thinking of

589
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,684
asking you out to meet him,

590
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,285
but then I changed

591
00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:02,484
my mind.

592
00:29:03,004 --> 00:29:04,164
It's not a good time.

593
00:29:04,684 --> 00:29:06,444
There'll be plenty of chances later.

594
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:08,845
Yes.

595
00:29:12,404 --> 00:29:14,004
His Majesty rewarded the army

596
00:29:14,164 --> 00:29:15,525
when he returned to the capital,

597
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:17,724
but he didn't reward

598
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:19,605
Lord Qin at all.

599
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:20,525
I think

600
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:21,684
there must be

601
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:23,525
some villain around His Majesty.

602
00:29:23,924 --> 00:29:24,805
His Majesty probably

603
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:27,765
believes in slanders.

604
00:29:28,845 --> 00:29:30,684
That's how the world works.

605
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,404
If one's achievements exceed
the emperor's, no reward follows.

606
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:34,805
I guess

607
00:29:34,964 --> 00:29:37,125
this is His Majesty's difficulty.

608
00:29:39,565 --> 00:29:40,765
Indeed.

609
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:42,525
Lord Qin

610
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:43,525
is the most honorable

611
00:29:43,525 --> 00:29:44,724
of all the princes.

612
00:29:45,164 --> 00:29:46,085
But

613
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:47,885
he's not even rewarded

614
00:29:48,004 --> 00:29:49,325
for his great achievement

615
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:51,244
in recovering the two capitals

616
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:53,045
and restoring the Dayu Dynasty.

617
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:54,885
It's not fair.

618
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:59,325
You are thinking...

619
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:02,444
His Majesty is in the prime of his life.

620
00:30:02,644 --> 00:30:03,644
Now,

621
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:05,444
he has no intention
of crowning a prince.

622
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:06,684
Otherwise,

623
00:30:06,845 --> 00:30:09,204
if he did, he should crown Lord Qin.

624
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:12,365
But Lord Xin is the eldest,

625
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:15,325
and Lord Qi has been His Majesty's
favourite since he was young.

626
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,924
His Majesty has not appointed an empress

627
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,565
since he ascended the throne.

628
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:22,924
The empress' son

629
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:24,365
is the eldest son.

630
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:26,525
I intend

631
00:30:26,684 --> 00:30:27,885
to ask His Majesty

632
00:30:28,045 --> 00:30:29,244
to grant the title of Empress

633
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:31,285
to Lord Qin's birth mother tomorrow.

634
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,164
Lord Qin has made
such a great contribution

635
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:36,365
that his birth mother
should be titled Empress posthumously.

636
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:39,484
I heard

637
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:42,244
that Lord Qin's birth mother
was from a humble background.

638
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,404
No matter if she was from
a humble background or not,

639
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:46,805
if she could give birth to a son

640
00:30:46,964 --> 00:30:48,325
as outstanding as Lord Qin,

641
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:52,004
shouldn't his birth mother
be titled Empress posthumously?

642
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,520
(Chaoqian Hall)

643
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:59,045
(Chaoqian Hall)
I've made up my mind.

644
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:02,244
Lord Xin and Lord Qi's
birth mother, Dong,

645
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:05,004
is posthumously titled
Empress Zhaocheng.

646
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,845
Lord Qin's birth mother, Liu,

647
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:13,045
is posthumously titled
Lady of Bright Deportment.

648
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:15,845
Well...

649
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:17,204
This is inappropriate.

650
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:22,244
Your Majesty,
I don't think that's appropriate.

651
00:31:24,444 --> 00:31:26,964
I second the proposal of General Pei.

652
00:31:27,204 --> 00:31:29,820
The posthumous title is granted
firstly by Your Majesty's grace,

653
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:31,845
and secondly for the sake of decency.

654
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:34,125
Lord Qin led his army from Laolan Pass

655
00:31:34,285 --> 00:31:35,285
to pacify the country

656
00:31:35,444 --> 00:31:36,644
and restore two capitals.

657
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:39,325
I fear it would be difficult
to show Your Majesty's grace

658
00:31:39,484 --> 00:31:43,204
if his birth mother were to be only titled
Lady of Bright Deportment.

659
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:44,644
Your Majesty,

660
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:45,805
I think

661
00:31:46,045 --> 00:31:47,885
Lord Qin's birth mother's Liu,

662
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:50,244
should be posthumously
titled as Empress.

663
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:52,724
I second the proposal.

664
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:54,565
I agree.

665
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:56,285
- I agree.
- I agree.

666
00:31:56,444 --> 00:31:58,045
All of you

667
00:31:58,204 --> 00:32:01,820
say that Lord Qin has made great achievements
in recovering the two capitals.

668
00:32:01,924 --> 00:32:03,004
What about Dongdu?

669
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,780
Your Majesty, please calm down.

670
00:32:06,845 --> 00:32:08,765
It's all because of my incompetence.

671
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:09,845
Shut up.

672
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:13,125
Liu comes from a humble background.

673
00:32:13,525 --> 00:32:14,285
Does she

674
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:16,285
have to be titled Empress

675
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:19,484
just because
she's Lord Qin's birth mother?

676
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:26,724
Your Majesty,

677
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:29,204
since my mother's humble origins

678
00:32:30,045 --> 00:32:31,004
have displeased you,

679
00:32:31,404 --> 00:32:33,964
I request to be stripped of my title

680
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,244
and sent to the border at Laolan Pass.

681
00:32:37,404 --> 00:32:37,885
Well...

682
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:47,085
You...

683
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:49,325
Your Majesty, please calm down.

684
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:51,444
It's normal for Lord Qin, as a son,

685
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:53,404
to be grateful to his mother

686
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:54,765
for his birth.

687
00:32:54,924 --> 00:32:57,444
Please forgive Lord Qin, Your Majesty.

688
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:02,004
Get out. Get out now.

689
00:33:02,484 --> 00:33:03,605
I don't want to

690
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:04,924
see you again!

691
00:33:07,164 --> 00:33:08,004
Get lost!

692
00:33:24,765 --> 00:33:26,644
He has no respect for me as his father!

693
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:29,004
He has no respect for me as his father!

694
00:33:44,552 --> 00:33:46,192
(Splendid virtue)

695
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:47,525
By His Majesty's decree,

696
00:33:47,845 --> 00:33:49,964
Lord Qin has defied his father

697
00:33:50,164 --> 00:33:51,204
by speaking out of turn,

698
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,684
and ranting in the court,

699
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:54,004
and is hereby ordered

700

to be removed
from the position of commander-in-chief,

701
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,164
to be confined to his residence
to reflect upon his mistakes.

702
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,924
Without an order,

703
00:34:01,085 --> 00:34:02,684
he is not to leave his residence,

704
00:34:02,845 --> 00:34:04,484
he is not to be involved
in the military,

705
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,380
and he is not to discuss
the political affairs.

706
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:07,885
That's it.

707
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:11,964

708
00:34:12,444 --> 00:34:14,044

892

to discuss with the Cui family

909
00:44:20,484 --> 00:44:21,404

910
00:44:21,484 --> 00:44:22,845

911
00:44:23,685 --> 00:44:24,365
Neither.

912
00:44:24,685 --> 00:44:25,604
It's a personal matter.

913
00:44:27,285 --> 00:44:28,845
You've got a big residence here.

914
00:44:28,964 --> 00:44:30,604

915

916
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:34,524

to deliver a letter.

920
00:44:38,964 --> 00:44:40,845
to take attendance
at my residence every day.

921

No matter how skilled Ear is,

922
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,124
he can't get back and forth in a day.

923
00:44:46,404 --> 00:44:47,564
Shiqi,

924
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,845

925
00:44:48,845 --> 00:44:49,645
The Cui family...

926
00:44:49,725 --> 00:44:51,604

927
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,300

928
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:01,285

00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:21,084
Even though all the bad guys

939
00:45:21,205 --> 00:45:22,285
are dead,

940
00:45:22,404 --> 00:45:23,444
Lord Qin

941
00:45:23,564 --> 00:45:24,604
will still be fine.

942
00:45:25,484 --> 00:45:26,964
His Highness risked his life

943
00:45:27,285 --> 00:45:28,524
several times to save you

944
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:30,205
and you don't even care.

945
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:31,325
It seems

946
00:45:31,885 --> 00:45:33,805
you have a heart of stone.

947
00:45:36,685 --> 00:45:38,365
Lord Qin has achieved great feats.

948
00:45:39,044 --> 00:45:41,084
If he's still in the court,

949
00:45:41,245 --> 00:45:42,484
will His Majesty reward him?

950
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:44,564
If His Majesty won't reward him,

951
00:45:44,685 --> 00:45:46,325
will his two brothers

952
00:45:46,564 --> 00:45:47,924
and the officials

953
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:49,924
be wary of him?

954
00:45:50,484 --> 00:45:52,165
Lord Qin is confined to his home.

955
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,810
On the surface, it looks like
he's lost all his military power.

956
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,165
But in reality,

957
00:45:56,885 --> 00:45:58,805
has he really lost Zhenxi Army?

958
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,010
General Pei Yuan, you're also a general
who leads troops in a war.

959
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:03,484
Regarding when to charge

960
00:46:03,604 --> 00:46:05,165
and when to rest,

961
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:07,084
they work the same way.

962
00:46:10,205 --> 00:46:10,885
It's late now.

963
00:46:11,004 --> 00:46:12,725
It's not appropriate for you

964
00:46:12,805 --> 00:46:14,124
to stay in our camp.

965
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,444
I won't see you off then.

966
00:46:18,004 --> 00:46:18,845
Goodbye.

967
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:30,604
It's not Ear who delivered the letter.

968
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,404
Someone's very upset
right now, isn't she?

969
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,881
No. I am not.

970
00:46:36,245 --> 00:46:36,924
No.

971
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,444
You must be hungry now.

972
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:42,444
Have a bite of the pastries
that have just

973
00:46:42,564 --> 00:46:43,205
been delivered.

974
00:46:44,725 --> 00:46:45,645
You're the best.

975
00:46:45,765 --> 00:46:46,924
I'm really hungry.

976
00:46:46,924 --> 00:46:48,005
(Tang Confectionery)
Just dig in.

977
00:46:54,404 --> 00:46:55,004
Lieutenant He,

978
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,610
this pastry is not too sweet
and not too greasy,

979
00:46:56,645 --> 00:46:57,604
it's really good.

980
00:47:03,165 --> 00:47:04,044
Are you really

981
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:05,645
not going to read the letter?

982
00:47:07,564 --> 00:47:08,564
Why don't you read it?

983
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,044
Why is this a blank sheet?

984
00:47:26,964 --> 00:47:27,604
Lieutenant He,

985
00:47:27,924 --> 00:47:29,524
you knew that, didn't you?

986
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:31,245
What does it mean?

987
00:47:32,805 --> 00:47:35,245
The fact that Li Ni sent
Pei Yuan to deliver the letter

988
00:47:36,245 --> 00:47:38,885
means that although he's been confined,

989
00:47:39,285 --> 00:47:40,725
he still has people at his disposal.

990
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,484
And Zhenxi Army

991
00:47:42,765 --> 00:47:44,444
is still under his command.

992
00:47:45,685 --> 00:47:47,044
Other things are not important,

993
00:47:47,524 --> 00:47:48,924
why bother to write more?

994
00:47:50,845 --> 00:47:52,564
Aren't you two smart people

995
00:47:52,725 --> 00:47:55,325
tired of going back and forth

996
00:47:55,685 --> 00:47:56,924
like this?

997
00:47:57,044 --> 00:47:58,044
Yeah.

998
00:47:58,165 --> 00:47:59,645
Not as much as someone

999
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:01,004
blowing a whistle

1000
00:48:01,084 --> 00:48:01,924
and Ear

1001
00:48:02,044 --> 00:48:04,004
