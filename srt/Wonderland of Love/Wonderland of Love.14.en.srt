29
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,549
You have high moral integrity

30
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,620
and an indomitable spirit.

31
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:02,152
I admire you very much.

32
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,911
I'm honored to be able to see you today.

33
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,830
Mister Shiqi, you're
too courteous here.

34
00:02:06,032 --> 00:02:07,991
I've long heard of your talents

35
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:10,231
from the military since long ago.

36
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,231
Now that I've met you,

37
00:02:11,552 --> 00:02:12,911
the rumors were definitely true.

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,980
Mister Shiqi, I wonder
why you risked your life

39
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:16,511
to enter the capital?

40
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,750
Sun Jing overthrew the nation
and disrupted the order of the court.

41
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:21,112
He led to
the people's suffering.

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,690
Prime Minister Gu, today I see you,

43
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,869
I hope that you can contact the loyal

44
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,490
old subordinates and noble families

45
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,112
and launch an attack
with the Zhenxi Army

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,520
so that we could take back Xichang.

47
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:39,471
Sun Jing is paranoid.

48
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:42,432
Ever since the fall
of Luoyang's Duke Zheng,

49
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,110
he has kept a close eye on
the old subordinates and noble families

50
00:02:45,152 --> 00:02:46,631
in the court.

51
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:47,791
To be honest,

52
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:48,631
if it weren't for

53
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,312
your elaborate arrangements,

54
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:53,631
it would've been difficult
for us to meet today.

55
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,751
Mister, are you here to buy fabric?

56
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:01,712
Mister,

57
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:02,832
take a look at our fabric.

58
00:03:03,231 --> 00:03:05,231
Mister, are you buying it for yourself?

59
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,951
Or are you buying it for your relatives?

60
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:07,471
Mister?

61
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:09,110
I'm just taking a look.

62
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:10,351
Mister,

63
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:12,152
you can check out this batch.

64
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:13,592
It's quite popular this year.

65
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:14,032
Mister.

66
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,152
I'm just taking a look.

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,810
Attacking the city is a military feat.

68
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:19,032
As long as the old subordinates and noble families

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,790
side with us and assist us in secret.

70
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,110
Then, the army will take a long time
to enter the city.

71
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,710
If there's no one to receive us
inside the city,

72
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,910
I'm afraid it'll be chaotic
when the army enters the city.

73
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,010
So we need to depend on
the noble families to keep an eye

74
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,730
on the important neighborhoods
and offices.

75
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:33,791
Or, we'll lose the people's support
if the livelihood is destroyed.

76
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:36,112
Naturally. This can be planned

77
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:37,631
in secret.

78
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:40,511
The city's granaries, oil mills, wells,

79
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:42,231
irrigation canals and so on

80
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,552
are located in the neighborhood.

81
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,671
All noble families

82
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:46,032
have their private armies.

83
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:46,992
By then,

84
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:49,191
they'll definitely protect
these checkpoints.

85
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,900
Thank you, Prime Minister Gu.

86
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,712
Mister Shiqi,

87
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,832
seems like you're confident

88
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:57,751
that you can storm the city.

89
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:01,592
I do have a plan or two.

90
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:04,029
This is confidential.

91
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,150
The more people know about this,

92
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:06,229
the riskier it'll get.

93
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,110
Mister Shiqi,
you don't need to tell me about it.

94
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:08,992
By then,

95
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:09,911
I'll follow

96
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:11,071
your arrangements

97
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:11,791
and accomplish

98
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,671
the task you gave me.

99
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,552
If you're not buying anything,

100
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,990
you shouldn't bother other customers.

101
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:17,671
Don't you agree?

102
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,152
Get lost!

103
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,351
Where did this guy come from?

104
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:32,712
This does look good on me.

105
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:33,592
Father.

106
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:35,272
What are you doing?

107
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:36,752
Sorry about that, dear guests.

108
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:37,349
This weirdo

109
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,752
just barged inside all of a sudden.

110
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:39,832
Leave!

111
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:50,111
Our encounter with Prime Minister Gu

112
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:51,632
was a narrow escape.

113
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:53,752
It's all thanks to your plan.

114
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:55,832
Shiqi, you're actually thanking me.

115
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:57,311
My trip wasn't in vain indeed.

116
00:04:57,712 --> 00:04:59,712
Refreshing vine tea is available here!

117
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,111
Mister and Miss,
would you like some?

118
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,311
Do you still remember
the day we had tea and made food

119
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:05,712
under the straw hut?

120
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:07,431
Of course I do.

121
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:08,431
This time,

122
00:05:08,592 --> 00:05:09,832
if we can take back Xichang

123
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:11,311
and eliminate Sun Jing,

124
00:05:12,072 --> 00:05:12,871
by then,

125
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:14,832
we can travel the Wonderland
on horseback.

126
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,791
Your Highness, by then, I'm just afraid

127
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:19,911
that you might be too busy
with official affairs

128
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:21,152
that you forgot about

129
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:22,032
your promise

130
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,752
to bring me around.

131
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,789
That will never happen.

132
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,750
No matter how busy or tired,

133
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:26,832
I will never forget you

134
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:27,871
or my promise

135
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:29,671
to bring you to the Wonderland.

136
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:38,032
The son of the heavens
has ascended the throne!

137
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:40,272
The son of the heavens
has ascended the throne!

138
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:42,632
The son of the heavens
has ascended the throne!

139
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,311
The son of the heavens
has ascended the throne!

140
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:15,431
This proclamation is well-written,

141
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:18,832
especially the part
where it criticized me.

142
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:22,712
Sun Jing must die
for the innocent to be saved, huh?

143
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,780
Grand Governor, please spare me.

144
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:27,911
Why should I?

145
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,231
This is good.

146
00:06:33,832 --> 00:06:35,671
Although the palace
has a tight security,

147
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:39,192
they rescued the dead Lord Liang,
from the palace in secret.

148
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,632
After that, he was revived.

149
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,650
He ascended the throne in Dongdu
and made himself emperor too.

150
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:48,032
Our enemy actually
has such fearsome abilities

151
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:50,311
and resourcefulness.

152
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:51,592
I wonder

153
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:53,351
if I'll lose my head

154
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,471
when I sleep tonight?

155
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,450
Grand Governor, please forgive me!

156
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:04,351
There's no need to interrogate

157
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:05,911
the suspects.

158
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,911
Execute all of them.

159
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,551
As for all those stubborn old subordinates,

160
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,310
send our troops there
to escort them into the palace

161
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:16,952
so that they wouldn't stay restless.

162
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:17,911
Yes,

163
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:19,231
Grand Governor.

164
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,829
Should we shut all nine cities' gates

165
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,390
and forbid anyone
from entering or exiting

166
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,750
to search for the suspects?

167
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,911
Since they've sent their men to Xichang

168
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:28,791
to spread these proclamations around,

169
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:31,512
naturally, they wanted
to perturb the people.

170
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:34,752
We shouldn't fall for their trick.

171
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:37,752
Li Ni and his army are closing in.

172
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:39,351
Once we shut the city gates,

173
00:07:39,712 --> 00:07:41,231
the people will be restless.

174
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,952
It'll be detrimental to us.

175
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,351
Grand Governor, you're right.

176
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:48,231
However,

177
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:51,752
we should examine all those
who enter or exit the cities strictly.

178
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:53,871
Do a thorough search
in the cities as well.

179
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:55,551
You must capture the spies

180
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:57,911
who spread these proclamations around.

181
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:00,311
Chop off their heads

182
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,592
and send them to Luoyang

183
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:04,712
so that Lord Liang will be terrified.

184
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:09,032
Lord Liang is a timid man.

185
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:11,592
If he dies from shock,

186
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:13,351
it'll turn into

187
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:14,671
a huge joke.

188
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:16,072
Yes.

189
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:46,992
Such foolishness.

190
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:49,352
They're utterly foolish.

191
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,030
This isn't the right time
for Lord Linzi and Lord Kuaiji

192
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,071
to proclaim Lord Liang

193
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:55,311
as the emperor.

194
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,512
I thought they welcomed Father back

195
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,191
so that he could be relaxed.

196
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,170
They were just
trying to claim credit.

197
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,070
But I never expected

198
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:06,191
them to proclaim Father to be the emperor
in Luoyang.

199
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,671
They even announced it to the public.

200
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:09,352
Such foolishness.

201
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,632
Mister Shiqi,

202
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:15,831
we're in trouble.

203
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:19,152
Sun Jing's men are searching for those
who spread the proclamations.

204
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:20,232
And,

205
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:21,469
when I came back,

206
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,660
I heard the borough chiefs
sent a message to all shopkeepers

207
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:24,831
saying that all guests

208
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:26,352
have to be investigated thoroughly.

209
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,420
The shopkeepers' guarantee
was rendered invalid too.

210
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:30,911
Seems like

211
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,191
we can't stay here for long.

212
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:34,232
Although our fake profiles

213
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:35,551
are the same as the real ones,

214
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,071
the neighborhood in Xichang
is under tight security.

215
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:39,671
They can tell the difference

216
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:42,311
as long as they put in some effort.

217
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:47,510
We're in huge trouble.

218
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,951
I received news that the Imperial Army
has surrounded the Gu Residence.

219
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,810
I dare not follow them
all the way there.

220
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:55,311
Young Master.

221
00:09:58,112 --> 00:09:58,711
Young Master,

222
00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:01,510
luckily, the herbs delivered
by General Pei Yuan were very potent.

223
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,472
Judging from your pulse,

224
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:04,272
you're 80% healed.

225
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,032
We can act and rendezvous with our main army

226
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,311
once Lieutenant He is back.

227
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,831
Young Master.

228
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:11,951
What's the matter?

229
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:14,632
We received news from Luoyang.

230
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:15,671
Lord Linzi, Li Jun,

231
00:10:15,872 --> 00:10:16,831
and Lord Kuaiji, Li Lai,

232
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,010
proclaimed Lord Liang as the emperor
in Dongdu.

233
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:19,911
What?

234
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:21,632
Those fools.

235
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:23,352
They're too impatient.

236
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:24,551
Taozi,

237
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,910
I instructed Lieutenant He
to leave her marks behind

238
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:27,872
along the way

239
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:28,911
before she departed.

240
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:31,431
Enter the capital
and tell her to leave immediately.

241
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,831
I'm afraid Sun Jing will be enraged
after hearing this.

242
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,900
I'm afraid Lieutenant He
will be in danger

243
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:37,710
if they shut the city gates and search.

244
00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:39,431
Yes, Young Master.
I will go immediately.

245
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:40,911
Shu,

246
00:10:41,152 --> 00:10:42,591
contact our main army immediately.

247
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,549
Tell them to break camp
and head southward.

248
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,050
If Lieutenant He
is unable to leave,

249
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:48,032
I will do everything I can to save her.

250
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,071
Yes, Young Master.

251
00:10:56,152 --> 00:10:57,232
Let me go!

252
00:10:57,632 --> 00:10:58,711
Why are you capturing me?

253
00:10:59,191 --> 00:10:59,632
Let me go!

254
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:00,831
Let me go!

255
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,392
Let me go!

256
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:07,872
What gives?

257
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:09,431
What gives?

258
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,431
Let me go!

259
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:13,232
I'm not a crook!

260
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:14,392
What gives?

261
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,032
These two brothers of yours

262
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:17,352
are too impatient.

263
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:20,711
They're only good at foiling my plans.

264
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:27,911
Mister Shiqi, Miss Gu is here.

265
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:29,472
Have a seat.

266
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:33,970
Why did you put on a disguise and risked
your life to come at this hour?

267
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:35,431
About 17 PM,

268
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,010
members of the palace suddenly came
and said that Grand Governor

269
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,330
had summoned Father to the palace.

270
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,071
Although Father wasn't willing to go,

271
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,090
he was afraid that the others
would be implicated.

272
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:44,671
That's why he let them detain him.

273
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,551
I disguised myself
as a servant during the nighttime

274
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,632
and snuck out of the residence
to tip you guys off.

275
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,352
Miss Gu, it must've been tough.

276
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,330
I wonder how Prime Minister Gu
is doing right now?

277
00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:57,392
I have no idea either.

278
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:58,431
But back then,

279
00:11:58,431 --> 00:11:59,791
Sun Jing didn't kill my father.

280
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:01,992
I assume he won't kill him right away.

281
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,152
That's right.

282
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,920
Prime Minister Gu
has a great reputation.

283
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:06,911
Sun Jing doesn't dare
to kill him that easily.

284
00:12:07,232 --> 00:12:07,992
Miss Gu,

285
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,610
you shouldn't worry too much either.

286
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:12,469
You guys should leave.

287
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,210
They were searching and catching
potential suspects on my way here.

288
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:15,911
If...

289
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,311
His Highness, it'll be terrible

290
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:19,632
if they find you here.

291
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:21,872
The Gu Family owns several estates.

292
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,911
Your Highness, you can hide there
and lay low for now if it's necessary.

293
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:25,951
Don't worry.

294
00:12:26,232 --> 00:12:27,791
We have our own arrangements.

295
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:28,992
But you, Miss Gu,

296
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,551
you shouldn't take any risks
to come out for now.

297
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:32,911
Ear,

298
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:34,272
escort Miss Gu back.

299
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:34,911
Yes.

300
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:36,671
Miss Gu, please.

301
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:50,472
Search every house in the vicinity!

302
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:51,632
Show it to me.

303
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:52,431
Come on!

304
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:53,911
You! Stay there!

305
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,549
You, leave.

306
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,710
Stop right there. Are these yours?

307
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:56,210
What's inside?

308
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,060
What's inside your shirt?

309
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:07,790
They're already searching
this early in the morning?

310
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,071
I wonder if Xie Chang'er and Bao

311
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:10,232
could evade them?

312
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,112
Of course they can.

313
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:11,911
Besides,

314
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,951
they have Taozi's aid.

315
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,700
They'll be here
to rendezvous with us later.

316
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,392
Let me see

317
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:17,671
if this lady

318
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,791
possesses any suspicious items.

319
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:22,152
Young lady.

320
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,512
Mister.

321
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:32,831
How dare you try
to strip my clothes off?

322
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:35,311
I'll prick you with my beard!

323
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:36,610
Search every house in the vicinity!

324
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:37,152
Yes, sir!

325
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:38,671
Search this place!

326
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:39,831
Over there!

327
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:41,191
Over there!

328
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,520
- Let's go inside.
- Over here.

329
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:47,911
Check that place.

330
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,232
No one.

331
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,250
Over there.

332
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,472
Today, I'll show you

333
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:52,831
what I got!

334
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:54,272
Bao, get out of the way!

335
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:55,431
Get out of the way!

336
00:13:59,512 --> 00:13:59,831
Bao!

337
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:01,632
You guys deserved that!

338
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:06,191
Hurry!

339
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,632
Search the place!

340
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:08,392
Hurry!

341
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:08,951
Search!

342
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:10,010
You two, head over there!

343
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:10,872
Yes!

344
00:14:11,112 --> 00:14:11,911
Search upstairs!

345
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:12,632
Yes!

346
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:14,112
Let's go!

347
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,670
- Benefactor!
- Hurry!

348
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:19,272
Benefactor, it's you.

349
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:21,591
Benefactor?

350
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:27,472
Your Highness,

351
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,711
we received the latest news.

352
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,472
Grand Governor was enraged ever since
Lord Liang ascended the throne.

353
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,750
Not only did he increase the inspections
in the capital,

354
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:35,450
but he also detained
many old subordinates,

355
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:38,872
forbidding them to leave the palace
in fear of them colluding with Lord Liang.

356
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:43,551
Has the messenger we sent to General Han

357
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:44,512
returned yet?

358
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:46,352
He sent us a letter.

359
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:47,791
He said he had no news of

360
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:49,512
General Han yet.

361
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:50,431
However,

362
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:51,431
he saw the bodies of

363
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,590
General Han's bodyguards.

364
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,711
I assume General Han

365
00:14:53,711 --> 00:14:56,350
has temporarily escaped together
with the great imperial grandson.

366
00:15:01,711 --> 00:15:03,551
No news is a kind of good news too.

367
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:05,911
Since we can't locate them,

368
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:08,112
I'm sure no one else can locate them.

369
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:10,911
Your Highness,

370
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:12,872
the citizens in the capital
are panicking.

371
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,191
Li Ni and the Zhenxi Army have
entered Tong Pass.

372
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:18,831
I assume they'll surround Xichang
anytime soon.

373
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:20,992
Now, we're ordering the people

374
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,232
to stock up more food.

375
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,512
Sun Jing has already relayed
a secret order

376
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,110
to recall the army meant for
conquering Baiyue.

377
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:27,512
If his army does return,

378
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,350
Xichang is easy to defend
and hard to attack.

379
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:32,551
Li Ni might not be able to defeat him.

380
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:34,232
If so, should we...

381
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,752
This isn't our priority.

382
00:15:36,472 --> 00:15:37,551
Our current priority

383
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:39,392
is to locate General Han

384
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,112
and make sure the great imperial
grandson is safe.

385
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:44,152
Try to send a message to Li Ni.

386
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,472
I have important matters

387
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,272
to discuss with him.

388
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:04,551
General Han,

389
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:06,551
I would've been dead

390
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,110
if you didn't risk your life
to save me again.

391
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,152
Your Highness, this is unnecessary.

392
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:15,472
I was just fulfilling my duty.

393
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:18,112
Sun Jing's private cavalry team

394
00:16:18,272 --> 00:16:19,512
was hot on our tails.

395
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,071
Maybe it's because loyalist army
achieved flawless victory.

396
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:24,591
This might be Sun Jing's last attempt

397
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,472
at struggling.

398
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,431
We've been making hasty retreats

399
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:39,551
for the past few days.

400
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:40,992
I wonder if Shiqi

401
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:42,632
has deployed his troops to Xichang

402
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,900
after restoring the eastern capital
to its former glory?

403
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:49,191
We'll know

404
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:51,311
what's going on out there

405
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,831
after shaking off the cavalry team.

406
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:58,551
Benefactors,

407
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,831
I inquired about the situation

408
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:01,791
using grocery shopping as my excuse.

409
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:03,232
Every shop

410
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:04,712
and inn out there

411
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:06,912
is searching for foreigners.

412
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:08,912
They were interrogated

413
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,880
even if they were affiliated
with the government.

414
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:12,151
Benefactors,

415
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,672
you guys may rest here in peace

416
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:15,272
for a few days.

417
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:17,032
If someone finds out,

418
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:19,712
I have my own way of covering it up.

419
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:22,472
Madam Yang,

420
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:23,770
if we continue to stay here,

421
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:26,151
I'm afraid we'll implicate
you guys eventually.

422
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:28,311
We should scale the wall

423
00:17:28,752 --> 00:17:30,071
and escape during nighttime.

424
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:34,149
Taozi sent us a letter.

425
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,272
Tthe inspections were strict.

426
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,952
But luckily, she found Lieutenant He.

427
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:38,370
And, their current shelter

428
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,351
is safe for now.

429
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,952
However, they're searching
the neighborhood one by one

430
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:43,712
until they find the suspects.

431
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,111
I'm worried that they might be found out

432
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,151
if it goes on long enough.

433
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:47,749
However, Lieutenant He

434
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,910
can definitely think of a way
to escape from the city.

435
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:52,712
Can the hidden shops in the city help us

436
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,010
to contact members of the palace?

437
00:17:54,232 --> 00:17:54,712
Yes.

438
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,910
Let's wait for a little longer.

439
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,230
Until Lieutenant He leaves.

440
00:17:57,551 --> 00:17:57,912
Yes.

441
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:00,311
How's the preparation for our army?

442
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:01,992
They'll reach Tong Pass soon.

443
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,712
All right.

444
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:04,432
I'll visit Pei Yuan first.

445
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:07,111
I'll tell him that Li Ni
and Lieutenant He are in danger

446
00:18:07,272 --> 00:18:08,391
and that the Cui Army

447
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:09,631
can provide aid to them.

448
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:13,272
Tell General Pei Yuan to allow us
to station our troops at Tong Pass first.

449
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,810
Send a message to them.

450
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,591
Tell them to make preparations for it.

451
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:17,831
Yes.

452
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:24,149
I have an idea.

453
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,830
It'll ensure that Madam Yang
won't be implicated

454
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,192
even if our identities are exposed.

455
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:28,631
What idea?

456
00:18:29,712 --> 00:18:31,432
Madam Yang's daughter, Yang Qiniang,

457
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:33,391
is engaged to a person called Xu Sanlang.

458
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,110
But I've asked Yang Qiniang
about this before.

459
00:18:35,432 --> 00:18:36,432
No one in the vicinity

460
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:38,032
has seen Xu Sanlang around.

461
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:39,512
Qiniang,

462
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:42,952
did you guys go to visit your friends
and relatives in the countryside

463
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:45,432
after returning from the city?

464
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:47,351
If, by then,

465
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:49,311
we have the chance to make our escape,

466
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,591
I'm afraid you guys

467
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:51,992
have to lay low

468
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:53,192
in your friends' house

469
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,351
so that your neighbors
won't suspect you.

470
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:56,912
We actually visited

471
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:58,551
the house of our relative.

472
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:00,472
We visited the house of my fiance.

473
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:01,952
His name is Xu Sanlang.

474
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:03,391
We're engaged.

475
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:04,831
But unfortunately,

476
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,111
he went outside to sell fabrics.

477
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:07,309
If not,

478
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,110
my mother and I wouldn't
need to take the risk

479
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:10,232
and leave the city

480
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:11,591
in order to procure food.

481
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:13,591
I see.

482
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:15,032
Yang Qiniang told me

483
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,410
that her mother already prepared

484
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,250
her wedding gown and
dowries for her long ago.

485
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,110
They were just waiting for
Xu Sanlang to marry her.

486
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:22,391
I'm almost the same age as Yang Qiniang.

487
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:23,712
And, we have similar figures.

488
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:24,871
By then,

489
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:27,111
you can pretend to be Xu Sanlang
and come to marry me.

490
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,512
I'll put on the wedding gown

491
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:29,631
and wedding veil.

492
00:19:29,992 --> 00:19:30,712
By then,

493
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:32,591
people will think that I'm Yang Qiniang.

494
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,069
Once I enter the carriage,

495
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,110
we can leave the city without
concealing ourselves.

496
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,111
And, we have the wedding documents
as our guarantee.

497
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,110
The city guards won't make things
difficult for us.

498
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,710
This won't do.

499
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:42,192
If we do so,

500
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,410
not only will we put
Madam Yang in danger,

501
00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:46,791
but it'll also
affect Miss Yang's marriage.

502
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:49,952
Benefactor, you saved me and my daughter.

503
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:51,831
Please don't say that.

504
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,311
This is an excellent plan.

505
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:56,910
And, she's only getting married
under my daughter's name.

506
00:19:57,232 --> 00:19:58,712
There's no risk in that.

507
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,391
Once Sanlang is back,

508
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:02,391
I'll send my daughter to him in secret

509
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:03,831
and they can get married.

510
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,920
The grace of dripping water should be
reciprocated by a gushing spring.

511
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:08,032
Moreover,

512
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:10,071
Benefactor, you saved our lives.

513
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:11,752
I can only live in peace

514
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:14,591
when you're out of danger.

515
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:15,829
But Madam Yang...

516
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,110
Madam Yang, thank you for your help.

517
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,391
Shiqi, leaving the city as soon as possible

518
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:21,472
is the wiser option.

519
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:27,591
If so, Madam Yang, thank you for your help.

520
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,218
(Bliss)

521
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:40,551
Stop.

522
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,071
Mister.

523
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,232
I'm getting married today.

524
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,990
This is the official wedding document
produced by the village chief.

525
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:57,023
(Wedding document)

526
00:20:58,232 --> 00:21:00,192
Xu Sanlang of the Xu Family

527
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,472
is marrying Yang Qiniang
of the Yang Family, huh?

528
00:21:02,672 --> 00:21:02,952
Yes.

529
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,472
I'm marrying Yang Qiniang today.

530
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,430
These are He' wedding pastries
on the east street.

531
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:09,712
Please enjoy them.

532
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,913
(Bliss)

533
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,990
The He Family is known for
their wedding pastries.

534
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,472
I won't interrupt your wedding then.

535
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:21,351
Go now.

536
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,272
Thank you, Mister.

537
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:23,712
Let's go.

538
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:41,831
Your Highness,

539
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:43,510
although you took
another person's apparel,

540
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:44,672
you left your wedding suit

541
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,232
in his yard.

542
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:48,992
You bartered his apparel
with another suit.

543
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,229
You've improved a lot,

544
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,910
since you stole
people's items in the past.

545
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:55,432
That was an emergency.

546
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:57,351
Actually,

547
00:21:57,831 --> 00:21:58,192
I do like

548
00:21:58,272 --> 00:21:59,631
my wedding suit.

549
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,512
Lieutenant He!

550
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:03,432
Lieutenant He!

551
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:03,871
Taozi.

552
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:05,432
Young Master sent us a letter.

553
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:06,831
Sun Jing's men scattered

554
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:08,232
one of our platoons.

555
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,871
So, he hopes that we can head to Tong Pass

556
00:22:09,952 --> 00:22:10,992
as soon as possible.

557
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:14,591
Since that's the case,

558
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,151
let's rendezvous somewhere else.

559
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,192
Your Highness, are you
returning to Tong Pass?

560
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:21,110
Although it's not far away,

561
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:22,551
the terrain here is complicated.

562
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:23,752
Let me join you.

563
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:27,660
So, Your Highness, are you worried

564
00:22:27,672 --> 00:22:29,432
that I might bring harm to Tong Pass

565
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,111
after meeting up with the main army?

566
00:22:32,272 --> 00:22:32,791
Naturally.

567
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:35,232
You're devious and witty.

568
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:37,232
I have to keep an eye on you personally.

569
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:40,391
Let's go.

570
00:22:49,788 --> 00:22:52,195
(Punishment)

571
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:02,992
Young Master, Taozi just sent a letter.

572
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,390
Lieutenant He has left the city.

573
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:05,432
What about Li Ni?

574
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,110
Right now, he's still together
with Lieutenant He.

575
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:09,952
He'll arrive at Tong Pass soon.

576
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,151
Has our army settled down?

577
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:15,151
Yes, they've settled down at Tong Pass.

578
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:21,032
Come and look at my handwriting.

579
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:27,192
One should mete out punishment
to prevent further harm.

580
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:29,871
Your handwriting looks full

581
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:30,871
and spirited.

582
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,720
Young Master, seems like
you've fully recovered.

583
00:23:34,192 --> 00:23:36,391
My wounds are definitely healed.

584
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:39,551
Since that's the case,

585
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:42,712
we should look back at our past mistakes

586
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:44,232
and learn from them

587
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,720
so that we won't commit them again.

588
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:47,752
(Cui Lin)
so that we won't commit them again.

589
00:23:47,752 --> 00:23:50,200
(Cui Lin)

590
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,949
Cui Lin sent me a letter,

591
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,151
saying that he could launch
a two-pronged attack with me

592
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,551
to recover Tong Pass.

593
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:04,391
In exchange, I have to withdraw
my troops from Yingzhou.

594
00:24:06,151 --> 00:24:07,912
Cui Lin is Cui Yi's only son.

595
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,952
Cui Yi has exhibited how ambitious he is

596
00:24:10,512 --> 00:24:11,791
ever since leaving Yingzhou.

597
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,992
He intends to rule the world.

598
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,110
Cui Lin has stepped off on the wrong foot.

599
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,570
And, he's recuperating at Tong Pass.

600
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:18,071
His letter

601
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:19,831
does make sense.

602
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:25,752
Back then, the Three Heroes

603
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,752
consist of Pei Xian,

604
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:30,591
Cui Yi, and I.

605
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:32,232
After Cui Yi

606
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:33,831
lost his wife,

607
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:36,311
he participated in battles
like a crazy madman.

608
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,672
Under such circumstances,

609
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:39,351
I'm sure

610
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,032
he won't let this opportunity
go to waste.

611
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:42,311
However,

612
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:44,269
even if he intends to rule the world,

613
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,670
it also has to depend on
whether he's capable enough to do so.

614
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,111
Yingzhou, which is owned by
the Cui Family, is surrounded.

615
00:24:50,232 --> 00:24:51,869
And now, Cui Lin, his son,

616
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,310
is getting restless because of that.

617
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:55,432
Grand Governor,

618
00:24:56,111 --> 00:24:58,472
although Cui Lin has
a convincing excuse,

619
00:24:58,831 --> 00:24:59,551
he often

620
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:01,512
made contact with the Zhenxi Army.

621
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,490
Grand Governor, you need
to be on your toes.

622
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,111
This might be a trick.

623
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:09,912
This brat

624
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:11,831
thinks he can trick me.

625
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,032
He's way too young to do so.

626
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,992
Send Cui Lin a message.

627
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:19,791
Tell him that I can launch a two-pronged attack
together with him.

628
00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:21,551
However,

629
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:23,591
I will only recall

630
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,351
the army I've dispatched to Yingzhou

631
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:28,472
after I take over Tong Pass.

632
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:29,232
Yes.

633
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:41,752
Your Highness.

634
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,831
General Han.

635
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:47,831
Are you used to life around here?

636
00:25:48,232 --> 00:25:49,912
Huayang Town is peaceful and quiet.

637
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:50,831
However,

638
00:25:50,952 --> 00:25:52,551
this place is near Xichang.

639
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:53,752
Are you sure

640
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,272
we won't be in danger if we stay here?

641
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:59,351
I'm afraid no one could predict

642
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:01,672
that we would seek shelter in a town

643
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,272
this near to Xichang.

644
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:05,071
As the saying goes,

645
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,111
it is dark under the lamp.

646
00:26:06,551 --> 00:26:07,512
Moreover, Sun Jing

647
00:26:07,871 --> 00:26:09,391
is troubled by the Zhenxi Army lately.

648
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,272
He's in a state of
extreme stress right now.

649
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:14,272
We can stay here peacefully
for the time being.

650
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:16,232
General Han.

651
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,410
Your Highness, please
get straight to the point.

652
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,591
Will Sun Jing still try to hunt us down

653
00:26:21,712 --> 00:26:22,712
after Lord Liang

654
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,192
has ascended the throne?

655
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:33,871
I'm afraid he would spend
even more effort to do so.

656
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,710
Although Lord Liang
has ascended the throne,

657
00:26:36,952 --> 00:26:38,192
Your Highness,

658
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:40,351
you're the official ruler of the empire.

659
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:43,391
You're the only descendant
of the late crown prince.

660
00:26:44,232 --> 00:26:45,551
Sun Jing knows that too.

661
00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:47,952
If he can capture you alive,

662
00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:50,032
he can take command of the empire

663
00:26:50,831 --> 00:26:52,272
using you as his hostage.

664
00:26:52,992 --> 00:26:54,512
I don't really remember

665
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:55,591
what Lord Liang

666
00:26:55,672 --> 00:26:56,912
looks like now.

667
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,192
He didn't visit the palace often
before this.

668
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,871
Actually, Lord Liang
is no cause for concern.

669
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,910
Li Ni, Lord Liang's son,
is the one we should be wary of.

670
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,330
Now that Lord Liang
has ascended the throne,

671
00:27:08,512 --> 00:27:09,351
I'm afraid...

672
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:11,591
Will Shiqi really do that?

673
00:27:11,992 --> 00:27:12,831
Your Highness,

674
00:27:14,512 --> 00:27:16,391
you mustn't trust anyone easily.

675
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,111
Here you go.

676
00:27:35,952 --> 00:27:37,111
Where did you get them?

677
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:39,551
Lieutenant He gave it another name.

678
00:27:39,672 --> 00:27:40,272
Dried fruits.

679
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:40,992
Dried fruits?

680
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,712
I heard that it was difficult
to procure them.

681
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,512
I tried it, and I liked it.

682
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,029
Lieutenant He brought me more of them

683
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,310
when she knew that I liked them.

684
00:27:49,472 --> 00:27:51,111
Taozi, thank you so much.

685
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:52,631
I'm only able to...

686
00:27:52,752 --> 00:27:53,831
That's enough.

687
00:27:54,032 --> 00:27:55,111
I'm only able

688
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:55,631
to have

689
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:58,111
such delicious dried fruits
all thanks to Ear.

690
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:01,712
These dried fruits are pretty good.

691
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:03,871
What do you mean by that?

692
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:04,712
Isn't Taozi nice

693
00:28:04,752 --> 00:28:05,672
to everyone here?

694
00:28:08,192 --> 00:28:09,391
Haven't you noticed yet?

695
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:11,232
Taozi

696
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:13,032
is especially nice to you.

697
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:14,311
That's not it.

698
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:15,752
Taozi is nice to everyone.

699
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:20,111
Why is she leaving?

700
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:22,151
Hey, are you dumb?

701
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:23,032
Go after her!

702
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:24,071
- Hurry!
- But why?

703
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:25,432
If not,

704
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:27,311
she'll poison you in the future.

705
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,272
Come on.

706
00:28:28,432 --> 00:28:29,192
Just go already.

707
00:28:31,151 --> 00:28:31,752
Taozi.

708
00:28:33,272 --> 00:28:34,992
This time, we failed to conquer the city.

709
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,880
However, we alerted them
to our presence.

710
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,071
Seems like we need to come up
with another plan

711
00:28:39,472 --> 00:28:41,791
to take back Xichang.

712
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:47,151
What plans do you have

713
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:49,752
after taking back Xichang?

714
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:53,551
By then,

715
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,192
I'll stop participating in battles.

716
00:28:55,631 --> 00:28:58,551
I'll bring the great imperial grandson
back to the imperial court

717
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,791
and persuade my father

718
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,192
to elect him as the crown prince.

719
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,232
After that, I'll return to Laolan Pass.

720
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,472
What about you?

721
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,110
Will you return to Yingzhou?

722
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,512
Lord Liang has already
ascended the emperor's throne.

723
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,071
You're the emperor's son.

724
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,920
Are you going to return to Laolan Pass

725
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:17,952
instead of staying in the capital?

726
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:23,591
I like Laolan Pass

727
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,111
better than Xichang.

728
00:29:25,952 --> 00:29:26,672
If not,

729
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:29,752
I wouldn't have found an excuse
to make a mistake

730
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:32,311
and made the late emperor
send me to Laolan Pass.

731
00:29:33,912 --> 00:29:35,992
Back then, you were Lord Liang's son.

732
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,192
You were the most insignificant
imperial grandson out of all of them.

733
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,912
Naturally, you can go anywhere you like.

734
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:42,672
It's the same for me now.

735
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,710
Since my father likes
my brothers so much,

736
00:29:44,712 --> 00:29:46,151
they can keep him company then.

737
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:48,110
What about you?

738
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,071
You haven't answered my question yet.

739
00:29:50,512 --> 00:29:51,631
Will you return to Yingzhou?

740
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:54,591
What?

741
00:29:55,351 --> 00:29:57,032
Your Highness, are you afraid

742
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,700
that the Cui Army will act like Sun Jing

743
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:00,151
and try to conquer Xichang

744
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,791
instead of returning to Yingzhou?

745
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:07,952
I made a wish

746
00:30:08,192 --> 00:30:09,672
when I left Yingzhou.

747
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,272
I hope that we can stop the war,

748
00:30:12,512 --> 00:30:13,672
return peace to the world,

749
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:15,192
and make sure the people

750
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:17,311
lead stable lives.

751
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:20,111
If, one day,

752
00:30:20,311 --> 00:30:21,992
we do take back Xichang successfully,

753
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:24,591
peace will be restored
to the world by then.

754
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:27,351
Why would we need to start another war?

755
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:33,192
Yeah, yeah.

756
00:30:34,912 --> 00:30:36,351
I'm too petty.

757
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,110
Lieutenant He, please be magnanimous
and forgive me for my pettiness.

758
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:42,992
If so, what do you want to do

759
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,920
after peace has been
restored to the world?

760
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:46,912
Me?

761
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,591
I haven't thought of that yet.

762
00:30:50,472 --> 00:30:52,712
The world is a vast place.

763
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,272
I haven't been to Laolan Pass before.

764
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:56,952
There are many places in the world

765
00:30:57,151 --> 00:30:58,311
that I haven't visited yet.

766
00:30:58,831 --> 00:30:59,672
So,

767
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:01,272
I wish to explore all of them.

768
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,311
You wish to travel the world, huh?

769
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:05,912
Will you come to Laolan Pass then?

770
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:11,391
I'll visit Laolan Pass

771
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:13,672
one day.

772
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:17,071
I'll check out the windy desert

773
00:31:17,871 --> 00:31:19,232
and the Laolan River you mentioned.

774
00:31:22,151 --> 00:31:22,551
All right.

775
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:24,351
It's a deal then.

776
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:37,391
Say that again if you dare!

777
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,310
- I shouldn't have been nice...
-  Miss Taozi.

778
00:31:39,871 --> 00:31:40,712
Don't come near me.

779
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,071
What's wrong with you?

780
00:31:45,992 --> 00:31:47,351
You're asking me that?

781
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,311
Did I make you angry again?

782
00:31:50,032 --> 00:31:51,071
But I don't know

783
00:31:51,192 --> 00:31:52,272
how I made you angry.

784
00:31:52,752 --> 00:31:53,472
You don't know?

785
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:55,351
You should think about it then.

786
00:31:56,992 --> 00:31:58,631
Was it because

787
00:31:58,912 --> 00:32:00,472
I said something wrong?

788
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:01,672
I'm sorry.

789
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:02,272
I'm not

790
00:32:02,391 --> 00:32:03,631
very eloquent.

791
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,032
If so, tell me then.

792
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:10,472
Tell me what you said wrongly.

793
00:32:11,272 --> 00:32:12,151
I...

794
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:14,912
I...

795
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:19,831
You're so dense.

796
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:21,192
Go away!

797
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:22,472
Taozi!

798
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,510
You're blocking my path.

799
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,151
Your Highness,

800
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:38,712
we received news from General Han.

801
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,791
The great imperial grandson
is safe for now.

802
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:45,351
That's great news.

803
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,752
Buddha did bless us.

804
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,110
Congratulations, Your Highness.

805
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:01,712
You may rest at ease for now.

806
00:33:05,071 --> 00:33:06,672
Grand Governor

807
00:33:07,391 --> 00:33:09,311
concealed his military
movements deliberately.

808
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:12,111
I kept thinking that
something big would happen.

809
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,110
Was it because Grand Governor
had located the imperial great-grandson?

810
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,912
Will he dispatch that many troops

811
00:33:19,591 --> 00:33:21,472
just to catch a single child?

812
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,120
If so, is he trying to
head to Dongdu and Luoyang?

813
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,970
Or is he providing
reinforcements to Yingzhou?

814
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:29,952
I don't know either.

815
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:33,351
Has the messenger we dispatched to Li Ni

816
00:33:33,631 --> 00:33:35,232
provided us with any news?

817
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:38,791
He said he hadn't met Li Ni yet.

818
00:33:38,912 --> 00:33:40,871
Therefore, there's no news for now.

819
00:33:48,512 --> 00:33:49,952
I just hope that Grand Governor

820
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:52,311
isn't heading to Tong Pass.

821
00:33:56,232 --> 00:33:57,032
Maybe...

822
00:34:00,912 --> 00:34:02,752
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

823
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:15,792
What's on your mind?

824
00:34:16,832 --> 00:34:18,751
I was reminded of my first campaign.

825
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,312
I left Xichang through Fuyuan Gate.

826
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:24,952
Back then,

827
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:25,671
I was just

828
00:34:25,832 --> 00:34:28,432
a nameless infantry.

829
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:30,352
After a few years,

830
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:33,792
I was promoted to the mayor of Huaihua
after rendering merit.

831
00:34:34,711 --> 00:34:36,992
I followed my superior
to get a position in the capital.

832
00:34:38,432 --> 00:34:40,591
I thought the capital
was lively and busy.

833
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:43,312
It was completely different

834
00:34:43,912 --> 00:34:45,912
from the desolate battlefield.

835
00:34:47,472 --> 00:34:49,591
Why are you telling me this
all of a sudden?

836
00:34:58,711 --> 00:34:59,591
Look.

837
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,111
The sun is setting.

838
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,032
No matter if the sun is shining on the palace's
glazed roof tiles

839
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:08,711
or on the yellow sand of
the northwest desert,

840
00:35:09,392 --> 00:35:11,071
it has a crimson hue to it.

841
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:22,352
Jing.

842
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:33,271
I'm fine.

843
00:35:33,671 --> 00:35:35,671
I was just suddenly
reminded of the past.

844
00:35:38,151 --> 00:35:39,032
That day,

845
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:40,671
outside of Yiluolu City,

846
00:35:41,151 --> 00:35:42,952
I was commanding 100,000 troops,

847
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:45,671
waiting for the rallying trumpet

848
00:35:46,071 --> 00:35:48,032
under the crimson sun.

849
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:50,952
Although I was commanding
100,000 troops,

850
00:35:51,512 --> 00:35:53,352
there was no end to the wilderness.

851
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,111
It was just as quiet as today.

852
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:06,151
I fear nothing

853
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:09,872
as long as I'm by your side.

854
00:36:18,432 --> 00:36:19,952
That brat Li Ni,

855
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:22,111
he thinks he can storm Xichang

856
00:36:22,392 --> 00:36:24,551
just because he took over Tong Pass?

857
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:31,671
Jing,

858
00:36:35,472 --> 00:36:37,191
please stop this.

859
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:39,711
Once the world is at peace,

860
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,631
you and I can spend our days

861
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:45,551
in Mount Li.

862
00:36:57,792 --> 00:36:58,271
All right.

863
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,191
We'll surely visit there.

864
00:37:16,312 --> 00:37:17,392
What's wrong?

865
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:19,271
What do you mean?

866
00:37:19,952 --> 00:37:21,549
You've been furious the past few days.

867
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,872
You ignored Xie Chang'er
even when we were taking a break.

868
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,010
Who does he think he is?

869
00:37:26,032 --> 00:37:27,992
Why must I talk to him
when we take a break?

870
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,750
There's an abnormal noise up front.

871
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:32,709
There's an army nearby.

872
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,010
But I don't know their identity.

873
00:37:34,071 --> 00:37:34,952
Let's stop here.

874
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,970
(Cui)

875
00:37:43,432 --> 00:37:44,029
Lieutenant He,

876
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,910
the previous platoon that was scattered
by Sun Jing is right ahead of us.

877
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:00,312
Youren,

878
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:01,512
hang in there.

879
00:38:10,352 --> 00:38:11,071
Slowly.

880
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:21,591
General Pei Yuan,

881
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:23,551
why did Sun Jing's army

882
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:24,792
appear out of nowhere?

883
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:29,191
What? Did the Cui Army launch a two-pronged
attack on us together with them?

884
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:31,032
Tong Pass.

885
00:38:31,631 --> 00:38:34,711
We finally conquered Tong Pass
after so much effort!

886
00:38:36,352 --> 00:38:37,392
General Pei Yuan,

887
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:39,352
many of our brothers

888
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,912
in the Zhenxi Army were sacrificed!

889
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:43,392
General Pei Yuan!

890
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,191
How did it go?

891
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:00,271
Mister Shiqi,

892
00:39:00,392 --> 00:39:01,671
you're amazing.

893
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,872
You noticed something was off

894
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:03,949
when we entered the camp.

895
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,270
You told me to keep an eye out
while feeding the horses.

896
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:07,191
I took a close look.

897
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,312
I noticed that their military
and food supplies were pretty intact.

898
00:39:10,591 --> 00:39:11,789
If what Taozi said was true,

899
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,110
and that the Cui Army's platoons
were scattered by Sun Jing's army,

900
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,050
their supplies and formations
should be affected somehow.

901
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:17,751
However, they look orderly.

902
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,060
It doesn't seem like they've
encountered any foes lately.

903
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:30,231
Taozi,

904
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,469
did Young Master send you a letter

905
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,349
saying that this platoon
was scattered by Sun Jing's army

906
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,790
and told us to rendezvous
with them here?

907
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:37,151
That's right.

908
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:39,671
You got me some hot water

909
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:40,671
for me to wash up

910
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,792
right after we've arrived.

911
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,472
But now, it's not cooking time.

912
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:45,032
Why is there fire here?

913
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,111
Lieutenant He, what do you mean?

914
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:52,151
Something's off.

915
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,910
If they were scattered by
Sun Jing's army,

916
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,490
naturally, they would be on high alert.

917
00:39:57,191 --> 00:39:58,711
Why would they start a fire

918
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,191
when it wasn't time for them to cook?

919
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:03,432
But this is

920
00:40:03,591 --> 00:40:04,912
the Cui Army's camp.

921
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:06,032
We saw them too.

922
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:06,992
The leader said

923
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,111
their platoon was scattered by
Sun Jing's main army.

924
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,231
Lieutenant He,

925
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:12,271
what do you think is off about this place?

926
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:14,191
When I entered the camp,

927
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,490
I realized that their horseshoes
were thoroughly worn.

928
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:18,472
Their boots were covered with mud too.

929
00:40:18,671 --> 00:40:20,551
It looked like they rushed here.

930
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:22,110
If they were scattered,

931
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,390
it's likely that they would wait for
reinforcements from the main army

932
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:26,352
or wait for the arrival of another platoon

933
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,832
before they resume their march.

934
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,750
That's why I told you
to check things out

935
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:31,710
as you feed the horses.

936
00:40:33,872 --> 00:40:34,512
Mister Shiqi,

937
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,912
if so, what should we do now?

938
00:40:37,591 --> 00:40:38,151
Ying.

939
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:44,472
Since you've arrived here safely,

940
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,770
I'll return to Tong Pass first.

941
00:40:46,392 --> 00:40:47,392
Let's leave together.

942
00:40:47,952 --> 00:40:49,151
This place is near Tong Pass.

943
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,910
Since we've already
rendezvous with them,

944
00:40:50,912 --> 00:40:52,250
let's head to Tong Pass together.

945
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:55,352
All right.

946
00:40:57,032 --> 00:40:57,792
Don't fall behind.

947
00:40:57,952 --> 00:40:58,751
Come on.

948
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,870
Those at the back, don't fall behind!

949
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:03,910
Those at the back, don't fall behind!

950
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:05,912
Buddy, hang in there.

951
00:41:06,312 --> 00:41:07,111
We can't stop here.

952
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:09,032
It's fine. Just hang in there.

953
00:41:10,591 --> 00:41:11,191
Youren!

954
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:15,992
Youren, slowly.

955
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,610
Those at the back, don't fall behind!

956
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:20,671
Buddy, hang in there!

957
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,940
(Cui)

958
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:28,271
Go.

959
00:41:28,711 --> 00:41:29,472
Go now.

960
00:41:29,832 --> 00:41:31,432
Don't forget what I told you.

961
00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:32,912
Go now.

962
00:41:35,591 --> 00:41:36,111
Miss Taozi,

963
00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:37,071
I know

964
00:41:37,111 --> 00:41:38,032
what I said wrong.

965
00:41:38,992 --> 00:41:40,151
What did you say wrong?

966
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:43,032
Bao told me about it.

967
00:41:43,352 --> 00:41:43,912
I know why

968
00:41:44,032 --> 00:41:44,992
you're upset.

969
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:46,352
I'm too dense.

970
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,110
I can't speak well.

971
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:48,591
Actually, I was saying

972
00:41:48,751 --> 00:41:49,510
that you were kind

973
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:50,671
and friendly to everyone

974
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:51,890
because I wanted to praise you.

975
00:41:51,952 --> 00:41:53,432
I know you treat me especially well.

976
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:54,151
But

977
00:41:54,432 --> 00:41:55,352
I...

978
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:58,352
I think I messed it up again.

979
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:00,312
Enough already.

980
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:01,952
You don't speak well indeed.

981
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:03,191
Miss Taozi,

982
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:04,111
actually,

983
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,370
I know that you treat me nicely.

984
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,720
So I want to
treat you nicely too.

985
00:42:06,912 --> 00:42:08,671
All right. I got it.

986
00:42:09,191 --> 00:42:09,671
Really?

987
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,992
Are you no longer angry at me?

988
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,010
Did you know how terrible I felt

989
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:14,312
when you ignored me?

990
00:42:15,071 --> 00:42:15,591
It depends on

991
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:16,992
my mood then.

992
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:27,111
Youdao!

993
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,711
Are they here?

994
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:30,751
I think I heard horses.

995
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:31,952
Youde,

996
00:42:32,071 --> 00:42:33,512
hide with Youren.

997
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:35,312
I can still fight

998
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,710
even if I only have one arm left.

999
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:38,191
That Cui scum,

1000
00:42:39,032 --> 00:42:39,912
he's such an ingrate!

1001
00:42:39,992 --> 00:42:41,551
We saved him and the Cui Army, you know?

1002
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,310
How could he launch a sneak attack at us?

1003
00:42:43,591 --> 00:42:44,872
Even if I were to die today,

1004
00:42:44,992 --> 00:42:46,711
I will never let him off even if I turn into

1005
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:47,792
a vengeful spirit!

1006
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:48,472
All right!

1007
00:42:48,872 --> 00:42:50,912
Hide the severely wounded in the forest.

1008
00:42:51,312 --> 00:42:52,711
My other brothers, take up arms

1009
00:42:52,992 --> 00:42:53,711
and follow me!

1010
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:54,392
Yes!

1011
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,810
All of you, don't fall behind!

1012
00:42:58,191 --> 00:42:58,792
Let's go!

1013
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,312
What do you think?

1014
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,810
There's a group of soldiers

1015
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,570
stopping in front.

1016
00:43:04,591 --> 00:43:05,631
But it's a small group.

1017
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,110
I don't know their identity.

1018
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,952
Let's meet them head-on then.

1019
00:43:09,432 --> 00:43:10,231
Kill them

1020
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:11,792
if they're foes.

1021
00:43:12,472 --> 00:43:13,231
All right.

1022
00:43:30,271 --> 00:43:31,231
General Pei Yuan,

1023
00:43:31,472 --> 00:43:33,352
I'm able to die beside you
in battle today.

1024
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,810
My life wasn't in vain.

1025
00:43:36,151 --> 00:43:36,952
My good buddy.

1026
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:42,832
Guys.

1027
00:43:43,352 --> 00:43:44,432
Attack!

1028
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:47,551
Attack!

1029
00:43:48,111 --> 00:43:51,751
Attack!

1030
00:43:53,872 --> 00:43:54,751
Shiqi?

1031
00:43:57,751 --> 00:43:58,450
What's going on?

1032
00:43:58,730 --> 00:43:59,952
Weren't you guys at Tong Pass?

1033
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,512
What's with the serious injuries?

1034
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,392
Mister Shiqi, why are you only here now?

1035
00:44:03,512 --> 00:44:04,992
Many of our brothers are dead!

1036
00:44:18,071 --> 00:44:20,512
Kill her and avenge the Zhenxi Army!

1037
00:44:20,671 --> 00:44:21,111
Kill her!

1038
00:44:21,512 --> 00:44:22,151
Youde,

1039
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:23,751
they're one of us.

1040
00:44:24,392 --> 00:44:25,392
One of us?

1041
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:27,671
The Cui Army sold Tong Pass out

1042
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,590
and launched a two-pronged attack
together with Sun Jing,

1043
00:44:29,591 --> 00:44:30,832
killing many of our brothers!

1044
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:32,832
Now, you're saying she's one of us?

1045
00:44:34,432 --> 00:44:35,392
Shiqi,

1046
00:44:36,231 --> 00:44:38,231
you mustn't let her deceive you again!

1047
00:44:39,191 --> 00:44:40,832
She and that Cui scum premeditated this!

1048
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:42,711
She duped you guys into heading to Xichang.

1049
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,790
The Cui Army launched
a two-pronged attack

1050
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:46,271
with Sun Jing at Tong Pass,

1051
00:44:46,432 --> 00:44:47,872
killed our brothers,

1052
00:44:48,032 --> 00:44:49,711
and sold Tong Pass out!

1053
00:44:51,551 --> 00:44:52,352
You crazy!

1054
00:44:52,992 --> 00:44:55,591
It's either you die or I die!

1055
00:45:04,832 --> 00:45:05,591
Ying.

1056
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:08,551
I mean, Lieutenant He.

1057
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,310
Was this one of your ploys all along?

1058
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:16,111
You said you would join me, head to Xichang,

1059
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,710
and said that you could resolve
the issue at Yingzhou, huh?

1060
00:45:19,191 --> 00:45:19,872
That's not it.

1061
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,510
On our way back to Tong Pass,

1062
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,350
you said one of the Cui Army's platoons
was scattered

1063
00:45:24,352 --> 00:45:25,430
and you needed
to rendezvous with them.

1064
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,992
You knew that I would escort you there

1065
00:45:28,151 --> 00:45:29,711
as I was worried about you.

1066
00:45:30,432 --> 00:45:32,191
But you did so to lure me
to another place.

1067
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,110
You did so to stall me
so that I couldn't return to Tong Pass.

1068
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:37,992
You won't trust me even if I tell you

1069
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:39,992
that I have no idea about this, right?

1070
00:45:41,151 --> 00:45:41,872
Shiqi,

1071
00:45:42,392 --> 00:45:43,631
you mustn't trust her again!

1072
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,472
How many times has she deceived you

1073
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,032
ever since you made contact with her?

1074
00:45:47,352 --> 00:45:48,312
Mister Shiqi,

1075
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,910
she has deceived you numerous times!

1076
00:45:49,912 --> 00:45:51,071
How could you still trust her?

1077
00:46:01,352 --> 00:46:02,032
You have no idea?

1078
00:46:04,392 --> 00:46:05,671
You have no idea.

1079
00:46:08,111 --> 00:46:10,392
Many of my brothers in the Zhenxi Army
were killed.

1080
00:46:11,392 --> 00:46:14,151
Are you saying that it wasn't
because of the Cui Army and Sun Jing?

1081
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,591
Since you're not willing to trust me,

1082
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,271
I have no way to explain...

1083
00:46:31,392 --> 00:46:32,472
How can I trust you?

1084
00:46:34,352 --> 00:46:35,872
You're your young master's strategist.

1085
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:38,151
This is a huge matter.

1086
00:46:39,352 --> 00:46:40,711
I'm sure he'll discuss it with you.

1087
00:46:45,231 --> 00:46:46,512
I did try to plot against you

1088
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:48,151
before we knew each other.

1089
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:49,792
But this time,

1090
00:46:50,071 --> 00:46:51,352
I didn't.

1091
00:46:51,711 --> 00:46:52,312
We saved you

1092
00:46:52,512 --> 00:46:54,191
and the Cui Army outside of Tong Pass.

1093
00:46:55,872 --> 00:46:58,231
How could you do this to the Zhenxi Army?

1094
00:47:08,271 --> 00:47:09,111
