Is anyone there?

32
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:01,016
How could you tie me here
for three days and three nights?

33
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:04,495
Who did this?

34
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:06,295
Is anyone there?

35
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:13,336
Mister,

36
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:14,895
I'm dying of thirst.

37
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:16,216
Please give me some water.

38
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:25,855
Mister,

39
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:28,216
why did you guys

40
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,096
tie me to this tree?

41
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:31,015
As long as you set me free,

42
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:32,816
I'll give you

43
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:34,096
all of my family assets.

44
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,695
The Cui Army led by my uncle is also

45
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:36,656
known as the Army of Victory.

46
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,256
They never...

47
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:44,536
It's you?

48
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:05,575
Cui Lin?

49
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:08,695
You didn't die, huh?

50
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:11,816
I'm not Cui Lin.

51
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:14,735
Lin,

52
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:17,135
I'm glad that you're still alive.

53
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:20,056
Lin,

54
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:22,015
I'm glad to see you alive!

55
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:24,656
I told you already.

56
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:25,895
I'm not Cui Lin.

57
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,735
Yes.

58
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:28,895
No.

59
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:29,895
You're not Cui Lin.

60
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:31,256
You're not Cui Lin.

61
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:33,656
My name is Liu Chengfeng.

62
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:36,175
Have you remembered that?

63
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:38,895
Yes, I have.

64
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:40,615
You're Young Master Liu Chengfeng.

65
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:41,455
Young Master Liu.

66
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:43,376
Young Master Liu.

67
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:45,695
Young Master Liu, I'm begging you.

68
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:47,175
I'm willing to do anything.

69
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:47,855
Young Master Liu.

70
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:50,096
Young Master Liu, trust me.

71
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,536
Please set me free,

72
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:52,656
Young Master Liu.

73
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:08,976
Jie...

74
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:11,376
The Jieshuo people?

75
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:13,895
You're not Cui Lin.

76
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:15,575
You're definitely not Cui Lin.

77
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,656
The Cui Family has a deep-seated grudge
against the Jieshuo people.

78
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:21,615
Anyone with the surname Cui

79
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,450
will never make acquaintances
with the Jieshuo people.

80
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:25,896
That's right.

81
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:28,136
I'm Liu Chengfeng.

82
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:30,055
I'm not Cui Lin.

83
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:35,495
Do you know
what you have swallowed just now?

84
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:37,776
It's a poison pill crafted by

85
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:39,576
the witch doctors of Jieshuo.

86
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:42,295
If you don't follow my instructions,

87
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:44,735
if you fail to take
the antidote on time,

88
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:47,495
your body will rupture.

89
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:54,175
Young Master Liu!

90
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:57,375
Please don't hold it against me!

91
00:04:57,615 --> 00:05:00,055
I'm willing to do anything for you

92
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,896
as long as you let me live!

93
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:03,495
Young Master Liu!

94
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:05,656
I'm willing to do anything! Anything!

95
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:10,976
As long as you obey my will

96
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:13,615
and follow my instructions,

97
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:18,055
I'll give you the antidote.

98
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:21,776
Thank you, Young Master Liu.

99
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:23,896
Thank you, Young Master Liu.

100
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:25,896
Thank you, Young Master Liu.

101
00:05:27,656 --> 00:05:28,295
Taozi,

102
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:29,456
I gathered these

103
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:30,456
on the mountains for you.

104
00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:31,255
They're nice.

105
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:32,415
They smell great.

106
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:34,896
By the way,

107
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:36,255
how's Mister Shiqi doing?

108
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,336
Don't mention that.

109
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:39,576
Great General

110
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:41,216
has released him from prison.

111
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:42,656
However, he gave him 30 whippings

112
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:44,216
(Wolong)
as per military rules.

113
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:44,976
What?

114
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,136
30 whippings?

115
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:48,576
However,

116
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:49,776
Lord Qin

117
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:51,175
is a tough man indeed.

118
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:52,855
He wasn't willing

119
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:53,896
to beg Great General

120
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,615
even after receiving
all that punishment.

121
00:05:56,615 --> 00:05:57,576
That's the way

122
00:05:57,576 --> 00:05:58,495
he is.

123
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:01,016
He will never yield until death.

124
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,055
Actually, Great General

125
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:05,576
is soft-hearted too.

126
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:08,415
Lord Qin wouldn't need to suffer that much

127
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,055
if he made a plea in the first place.

128
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,536
Since you gathered these,

129
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:18,656
you should have some too.

130
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:19,656
It's fine.

131
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:20,855
You can have them all if you like.

132
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:21,815
This is fine.

133
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:24,735
Fine.

134
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:28,855
I see.

135
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,576
What do you mean?

136
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:33,696
The entire Cui Army

137
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:34,855
behaves in the same way.

138
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,710
Tough on the outside,
but soft on the inside.

139
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:40,055
Mind you, I'm very fierce.

140
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:42,096
Yeah, yeah. You're fierce.

141
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:07,249
Great General,

142
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,270
we've already cleaned
the front of the battlefield.

143
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,255
We brought the prisoners back.

144
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:11,640
Now, we're doing an inventory check.

145
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:21,536
Ying,

146
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:25,096
should I not have done so?

147
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:27,415
Father,

148
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:28,896
what's wrong?

149
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,536
When you were born,

150
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:33,216
I told the imperial court

151
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:35,255
that you were a boy.

152
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:36,976
When you grew up,

153
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:39,696
Liu Chengfeng replaced you as Cui Lin

154
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:41,136
and became my son.

155
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:44,935
You're a lady.

156
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:46,615
But you ride horses

157
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:48,216
and fight battles alongside me.

158
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:49,896
How can I

159
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:53,175
get you a husband in the future?

160
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:57,375
Those who are willing to marry you

161
00:07:57,495 --> 00:07:59,456
will definitely have all kinds of flaws.

162
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:00,855
Forget about you,

163
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,230
even I won't take a liking to them.

164
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:04,935
Father, what are you saying?

165
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:06,415
I love going to war.

166
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:07,776
I love to live this way.

167
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,735
There are plenty of men in the world.

168
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:11,055
I can do everything

169
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,295
they do.

170
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:14,016
Why should I get married then?

171
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:16,896
You're a lady after all.

172
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:19,096
You will get married
and give birth eventually.

173
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:22,935
Actually,

174
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:25,495
Feng is pretty nice too.

175
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:27,255
He...

176
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:29,175
Father,

177
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:30,576
the world is huge

178
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:31,656
and vast.

179
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:32,775
There are many places

180
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:33,976
that I haven't been to yet.

181
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,015
There are many things

182
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,495
I wish to experience for myself.

183
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:38,735
If, getting married and giving birth

184
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:40,655
is one of the experiences,

185
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:42,655
there's nothing wrong in omitting it.

186
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,576
It's just one of the thousands of experiences

187
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:46,015
I will experience.

188
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:48,416
I'll grow old one day.

189
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,895
We'll have to part ways eventually.

190
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:51,816
By then, you'll be all alone.

191
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:54,456
I'll be too embarrassed

192
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:57,576
to face your mother in the afterlife.

193
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:01,495
Father,

194
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:02,855
I've led

195
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:04,895
a happy and carefree life.

196
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:06,816
When you see Mother

197
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:08,296
in the afterlife,

198
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:09,775
just tell her

199
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:12,735
that this was my favorite way of living.

200
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:13,976
I think

201
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,096
Mother will be happy

202
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,416
when she hears that.

203
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:18,135
There's nothing more fulfilling

204
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,895
than letting one's daughter
lead a happy and carefree life, right?

205
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:33,456
Great General,

206
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,495
the scouts we sent out
have discovered a suspect.

207
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:38,015
They found the traces of Cui Li.

208
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:41,135
Do not let

209
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:43,696
Lieutenant He find out.

210
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,416
Deploy our troops.

211
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,655
I'll head there personally.

212
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:48,096
Yes, Great General.

213
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:57,895
Young Master Liu.

214
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,655
Cui Yi will be here later.

215
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,495
Do you still remember

216
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:02,615
what you have to say?

217
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,615
Yes, Young Master Liu.

218
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:04,855
I did remember my lines.

219
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:06,535
Young Master Liu,

220
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:07,735
if I do

221
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:09,655
play my part in your act,

222
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:11,696
will you give me the antidote

223
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:13,375
so that I can survive?

224
00:10:21,936 --> 00:10:22,615
Young Master Liu,

225
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:23,216
don't worry.

226
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,976
I'll definitely play my part well.

227
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:25,976
I will.

228
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:26,936
Rest assured.

229
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:29,615
Reporting in!

230
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,495
Great General,
we've surrounded the forest.

231
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:34,290
Cui Li has escaped
into the forest with his men.

232
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,096
Surround the forest thoroughly.

233
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:38,096
Do not let him escape.

234
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:38,696
Yes!

235
00:10:43,535 --> 00:10:44,416
Don't come near me!

236
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:46,096
All of you, stay put!

237
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,790
I'll kill him
if you take one step closer!

238
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:48,696
Don't come here!

239
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:51,255
Stand back!

240
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,416
Uncle.

241
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:02,655
Don't move!

242
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:16,535
Uncle!

243
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,936
Uncle, I had no choice!

244
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:27,775
Let him go.

245
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:28,895
Uncle,

246
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:31,056
I had no choice!

247
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:35,696
Uncle, don't come near me!

248
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,576
Don't force me to do this!

249
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:40,096
Put down your sword.

250
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:43,216
You're still my nephew.

251
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:44,735
If not,

252
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:47,816
you cannot be spared
for what you've done.

253
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:49,696
Uncle,

254
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:52,135
I had no choice too!

255
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,015
Li Ni forced me to do this!

256
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:56,176
He said he would kill me
if I didn't kill Lin!

257
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,456
That's why I staged an act

258
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,976
and forced Lin to jump into the river.

259
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:01,056
But once they left,

260
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:02,216
I went downstream

261
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:03,216
and saved Cui Lin.

262
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:04,655
I even treated his wounds!

263
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:06,855
Uncle!

264
00:12:07,015 --> 00:12:08,096
Uncle!

265
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:14,895
Let him go!

266
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,976
Uncle, don't force me!

267
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:36,535
Let him go!

268
00:12:53,655 --> 00:12:54,416
Fire.

269
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,096
I won!

270
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,296
Father,

271
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:09,375
why do I have

272
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,696
to practice this all the time?

273
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:13,816
Because you're my daughter.

274
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,489
The Jieshuo people are ruthless.

275
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,110
If they do take you as
a hostage one day,

276
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:19,456
I hope that I can save you

277
00:13:19,535 --> 00:13:20,456
with my bow and arrow.

278
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:28,816
Come here.

279
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:34,015
Father, can I join in too?

280
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:34,735
Of course.

281
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:36,135
You're my son too.

282
00:13:36,296 --> 00:13:37,416
We can do this training

283
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:38,816
for as long as you want.

284
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:40,936
Thank you, Father!

285
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:42,936
Why are you thanking me?
Come, let me teach you.

286
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:47,255
Fire.

287
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,380
Untie him.

288
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

289
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:25,216
I told you already.

290
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:27,775
I could spare you

291
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,936
if you put down your sword.

292
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:33,296
If not,

293
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:36,976
I have to put you down
according to the military rules.

294
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:39,495
Jie...

295
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:47,576
What did you say?

296
00:14:50,535 --> 00:14:51,176
Jie...

297
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:53,135
Jie...

298
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:19,576
Your Highness,

299
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,056
why don't you let me do it?

300
00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:21,980
You should resume your work.

301
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:22,735
Don't worry.

302
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:24,735
I'll make sure this soup won't over-boil.

303
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:25,855
But the heat is too...

304
00:15:25,855 --> 00:15:26,456
Taozi.

305
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:28,096
Come here.

306
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:28,976
That's not it. I...

307
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:36,535
Don't scratch it.

308
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:38,775
It will never heal

309
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:40,456
if you keep scratching it.

310
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,456
But you don't help me
apply medicine.

311
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:43,696
I can't reach it myself.

312
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:44,655
Of course it'll itch.

313
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,456
I'm doing it to teach you a lesson.

314
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:48,270
I'll see if you dare
to repeat it next time.

315
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,775
Next time? No thanks.

316
00:15:50,135 --> 00:15:51,056
It's hard to say.

317
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:52,056
You're a dense fellow.

318
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:53,176
I'm sure Father

319
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:54,456
will be mad when he sees you.

320
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:56,855
Maybe he'll beat you up again next time.

321
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:00,416
We can talk about it by then.

322
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:01,456
I think

323
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:03,296
the soup is almost ready.

324
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,416
Try it.

325
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:10,096
Let me get a big one.

326
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:12,735
Gooseberries.

327
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:16,735
And red dates.

328
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:24,816
All done.

329
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:25,855
Give it a try.

330
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:36,296
How is it? Is it sweet?

331
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:40,495
It's pretty good.

332
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:42,535
You should let me try it then.

333
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,336
There's plenty of it left.

334
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:45,576
Get a bowl for yourself.

335
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:48,895
I tried your medicine to see
if it was bitter before you?

336
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:51,895
Don't you think you should let me try
how sweet the soup is?

337
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:54,096
Let me try it.

338
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:27,176
Ying,

339
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,495
come to my room.

340
00:17:43,656 --> 00:17:44,656
- Young Master.
- Ying.

341
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,815
Young Master, you're awake.

342
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:46,735
Ying.

343
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:51,696
I'm not dreaming, am I?

344
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,696
I could actually see you again.

345
00:17:57,216 --> 00:17:58,055
Ying.

346
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:00,575
Young Master, all of us are happy

347
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:02,335
that you returned safely.

348
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:03,936
This is great.

349
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:04,616
Ying,

350
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,815
we can be together again.

351
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:12,535
Father.

352
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:15,735
Don't get up.

353
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:17,880
You have to rest and recuperate.

354
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:20,255
Father,

355
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:23,136
Cui Li captured Shu as well.

356
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:25,936
I don't know where he hid him.

357
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:26,976
I knew that.

358
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:28,656
He was rescued too.

359
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:30,976
Thank you, Father.

360
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:34,575
You're my son.

361
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:36,775
Why are you being so courteous now?

362
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:40,176
Maybe...

363
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:44,335
Maybe it's because
I survived a disaster.

364
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:47,456
I'm still bewildered.

365
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:50,535
I keep feeling like I'm in a dream.

366
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,815
You were born with a weak constitution.

367
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:02,376
When the physician read your pulse,

368
00:19:03,335 --> 00:19:04,656
he said you were healthier

369
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:06,216
than before.

370
00:19:07,535 --> 00:19:09,456
Maybe everything got better

371
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,176
after you survived the disaster.

372
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:14,976
Yes.

373
00:19:17,335 --> 00:19:18,416
I hope so.

374
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,015
Your Highness,
are you trying to kill someone?

375
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,416
I'll go on a killing spree

376
00:19:39,535 --> 00:19:41,255
if you don't come back.

377
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:43,295
My elder brother survived a disaster.

378
00:19:43,456 --> 00:19:44,856
And, we've finally rescued him.

379
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,376
Shouldn't I check on him?

380
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:48,376
I wouldn't mind

381
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:50,055
if he was your real elder brother.

382
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:51,535
But he's not.

383
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:54,015
You even made him a set of chess pieces

384
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:55,216
and got your hands hurt.

385
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:57,495
You always call him Brother.

386
00:19:57,616 --> 00:19:58,136
What?

387
00:19:58,136 --> 00:19:59,216
Doesn't he have a name?

388
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:02,936
His real name is Liu Chengfeng.

389
00:20:03,055 --> 00:20:04,376
Although his surname isn't Cui,

390
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,456
he's my real

391
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:06,936
elder brother.

392
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:10,575
Anyway, I don't like him.

393
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:12,575
He's disloyal and dishonest.

394
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,735
Back then, he sold Tong Pass out

395
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:15,730
and caused the death of
many soldiers in the Zhenxi Army.

396
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:17,216
Moreover,

397
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:18,456
you even

398
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:19,656
argued with me

399
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:21,216
because I failed to save him in time.

400
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,735
You never behaved
like that in front of me

401
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,670
for other people's sake.

402
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:25,376
Now that he's back,

403
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:27,136
you spent so long
checking on him.

404
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,376
Even if he's your real brother,

405
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:29,410
I think you went overboard.

406
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:31,856
You're so petty.

407
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:34,216
I think I'll tell the kitchen
to send you a vat

408
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:36,656
of vinegar to cure you of your jealousy tonight.

409
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:42,575
We were interrupted
when we were having the dessert.

410
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:43,575
What?

411
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,110
You want me to drink vinegar now?

412
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:45,896
Fine.

413
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:47,616
Drink vinegar with me.

414
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:49,176
Let's taste it together.

415
00:20:57,735 --> 00:20:58,735
We won't have the chance

416
00:20:58,735 --> 00:20:59,950
when Great General Cui is here.

417
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:22,110
That was an excellent plan.

418
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:23,815
Cui Li deserved to die.

419
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,616
Many soldiers died because of him.

420
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:30,535
He also caused Xing's death.

421
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:34,295
I wanted to kill him long ago.

422
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:36,656
I kept him alive until now

423
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:39,456
so that I could utilize him fully.

424
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:40,616
Young Master,

425
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,920
Li Ni is in the residence.

426
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:45,723
Really?

427
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,710
Young Master, you poisoned Lieutenant He

428
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:50,575
to lure Li Ni into the residence.

429
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:53,055
However, I didn't expect Great General

430
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,616
to let him look after Lieutenant He.

431
00:21:59,656 --> 00:22:00,216
Young Master,

432
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:02,055
is Great General

433
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:03,456
going to betroth

434
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:04,976
Lieutenant He to Li Ni?

435
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:09,896
All those who stop me from marrying Ying

436
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:12,295
will have to die.

437
00:22:13,856 --> 00:22:16,055
Since Li Ni is already here,

438
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,376
I'll get rid of him first.

439
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:25,815
Father,

440
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,495
were you looking for me?

441
00:22:28,295 --> 00:22:29,136
Feng,

442
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:30,535
have a seat.

443
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:33,815
Father,

444
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,510
now that you're addressing me
by that name,

445
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,575
I feel like I'm not used to it.

446
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,055
Feng, even since you were seriously wounded
and fell into the water,

447
00:22:43,616 --> 00:22:45,136
I sent many of my men

448
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:46,535
to search for you.

449
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,520
We couldn't find you
no matter what we did.

450
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:52,335
I thought you were already gone.

451
00:22:53,335 --> 00:22:55,495
After that, Ying and I

452
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:57,896
went to pay our respects to you
at your tomb.

453
00:22:58,616 --> 00:22:59,896
I was reminded of the past.

454
00:23:01,656 --> 00:23:02,856
In the past,

455
00:23:03,656 --> 00:23:05,335
I was too selfish.

456
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:07,856
Although I did ask you

457
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,410
whether you were willing to be my son
when you were young,

458
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,335
you were still young
and insensible back then.

459
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:14,936
You couldn't understand fully
what I told you.

460
00:23:16,216 --> 00:23:16,976
Father.

461
00:23:22,896 --> 00:23:24,095
I've decided.

462
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:27,295
You can call yourself
Liu Chengfeng again.

463
00:23:28,495 --> 00:23:30,376
However, you will still be my son.

464
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:33,255
I will tell everyone

465
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:34,896
that you're my adopted son.

466
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:38,416
Father,

467
00:23:40,055 --> 00:23:42,136
are you allowing me
to acknowledge my ancestry?

468
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,335
Now,

469
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:47,015
Ying is all grown up.

470
00:23:47,735 --> 00:23:49,136
She was born a willful child.

471
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:51,896
She doesn't need me to take care of her.

472
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:53,456
You grew up

473
00:23:53,456 --> 00:23:54,856
in our residence since young.

474
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:55,856
I truly

475
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:57,495
saw you as my son.

476
00:23:58,656 --> 00:24:00,335
I want you to acknowledge your ancestry.

477
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,456
After that,

478
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:05,136
I'll tell the matchmaker

479
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:07,255
to find a virtuous wife for you

480
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:08,976
and give birth to your descendants.

481
00:24:09,176 --> 00:24:10,535
This way, the Liu family

482
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:12,696
will be able to retain their lineage.

483
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:14,616
Father,

484
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:16,856
are you abandoning me?

485
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,856
Although you're changing your name,

486
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:24,015
you're still my son.

487
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:33,535
Father,

488
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:35,216
thank you.

489
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:45,176
Father.

490
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,976
Time to take your medicine.

491
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:49,735
Why are you serving me

492
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:50,936
with my medicine today?

493
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:51,896
Father,

494
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:53,216
serving you

495
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:54,416
is my duty.

496
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:56,335
Father,

497
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,376
I'm sure you were worried sick about me

498
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,410
when I fell into the water
after sustaining serious injuries.

499
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:02,976
Even so, you still thought of me

500
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,810
and allowed me to
acknowledge my ancestry.

501
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,015
I'm truly grateful to you.

502
00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:09,416
Although I'm not your real son,

503
00:25:10,335 --> 00:25:11,696
in my heart,

504
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:14,176
Father,

505
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:17,376
you'll always be my real father.

506
00:25:18,575 --> 00:25:20,015
So, these are the duties

507
00:25:20,376 --> 00:25:21,735
I should fulfill.

508
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:23,216
In the future,

509
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:25,976
I will serve you well.

510
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,510
You just recovered from your condition.

511
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,976
And, you just came back not long ago.

512
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:31,570
You have to rest and recuperate too.

513
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,495
I'll tell Taozi to read your pulse

514
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:36,335
and prepare some prescriptions
for you after this.

515
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:39,216
Thank you, Father.

516
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:45,015
Here.

517
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:46,535
Father, please have your medicine.

518
00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:50,976
Be careful. It's hot.

519
00:26:11,295 --> 00:26:12,015
Greetings,

520
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:13,495
Great General.

521
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:15,575
Lord Qin, what do you need?

522
00:26:16,136 --> 00:26:16,815
Great General,

523
00:26:17,255 --> 00:26:18,176
I wish to discuss

524
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,495
the issue of Changzhou with you.

525
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:21,095
Changzhou

526
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:22,815
is already part of our territory.

527
00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:25,815
Lord Qin, if you wish
to take back Changzhou,

528
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:27,976
we'll see each other on the battlefield.

529
00:26:28,176 --> 00:26:29,656
Great General, you misunderstood me.

530
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,370
Initially, I wrote a letter
to the Cui Army

531
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:34,216
to request your help
in resolving the emergency in Changzhou.

532
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:36,535
Great General, you've stationed
your troops in Changzhou.

533
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:38,255
Although I came here with my army,

534
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:39,335
I don't wish

535
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:41,976
to engage you in a battle.

536
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,015
Is that so?

537
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:01,856
Great General?

538
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:03,456
Great General?

539
00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:04,775
Great General!

540
00:27:04,936 --> 00:27:05,815
Great General!

541
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:24,575
Don't let him escape!

542
00:27:24,815 --> 00:27:26,295
He harmed Great General!

543
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:27,176
Tell us!

544
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:28,656
What exactly did you do

545
00:27:28,656 --> 00:27:29,775
to Great General?

546
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:30,936
I told you already.

547
00:27:31,095 --> 00:27:32,575
I was speaking to him

548
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:34,330
when he vomited blood
and fell unconscious.

549
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:36,255
That's why I came out to seek help.

550
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:38,216
Why would I seek help

551
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:40,295
if I intended to harm him?

552
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:48,815
You didn't escape

553
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,976
because you knew that
you couldn't escape.

554
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:53,575
Bring the archers here.

555
00:27:54,136 --> 00:27:55,255
Don't let him escape.

556
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:58,015
Kill him

557
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,976
if something happens to Father.

558
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:07,856
Great General!

559
00:28:09,295 --> 00:28:10,216
Great General!

560
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,815
Taozi, how is he?

561
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:19,335
Great General?

562
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:22,376
Great General.

563
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,376
Great General!

564
00:28:26,696 --> 00:28:27,616
Great General!

565
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:50,656
Kill him

566
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:52,255
to avenge Father!

567
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:53,495
Wait!

568
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,160
The truth behind Great General's
assassination hasn't been revealed yet.

569
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:02,110
We cannot confirm whether he was poisoned
or harmed by other methods.

570
00:29:02,216 --> 00:29:03,696
You mustn't kill him.

571
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:05,616
Even now, you're still
trying to defend him?

572
00:29:05,616 --> 00:29:06,696
I'm not defending him.

573
00:29:06,856 --> 00:29:08,656
Father is barely breathing now.

574
00:29:09,495 --> 00:29:11,136
You must've been bewitched by him.

575
00:29:11,255 --> 00:29:13,015
Lord Qin will never harm Great General!

576
00:29:13,176 --> 00:29:14,295
For the sake of Changzhou,

577
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:15,255
Lord Qin

578
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,416
will resort to anything.

579
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,936
He's cunning and devious.

580
00:29:19,095 --> 00:29:20,376
If we don't kill him,

581
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:21,696
he'll escape!

582
00:29:31,015 --> 00:29:31,976
Fire!

583
00:29:31,976 --> 00:29:32,656
Stop!

584
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:33,976
Release him!

585
00:29:39,216 --> 00:29:40,216
Let him go!

586
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:43,535
How dare you treat me like this?

587
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:45,176
Lieutenant He,

588
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,710
are you trying to stage a revolt here?

589
00:29:54,216 --> 00:29:55,055
Let him go.

590
00:30:00,696 --> 00:30:02,055
Let him go!

591
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:24,696
He already left.

592
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:27,535
With his capability,

593
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,710
it's likely that I won't be able
to catch up to him.

594
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,656
So, are you still going
to put your sword on my neck?

595
00:30:46,896 --> 00:30:47,896
Someone!

596
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:52,535
Lieutenant He was misled by the villain.

597
00:30:53,616 --> 00:30:54,896
And, she released the suspect.

598
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:56,936
Send her...

599
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:01,295
Send her to the water prison.

600
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:02,535
Young Master!

601
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,095
Great General's life is in danger.

602
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,015
You should postpone

603
00:31:05,015 --> 00:31:06,095
my punishment for now.

604
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:08,095
Allow me to look
after Great General first.

605
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,136
So, you still knew that
Great General's life was in danger?

606
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:14,255
Take her away!

607
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:15,616
Take her away.

608
00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:23,656
Young Master,

609
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,136
I think Great General was poisoned.

610
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:26,176
Lieutenant He, she...

611
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:28,255
She was just anxious.

612
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,575
Why don't you let her stay?

613
00:31:29,775 --> 00:31:30,656
Shut up!

614
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,216
Young Master.

615
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:32,856
Someone!

616
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:35,015
Young Master!

617
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:37,055
Arrest Taozi as well.

618
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:39,810
Their punishment
will be announced in due time.

619
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:40,616
Young Master!

620
00:31:41,136 --> 00:31:42,136
Young Master!

621
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,136
Young Master!

622
00:31:58,295 --> 00:31:59,015
How could you...

623
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,095
Where's Mister Shiqi?

624
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:02,376
He has already escaped.

625
00:32:03,015 --> 00:32:04,015
Where's Lieutenant He?

626
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,535
She's under tight surveillance.
We can't rescue her for now.

627
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:07,280
Let's escape first.

628
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:07,976
Let's go.

629
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,820
Young Master,
we have brought Lieutenant He here.

630
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:23,970
- Yes, Young Master.
- Yes, Young Master.

631
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,055
Ying,

632
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:33,936
you must've suffered.

633
00:32:35,216 --> 00:32:36,095
But today,

634
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:38,136
you put your sword on my neck

635
00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:39,856
in public.

636
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:41,376
No matter what,

637
00:32:41,616 --> 00:32:43,495
I had to punish you.

638
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,270
Young Master, you may stop
creating excuses.

639
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:47,456
You had a sudden change of attitude.

640
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,976
I suppose you wish to use this opportunity
to get rid of Li Ni.

641
00:32:52,495 --> 00:32:53,335
Ying,

642
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:56,696
why do you trust Li Ni that much?

643
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:00,055
He harmed Father to take back Changzhou.

644
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:03,136
The truth is right in front of you.

645
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,575
Why aren't you
willing to face the truth?

646
00:33:04,575 --> 00:33:06,055
Truth? What is the truth?

647
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:07,856
Why is Li Ni trying to harm Father then?

648
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:09,575
In order to take back Changzhou!

649
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:12,976
I've already ordered my men

650
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,456
to investigate every single detail.

651
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:17,495
But now, Li Ni is

652
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,535
the largest suspect.

653
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,176
You can't just let him go
because you want to defend him.

654
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:29,856
Ying,

655
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,255
let's drop the topic,

656
00:33:33,255 --> 00:33:34,015
okay?

657
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:37,055
You haven't eaten yet, right?

658
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,015
I've ordered my men
to make your favorite dishes.

659
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,015
You should have something.

660
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:46,136
I want to visit Father.

661
00:33:48,136 --> 00:33:48,815
Ying,

662
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:52,216
finish your meal,

663
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:54,216
and I'll take you there.

664
00:33:55,856 --> 00:33:57,456
You're so worried about Father

665
00:33:57,575 --> 00:33:59,015
that you can't sleep

666
00:33:59,095 --> 00:34:00,335
or eat.

667
00:34:01,295 --> 00:34:03,176
Father will be worried too

668
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:05,656
if he sees you in this state, right?

669
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:19,296
Young Master.

670
00:34:19,575 --> 00:34:20,736
You guys may leave first.

671
00:34:21,655 --> 00:34:23,416
Young Master, what about
Lieutenant He...

672
00:34:23,615 --> 00:34:24,376
It's fine.

673
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,110
Lieutenant He was
deceived and bewitched.

674
00:34:27,736 --> 00:34:29,095
She has reflected upon her actions.

675
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,655
She knows her fault now.

676
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:32,296
You guys may leave.

677
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,256
- Yes.
- Yes.

678
00:34:50,816 --> 00:34:51,695
Father,

679
00:34:53,695 --> 00:34:55,736
I'll definitely find the culprit

680
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:58,896
behind this incident

681
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:01,456
and avenge you.

682
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:08,896
Let me stay here and look after Father.

683
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:09,655
No.

684
00:35:15,256 --> 00:35:16,015
Ying,

685
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:19,695
all of us are upset

686
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:23,655
that Father ended up like this.

687
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:25,736
We're on high alert as well.

688
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:30,135
I'm afraid someone is still trying
to harm Father.

689
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:33,055
That's why we came up

690
00:35:33,055 --> 00:35:34,456
with a shift schedule.

691
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:38,055
Ying,

692
00:35:38,896 --> 00:35:39,936
return to your room

693
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:42,296
and sleep.

694
00:35:43,535 --> 00:35:44,630
I'll bring you to see Father

695
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:47,615
tomorrow morning.

696
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:50,495
Will you keep your words?

697
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,376
Of course.

698
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:14,495
In my opinion,

699
00:36:14,495 --> 00:36:16,055
why don't we just charge into Changzhou?

700
00:36:16,055 --> 00:36:17,416
We can snatch Great General Cui first.

701
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:18,456
After that, we can treat him.

702
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:21,776
We'll tell them that you weren't the one
who harmed Great General Cui.

703
00:36:21,776 --> 00:36:22,936
Are you dumb?

704
00:36:22,936 --> 00:36:24,175
If we did that,

705
00:36:24,175 --> 00:36:25,655
we have to attack Changzhou first.

706
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:26,535
If we do so,

707
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:28,470
Mister Shiqi will never be able
to explain himself.

708
00:36:28,535 --> 00:36:29,776
By then, the Cui Army

709
00:36:29,776 --> 00:36:31,615
will definitely see us as sworn enemies.

710
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:34,015
Mister Shiqi.

711
00:36:35,055 --> 00:36:35,736
Taozi.

712
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,896
What are you doing here?

713
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,816
Where's Lieutenant He?

714
00:36:37,816 --> 00:36:38,495
How is she doing?

715
00:36:38,816 --> 00:36:40,055
Lieutenant He is under arrest.

716
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,560
Young Master is keeping her
under heavy surveillance.

717
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,095
He even wanted to lock me up.

718
00:36:43,215 --> 00:36:44,816
I figured that I should escape

719
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:45,936
and come here with Ear.

720
00:36:46,055 --> 00:36:47,456
I should regroup with you guys

721
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:49,360
and see if there's a way for us
to find out the truth.

722
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:51,055
Who exactly harmed Great General Cui?

723
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,495
Did he sustain internal injuries?

724
00:36:52,615 --> 00:36:53,655
Or was he poisoned?

725
00:36:53,936 --> 00:36:55,416
It's likely that he's poisoned.

726
00:36:55,655 --> 00:36:56,615
What kind of poison?

727
00:36:56,936 --> 00:36:58,055
I read his pulse in a hurry.

728
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:01,055
Young Master sent his men to arrest me
before I could figure it out.

729
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:10,416
Ying,

730
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,816
Father had a heart-to-heart
conversation with me

731
00:37:13,256 --> 00:37:14,615
before he fell unconscious.

732
00:37:15,495 --> 00:37:17,175
He allowed me to acknowledge my ancestry

733
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,535
and changed my name
back to Liu Chengfeng.

734
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:21,336
He also said

735
00:37:21,695 --> 00:37:23,296
that I was still his son.

736
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,896
Has Father told you about that?

737
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:30,856
At first, Father thought

738
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,936
you were dead.

739
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:35,015
He was heartbroken.

740
00:37:36,575 --> 00:37:38,015
He did tell me about it before.

741
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,535
He thought that he'd let you down

742
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:42,055
by letting you

743
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:43,376
carry the name Cui Lin

744
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:45,215
all these years.

745
00:37:45,776 --> 00:37:47,055
He regretted

746
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,350
that he didn't allow you
to be your true self.

747
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:54,215
Father also mentioned one thing.

748
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:56,535
Father said

749
00:37:57,095 --> 00:37:58,416
he would let me marry you

750
00:37:58,416 --> 00:37:59,695
after I changed my name back

751
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:03,135
to Liu Chengfeng.

752
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:06,736
Father even said

753
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,695
that our first child

754
00:38:08,695 --> 00:38:10,135
could take the surname Liu

755
00:38:10,336 --> 00:38:12,655
while the other children could take

756
00:38:13,015 --> 00:38:14,936
the surname Cui.

757
00:38:15,256 --> 00:38:17,495
This way, both the lineage of
the Cui and Liu family

758
00:38:17,615 --> 00:38:18,976
will be preserved.

759
00:38:20,015 --> 00:38:20,776
Ying,

760
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:22,495
Father had everything

761
00:38:22,495 --> 00:38:23,575
thought out for us.

762
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:25,215
It's a shame

763
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:26,175
that Li Ni

764
00:38:26,175 --> 00:38:27,736
harmed him

765
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:29,776
before he could proceed with it.

766
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:34,416
Young Master,

767
00:38:36,336 --> 00:38:38,175
are you sure Father said that?

768
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:39,055
Of course.

769
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,256
Ying,

770
00:38:52,336 --> 00:38:54,296
let's get married.

771
00:38:55,336 --> 00:38:57,015
This way, you'll be my wife.

772
00:38:57,896 --> 00:38:59,776
And, no one will dare

773
00:39:00,535 --> 00:39:01,816
to mention the incident

774
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:03,510
where you put your sword
on my neck again.

775
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:05,615
Once we

776
00:39:05,615 --> 00:39:06,736
get married,

777
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:09,936
you can look after Father properly.

778
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:12,655
Father is unconscious

779
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:14,055
and his life is in danger.

780
00:39:16,376 --> 00:39:18,095
Now, you actually want
to hold a wedding?

781
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:20,095
What if Father regains consciousness

782
00:39:20,336 --> 00:39:21,575
out of joy?

783
00:39:23,816 --> 00:39:25,296
It was Father's arrangement.

784
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:27,495
Ying,

785
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:30,615
are you not willing to do so?

786
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:31,695
No, I'm not willing.

787
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:33,776
Father won't make such

788
00:39:33,776 --> 00:39:34,856
an arrangement.

789
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:37,015
If you don't believe me,

790
00:39:38,215 --> 00:39:39,896
you can wait until Father wakes up.

791
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,215
You can ask him personally by then.

792
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:43,256
I told you already.

793
00:39:43,695 --> 00:39:44,695
Father will never

794
00:39:44,695 --> 00:39:45,736
make such an arrangement!

795
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:47,256
I suppose you've been

796
00:39:47,256 --> 00:39:48,856
too worried about Father's health

797
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:50,655
that you're getting muddle-headed.

798
00:39:51,376 --> 00:39:52,376
Don't worry.

799
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,256
I will make arrangements

800
00:39:54,456 --> 00:39:56,095
for our wedding.

801
00:39:57,456 --> 00:39:58,896
The only thing you need to do now

802
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:01,336
is to become my bride.

803
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,215
Keep an eye on Lieutenant He.

804
00:40:16,776 --> 00:40:19,015
Do not allow her
to step out of the room.

805
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,936
Bring the archers here.

806
00:40:21,695 --> 00:40:23,736
Maintain tight security.

807
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:26,615
I don't even want

808
00:40:26,615 --> 00:40:27,976
to see a fly here.

809
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:29,256
- Yes.
- Yes.

810
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:43,296
Councillor Wang is here.

811
00:40:43,296 --> 00:40:44,336
Congratulations.

812
00:40:53,256 --> 00:40:54,695
Bride,

813
00:40:54,896 --> 00:40:56,816
the auspicious hour is nearing.

814
00:40:56,816 --> 00:40:59,055
You should get dressed up.

815
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:00,095
Where's Liu Chengfeng?

816
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:01,655
Tell him to come here.

817
00:41:02,695 --> 00:41:03,736
Bride,

818
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:05,816
today's your wedding.

819
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,015
You're going to get married
to Young Master Cui soon.

820
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:09,776
You have no idea how lucky you are.

821
00:41:09,776 --> 00:41:11,015
Bring Young Master Cui here.

822
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:12,175
I need to talk to him.

823
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:13,095
If not,

824
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:16,296
I won't let this wedding proceed.

825
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:17,575
But...

826
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:18,575
Bring him here!

827
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:22,135
Yes.

828
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,256
Congratulations.

829
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,649
(Prefectural Governor's Residence)

830
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:37,336
Congratulations.

831
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:04,615
Ying,

832
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,296
why haven't you dressed yourself yet?

833
00:42:08,256 --> 00:42:09,449
It'll be terrible

834
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,936
if we miss out on the auspicious hour.

835
00:42:13,336 --> 00:42:14,175
It was you.

836
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:19,695
It was you, right?

837
00:42:22,215 --> 00:42:24,376
What kind of poison
did you feed Father?

838
00:42:27,736 --> 00:42:28,416
Look at you.

839
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,736
Did you lose your mind from all the joy?

840
00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:33,416
Why are you spouting nonsense?

841
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,215
I was almost assassinated at Changzhou
not long ago.

842
00:42:38,936 --> 00:42:40,776
Someone impersonated you to lure me out.

843
00:42:41,095 --> 00:42:42,175
However, he only abducted me

844
00:42:42,175 --> 00:42:43,495
without harming me.

845
00:42:43,655 --> 00:42:45,296
I thought something was off back then.

846
00:42:46,095 --> 00:42:47,095
You were the one

847
00:42:47,095 --> 00:42:48,376
who lured me outside, right?

848
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,870
You were the one
who sent the assassin too, right?

849
00:42:51,215 --> 00:42:51,976
Ying,

850
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:54,695
stop spouting nonsense.

851
00:42:57,055 --> 00:42:58,695
I've been waiting for this day

852
00:43:00,095 --> 00:43:02,095
ever since I was a teen.

853
00:43:03,736 --> 00:43:05,655
Today's our wedding.

854
00:43:06,495 --> 00:43:07,575
You'll become

855
00:43:07,575 --> 00:43:08,856
my bride soon.

856
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,896
Once we get married,

857
00:43:12,376 --> 00:43:14,135
I'll definitely treat you well.

858
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:16,495
I'll also kill Li Ni

859
00:43:17,135 --> 00:43:18,655
to avenge Father.

860
00:43:21,695 --> 00:43:23,256
Avenge Father, huh?

861
00:43:24,695 --> 00:43:25,936
Liu Chengfeng,

862
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,470
you may be able to deceive the others,
but you won't be able to deceive me!

863
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:37,416
You were the one

864
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:38,695
who poisoned Father, right?

865
00:43:39,976 --> 00:43:41,416
Father always treated you

866
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:42,936
as his own son.

867
00:43:43,736 --> 00:43:44,976
Since young,

868
00:43:45,896 --> 00:43:47,736
I always treated you
as my elder brother.

869
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:50,936
How cruel must you be

870
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:52,976
for you to do something like this?

871
00:43:56,055 --> 00:43:56,816
Ying,

872
00:43:58,655 --> 00:43:59,416
look.

873
00:44:00,615 --> 00:44:02,856
I made this hairpin for you.

874
00:44:03,615 --> 00:44:05,456
Today, I finally have the chance

875
00:44:06,215 --> 00:44:07,776
to give it to you

876
00:44:07,776 --> 00:44:08,816
as my love token.

877
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:10,776
Take it away.

878
00:44:14,936 --> 00:44:15,695
Ying,

879
00:44:17,495 --> 00:44:19,256
you better don't move.

880
00:44:20,215 --> 00:44:21,896
You might get hurt.

881
00:44:23,055 --> 00:44:24,456
What if Father finds out

882
00:44:24,575 --> 00:44:25,816
that you're hurt?

883
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:30,135
What if

884
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:31,535
something bad happens to him?

885
00:44:31,695 --> 00:44:33,856
How dare you blackmail me
with Father's life?

886
00:44:34,495 --> 00:44:36,655
Father will be happy

887
00:44:37,336 --> 00:44:38,736
as long as you get married to me.

888
00:44:41,135 --> 00:44:43,095
What if something bad happens to Father

889
00:44:46,376 --> 00:44:48,296
because he's worried about you?

890
00:44:48,296 --> 00:44:49,416
Scram immediately!

891
00:44:59,015 --> 00:44:59,695
Ying,

892
00:45:01,456 --> 00:45:03,055
you should take a break.

893
00:45:05,856 --> 00:45:07,736
I need to invite Father

894
00:45:08,896 --> 00:45:11,416
to witness our wedding too.

895
00:45:17,535 --> 00:45:18,535
How dare you?

896
00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:21,135
Touch Father if you dare!

897
00:45:27,776 --> 00:45:28,655
Ying,

898
00:45:29,575 --> 00:45:31,816
Father will be fine

899
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:35,215
as long as you get married to me.

900
00:45:36,976 --> 00:45:37,816
Someone.

901
00:45:41,336 --> 00:45:42,376
Yes, Young Master.

902
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:45,456
Dress Lieutenant He up.

903
00:45:46,736 --> 00:45:48,055
Bring her to the wedding hall

904
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:50,495
once the auspicious hour has arrived.

905
00:45:51,135 --> 00:45:51,896
Yes, Young Master.

906
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:16,535
- Congratulations, Young Master.
- Congratulations, Young Master.

907
00:46:16,555 --> 00:46:17,508
(Cui)

908
00:46:17,535 --> 00:46:19,575
We must drink until we drop today.

909
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,110
It's a shame that Great General
hasn't recovered from his condition.

910
00:46:22,135 --> 00:46:23,736
If not, we'll have double the happiness.

911
00:46:46,376 --> 00:46:47,215
Father,

912
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:51,456
today's my wedding with Ying.

913
00:46:53,976 --> 00:46:55,976
Look at all the guests we have here.

914
00:46:56,535 --> 00:46:58,135
All of them are here to congratulate us.

915
00:47:00,816 --> 00:47:01,575
Father,

916
00:47:02,896 --> 00:47:04,296
although you're still sick,

917
00:47:04,535 --> 00:47:06,416
I still want you

918
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:08,575
to witness our wedding.

919
00:47:17,256 --> 00:47:18,215
Father,

920
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,296
I've been your son

921
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,495
for over 20 years.

922
00:47:26,456 --> 00:47:28,416
You've never agreed

923
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,015
to let me marry Ying.

924
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:34,376
That's why I can only

925
00:47:35,575 --> 00:47:37,175
depend on myself

926
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:40,336
to realize my own wish.

927
00:47:42,695 --> 00:47:43,495
Father,

928
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:46,976
I brought you outside

929
00:47:47,816 --> 00:47:50,376
to show you

930
00:47:52,776 --> 00:47:56,336
that both the Cui Army

931
00:47:58,336 --> 00:48:00,736
and your precious daughter are mine.

932
00:48:03,976 --> 00:48:05,055
Father,

933
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,416
from now on,

934
00:48:09,055 --> 00:48:10,376
I will inherit

935
00:48:10,376 --> 00:48:11,896
the empire you built.

936
00:48:12,376 --> 00:48:13,776
I will also watch over

937
00:48:13,776 --> 00:48:15,535
your precious daughter.

938
00:48:19,495 --> 00:48:20,416
Shu.

939
00:48:43,135 --> 00:48:43,896
Lieutenant He.

940
00:48:58,655 --> 00:48:59,135
Father,

941
00:49:00,655 --> 00:49:03,135
I will propose a toast to you.

942
00:49:04,456 --> 00:49:05,495
After this,

943
00:49:06,896 --> 00:49:11,296
I will marry Ying.

944
00:49:13,196 --> 00:49:13,695
Here.

945
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:40,380
