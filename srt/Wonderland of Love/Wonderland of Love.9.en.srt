(Zhenxi)

30
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,720
Luoyang

31
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,241
has a strong defense and high walls.

32
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:52,570
It's easy to defend and hard to conquer.

33
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,961
And, there's Fu Yuan'er too.

34
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,540
Although he's a general
of ethnic minorities,

35
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,960
he's one of Sun Jing's old subordinates.

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,761
He has always been loyal to Sun Jing.

37
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:00,059
So, Shiqi,

38
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,321
we should only attack the city
if we have no choice.

39
00:02:02,741 --> 00:02:04,059
And, the Cui Army has their eyes on us

40
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,779
in the left vicinity.

41
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,580
If we fail to conquer the city,

42
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:09,201
we'll face a two-pronged attack.

43
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:10,900
It's not like Luoyang City

44
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:12,081
has perfect defense.

45
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,579
Sun Jing's brother-in-law, Duke Zheng,

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,401
is overseeing the battle
in Luoyang City.

47
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,220
He's ambitious yet incompetent.

48
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,201
And, he's on bad terms with Fu Yuan'er.

49
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,280
In my opinion,

50
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,201
he's the biggest weakness
of Luoyang City.

51
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:27,681
Mister Shiqi,

52
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:29,340
a messenger from Luoyang City

53
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:30,121
wishes to see you.

54
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,720
Summon him.

55
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,560
General Fu, you actually came here alone.

56
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:44,241
You're daring indeed.

57
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,081
Your Highness, you flatter me.

58
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,821
(Prefectural Governor of Luoyang)
Courage

59
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:53,641
(Fu Yuan'er)
is the only thing I have.

60
00:02:57,501 --> 00:03:00,500
You must be Pei Xian's youngest son.

61
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:02,600
Back then, when your father and I

62
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,940
were conquering Yiluo,

63
00:03:05,941 --> 00:03:07,921
I suppose you were still a baby.

64
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,220
General Fu, when you attacked Yiluo

65
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:11,720
over a decade ago,

66
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,739
you stormed
the leader's tent by yourself

67
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,521
and beheaded their king.

68
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,139
I was young back then.

69
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,840
I thought it was just a myth.

70
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:21,500
Now that I'm seeing you in person,

71
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,641
you're as mighty as what I've heard.

72
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm old now.

73
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,380
Just forget about the past.

74
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:30,660
You're the young hero here.

75
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:31,859
Sir, how could I be a hero

76
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,401
when you're right in front of me?

77
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:34,320
Please.

78
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:42,660
I've heard about the conflict between

79
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:44,521
the Zhenxi Army and the Cui Army

80
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:46,440
in Bingzhou.

81
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,840
Your Highness,

82
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,739
since you captured Han Li,

83
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,699
why didn't you

84
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,299
conquer Jianzhou too?

85
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,620
You actually let the Cui Family

86
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:57,320
took advantage of the situation.

87
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,641
The Zhenxi Army

88
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,139
isn't as wealthy as the Cui Army.

89
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,280
We could only exchange Jianzhou
for food supplies.

90
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:07,081
I was helpless too.

91
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,459
Your Highness, don't you wish to
vent out your frustration

92
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,780
and take back the military supplies

93
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:13,921
from the Cui Army?

94
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:15,961
General Fu, I'm afraid you forgot

95
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,760
why I came to Luoyang City
in the first place.

96
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,520
Your Highness, I know you intend
to conquer Luoyang City.

97
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,659
I know that very well.

98
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,579
But now,

99
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,841
the Zhenxi Army lacks food supplies.

100
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:36,600
Your soldiers are tired too.
If you attack Luoyang head-on,

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,041
you're only making things easier

102
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,041
for the Cui Army.

103
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,880
You still want to let them
take advantage of you?

104
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:48,620
People say that General Fu

105
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,200
is mighty and strong.

106
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,820
But I never expected you

107
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,259
to be so good

108
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,681
at driving a wedge between us too.

109
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,601
Although I'm driving a wedge
between you two,

110
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,681
I'm also telling you the truth.

111
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:01,300
Your Highness, if you don't strike now,

112
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,740
Cui Yi's forces will grow
stronger and stronger.

113
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:06,540
He'll reap the grains you sowed

114
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,560
and end up being too powerful
for you to deal with.

115
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:13,139
Don't tell me Cui Yi is
easier to get along with

116
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,200
compared to Grand Governor?

117
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,361
General Fu, you should
get straight to the point.

118
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:23,481
Right now, both armies
are outside of my city.

119
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,560
I'm indebted to Grand Governor.

120
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,019
With your current forces,

121
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,940
it's not easy for you

122
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:33,601
to conquer Luoyang head-on.

123
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,540
If you crush the Cui Army

124
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,060
within three days,

125
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:38,579
I shall deliver

126
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,300
half of the city's supplies to you

127
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,400
once the deed is done.

128
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:47,241
And, I won't stop the Zhenxi Army

129
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:49,681
from passing through the city.

130
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,161
Your Highness, you should
consider my proposal.

131
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,041
You can give me your reply tomorrow.

132
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,921
All right.

133
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,000
Farewell.

134
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,300
I've already ordered my men

135
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:16,860
to prepare 30 carts
of military supplies.

136
00:06:16,861 --> 00:06:18,801
They'll arrive by tonight.

137
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,080
Take it as a gift from me.

138
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,281
General Fu, aren't you afraid
that I'll attack Luoyang

139
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,080
after taking your supplies?

140
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:31,699
I can still afford to give out

141
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,921
30 carts of military supplies, you know?

142
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,161
Farewell.

143
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:47,921
That fool, Han Li,

144
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:49,459
I never expected him

145
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,560
to lose Bingzhou and Jianzhou
in such a short time.

146
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:55,000
I thought he could at least
engage the Zhenxi Army

147
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,899
in a war of attrition

148
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,400
since he was a veteran.

149
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:02,041
I didn't expect him
to be this incompetent.

150
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,440
The Zhenxi Army was working together
with the Cui Army.

151
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,161
Naturally, Han Li cannot defeat them.

152
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:08,779
Now,

153
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,779
the Zhenxi Army will surely
target Luoshui.

154
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,380
Should we pull back

155
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:13,699
some of our forces

156
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,241
that are heading to Baiyue?

157
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:18,699
Conquering Baiyue

158
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,121
will expand our territory.

159
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:23,880
The Li Family of the Dayu Dynasty

160
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:26,620
had always suffered defeat
at the hands of Baiyue.

161
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:30,161
If I can conquer Baiyue,

162
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:32,880
the world will be impressed.

163
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:34,080
Yes, Grand Governor.

164
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:35,500
However, we're in dire straits.

165
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:36,640
Recruit more troops.

166
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:40,060
Try to recruit as many troops
as you can.

167
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:41,459
Although Li Ni is capable,

168
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,281
his forces are limited.

169
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,200
I'll surround him

170
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,060
and trap him

171
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:48,000
at the bank of Luoyang.

172
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:53,960
Red wine from Western Regions, huh?

173
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,681
Shiqi,

174
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,481
that Fu Yuan'er

175
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,481
is old and devious indeed.

176
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:01,899
He frankly drove a wedge between us.

177
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,899
We didn't even have a chance

178
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,000
to refute him.

179
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,080
Fu Yuan'er.

180
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,241
He's a mighty general.

181
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,779
He's brave and has wits.

182
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,121
However, he's only loyal to Sun Jing.

183
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:17,000
What a shame.

184
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,200
Shiqi,

185
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,259
say,

186
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,000
how much of his words
do you think we can trust?

187
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,520
Send a letter to Fu Yuan'er

188
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,699
tomorrow morning.

189
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,921
Tell him that I've agreed to it.

190
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,040
What?

191
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:35,241
Are you saying
that you'll attack the Cui Army?

192
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,640
After that, send another letter

193
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,680
to the Cui Army.

194
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,000
What are you up to again?

195
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:42,459
I'm trying

196
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,400
to take back everything we've lost

197
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:46,579
plus the interests

198
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,361
before things get out of hand.

199
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,820
Duke, you mustn't go there!

200
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:52,459
I'm Duke Zheng!

201
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,099
General Fu is sick!

202
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,739
All of you, scram!

203
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,379
Stupid servants!

204
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,180
Duke!

205
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:56,339
I want to see Fu Yuan'er!

206
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,180
Duke!

207
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:58,300
Fu Yuan'er!

208
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:00,180
You're arrogant and rebellious!

209
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:01,540
I've returned to Luoyang
for half a month!

210
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,241
How dare you keep refusing to see me
by saying that you're sick?

211
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,601
I already received a secret report.

212
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,099
You went

213
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,060
to the main camp

214
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:14,699
of the Zhenxi Army
and met Li Ni in private

215
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,241
a few days ago.

216
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:17,000
Tell me!

217
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,099
Are you colluding with Li Ni

218
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,800
behind Grand Governor's back?

219
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:22,000
That's right.

220
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:25,000
I did visit the main camp

221
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,520
of the Zhenxi Army and met Li Ni

222
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:31,121
three days ago.

223
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,880
Excellent.

224
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:35,840
Since you've already owned up
to your crime,

225
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,601
you should hand over the general's seal.

226
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,780
General Fu,

227
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:42,760
you're in control of the Luoyang Army.

228
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:44,619
What if you launch a two-pronged attack

229
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,060
with Li Ni?

230
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:47,841
The Grand Governor
will be in trouble then!

231
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,920
Grand Governor granted me
the general's seal himself.

232
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,920
Unless he comes here personally.

233
00:09:58,901 --> 00:10:00,339
If not,

234
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,820
I will never hand over
the general's seal.

235
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:03,760
You and your fancy words!

236
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,339
I met Li Ni

237
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,920
because I wanted to force him
to attack the Cui Army.

238
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:15,000
Both armies have deployed troops
to Luoshui.

239
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:16,920
If they work together,

240
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,520
Luoyang City will be in danger.

241
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,361
Our best solution

242
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,280
is to make Li Ni

243
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,640
crush the Cui Army.

244
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:39,820
So, General Fu,

245
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:41,060
according to you,

246
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:42,660
you have a way

247
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:45,000
to make Li Ni crush the Cui Army, huh?

248
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,361
What a coincidence.

249
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,979
Li Ni just sent a letter here.

250
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,140
He said he would crush

251
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:52,859
the Cui Army at the hour of Wei.

252
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,260
Duke Zheng, are you willing to join me

253
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:57,361
as we spectate the feat

254
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,561
on top of the city's wall?

255
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,160
(General Fu, this is my promise.)

256
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:06,400
(We'll attack the Cui Army
at the hour of Wei today.)

257
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:08,200
You should stay at the back
and observe the formations.

258
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,820
How could our marshal
be in the frontline?

259
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:11,400
Fu Yuan'er will never fall for it

260
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,961
unless I head there myself.

261
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,361
Besides,

262
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,140
we have to show the Cui Army

263
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:18,160
the strength of the Zhenxi Army.

264
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,081
Reporting in!

265
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:39,400
The Zhenxi Army has launched
a full-scale assault

266
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,680
toward the Cui Army!

267
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,499
What are you guys doing?

268
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,660
Mister Shiqi told us to fake it, right?

269
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:30,160
Isn't it the same no matter
who we fight?

270
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,600
Nonsense! Fighting your own comrades?

271
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,499
- Fight the Cui Army!
- Fight them!

272
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,520
Go now!

273
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:37,160
Beat them up!

274
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:39,961
Let's go!

275
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,160
You!

276
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:58,060
Hey! Watch where you're stepping!

277
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:00,201
How dare you step on my hand?

278
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,241
I thought you were dead.

279
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,000
Are you a zombie?

280
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,499
So, the Zhenxi Army

281
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,260
only consists of timid individuals

282
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:09,880
who only bully the weak, huh?

283
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:12,361
You brat.

284
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,920
I'll teach you a lesson today!

285
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,800
So, it's you.

286
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,441
I saved you again.

287
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:13,660
Fine.

288
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:15,321
I'll return the favor then.

289
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,362
(Fengtai Gate)

290
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,940
Why are they trying to kill you?

291
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:43,600
Although they look unfamiliar to me,
and tried to not expose themselves,

292
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,800
I have doubts about them.

293
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,481
Shiqi!

294
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:48,841
Are you okay?

295
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,601
You're hurt?

296
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,979
Come on.

297
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,240
I thought we were supposed to fake it?

298
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,160
What's going on?

299
00:14:55,821 --> 00:14:57,601
I think we're done here.

300
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,000
Let's go.

301
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:04,280
Reporting in!

302
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:07,481
How did it go?

303
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,540
According to our scouts,

304
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,099
the Zhenxi Army has
crushed the Cui Army.

305
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,300
Young Master Cui is injured.

306
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,339
The Cui Army has retreated by 30 li.
They're regrouping.

307
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,640
Although the Zhenxi Army won the battle,
they suffered major losses.

308
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,060
Their marshal , Li Ni, had his leg injured.

309
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:18,481
They've carried him back to the camp.

310
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:19,920
Good.

311
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,241
General Fu,

312
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,300
people say that Li Ni is crafty

313
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:26,499
and the Cui Army is mighty.

314
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,321
They don't seem that mighty to me.

315
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:31,099
Why don't I attack both of them

316
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,880
so that we can deliver good news
to Grand Governor?

317
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:34,400
Wait.

318
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,441
I already gave Li Ni my promise.

319
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,180
I'll give him half of the city's supplies

320
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,481
as long as he crushes the Cui Army.

321
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:46,160
I'll also allow him
to pass through Luoyang City.

322
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,561
What?

323
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,940
You're giving him our supplies?

324
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:51,680
And, you're allowing them to pass too?

325
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,400
Are you trying to stage a revolt here?

326
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,721
What do you know?

327
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:00,040
Luoyang is also Dongdu.

328
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:03,481
Its terrain and morale are different
from a usual city.

329
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:05,859
Right now, although Luoyang

330
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,180
has adequate soldiers and supplies,

331
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:09,499
if the Cui Army

332
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,459
and the Zhenxi Army
attack our city together

333
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,140
or try to surround us

334
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:14,540
and cut off our food supply,

335
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,260
we'll be landing Grand Governor

336
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:19,081
and the capital in danger.

337
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,020
You're just a coward
who's afraid of fighting them.

338
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:24,361
Stop saying fancy words!

339
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:30,540
I risked my life to drive a wedge
between the Cui Army

340
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,201
and the Zhenxi Army.

341
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,920
Right now, both of them
have suffered major losses.

342
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:39,180
I'm just afraid that there might be
more to this than meets the eye.

343
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:41,680
We have to lure them away
from Luoyang first.

344
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,579
After that, we can think of a plan

345
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,400
to divide and conquer them.

346
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:00,619
Does it hurt?

347
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,379
No.

348
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,680
It's just a scratch.

349
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:03,880
Ying,

350
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:05,521
why are you injured?

351
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:06,740
Young Master.

352
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:07,379
Young Master.

353
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,060
I'm fine.

354
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,121
I wasn't injured.

355
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,920
I'm glad that you weren't injured.

356
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:13,041
Young Master,

357
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,880
someone from the Cui Army

358
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:16,440
tried to kill me.

359
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,379
No.

360
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,700
I was wearing a mask just now.

361
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:22,321
They thought I was you.

362
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:24,880
Someone was trying to kill you.

363
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:29,521
If so, who do you think

364
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:31,680
is behind this?

365
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,561
Who else in the Cui Army

366
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,121
can keep targeting us

367
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,480
without sparing any effort?

368
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,400
Seems like Cui Li can't take it anymore.

369
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,440
He's getting tired of laying low, huh?

370
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:51,440
Young Master, don't worry.

371
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,521
I have a way to stop him.

372
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:58,160
Shiqi!

373
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,400
Shiqi.

374
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,899
So,

375
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,899
we're not having liquor today?

376
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,859
We're having tea instead?

377
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,240
Just regard the tea as the liquor.

378
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,300
Such excellent tea.

379
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,521
We have to drink more.

380
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:17,400
Wait.

381
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,521
Why are you so happy today?

382
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,640
Was there a joyous occasion?

383
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,841
You're on point.

384
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:29,540
That friend of mine,

385
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,321
it turns out that the lady he fell for

386
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,240
wasn't someone else's concubine.

387
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,321
Shiqi, you...

388
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:39,480
So, your friend

389
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,521
is still dwelling on that?

390
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:44,480
A man should be open-minded
and magnanimous.

391
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:46,640
I thought they severed
their ties already.

392
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:47,880
You don't understand.

393
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,321
Fine, I don't understand.

394
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,020
But people could tell

395
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:54,820
that Lieutenant He is very close

396
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:56,099
to Young Master Cui.

397
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,820
Even if she's not his concubine,

398
00:18:57,821 --> 00:19:00,720
I'm sure they're in a relationship.

399
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,379
Shiqi,

400
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,700
although both we and the Cui Army

401
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:08,460
are loyalists,

402
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:09,540
the Cui Family

403
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,339
surely has an ulterior motive.

404
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,880
They will be a threat to the nation
in the future.

405
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,220
Since when did you find out?

406
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:20,500
Since when?

407
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:22,099
Anyone who's not blind
can tell that easily.

408
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,379
You fell for Lieutenant He,

409
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,200
didn't you?

410
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,020
Is it that obvious?

411
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:29,521
If so, I'll try to be
more reserved next time.

412
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,640
Where are you going?

413
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:53,041
Lieutenant He,

414
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,081
time to eat.

415
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:57,801
Time to eat.

416
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,680
Taozi,

417
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,761
get me the deadliest poison
you can find.

418
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:02,880
The kind where it can kill a person
in one touch.

419
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,139
You...

420
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,801
Why are you asking for that?

421
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,640
Just get it for me.

422
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:08,521
All right. I'll go immediately.

423
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,880
Poison?

424
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:15,361
The deadliest poison, huh?

425
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,761
What's the matter?

426
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,579
Lieutenant He,
are you trying to silence me

427
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,200
because you know I'm here?

428
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,780
Your Highness, you're injured.

429
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,240
What are you doing here

430
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:24,880
instead of resting in your tent?

431
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,220
I'm sure

432
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:34,099
you went to battle
on your young master's behalf

433
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,680
in the past, right?

434
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:38,480
Of course not.

435
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,480
Young Master was unwell today.

436
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,120
That's why I went to the battlefield
on his behalf.

437
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:53,640
I already found out.

438
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:55,841
What do you mean?

439
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,041
I found out about your identity.

440
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,440
You found out about my identity?

441
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,041
I know your true identity. You are...

442
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:13,020
I know you aren't

443
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,880
Young Master Cui's concubine.

444
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:19,920
Yeah.

445
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,841
So what?

446
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,899
You're full of lies.

447
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,880
You liar.

448
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,880
Let me discuss something with you.

449
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:29,740
If I do capture Duke Zheng,

450
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:31,240
Luoyang will belong to me. Okay?

451
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:32,361
That won't do.

452
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,419
Even if you can capture Duke Zheng,

453
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,579
I can't let you take over Luoyang

454
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,099
unless the Zhenxi Army

455
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,419
can conquer Luoyang

456
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,160
without the Cui Army's help.

457
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,220
Lieutenant He,
I brought the poison here.

458
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:44,939
Are we going

459
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,480
to poison the Zhenxi Army?

460
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,801
We'll talk about it next time.

461
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:05,240
Lieutenant He,

462
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:07,440
what was Li Ni doing here?

463
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,179
What did he tell you?

464
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,001
You guys have things to discuss
in the future?

465
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:12,220
You never hid

466
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:13,460
anything from me in the past.

467
00:22:13,461 --> 00:22:15,081
But now, you don't tell me anything.

468
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,440
Will we be using the poison or not?

469
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,575
(Fengtai Gate)

470
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,060
The Cui Army suffered a major defeat!

471
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:36,720
They've retreated for 30 li!

472
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,060
General Fu,

473
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:39,920
we didn't let you down
during yesterday's battle!

474
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:42,480
Great job!

475
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:45,339
You do live up to your name
as your father's son!

476
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,880
General Fu, you flatter me.

477
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,220
His Highness was injured

478
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:49,500
after yesterday's battle.

479
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,200
He couldn't come here today.

480
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,899
He told me

481
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,841
to thank you for the supplies, General Fu.

482
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,060
I'm a man of my word.

483
00:22:57,061 --> 00:22:59,099
Since I promised to give him
our supplies,

484
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,361
I'd fulfill my end of the bargain.

485
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:03,419
Thank you, General Fu.

486
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,820
Tell Li Ni

487
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:07,561
to take care of himself.

488
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,121
Yes, General Fu!

489
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,300
Mister Shiqi, aren't these the food supplies

490
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:29,579
General Fu promised to give us?

491
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,281
Why are we setting an ambush here?

492
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,020
I'll show you guys

493
00:23:33,021 --> 00:23:34,480
a magic trick later.

494
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,200
What magic trick?

495
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,361
I'll make Duke Zheng

496
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,001
appear out of nowhere.

497
00:24:00,781 --> 00:24:01,880
Charge!

498
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,121
Come out!

499
00:24:08,221 --> 00:24:09,720
Come out!

500
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,960
Come out!

501
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:11,960
Come out!

502
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,081
Don't move!

503
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,139
General Pei Yuan!

504
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,980
How long will these supplies last us?

505
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:26,939
For quite some time.

506
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,460
And, we caught a big fish too.

507
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:30,601
Now, Luoyang is ours!

508
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,060
So, this is Duke Zheng,

509
00:24:36,061 --> 00:24:37,980
Sun Jing's brother-in-law, huh?

510
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:39,339
He's quite ugly.

511
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:39,980
Precisely.

512
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:42,001
If so, I'm sure Sun Jing's wife is ugly too.

513
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,980
I've never seen

514
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:45,240
a duke before.

515
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,460
His armor is pretty nice.

516
00:24:47,461 --> 00:24:48,801
Yeah.

517
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,980
A high-ranking official like him

518
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:53,400
actually cried after getting slashed?

519
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:56,099
High-ranking relatives of Luoyang City,

520
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,139
you think you guys can ambush us

521
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,579
by hiding within the carts?

522
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,780
Mister Shiqi has everything figured out.

523
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:02,561
He captured them all.

524
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,440
Since we've already captured Duke Zheng,

525
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:06,640
Luoyang City

526
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:08,640
is as good as ours.

527
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,780
That's right.

528
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:10,619
This is great.

529
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,761
This is great.

530
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,081
Let me go!

531
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:19,379
Let me go!

532
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,200
General!

533
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,500
Li Ni of the Zhenxi Army

534
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:22,880
and Cui Lin of the Cui Army

535
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,859
are bringing Duke Zheng

536
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,899
and his relatives

537
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,939
to the front of the city.

538
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,500
They say they're willing to exchange
Duke Zheng

539
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:28,740
and his captured relatives

540
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:29,659
for Luoyang City.

541
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,859
Don't kill me! Help!

542
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,920
Exchange him for the city?

543
00:25:32,221 --> 00:25:34,099
I don't care if he's a duke.

544
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,841
He's not as important as Luoyang City.

545
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:39,339
Only the Zhenxi Army

546
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,540
is capable of such a dirty trick.

547
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,020
It may be a dirty trick,

548
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:44,200
but it's effective.

549
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,960
Do you dare to make a bet with me?

550
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,761
No way.

551
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:51,859
Old Man Fu!

552
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,440
Listen up!

553
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,281
The imperial grandson,

554
00:25:55,301 --> 00:25:56,841
Marshal Li, said

555
00:25:57,061 --> 00:25:58,880
he would give you a chance.

556
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:00,220
As long as you open

557
00:26:00,221 --> 00:26:01,619
the gate of Luoyang,

558
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,500
we'll release Duke Zheng

559
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:05,561
and his relatives.

560
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,020
We promise

561
00:26:07,021 --> 00:26:08,939
we won't raid the city

562
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,281
or hurt any citizens.

563
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:12,561
What do you think?

564
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,361
It's a great deal, right?

565
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:23,321
Duke Zheng is Sun Jing's brother-in-law!

566
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,139
If you don't save him,

567
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,700
your Grand Governor Sun Jing

568
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:28,460
will never let you off!

569
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,680
Release the arrows!

570
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:38,640
Go ahead!

571
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:40,300
Shoot Duke Zheng if you dare!

572
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:41,419
See if

573
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,200
Sun Jing will chop your heads off!

574
00:26:45,261 --> 00:26:46,240
Fu Yuan'er!

575
00:26:46,781 --> 00:26:48,001
Have you lost your mind?

576
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:52,680
Fu Yuan'er! Don't!

577
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,379
Fu Yuan'er! Don't!

578
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,339
Come on!

579
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,761
Don't!

580
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,240
Come on!

581
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:02,640
Fu Yuan'er!

582
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,041
Don't!

583
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:14,160
Fu Yuan'er! You wretch!

584
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,480
Fu Yuan'er!

585
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,761
You're abusing your power
to exact revenge on me!

586
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:19,460
Everyone in the city

587
00:27:19,461 --> 00:27:20,619
is watching!

588
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,680
Grand Governor will never let you off!

589
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:27,561
That was a good shot.

590
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,859
It'll be terrible

591
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,300
if you miss your aim

592
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:31,841
and the arrow hits
Duke Zheng in the chest.

593
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,160
I've already sent my men
to attack Yingzhou.

594
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,700
We can't afford to let Cui Yi

595
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,240
enjoy his time now.

596
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,659
Grand Governor,

597
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,960
what an excellent ploy.

598
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:46,659
This way, the Cui Army

599
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,820
has to give up on Luoyang

600
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:48,939
in order to aid Yingzhou.

601
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,820
The Zhenxi Army won't be able to
achieve anything by themselves.

602
00:27:51,821 --> 00:27:53,561
By then, we can divide and conquer them.

603
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,680
Relay my message to Fu Yuan'er.

604
00:27:58,061 --> 00:27:59,820
Duke Zheng's greed
is a menace to the nation.

605
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:01,240
He deserves to die.

606
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,820
Tell him not to hesitate.

607
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:04,419
Tell him to defend Luoyang at all costs.

608
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,240
Yes, Grand Governor.

609
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:09,081
However, regarding Madam of Wei...

610
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:13,260
I'll ignore

611
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:15,240
that noisy woman.

612
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:20,020
Are Li Ni's two elder brothers

613
00:28:20,021 --> 00:28:21,920
still in Jiangnan?

614
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,820
Li Jun and Li Lai

615
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:24,939
cannot lead an army.

616
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,619
Now, they're trapped in Jiangnan.

617
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,920
They're no cause for concern.

618
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,081
Let them leave.

619
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,041
Grand Governor, you...

620
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,980
When the three of them gather around,

621
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:39,700
you'll find out who's the leader

622
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,400
of the pack.

623
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:43,880
How could his two inferior brothers

624
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,579
sit idly by and watch

625
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,179
their younger brother

626
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,880
soar to the sky?

627
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,880
Grand Governor, that's an excellent plan.

628
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:53,145
Brotherly discord

629
00:28:53,146 --> 00:28:55,339
is a common theme since ancient times.

630
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,260
It's time for Li Ni

631
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:58,579
to have a taste of that.

632
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,200
That's right.

633
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,001
Here.

634
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,521
Come.

635
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,179
Sun Jing is using a strange tactic here.

636
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,081
He's sending his main army to Yingzhou.

637
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:10,139
However, our main forces are here.

638
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,360
I'm afraid Father
can't hold them back for long.

639
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:15,761
Sun Jing is forcing us

640
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,440
to retreat from Luoyang.

641
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,160
I should head back to Yingzhou.

642
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,960
You won't make it in time
even if you depart now.

643
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:22,561
What should we do then?

644
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,440
Mainly, Yingzhou is too far away.

645
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,041
If we can pass through Wangzhou,

646
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:31,020
we can shorten our travel time.

647
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,619
Not only can we provide aid to Yingzhou,

648
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,041
but we can also conquer Luoyang.

649
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,240
However, Wangzhou
is under Li Ni's control now.

650
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,081
I'm just afraid he won't agree to it.

651
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,300
With our current strength,

652
00:29:44,301 --> 00:29:45,339
there's still some room left

653
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,859
for a negotiation.

654
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,680
What?

655
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,200
Yingzhou is in a state of emergency?

656
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:51,260
The news source is reliable.

657
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:53,281
Sun Jing's army is on its way there.

658
00:29:53,781 --> 00:29:54,899
Seems like the Cui Army

659
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,200
will definitely act.

660
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:58,240
However, they might not be able
to reach Yingzhou in time.

661
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:00,601
If they wish to make it back in time,

662
00:30:00,781 --> 00:30:03,880
Cui Lin needs to pass through Wangzhou.

663
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,440
What do you mean by that?

664
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,321
Are you lending Wangzhou to them?

665
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:15,041
I'm waiting for them
to offer their conditions.

666
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,874
(Taiqing Palace)

667
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:24,801
Chang'er,

668
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:27,761
find some medical books
together with Miss Taozi.

669
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,880
Yes, Your Highness.

670
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,760
Miss Taozi.

671
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:43,561
The grand view of Dongdu

672
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,200
can only be seen at a high altitude.

673
00:30:46,981 --> 00:30:48,640
Overlooking the plains of Luoyang,

674
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,880
endless horde of rebel army march.

675
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:54,321
Blood staining the field of wild grass,

676
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:56,440
the wolves in full battle array.

677
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:01,761
Your Highness, you're quoting
a poem from Li Bai.

678
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,521
Are you being sarcastic here?

679
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,761
I'm just feeling sentimental
all of a sudden.

680
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:11,081
The grand and magnificent Dongdu

681
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,920
has been involved in the war.

682
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:14,680
There's no peace now.

683
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,720
I wonder when the war will end.

684
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,720
Your Highness, you knew

685
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,001
that the battles would never stop

686
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:27,801
and people would die
when you raised your army.

687
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,001
World peace can only be acquired

688
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,880
by winning the war.

689
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,160
I just hope

690
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:38,761
that I can take back our empire

691
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:42,041
and return peace to the people
as soon as possible.

692
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:47,761
I hope so too.

693
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,920
Back then, you said

694
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,500
you wanted the help

695
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:10,801
of our spies in the capital

696
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,440
to help you save Lord Liang.

697
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:15,720
I can do that.

698
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,521
Only if you win against me first.

699
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,841
Judging from your words,

700
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,601
seems like you're up to something again.

701
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,601
Your Highness, are you willing

702
00:32:29,821 --> 00:32:31,321
to make a bet with me?

703
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,640
I know you're a cautious person.

704
00:32:36,741 --> 00:32:38,561
I'll tell you the bet then.

705
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,440
If I win,

706
00:32:41,021 --> 00:32:43,001
you need to let me
pass through Wangzhou.

707
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,379
If you win,

708
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,820
the Cui Army

709
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:48,240
will help you save Lord Liang.

710
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:52,041
It sounds pretty fair.

711
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:53,240
What kind of game are we playing?

712
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,880
What kind of game, huh?

713
00:32:58,541 --> 00:32:59,880
It's very simple.

714
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,500
Close your eyes.

715
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:03,540
I'll count from one to ten.

716
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,220
If you open your eyes

717
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:07,480
before I count to ten,

718
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:09,041
it's my win.

719
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:19,179
Don't tell me you want to

720
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,619
knock me out again
when my eyes are closed?

721
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,619
Don't worry.

722
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,240
I won't do anything that'll harm you.

723
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:25,640
What do you think?

724
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,561
Fine.

725
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:36,041
But,

726
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,281
I'll do the counting myself.

727
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,579
I will never open my eyes

728
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,841
even if you prick me with your needles.

729
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:44,460
All right. Close your eyes then.

730
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:45,680
You may start counting.

731
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:53,680
One,

732
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,001
two,

733
00:34:02,781 --> 00:34:04,680
three,

734
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,846
four...

Taoist,

758
00:36:01,581 --> 00:36:03,979
I heard that there was a sole copy
of a medical book

759
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,880
that could only be found
in the library of Taiqing Palace.

760
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,441
May I read it?

761
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:09,700
According to our ancestors' rules,

762
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,921
we never borrow books to outsiders.

763
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,001
Taoist,

764
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,700
I'm willing to do

765
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:16,539
all kinds of heavy chores here.

766
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,220
Please allow me

767
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:19,240
to read it in the library.

768
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,260
You're a lady.

769
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:23,760
How can you do heavy chores?

770
00:36:23,821 --> 00:36:24,300
I...

771
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:26,180
Taoist, I'm willing
to do the heavy chores for her.

772
00:36:26,181 --> 00:36:27,440
Taoist.

773
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:29,080
I'm willing to help her sweep the place.

774
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,200
Taoist, I'm willing to help too.

775
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,160
Please grant her request.

776
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:37,561
If so, you two, please get some water.

777
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:38,780
You two,

778
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:40,280
please sweep the library.

779
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,921
Miss Taozi, let me help you out.

780
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,160
That won't do.

781
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:55,740
You're here to help me.

782
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:57,521
You're not here to work for me.

783
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,700
And,

784
00:36:58,701 --> 00:37:00,200
why are you trying to help me?

785
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:02,059
I don't know either.

786
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,899
Anyway, I just want

787
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,840
to help you out.

788
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:19,899
Judging from your looks,

789
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,220
you two look educated.

790
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:22,700
Please refrain from damaging the books

791
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:23,921
when you sweep the place.

792
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,780
Yes, sir.

793
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:25,601
Yes, sir.

794
00:37:29,221 --> 00:37:30,379
Take a break.

795
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,360
I'll do the cleaning.

796
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,561
The imperial grandson is doing chores
on my behalf?

797
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:35,121
I don't think that's appropriate.

798
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,961
Since I lost the bet,

799
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,840
let me show you my sincerity.

800
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,820
It's very lifelike.

801
00:38:49,821 --> 00:38:50,921
Excellent work.

802
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:54,539
I'll call this
the Imperial Grandson's Labor.

803
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,780
What do you think?

804
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:56,840
The name is even better.

805
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:12,617
(Imperial Grandson's Labor)

806
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:15,881
I guess you'll give it to me.

807
00:39:15,942 --> 00:39:17,075
(Imperial Grandson's Labor)

808
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:20,660
I drew this.

809
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:22,160
Why must I give it to you?

810
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,939
But you drew me.

811
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,041
Naturally, it's mine.

812
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:37,620
What are you laughing at?

813
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:38,580
Nothing.

814
00:39:38,581 --> 00:39:39,740
What were you laughing at?

815
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:41,360
It's nothing. It's a secret.

816
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,539
Just tell me.

817
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,760
What were you laughing at?

818
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,899
You're not allowed

819
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,160
to be angry after hearing this.

820
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:48,840
Tell me first.

821
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,820
You kept me near your heart

822
00:39:52,821 --> 00:39:54,339
and brought it with you
everywhere you went.

823
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:54,939
When you miss me,

824
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,419
you can take a look at it.

825
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,100
That's why I'm happy.

826
00:39:57,101 --> 00:39:58,561
I'll smile when I'm happy.

827
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:00,441
You and your slick tongue!

828
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:06,800
Thanks for the gift.

829
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:08,640
You're haunting me

830
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,401
everywhere I go.

831
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:14,300
All right.

832
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:15,521
Let's get straight to business.

833
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,419
Since you won the bet,

834
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,760
I'll keep my end of the bargain
and allow you to pass through Wangzhou.

835
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,700
But when will you agree to help me

836
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:22,881
save my father?

837
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,939
Why don't you consider

838
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,441
helping me to conquer Luoyang first?

839
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,121
That's negotiable.

840
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,760
Your Highness, seems like

841
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,921
you're confident
that you can conquer Luoyang.

842
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,680
First,

843
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,401
we've deployed our troops
outside Luoyang.

844
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,200
We're already halfway there.

845
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:43,379
And, Duke Zheng was captured.

846
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,680
That means we're 70% there.

847
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,320
Although Fu Yuan'er is brave and mighty,

848
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,519
he doesn't understand the political
situation in the imperial court.

849
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,441
He has no idea
what the noble families are up to.

850
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,800
That means we're 90% there.

851
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,401
Since we're already 90% there,

852
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:55,899
conquering Luoyang City

853
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,521
will be a piece of cake.

854
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,360
Your Highness, you're devising
all these strategies to save your father.

855
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,800
He's so lucky.

856
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:10,481
He's my father.

857
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,160
Naturally, I'll save him.

858
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:15,320
He's in Sun Jing's hand right now.

859
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:18,800
I'm afraid Sun Jing might kill him

860
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,840
after we conquer Luoyang.

861
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:27,200
If so, why don't we

862
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,881
back him to a corner?

863
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,481
Back him to a corner?

864
00:41:40,141 --> 00:41:41,859
Fu Yuan'er refused to save Duke Zheng

865
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,041
under a false order from Grand Governor.

866
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,979
I'm afraid Fu Yuan'er won't save

867
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,820
the other masters as well.

868
00:41:47,821 --> 00:41:48,620
What should we do then?

869
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:49,300
What should we do?

870
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:49,820
Yeah.

871
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:51,240
We can't depend on Fu Yuan'er now.

872
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,499
We have to depend on ourselves
to save our masters.

873
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,441
He's right.

874
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,419
General!

875
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,360
We're in trouble!

876
00:42:01,781 --> 00:42:02,680
Come in!

877
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,339
Duke Zheng's family members
led their private troops

878
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,459
to knock out the city guards

879
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,240
and open the gate.

880
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,160
The Zhenxi Army and the Cui Army
have entered the city!

881
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,800
What?

882
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:12,360
We're done for.

883
00:42:14,141 --> 00:42:15,760
This is the end.

884
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,521
Those fools.

885
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:21,700
I never expected them

886
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:23,700
to give Luoyang City away.

887
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:26,240
I'm going to kill those fools!

888
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:28,561
Defend the city with your life!

889
00:42:32,781 --> 00:42:33,700
Acquire the supplies first!

890
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:35,081
Don't worry, Shiqi!

891
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,960
(The Zhenxi Army and the Cui Army
attacked Luoyang together.)

892
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,720
(They couldn't find a breakthrough point
after surrounding them for a long time.)

893
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,019
(Li Ni used a clever trick)

894
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,459
(and tricked the family members of
Duke Zheng to open the gate.)

895
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,459
(That's how the Zhenxi Army
and the Cui Army were able to enter the city.)

896
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,180
(Fu Yuan'er resisted the invasion
with all his might.)

897
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:51,601
(Zhenxi)
(The battle lasted for two days and one night.)

898
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:53,041
(In the end, Luoyang fell.)

899
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:26,465
(Cui)

900
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:06,800
I owe Grand Governor my life.

901
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,800
Initially, I wanted to defend Luoyang

902
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:13,441
to repay him.

903
00:44:14,261 --> 00:44:15,601
But now,

904
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,521
Luoyang has fallen.

905
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:24,800
Seems like

906
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,601
I have no choice

907
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:33,760
but to return my life
to the Grand Governor.

908
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,720
Excellent.

909
00:45:04,221 --> 00:45:05,881
Excellent.

910
00:45:07,781 --> 00:45:09,921
In the future, the world

911
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,200
will belong to young heroes like you.

912
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:23,140
How exciting would it be

913
00:45:23,141 --> 00:45:25,800
when you two fight each other

914
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,521
to rule over the world!

915
00:45:34,661 --> 00:45:36,041
It's a shame

916
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,840
that I can't witness it myself.
