you can come with me

But I understand your feelings.

54
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,411

to see me sacrifice my life

Mister Shiqi,

80
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:24,817
I knew you would come this way
when you left the pass.

81
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:26,538
So, I brought our men

82
00:06:26,617 --> 00:06:28,096
to meet you here.

83
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:28,977
So, what do you think?

84
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:30,297
We're pretty loyal, right?

85
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:32,976
Unlike someone

86
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:35,577
who knocked out his brother.

87
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:36,536
Go back first.

88
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:37,817
There's an ambush nearby.

89
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:40,578
All right.

90
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:54,057
Withdraw.

91
00:06:58,737 --> 00:06:59,617
Taozi.

92
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:01,482
Taozi,

93
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:02,281
I brought

94
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:03,521
your favorite dried nuts.

95
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:04,201
Here you go.

96
00:07:11,602 --> 00:07:12,641
What's wrong?

97
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,362
Don't you want
to eat dried nuts anymore?

98
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:19,722
It's not that I don't want
to eat dried nuts.

99
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:22,042
It's just that tomorrow

100
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:24,680
I have to leave with Lieutenant He

101
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:26,321
after the troops withdraw.

102
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:29,641
Why so soon?

103
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:34,360
The Great General learned

104
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:36,201
that the Lieutenant He
suddenly fell seriously ill.

105
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:37,440
He was extremely worried

106
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,720
and insisted on coming
to personally escort the Lieutenant He.

107
00:07:39,722 --> 00:07:40,880
But he's the Great General

108
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,121
in charge of two towns.

109
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:44,601
If he appears abruptly at Tong Pass,

110
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:46,641
it might lead
to misunderstandings in the court.

111
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:48,920
So, the Lieutenant He said
we have to withdraw quickly.

112
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:51,321
So, we can meet the Great General
on the way.

113
00:07:51,962 --> 00:07:53,761
Then, I'll go send you off tomorrow.

114
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,602
Don't bother.

115
00:07:55,762 --> 00:07:57,441
Lieutenant He is not in a good mood.

116
00:07:57,522 --> 00:07:58,320
I don't want her

117
00:07:58,321 --> 00:07:59,801
to see anyone from the Zhenxi Army.

118
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,961
I'll go and talk to Mister Shiqi

119
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:04,441
to apologize to the Lieutenant He.

120
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,801
Come back here.

121
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:09,201
Don't interfere

122
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:10,561
if you don't know anything.

123
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:11,801
But...

124
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:16,922
But I don't want to part ways with you.

125
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,641
What you see in dreams may not be
as real as what you see in paintings.

126
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:30,401
So, parting ways may not be
as sad as you think it is.

127
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,802
What does that mean?

128
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:38,082
Lieutenant He said it.

129
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,202
It means

130
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:42,401
if people stay apart long enough,

131
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,761
they won't feel sad anymore.

132
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:47,082
I see it differently.

133
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,800
As long we stay apart,

134
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:51,121
I would feel sad.

135
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,082
If we stay apart long enough,

136
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,722
I would be very sad.

137
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:55,641
Why are you doing this?

138
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:57,602
Not even giving her a farewell.

139
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:59,600
Instead, you're standing here,

140
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:01,401
staring at the empty space.

141
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,001
Who says I'm staring at the empty space?

142
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:07,962
I'm looking at the terrain
on both sides.

143
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:12,080
Whether you look or not
doesn't matter now.

144
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,281
What matters

145
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:16,121
is when you start feeling empty inside
while waiting here.

146
00:10:16,122 --> 00:10:18,562
Only then you'll know
what it feels like.

147
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:20,082
Here.

148
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:22,481
Did the people we sent out last night

149
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:23,761
find anything?

150
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:27,641
There are some traces in this forest.

151
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:28,960
But it's hard to tell.

152
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,281
Those people are very cautious

153
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:31,881
in their actions.

154
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:33,761
Oh!

155
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:34,680
Could it be

156
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,361
that they are targeting Miss Cui?

157
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:38,080
I heard Miss Cui

158
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:39,481
is still not well.

159
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:40,320
When she left,

160
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:41,680
she traveled in a carriage.

161
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:43,202
Aren't you going to escort her?

162
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:46,440
They're not going after her.

163
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:48,202
They're likely after me.

164
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:49,722
Besides,

165
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:52,600
she has the army guarding her,

166
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:53,241
and her father

167
00:10:53,242 --> 00:10:55,001
also sent elite soldiers
to meet up with her.

168
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,562
She'll be fine.

169
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:58,680
You sure

170
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:00,361
are stubborn.

171
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:01,481
If you don't go after her,

172
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:03,401
you'll regret it in the future.

173
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:06,840
We should focus

174
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:08,241
on important matters.

175
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:09,682
We've secured Tong Pass,

176
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:11,521
and the army should return
to the capital.

177
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:18,482
What are you looking at?

178
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,401
I'm watching

179
00:11:20,402 --> 00:11:22,241
two lonely geese in the sky.

180
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:25,082
One is heading south,
and the other is heading north.

181
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,641
It's quite pitiful.

182
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,041
I wonder

183
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:32,362
if they can fly together.

184
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:57,001
Lord Qin requested
to return to the capital

185
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:58,482
and will be back today.

186
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,600
At first, the Ministry of Rites
was considering

187
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:02,680
whether to have the officials
welcome him.

188
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,161
But Lord Qin declined.

189
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:06,281
However, today,

190
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:07,960
all the young ladies in the city

191
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,680
rushed to the streets

192
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:11,241
to see Lord Qin leading the army

193
00:12:11,242 --> 00:12:12,921
returning with victory.

194
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,080
It's widely spread

195
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,440
that Lord Qin is truly valiant

196
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:18,161
and awe-inspiring.

197
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:21,041
Father, say whatever you want to say.

198
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,161
When do you plan

199
00:12:23,162 --> 00:12:25,842
to visit Lord Qin?

200
00:12:25,882 --> 00:12:27,401
Three days later.

201
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:30,121
Why three days later?

202
00:12:30,882 --> 00:12:32,962
I'm waiting for someone.

203
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:34,842
When that person arrives,

204
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:35,881
only then I can go

205
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:37,562
and meet Lord Qin.

206
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:51,761
Hey, Bao.

207
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:53,082
Shiqi,

208
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:54,600
since we have nothing to do today,

209
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,120
let's go out of the city
for a horse ride.

210
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:57,241
No.

211
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:01,562
I heard Fengying Pavilion has received
a batch of good alcohol.

212
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:02,881
Let's go for a drink.

213
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:05,041
No.

214
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:08,121
What's going on with you?

215
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,521
Ever since we returned to the capital,

216
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:13,161
you've changed like a different person.

217
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:14,680
You're moody all day

218
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,322
and even pulling a long face.

219
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:17,482
What happened?

220
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:19,322
Who made you angry?

221
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,001
Or

222
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:22,481
did someone offend you

223
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:23,761
and you're upset about it?

224
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,241
In this world,

225
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:26,920
one thing can conquer another.

226
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:29,281
Do you think no one can deal

227
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:31,442
with the mighty and invincible Lord Qin?

228
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:32,840
Stop talking in riddles

229
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:33,600
and just tell me.

230
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:35,362
Don't listen to his nonsense.

231
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,320
Me? Talking nonsense?

232
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:39,560
It's better than someone being bothered

233
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:41,041
with wild thoughts.

234
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,682
Mister Shiqi,
Miss Gu is seeking an audience.

235
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:51,001
Greetings, Lord Qin.

236
00:13:54,242 --> 00:13:55,281
Your Highness.

237
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:56,842
Miss Gu, you're too kind.

238
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:04,442
Nanny?

239
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:06,722
Nanny, please sit.

240
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,482
Shiqi,

241
00:14:13,522 --> 00:14:15,442
you're all grown-up now.

242
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:20,521
Our little young master

243
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:23,881
is now Lord Qin.

244
00:14:25,242 --> 00:14:27,161
Since I arrived in the capital,

245
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,001
I've heard everyone praising

246
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:32,560
Lord Qin for his might.

247
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:33,840
Every young lady wants

248
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,041
to marry Lord Qin.

249
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:39,082
Nanny, why are you here?

250
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:44,001
I've been living in the countryside
for many years.

251
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:46,322
I'm not feeling well

252
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:48,962
and no one could send me to the capital.

253
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,320
This time,

254
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:52,521
it's all thanks to Miss Gu

255
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:55,041
who somehow managed
to send someone to find me,

256
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:57,641
asking if I wanted to see you.

257
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:01,241
Of course, I'm happy to do so.

258
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:09,962
Now that I've seen you,

259
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:13,682
I can die happily

260
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:16,840
even if I die now.

261
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:17,881
Nanny,

262
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:19,521
don't say such things.

263
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:21,802
I'm happy.

264
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,001
I'm truly happy.

265
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:25,121
Nanny,

266
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:26,641
since you're here,

267
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:27,802
stay with us.

268
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:29,362
My residence is quite spacious.

269
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:31,161
You can stay wherever you like.

270
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:32,322
All right.

271
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:33,921
All right.

272
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:42,602
You've grown up. You're all grown up.

273
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,241
Your Highness,

274
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:46,161
she's used to taking an afternoon nap.

275
00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:46,881
I've just

276
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:48,281
assisted her to sleep.

277
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:49,722
You can rest assured, Your Highness.

278
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,241
Thank you, Miss Gu.

279
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:55,161
It's a small matter,
not worth mentioning.

280
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:58,121
Nanny is getting old.

281
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,121
I once sent people to find her.

282
00:16:01,681 --> 00:16:03,401
But it was in vain.

283
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:06,082
I even thought

284
00:16:06,362 --> 00:16:08,322
I would never see her again.

285
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:11,800
The nanny's own son

286
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:13,401
is very unfilial.

287
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,240
I didn't give him money.

288
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,682
Instead, I asked village head
to question him thoroughly.

289
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:20,080
Nanny's family is poor.

290
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:22,161
So, I bought a few acres of good land

291
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:23,682
in your name.

292
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:24,361
The deed

293
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:26,200
is all in the nanny's name.

294
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:27,041
In the future,

295
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,521
if she doesn't want to stay
in your residence

296
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,040
and wants to retire to the countryside,

297
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,241
it should be enough.

298
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,202
Miss Gu,

299
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:37,800
you're a kind and thoughtful person.

300
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:38,962
Thank you.

301
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:44,121
Also, the money used to buy the land

302
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:44,840
will be sent

303
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,401
to your residence later.

304
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,482
Your Highness, you're too kind.

305
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:51,001
I'm not smart since I was a child.

306
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:52,361
To be honest,

307
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:55,001
I'm not favored by my parents.

308
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:57,761
So, whenever someone
is a little kind to me,

309
00:16:57,762 --> 00:16:59,401
I'm very grateful.

310
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:02,161
Your Highness, you saved my life.

311
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:03,481
I can never repay

312
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,161
such great kindness.

313
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:06,840
So, I can only do some

314
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:08,521
little things within my ability.

315
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:10,481
I only hope you will always be happy.

316
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:12,961
That's enough for me to be very happy.

317
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:15,201
Thank you.

318
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:19,880
The officials advised me

319
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:23,282
to reward Cui Yi

320
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:25,800
and to ingratiate myself

321
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:27,282
with the Cui family.

322
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,320
He already controls two prefectures,

323
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:31,400
Pingliang and Weiyang.

324
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:33,762
How can I reward them?

325
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:34,840
Besides,

326
00:17:34,841 --> 00:17:36,921
he doesn't have a son
whom I can confer a title to.

327
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:44,282
What can I do
to properly win the Cui family over?

328
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:47,521
Father,

329
00:17:47,522 --> 00:17:49,481
I have an idea.

330
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:51,042
Tell me quickly.

331
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,001
I heard

332
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:54,521
Cui Yi has a daughter,

333
00:17:54,522 --> 00:17:56,881
and she grew up in the military,

334
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:58,522
not inferior to a son.

335
00:17:58,841 --> 00:18:00,880
Since I have not yet married,

336
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:02,600
how about Father bestows Miss Cui

337
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:03,681
in marriage to me?

338
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,320
This way,

339
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:05,241
Miss Cui

340
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:07,120
becomes your daughter-in-law,

341
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:08,080
and Cui Yi

342
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:10,041
becomes my father-in-law.

343
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:11,080
Even if, in the future,

344
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:13,481
I ask him to withdraw from Dongdu,
it may be possible too.

345
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:14,721
Good.

346
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:17,681
This plan is good, very good.

347
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:28,002
I just don't know

348
00:18:29,962 --> 00:18:31,640
what Miss Cui looks like.

349
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:34,322
If she grew up in the military,

350
00:18:34,922 --> 00:18:36,802
is she rough?

351
00:18:36,922 --> 00:18:39,041
If her appearance is ugly

352
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:40,881
and her temperament is coarse,

353
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:44,041
wouldn't it

354
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:45,641
be really unfair to you?

355
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,880
I am your son.

356
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:49,721
So, I should share your worries.

357
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:51,760
Winning the Cui family
is to avoid suspicion

358
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,961
between the ruler and the subject.

359
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:55,120
This is my duty.

360
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:56,201
Father, rest assured.

361
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:59,681
Regardless of what Miss Cui's appearance
and character are like,

362
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:01,120
I am willing to marry her

363
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:02,600
and treat her well,

364
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,681
ensuring the Cui family

365
00:19:04,682 --> 00:19:06,002
remains loyal to you.

366
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:12,201
Lai,

367
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:16,121
you are the one
who considers the overall situation.

368
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,842
But don't worry.

369
00:19:17,962 --> 00:19:19,041
In the future,

370
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,881
I'll definitely give you
several beautiful women

371
00:19:20,962 --> 00:19:22,322
to serve you as side consorts.

372
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,120
I won't let you suffer

373
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,082
such unfairness for nothing.

374
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:27,481
Don't worry.

375
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:31,121
Father, have some tea.

376
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:32,042
All right.

377
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:36,800
Are you saying

378
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,481
someone from the court sent
a message saying

379
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:40,641
they want me to marry Lord Qi?

380
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:43,400
He's aiming at someone
outside of his league.

381
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:44,921
Who does Lord Qi think he is?

382
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:46,840
I can't believe he asks
for your hand in marriage.

383
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:49,521
The Emperor is indeed Li Ni's father.

384
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,600
Like father, like son,

385
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:53,242
who don't know their place.

386
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:00,282
All right, I'll stop.

387
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:03,362
I'll stop talking about the person
who was not to know good from bad.

388
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:04,602
Father,

389
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:06,562
I'm thinking,

390
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:09,362
since someone from the court
has such intentions,

391
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,560
why don't we play along

392
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:13,282
and turn the tables on them?

393
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:15,121
Ying,

394
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,201
do you mean...

395
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:19,120
We will openly write a memorial

396
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:20,400
to the Emperor.

397
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:21,560
In the memorial,

398
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:24,001
I agree to marry a prince.

399
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:25,721
But I want to choose

400
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:27,360
my husband

401
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:28,641
among the princes.

402
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:31,121
That Li Ni doesn't know his place.

403
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:33,400
Do you still want to marry him?

404
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:35,362
Whether or not I marry him
is another matter.

405
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:37,001
But since someone in the court

406
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,560
already has designs on our Cui family,

407
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:40,721
why not be straightforward

408
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:42,322
and use their own tricks against them?

409
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,921
Are you saying...

410
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:46,880
As long as I say

411
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:49,161
I want to choose a husband
from among the princes,

412
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,961
there will be a big commotion.

413
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:53,961
I don't know what actions

414
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,041
Li Ni's two older brothers

415
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:56,282
might take.

416
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:58,201
I'm curious to see

417
00:20:58,202 --> 00:20:58,961
how shameless

418
00:20:58,962 --> 00:21:00,161
they can be.

419
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:02,322
I'm also curious

420
00:21:02,482 --> 00:21:04,161
about Li Ni's reaction.

421
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:05,201
Ying,

422
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:07,242
this is your lifelong matter.

423
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:08,961
Don't act in anger.

424
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:11,842
Father, I'm not doing this out of anger.

425
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:13,281
Now,

426
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:15,640
you have control over Pingliang and Weiyang,

427
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,161
and our Cui Army is strong.

428
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:20,120
Many in the court are uneasy,

429
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:21,640
seeing us as a piece of meat

430
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:23,562
everyone wants to grab.

431
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:25,322
In that case,

432
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:27,481
why not make the first move

433
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:28,241
and weaken them

434
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:30,002
with internal conflicts first?

435
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:34,042
You must think carefully.

436
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,362
Once I submit this memorial,

437
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:39,761
you can only choose your future husband

438
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:42,242
from among the three princes.

439
00:21:42,841 --> 00:21:44,602
There's no turning back after that.

440
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:46,681
The final outcome

441
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:49,362
may not go as we wish.

442
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:53,161
Father,

443
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:55,322
I've considered

444
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:57,201
the interests and risks involved.

445
00:21:57,561 --> 00:21:59,481
Life is like a chess game.

446
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:01,160
This world

447
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:02,921
is the biggest game.

448
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:05,481
I want to be the one playing the chess.

449
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:09,282
Lord Qin has too many concerns
in his heart

450
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,282
and has no interest
in being the crown prince.

451
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,881
I had a long talk with him.

452
00:22:14,962 --> 00:22:16,562
But it had little effect.

453
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:18,800
Since he's willing to be a chess piece,

454
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:20,281
even if I have to force him,

455
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:21,120
I will make him

456
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:22,641
the other player.

457
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:25,201
Father,

458
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:28,362
I want to take this risk.

459
00:22:30,321 --> 00:22:31,522
Your Majesty,

460
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:34,201
in Cui Yi's memorial,

461
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:35,880
it claims Your Majesty intends

462
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,521
to bestow his daughter's marriage
to Lord Qi.

463
00:22:38,522 --> 00:22:40,121
Is this true?

464
00:22:42,682 --> 00:22:45,600
I did send someone to inquire.

465
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:48,002
Your Majesty's intention
is the imperial decree.

466
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:49,840
However, as a subject,

467
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,562
he dared to speak arrogantly,

468
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,842
wanting to choose a son-in-law
among the princes for his daughter

469
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:57,362
as if court customs meant nothing.

470
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,640
I ask Your Majesty to issue a decree

471
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:01,281
to rectify the court's morals.

472
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:02,441
That's right!

473
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:05,001
Cui Yi

474
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:07,320
is indeed too arrogant.

475
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:09,681
Does he see the imperial family
as a marketplace

476
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:11,322
where he can pick and choose?

477
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:14,800
Your Majesty,

478
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:15,961
Cui Yi controls two prefectures,

479
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:17,961
Pingliang and Weiyang,

480
00:23:17,962 --> 00:23:19,521
and now occupies Dongdu.

481
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:20,640
The court is already worried

482
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:22,761
about his excessive power

483
00:23:22,762 --> 00:23:24,600
without any checks.

484
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:26,241
It is wise for Your Majesty

485
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:29,362
to choose Miss Cui
as daughter-in-law.

486
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:30,320
Now,

487
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:32,961
it's only a gentle appeal
from Cui Yi requesting

488
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:35,802
to choose an imperial prince
for his daughter.

489
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:38,600
Your Majesty, why not agree?

490
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:41,281
This action costs
no soldiers or resources

491
00:23:41,282 --> 00:23:44,042
and can bring the military power
of the Cui family under control.

492
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:46,481
It's truly clever.

493
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:53,242
I also think this idea is not bad.

494
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:55,281
However, for my son

495
00:23:55,282 --> 00:23:56,921
to marry his daughter

496
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:58,320
is the ultimate honor

497
00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:00,082
for the Cui family.

498
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:02,041
How can they send a memorial

499
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:04,121
suggesting to choose one themselves?

500
00:24:04,202 --> 00:24:05,880
Your Majesty's words are correct.

501
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:07,120
The Cui family is impudent!

502
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,640
How can Miss Cui be worthy
of becoming a princess consort?

503
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,280
Military officers
who lack moral character!

504
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
However, as a ruler,

505
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,440
His Majesty has a broad mind
and can tolerate the world.

506
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,681
What the Cui family has done,
His Majesty can surely forgive.

507
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:21,120
Putting the ruler before the subjects
is just and proper!

508
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:22,360
There is no reason for a subject

509
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,160
to choose an imperial son-in-law.

510
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:25,800
You are stuck in outdated ways,

511
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:27,080
resistant to change!

512
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,441
You're old-fashioned and rigid!

513
00:24:28,442 --> 00:24:29,241
By speaking like this,

514
00:24:29,242 --> 00:24:30,840
you're not showing respect
to His Majesty

515
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,560
or honoring the traditions
of our ancestors!

516
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,070
You truly lack
an understanding of etiquette!

517
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,600
You're lacking
an understanding of etiquette!

518
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,920
You forgot
the teaching of the ancestors!

519
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,687
(Lord Xin's Residence)

520
00:24:40,922 --> 00:24:42,042
Thank you, sister-in-law.

521
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:43,160
You're too kind, Lai.

522
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:45,082
I'll leave you two to talk.

523
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:54,241
Jun, you sure have married
the right woman.

524
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,002
I'm truly envious.

525
00:24:56,401 --> 00:24:59,121
You rushed to my residence
right after the morning court ended.

526
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:00,842
What do you want?

527
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:02,761
Jun,

528
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:04,802
you must help me this time.

529
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:07,281
Cui Yi said he wants to choose
a son-in-law between me and Li Ni.

530
00:25:07,282 --> 00:25:07,961
Cui Yi said,

531
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:10,481
selecting among the princes.

532
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:13,921
I was thinking

533
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:15,481
that you already
have a princess consort.

534
00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:16,961
I supposed Miss Cui wouldn't want

535
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:18,521
to be a side consort.

536
00:25:18,522 --> 00:25:19,880
So, I thought

537
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:21,802
if you could help me

538
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,360
get the support of the Cui family,

539
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:28,042
I could definitely assist you
in moving into the Eastern Palace.

540
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:32,802
What do you think, Jun?

541
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:38,641
You have a point.

542
00:25:38,682 --> 00:25:40,681
We must not

543
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:44,721
let Miss Cui marry Li Ni.

544
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:47,161
Thank you, Jun.

545
00:25:52,841 --> 00:25:55,320
I'm impressed with Miss Cui

546
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,921
with all my heart
and sincerely convinced.

547
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,800
You see,

548
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:02,560
His Majesty wants to marry Miss Cui
to Lord Qi.

549
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,960
See how clever she was?

550
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,400
She voluntarily submitted a memorial,

551
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,281
stating that she wanted

552
00:26:06,282 --> 00:26:08,320
to choose a husband from the princes.

553
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:09,800
Isn't it obvious

554
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,840
that she wants to marry Mister Shiqi?

555
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:13,441
- Exactly!
- That's right!

556
00:26:13,922 --> 00:26:14,961
Mister Shiqi,

557
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:17,282
you have to show her some gestures.

558
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:19,080
Yes, show some gestures.

559
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,400
- Yes, you need to.
- Do it.

560
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:21,041
She only said

561
00:26:21,042 --> 00:26:22,640
to pick among the princes.

562
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:23,961
She didn't say it was me.

563
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,041
Stop being stubborn.

564
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,521
As a young lady,

565
00:26:27,522 --> 00:26:29,041
do you expect her to name you directly

566
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:30,041
to marry you?

567
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:31,001
Who else would she marry

568
00:26:31,002 --> 00:26:31,840
if not you?

569
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:32,600
That's right.

570
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:33,840
If she doesn't want to marry you,

571
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:34,600
why would she submit

572
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:36,041
such a memorial to His Majesty?

573
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:37,360
- That's right!
- Precisely.

574
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:38,160
- Shiqi.
- Exactly.

575
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,481
Marrying Miss Cui would be having
the best of both worlds,

576
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:41,082
am I right?

577
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:42,721
Miss Cui

578
00:26:42,722 --> 00:26:45,762
may be formidable at times.

579
00:26:45,962 --> 00:26:49,320
But she's Cui Yi's only daughter.

580
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:50,961
In the future, her husband

581
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:53,160
will oversee the entire Cui Army.

582
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:54,120
So, can we

583
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:55,401
let Lord Qi gain

584
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:57,560
this favorable situation?

585
00:26:57,561 --> 00:26:58,721
Of course not!

586
00:26:58,722 --> 00:26:59,280
Right.

587
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,480
- No way!
- We can't let him have it.

588
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,961
But that's not the crucial part.

589
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:03,681
What matters most?

590
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,721
It's that Miss Cui

591
00:27:05,801 --> 00:27:10,121
already has good feelings toward Shiqi.

592
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:11,600
General Pei Yuan

593
00:27:11,601 --> 00:27:12,802
is absolutely right.

594
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:14,602
Ear,

595
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:16,961
you must be happy this time, right?

596
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:19,320
If Miss Cui marries Mister Shiqi,

597
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:20,880
Taozi will naturally come

598
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:22,521
to Lord Qin's Residence.

599
00:27:22,522 --> 00:27:24,880
Then, you two

600
00:27:24,881 --> 00:27:27,042
can live together happily.

601
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:29,641
Yes, live a blissful life together.

602
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:33,681
Mister Shiqi.

603
00:27:33,682 --> 00:27:34,201
Yes.

604
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:35,640
Miss Cui's dowry

605
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:37,241
must be at least
three hundred carts, right?

606
00:27:37,242 --> 00:27:38,520
It has to be, it has to be.

607
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,441
Then our betrothal gifts
can't be lacking either.

608
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:41,562
Indeed.

609
00:27:44,282 --> 00:27:45,880
It's our village tradition

610
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:48,000
to have a pair of wild geese
as part of the betrothal gifts.

611
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,522
The groom must personally shoot them.

612
00:27:49,762 --> 00:27:51,001
Since we have nice weather now,

613
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,441
how about we accompany you
outside the city to hunt wild geese?

614
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:54,400
That's right.

615
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:56,080
If Mister Shiqi fails to get any,

616
00:27:56,081 --> 00:27:57,441
and we manage to shoot the geese,

617
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,360
does it count?

618
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,480
Of course, it doesn't count.

619
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,080
Didn't he say earlier
the groom must personally shoot them?

620
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:03,160
Of course, it counts.

621
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:04,880
We are Mister Shiqi's brothers,

622
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:06,001
his family.

623
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:06,400
Yes.

624
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:07,760
If family shoots, why wouldn't it count?

625
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,320
- No, it doesn't count.
- Yes, it counts.

626
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,241
- No, it can't!
- I said it does count.

627
00:28:11,242 --> 00:28:13,080
- It just doesn't count.
- All right. Enough already.

628
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:14,281
Stop fighting!

629
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:15,082
Shiqi.

630
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:16,401
Shiqi.

631
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:17,600
I say it counts.

632
00:28:17,601 --> 00:28:18,160
Mister Shiqi.

633
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:19,881
Mister Shiqi, where are you going?

634
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,720
When are we going to hunt wild geese?

635
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,201
We'll prepare the bows and arrows.

636
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:34,921
Young Master.

637
00:28:39,482 --> 00:28:40,322
Young Master.

638
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:41,602
What do you think

639
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:44,082
Ying meant

640
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:45,842
when she submitted this memorial?

641
00:28:49,442 --> 00:28:50,762
It's probably

642
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:53,961
because she doesn't want
to marry Lord Qi.

643
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:55,840
So, she politely declined.

644
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:57,762
It was because she only wanted
to marry Li Ni!

645
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:05,961
Why is Ying doing this to me?

646
00:29:07,682 --> 00:29:09,562
I have been devoted to her.

647
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:13,802
Can't she see that at all?

648
00:29:14,282 --> 00:29:15,161
Young Master,

649
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:16,160
the Lieutenant He was...

650
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:17,160
She must have hated me

651
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:18,881
because I borrowed troops

652
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:22,002
from Jieshuo.

653
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:29,242
She can hate if she wants.

654
00:29:30,442 --> 00:29:33,002
As long as I'm with her,

655
00:29:33,762 --> 00:29:35,602
I can slowly persuade her.

656
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:39,121
Sooner or later, she'll change her mind.

657
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:49,161
The place where Ying and I are going

658
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:52,002
is beautiful.

659
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:55,481
She'll surely like it.

660
00:29:57,202 --> 00:29:59,082
Both of us will stay there

661
00:30:00,002 --> 00:30:02,602
and live a carefree and leisurely life.

662
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:08,201
Have you prepared

663
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:11,042
the snacks she likes?

664
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:18,121
Once Ying and I are there,

665
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:21,921
no one will get in our way anymore.

666
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:33,401
Mister Shiqi.

667
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,720
Mister Shiqi, we have good news.

668
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,880
What's that piece of good news
that makes you this happy?

669
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,921
Miss Cui has sent someone

670
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:40,481
to invite you to a meeting
outside the city.

671
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:42,360
What did I tell you?

672
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:43,961
Miss Cui must be looking for you

673
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:45,762
to discuss this betrothal.

674
00:30:45,922 --> 00:30:47,721
You two like each other.

675
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:48,800
This time, Miss Cui

676
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:50,810
even took the initiative
to submit a memorial to His Majesty.

677
00:30:50,922 --> 00:30:51,721
For a young lady

678
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:54,401
to take such a step is not easy.

679
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:57,761
Regardless of any quarrels or disagreements
you had in the past,

680
00:30:57,762 --> 00:30:59,160
now that you'll meet,

681
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:01,281
make sure to reconcile

682
00:31:01,282 --> 00:31:03,161
and marry her.

683
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:08,961
Mister Shiqi, what's wrong?

684
00:31:12,922 --> 00:31:14,362
If she chooses me,

685
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:15,762
there's no need to meet.

686
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:18,002
Since she wants to meet me,

687
00:31:18,682 --> 00:31:20,161
I fear there might be some discord.

688
00:31:42,682 --> 00:31:44,602
Wonderland is still beautiful.

689
00:31:48,722 --> 00:31:49,681
Ying,

690
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:51,681
back at Tong Pass,

691
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:53,802
you asked us to think
about it individually.

692
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:56,641
The Great General submitted a petition,

693
00:31:57,962 --> 00:31:59,201
and I initially thought

694
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,641
you were unwilling to marry Lord Qi.

695
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:04,562
That's why you had to submit
that memorial.

696
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:07,082
Life is like a game of chess.

697
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:10,401
No one can navigate it alone.

698
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:13,322
I'm my father's only daughter.

699
00:32:13,962 --> 00:32:15,802
I'm bound to attract
the coveting desires of others.

700
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:19,762
So, are you willing to marry me?

701
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:32,441
My heart is more than willing.

702
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:35,002
But what about your two elder brothers?

703
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,881
Will they let it happen?

704
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:40,121
I told you

705
00:32:40,922 --> 00:32:42,842
I'm not interested
in crown prince's position.

706
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:45,001
I will find the great imperial grandson

707
00:32:45,002 --> 00:32:46,842
and have my father declare him
the crown prince,

708
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:48,961
leaving my brothers with no hope.

709
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:51,080
Do you think your brothers

710
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,840
will willingly accept
the great imperial grandson

711
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,721
as the crown prince?

712
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,201
After the great imperial grandson
moves into the Eastern Palace,

713
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:58,001
can he survive for even a year or so?

714
00:32:58,002 --> 00:32:59,082
With me around,

715
00:32:59,401 --> 00:33:00,521
I will ensure his safety

716
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:01,360
in the Eastern Palace.

717
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:02,320
Even if you can protect

718
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:03,961
the great imperial grandson in court,

719
00:33:03,962 --> 00:33:06,522
can you guarantee absolute security?

720
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:08,120
You're Lord Qin

721
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:09,481
with military power in your hands.

722
00:33:09,482 --> 00:33:11,241
When your brothers frame you

723
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,320
and the great imperial grandson
for usurping the throne,

724
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:14,802
how are you going to explain that?

725
00:33:14,962 --> 00:33:16,441
Will you relinquish your military power

726
00:33:16,442 --> 00:33:17,881
to prove your innocence?

727
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,320
Then who's going to protect
the great imperial grandson after that?

728
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:22,880
Even if you can bring
the great imperial grandson

729
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
back to Laolan Pass,

730
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,120
your simple-minded father

731
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:26,800
may order you to take your own life

732
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:28,160
after being instigated by others.

733
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:29,281
Will you comply

734
00:33:29,282 --> 00:33:30,362
or rebel when that time comes?

735
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:32,560
When you are in a desperate situation,

736
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:34,522
how will you protect
the great imperial grandson?

737
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:36,961
Shiqi,

738
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:38,041
I've already calculated

739
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:38,721
every move for you

740
00:33:38,722 --> 00:33:39,800
in this complex situation.

741
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:41,041
They are all dead ends.

742
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:43,160
Entering the Eastern Palace

743
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:44,961
is your only escape.

744
00:33:53,202 --> 00:33:55,401
I refuse to believe
that this is my only way out.

745
00:33:58,962 --> 00:34:01,721
Can you not always see human nature
as so treacherous?

746
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:09,521
Over time,

747
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:12,481
you will find out for yourself

748
00:34:12,561 --> 00:34:14,642
how complex and treacherous

749
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:16,362
human hearts can be.

750
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:21,722
So, did you ask me here

751
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:23,481
just to tell me all this?

752
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:24,961
Yes.

753
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:28,322
Do you like me?

754
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:42,682
One day,

755
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:44,362
I encountered someone.

756
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:47,322
He's exceptionally talented

757
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:49,202
and intelligent.

758
00:34:50,842 --> 00:34:51,881
He's unlike anyone

759
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,202
I've met before.

760
00:34:54,322 --> 00:34:55,961
The first time meeting,

761
00:34:55,962 --> 00:34:57,682
we had a tough fight.

762
00:34:58,522 --> 00:34:59,881
When we met the second time,

763
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:02,242
I kicked him into a well.

764
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:04,961
But at that moment,

765
00:35:05,442 --> 00:35:06,842
I knew

766
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:10,202
I liked him.

767
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,642
Even though

768
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:17,762
I've never liked anyone before

769
00:35:18,161 --> 00:35:20,481
or know

770
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:22,282
what it feels like,

771
00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:24,682
I'm certain

772
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:27,242
I like him.

773
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:31,041
Whether he's Shiqi from Laolan Pass

774
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:33,162
or Lord Qin,

775
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:38,722
whether he's a commoner,
the imperial grandson, or the crown prince,

776
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,961
I just like him as a person.

777
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:53,401
You like me

778
00:35:53,882 --> 00:35:55,322
and I like you too.

779
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:57,961
Why can't you marry me?

780
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:05,881
Please go back, Your Highness.

781
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:08,081
Perhaps after some time,

782
00:36:08,442 --> 00:36:10,081
you'll understand

783
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:12,080
that it's not about Lord Qin

784
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:13,601
wanting to return

785
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:16,122
to Laolan Pass

786
00:36:16,402 --> 00:36:17,722
and live as Shiqi.

787
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:20,122
But it's just that Lord Qin

788
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:22,642
cannot avoid becoming the crown prince
at the Eastern Palace.

789
00:36:31,362 --> 00:36:32,961
If I refused to be the crown prince,

790
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:36,282
would you refuse to marry me?

791
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,162
If I say yes,

792
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:51,601
would it make you feel better,
Your Highness?

793
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:03,242
If Mister Shiqi marries Miss Cui,

794
00:37:03,442 --> 00:37:05,001
then she'll stay in the capital.

795
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:06,295
Then you would also stay

796
00:37:06,922 --> 00:37:08,762
in the capital, right?

797
00:37:09,842 --> 00:37:11,802
Well, that's not certain.

798
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:13,401
Why not?

799
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:15,080
If Miss Cui already stays
in the capital,

800
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:16,322
where else can you go?

801
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:18,961
Maybe

802
00:37:18,962 --> 00:37:20,240
our Great General

803
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:22,881
won't agree to marry
our young lady to Lord Qin.

804
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:24,282
That's impossible.

805
00:37:24,522 --> 00:37:25,240
Your Great General

806
00:37:25,241 --> 00:37:26,921
already submitted a memorial

807
00:37:26,922 --> 00:37:29,600
to let Miss Cui choose her husband.

808
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:30,841
Isn't it obvious

809
00:37:30,842 --> 00:37:32,361
that she'll choose Mister Shiqi

810
00:37:32,362 --> 00:37:33,722
as her husband?

811
00:37:33,882 --> 00:37:36,080
Moreover, they agreed to meet today,

812
00:37:36,081 --> 00:37:38,001
probably to discuss the wedding.

813
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:41,321
You're weird.

814
00:37:41,322 --> 00:37:42,321
What does my young lady

815
00:37:42,322 --> 00:37:44,560
and Lord Qin's wedding discussion

816
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:46,842
have anything to do with us?

817
00:37:52,362 --> 00:37:53,202
Taozi.

818
00:37:53,362 --> 00:37:53,881
What?

819
00:37:53,882 --> 00:37:54,961
I like you.

820
00:37:55,002 --> 00:37:56,601
I want to be with you all the time.

821
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,282
Are...

822
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:00,242
Are you willing to?

823
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,322
Well...

824
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:09,682
What happened?

825
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:11,921
Why is Lord Qin

826
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,802
suddenly leaving on his horse?

827
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:15,601

what exactly

832
00:38:47,802 --> 00:38:49,240
did you tell Lord Qin just now?

833
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:51,162
Why did you suddenly leave on bad terms?

834
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:55,280
What does that mean?

835
00:38:55,281 --> 00:38:57,322
Didn't he come here
to discuss the betrothal?

836
00:38:57,442 --> 00:38:58,200
What happened?

837
00:38:58,201 --> 00:38:59,200
Don't tell me

838
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,762
he doesn't want to marry you anymore.

839
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:04,401
He's just not willing
to be the crown prince.

840
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,601
But he doesn't understand

841
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:08,521
that if he doesn't become
the crown prince,

842
00:39:08,522 --> 00:39:09,361
he might not be able

843
00:39:09,362 --> 00:39:11,722

844
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:13,802
How can he marry me?

845
00:39:14,161 --> 00:39:15,881
What's wrong with him?

846
00:39:15,882 --> 00:39:17,321
He clearly likes you so much,

847
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,441
to the extent of giving up his own life.

848
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:21,280
Is it harder for him

849
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:23,722
to be the crown prince
than to lose his life?

There are natural orders to follow,

It's getting dark,

855
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:46,481
and it's raining now, of all time.

00:39:47,002 --> 00:39:48,642

It's so early in the morning.

865
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:35,162
Why is he rushing back
from outside the city?

866
00:40:38,882 --> 00:40:42,682
He seems a little distraught.

867
00:40:42,721 --> 00:40:45,081
I wonder what happened.

868
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:55,081
Your Highness!

869
00:40:56,002 --> 00:40:56,921
Your Highness.

870
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,282
Something happened
at Lord Xin's residence.

871
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:00,322
What happened?

872
00:41:00,402 --> 00:41:02,401
There was a fire
at Lord Xin's residence last night.

873
00:41:02,442 --> 00:41:04,881
Consort Xin has passed away.

874
00:41:06,402 --> 00:41:07,401
What?

875
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:09,200
Is this true?

876
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:10,481
It's absolutely true.

877
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:12,122
No wonder

878
00:41:12,122 --> 00:41:14,601
there was a sudden fire
at Lord Xin's residence last night.

879
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:15,521
My poor sister-in-law,

880
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:17,160
along with all the maids and servants

881
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:17,881
failed to escape.

882
00:41:17,882 --> 00:41:19,361
All of them perished in the flames.

883
00:41:19,362 --> 00:41:21,720
It turns out
someone deliberately set fire.

884
00:41:21,721 --> 00:41:23,881
Our spy at Lord Xin's residence saw

885
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:25,680
that no one escaped,

886
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:26,961
which made him suspicious.

887
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:28,280
So, it took some effort

888
00:41:28,281 --> 00:41:29,441
to investigate the matter.

889
00:41:29,522 --> 00:41:30,600
Something seems to be amiss

890
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:32,001
at the Consort Xin's courtyard.

891
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:33,280
It also took some time

892
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:34,521
for people to put out the fire.

893
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:35,680
This incident

894
00:41:35,681 --> 00:41:37,162
was certainly arson,

895
00:41:37,201 --> 00:41:38,722
not an accidental fire.

896
00:41:38,922 --> 00:41:40,200
We just don't know

897
00:41:40,201 --> 00:41:41,601
who did it.

898
00:41:41,641 --> 00:41:42,801
I never expected

899
00:41:42,802 --> 00:41:43,640
the vast courtyard

900
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:44,881
behind Lord Xin's Residence

901
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:46,441
would be burnt to ashes.

902
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:47,520
The Consort Xin

903
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,480
and all the maids and servants
in the entire courtyard

904
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,842
didn't manage to escape.

905
00:41:50,922 --> 00:41:51,880
Something's not right.

906
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,122
What's not right?

907
00:41:55,482 --> 00:41:57,122
A lord's residence has regulations.

908
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:58,720
Lord Xin's Residence

909
00:41:58,721 --> 00:42:00,801
was renovated
from the former Lord Jin's Residence.

910
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:02,842
The pillars were made
of precious golden nanmu wood.

911
00:42:03,241 --> 00:42:05,122
It's very sturdy.

912
00:42:05,922 --> 00:42:08,642
Even the golden nanmu wood
turned into charcoal.

913
00:42:09,241 --> 00:42:11,202
But the bricks
on the nearby courtyard wall

914
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,041
are not charred.

915
00:42:14,962 --> 00:42:16,481
It also rained last night.

916
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:19,202
Yet, they couldn't
put out the fire in time.

917
00:42:19,522 --> 00:42:21,881
None of this adds up.

918
00:42:24,402 --> 00:42:25,561
Shiqi,

919
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:27,162
do you mean...

920
00:42:28,402 --> 00:42:29,881
It must be arson

921
00:42:30,002 --> 00:42:30,760
or someone poured oil

922
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:32,521
or used some kind
of inflammable substance.

923
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:34,560
Otherwise, even the golden nanmu wood

924
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:37,001
can't turn into charcoal
in such a short time.

925
00:42:45,121 --> 00:42:46,722
Since it's arson,

926
00:42:47,842 --> 00:42:49,521
Sister-in-law's death

927
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:51,561
has hidden motives.

928
00:42:52,522 --> 00:42:55,280
Who could set fire
to Consort Xin's backyard

929
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,362
and control the servants?

930
00:42:57,482 --> 00:42:58,401
Coincidentally,

931
00:42:58,402 --> 00:43:00,001
I asked Jun to help me

932
00:43:00,002 --> 00:43:02,441
regarding the betrothal with Miss Cui
a few days ago.

933
00:43:03,322 --> 00:43:04,842
Who else could it be?

934
00:43:06,442 --> 00:43:07,921
Are you suggesting

935
00:43:08,482 --> 00:43:10,202
that Lord Xin is behind this?

936
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:13,240
My elder brother dared

937
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:14,921
to burn his own wife to death.

938
00:43:14,922 --> 00:43:16,160
Clearly, he's targeting

939
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:18,561
Cui Yi's proposal to choose a son-in-law.

940
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:19,640
In that case,

941
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,841
he must also want to fight

942
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:22,001
for Miss Cui

943
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:23,561
and won't help me anymore.

944
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,521
Your Highness,

945
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,842
isn't this our chance?

946
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:33,481
You're right.

947
00:43:33,482 --> 00:43:34,921
If Father finds out,

948
00:43:34,922 --> 00:43:36,441
Jun won't be able
to marry Miss Cui.

949
00:43:36,442 --> 00:43:38,120
My chances of winning
will be even greater.

950
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,380
Your Highness, you're wise indeed.

951
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:46,001
I believe in a few days,

952
00:43:46,002 --> 00:43:48,282
Ni will also become suspicious
of this matter.

953
00:43:48,442 --> 00:43:50,481
By then, I must lend him

954
00:43:50,482 --> 00:43:52,120
a helping hand.

955
00:43:52,121 --> 00:43:53,881
After all, his feelings for sister-in-law

956
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,041
were the deepest back in the day,
and he admired her the most.

957
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:56,841
If he finds out

958
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,441
Jun is responsible
for sister-in-law's death,

959
00:43:58,442 --> 00:43:59,720
he'll surely report it to Father.

960
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,520
Then, Father will conduct
a thorough investigation.

961
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,361
By then, Jun

962
00:44:02,362 --> 00:44:04,282
will be in big trouble.

963
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,401
Lord Xin is really ruthless.

964
00:44:07,402 --> 00:44:08,722
Do you think

965
00:44:08,882 --> 00:44:10,722
it's Lord Xin's doing?

966
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,401
Who else could it be but him?

967
00:44:14,681 --> 00:44:16,081
I never expected him

968
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,361
to kill his own wife.

969
00:44:19,362 --> 00:44:21,481
That's the imperial family.

970
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:23,240
Family members harming each other,

971
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:24,921
siblings killing each other.

972
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,362
Even if he killed his wife,

973
00:44:27,522 --> 00:44:29,682
it's not something new.

974
00:44:32,561 --> 00:44:33,481
Father,

975
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,322
I want to go to Xichang.

976
00:44:37,281 --> 00:44:39,202
What do you want to do in Xichang?

977
00:44:39,922 --> 00:44:41,601
Lord Xin killed his wife

978
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:43,122
just to marry me.

979
00:44:43,402 --> 00:44:45,080
I want to see

980
00:44:45,081 --> 00:44:46,841
how he will fight

981
00:44:46,842 --> 00:44:48,481
with Lord Qi.

982
00:44:51,362 --> 00:44:53,282
You actually want to see

983
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:55,842
how Lord Qin will react, right?

984
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:01,200
Young Lady,

985
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:04,561
are we visiting nanny of Lord Qin today?

986
00:45:04,842 --> 00:45:06,401
Cui Yi submitted a memorial,

987
00:45:06,482 --> 00:45:09,081
wanting to choose a son-in-law
among the princes.

988
00:45:09,442 --> 00:45:10,760
This memorial

989
00:45:10,761 --> 00:45:12,122
is quite strange.

990
00:45:12,402 --> 00:45:14,041
What's strange about it?

991
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:16,401
I once saw

992
00:45:16,402 --> 00:45:18,401
the original text of this memorial.

993
00:45:18,962 --> 00:45:20,361
If Cui Yi submitted it

994
00:45:20,362 --> 00:45:22,481
to marry his daughter to Lord Qin,

995
00:45:22,482 --> 00:45:24,642
he would undoubtedly
use different wordings,

996
00:45:25,161 --> 00:45:28,001
and there could be subtle hints in the text.

997
00:45:28,522 --> 00:45:29,921
But there weren't any.

998
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,640
If Cui Yi didn't submit the memorial

999
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:35,041
to marry his daughter to Lord Qin,

1000
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:36,760
there might have been

1001
00:45:36,761 --> 00:45:38,842
another plan behind it.

1002
00:45:39,442 --> 00:45:41,200
So that's why you're going

1003
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:43,001
to Lord Qin's residence today.

1004
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,601
This morning,
I saw Lord Qin entering the city,

1005
00:45:45,962 --> 00:45:47,961
seemingly soaked from a night of rain.

1006
00:45:49,761 --> 00:45:51,881
He's usually a carefree person,

1007
00:45:52,641 --> 00:45:54,001
and almost never had such

1008
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:55,162
an appearance.

1009
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:57,680
I think

1010
00:45:57,681 --> 00:45:59,722
he must have encountered
an unexpected turn of events.

1011
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:01,282
And this may be related

1012
00:46:01,601 --> 00:46:02,521
to the memorial

1013
00:46:02,522 --> 00:46:04,081
the Cui family submitted.
