1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,580
Natsume-san's omelet is so delicious.

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,580
And the coffee you made too.

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,070
Ever since Emma's training ended yesterday,

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,170
Toma has been acting

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,390
a little strange.

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,920
Is he okay?
Emma's personal training...

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,330
Natsume-san...

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,100
I love you.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,520
So suddenly... what's wrong?

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,240
I just suddenly wanted to say it...

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,720
Maybe it's not just

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,430
that he's tired.

13
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,950
What is this feeling...?

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,280
Natsume-san.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,560
Aren't you eating?

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,420
Oh, no, I am.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,209
You too, hurry up and eat.

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,040
There are still tomatoes left.

19
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:59,790
Alright, alright.

20
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,070
I'll eat them.

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,840
I hope I'm just overthinking.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,300
"Cosmetic Playlover" Season 2
(Episode 2)

23
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,320
This weekend is the launch day
for our new summer foundation.

24
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,446
It's our product that we have the
most confidence in this season.

25
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,060
Please understand the customers'
skin concerns and distribute samples.

26
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,080
Please do your best to promote it.

27
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,310
Yes!

28
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,320
Also, sales for the new
lipstick are doing well.

29
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,690
Please continue your
efforts in that area too.

30
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,110
And,

31
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,270
I have a meeting at headquarters today.

32
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,060
Aizawa-san,

33
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,590
while I'm away,

34
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,090
I'll leave things to you.

35
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Understood.

36
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,870
Now, let's all work
hard with a smile today!

37
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,630
Thank you for your hard work.

38
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,780
While the interpretation
of the concept is good,

39
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,690
it doesn't fully highlight the
positives of the bone structure.

40
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,500
Also, pay more attention
to the lighting conditions.

41
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,730
Yes.

42
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,740
Atsushi's base makeup is really well done.

43
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,470
And the color scheme is excellent.

44
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,150
It's very pleasing to the eye.

45
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,790
I just followed the basics.

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,530
Oh dear.

47
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:17,949
Having personal
characteristics is a good thing.

48
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,970
Here we go again.

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,890
Well, this is fine for me.

50
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,640
Something important...?

51
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,030
Actually, I want to make you...

52
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,506
(Emma Lauren Makeup Artist Training
Workshop Location: Conference Room A)

53
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,020
Toma must be

54
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,650
working hard right now too.

55
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,500
I need to do my best too.

56
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,970
Mamiya-kun?

57
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Huh?

58
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,640
- Oh, long time no see.
- Long time no see.

59
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,620
You're looking well.

60
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,290
You as well, Chief Harada.

61
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,700
I'm not the chief any longer,

62
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,710
you are.

63
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,260
Oh, right... I just got
used to calling you that.

64
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,120
I heard you're working hard as a chief.

65
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,690
Thank you.

66
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,560
What are you doing now that
you're back at headquarters?

67
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,293
I'm in the training department.

68
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,340
To become a full-fledged trainer,

69
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,600
I'm learning every day.

70
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,880
A trainer, huh...

71
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,280
Is it completely different from a BA's job?

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,610
Perhaps it's the same in essence.

73
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,970
What a trainer needs to have is

74
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,820
a personality that genuinely
rejoices in others' growth,

75
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,280
and a convincing authority.

76
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,190
Also,

77
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,050
a passion for the brand, I suppose.

78
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,700
Ah, now that you mention it,

79
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,960
you actually possess all of that.

80
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,780
Huh? Me?

81
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,130
In June,

82
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:17,460
the new recruits that we're training might be sent
to your department, so please take care of them.

83
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,640
I'll be counting on you then.

84
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,340
Yes, of course, no problem.

85
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,810
Hello?

86
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,606
I figured your meeting would be over
by now, and you'd be on your way home.

87
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,630
Huh...

88
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,510
You're not secretly watching
me somewhere again, are you?

89
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,630
Because I'm on a break right now.

90
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
I see.

91
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,820
Will you be late again today?

92
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,420
Probably.

93
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,840
Natsume-san, you should go to bed first.

94
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,110
I can wait for you.

95
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,410
Being waited for actually stresses me out.

96
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,730
I might even sneak out
of training halfway through.

97
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,180
You can't do that.

98
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,870
I understand.

99
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,060
I'll go to bed first.

100
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,790
Okay.

101
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,020
Natsume-san.

102
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,580
Hmm?

103
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,260
Tell me to do my best.

104
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Okay.

105
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
Do your best.

106
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,340
Alright, I'll do my best.

107
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,490
Ah, I should get going.

108
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,030
- See you then.
- Mm.

109
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,570
I'm full.

110
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,180
It'll probably be like this
until the workshop ends.

111
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,350
Even though we live together.

112
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
No, no, no.

113
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,830
Don't, don't, don't.

114
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,930
He's working hard too.

115
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,440
I also need to

116
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,040
do what I can.

117
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,730
Alright, um...

118
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,390
I'm home.

119
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Natsume-san...

120
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,110
Good morning.

121
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,570
Morning.

122
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,410
Huh?

123
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,186
Toma, are you going to
the workshop again today?

124
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,210
Yes.

125
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,410
Natsume-san, you have
the day off today, right?

126
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,470
Yeah.

127
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,950
Then I should get going.

128
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,620
Wait.

129
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,840
It's your day off, you
could actually rest at home.

130
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,900
It's fine, I'll walk with
you part of the way.

131
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,980
You want to be with me that much?

132
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Huh?

133
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,590
Ah, no... um...

134
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,780
well what if I did, then so what?

135
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,340
No, I'm happy too.

136
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,280
But, I can go by myself from here.

137
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,930
Okay.

138
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:32,955
I understand.

139
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,510
Do your best.

140
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,080
Okay, I'm leaving.

141
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,630
Mm.

142
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,710
Natsume!

143
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,950
- Emma-san?
- You're just in time.

144
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,340
So, Natsume, what do you think?

145
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,600
About Toma taking the next step?

146
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,260
I'm very happy.

147
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,800
It also makes me feel
like I need to work harder.

148
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,870
It's a great motivation for me.

149
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I see.

150
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,660
As I said last time,

151
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,300
I also sensed his potential.

152
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,620
That's why this time,

153
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,050
I made thorough preparations like this,

154
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,970
looking forward to meeting him.

155
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Preparations?

156
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,250
I heard from Nanjo-kun

157
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,530
how to deal with that charmless Toma.

158
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,650
Nanjo-san?

159
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,420
He said the only way was
to bring up Natsume's name.

160
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,199
The moment your name was mentioned,

161
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,060
his eyes really changed, it startled me.

162
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,029
But thanks to that,

163
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,850
he finally got on track obediently.

164
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,970
I'm really sorry for using you.

165
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,700
Um... what do you
mean, Emma-san?

166
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,820
I have something important to tell you.

167
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,820
Something important...?

168
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,030
Actually, I'm considering

169
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,430
making you one of my successors.

170
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,030
Successor?

171
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,970
A top makeup artist?

172
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,050
That guy?

173
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,830
It's not like a promotion.

174
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:37,230
It's just a testing phase for promising stars
to see if they can be key training candidates.

175
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,060
Why him?

176
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,030
You see, makeup artists

177
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,130
all want to express themselves.

178
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,580
For example, Nanjo-kun is that type.

179
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,630
He wants to show originality in his makeup.

180
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,410
He's an artist at heart.

181
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,000
That's not a bad thing in itself.

182
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,940
However,

183
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:12,950
it's not suitable for becoming a
top figure who symbolizes the brand.

184
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,650
Consistently embodying the brand's colors,

185
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,830
and protecting the brand image,

186
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,020
these are the necessary
conditions for a top figure.

187
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,589
Toma, in a good way,

188
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,230
doesn't have strong personal preferences.

189
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,029
Rather than the artistry of makeup,

190
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,620
he's more interested in
structure and technique.

191
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,060
He can reliably absorb what's incomplete,

192
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,600
and flexibly adapt to corrections.

193
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,160
On top of that, the individuality he
displays is also very well-balanced.

194
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,539
This type of person

195
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,750
is very valuable to a brand.

196
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,699
Those who want to cherish their own style

197
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,530
often feel that the brand is a constraint,

198
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,380
so many don't stay long.

199
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
Morning.

200
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,310
Good morning.

201
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,810
Sahashi-kun, morning.

202
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,740
Hello.

203
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,970
Do your best today too.

204
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,510
There are countless people

205
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,260
with better skills than Toma.

206
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
However,

207
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,920
I feel he has potential worth training.

208
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,530
That's how I feel.

209
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,390
Emma-san.

210
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,500
Are you seriously considering him as...

211
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,190
You can ask him about the rest yourself.

212
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,900
What he'll do next is up to him.

213
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,550
Understood.

214
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
In any case,

215
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,679
you're not the only one who's happy

216
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,430
about Toma's growth.

217
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,740
So, Natsume, you do your best too.

218
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,749
I'm sure you two will influence each other

219
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,090
and grow together.

220
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Okay.

221
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,290
I understand.

222
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,710
The atmosphere got too serious, didn't it?

223
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,260
Alright, have a cup of
coffee before you go.

224
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,450
Have a pleasant holiday.

225
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,900
Ah.

226
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,110
Thank you for the hospitality.

227
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,010
Toma...

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,750
wants to be Emma-san's successor...

229
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,160
So that's why he...

230
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,020
Natsume-san.

231
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,820
I love you.

232
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,680
I just wanted to stay with you

233
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,220
like this for a little longer.

234
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,020
I had a feeling he was acting strange then.

235
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,860
The days I can personally
train you all like this

236
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,370
are numbered.

237
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,410
Everything I've taught you,

238
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:44,955
make sure you absorb it well.

239
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Allons-y.

240
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,670
Yes!

241
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
Excuse me.

242
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,290
You're home.

243
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,050
I'm home.

244
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,570
Did something happen?

245
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:23,794
Huh...

246
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,610
Oh, no.

247
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,770
Nothing happened.

248
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,360
By the way, have you had dinner?

249
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,420
Yes, I have.

250
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,070
You must be tired, go take a bath.

251
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,250
Before that...

252
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,960
Can I talk to you for a bit?

253
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Uh...

254
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
OK.

255
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,550
Natsume-san.

256
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Actually, I...

257
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,100
Emma asked me if I
wanted to aim for the top.

258
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,860
Hmm...

259
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,950
I heard from Emma-san.

260
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Huh?

261
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,040
Is that so?

262
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,419
After I saw you off this morning,

263
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,640
I happened to run into her.

264
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,680
Why did she have to say anything?

265
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,430
But that's all I heard.

266
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,640
He told me to hear it directly from
you how you decide to proceed.

267
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
I see.

268
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,530
Mm.

269
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:33,800
All this time,

270
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,470
while working diligently,

271
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,217
I've always made decisions with only one
thing in mind: to stay by Natsume-san's side.

272
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,030
That hasn't changed even now.

273
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,610
It's just...

274
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,980
Feelings and the future...

275
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:54,956
which one should I prioritize?

276
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,050
That's what I'm thinking about.

277
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,410
Feelings and the future...

278
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,610
I don't aspire to become like
Emma, the pinnacle of Romy.

279
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,580
I want to become the top makeup artist at
Romy Japan, right where you are.

280
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,590
I want to become someone
Natsume-san can be proud of,

281
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,020
as well as considering my
feelings after Emma's training,

282
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,030
That's the conclusion I came to after
considering both of those things.

283
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,090
Toma...

284
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,060
However...

285
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,050
to achieve this goal,

286
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,860
I must join Emma's team

287
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,510
and learn from them.

288
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,760
After personally experiencing
the techniques of a top team,

289
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,340
I feel like it would be difficult to
hone the same kinds of skills in Japan.

290
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,320
So that means...

291
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,680
You're going to Paris to study with Emma?

292
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,060
Not immediately, it's a future plan.

293
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,910
How long will you be gone?

294
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,680
Emma said at least two years.

295
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,730
I see.

296
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
I...

297
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,770
I can't go to Paris with you.

298
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,180
Because I also have...

299
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,140
a dream of continuing to grow as a BA.

300
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,320
But,

301
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,730
I will support the path you choose.

302
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,090
If you want to go to Paris to study,

303
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,390
I will support you.

304
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,350
I won't hold you back.

305
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,000
But...

306
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,150
That means we'll be in a
long-distance relationship, right?

307
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,730
I still can't do it.
I can't be separated from you.

308
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,520
I'll wither and die.

309
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,140
Wither and die?

310
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,330
You're exaggerating too much.

311
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,760
Do your best.

312
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,090
I'll always be by your side.

313
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,470
If I only consider my feelings,

314
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,340
I can't even imagine
being separated from you.

315
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
But,

316
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,150
considering the future,

317
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,410
I don't want to stagnate.

318
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,080
Because I hope that from
now on, I can always...

319
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,960
achieve all sorts
of dreams with you.

320
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,340
I didn't expect him to be
troubled to this extent...

321
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,630
So confused and lost...

322
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,830
Hey, Toma.

323
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,370
Don't think about me
first, just think carefully.

324
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,260
I'm not going anywhere.

325
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,840
And I believe in you.

326
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,060
And I'll support you.

327
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,410
So,

328
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,760
you need to think about
what you truly want to do.

329
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,200
Do you want to go and learn from Emma-san,

330
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,950
or not?

331
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,130
There are only these two options.

332
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,450
It's simple, right?

333
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,000
Natsume-san...

334
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,500
The feeling of 'wanting to be together'

335
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,920
and the feeling of 'wanting
to work hard at makeup'

336
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,760
are both equally strong.

337
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,470
That's why you're hesitating so much.

338
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,290
In that case,

339
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,090
in the past, you gave me
so much support at work.

340
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,070
This time, it's my turn to...

341
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,850
support you.

342
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,710
That's all it is, right?

343
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,000
Natsume-san, you...

344
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,090
are truly a strong person.

345
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,650
I'm not strong at all.

346
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,600
My feelings are the same as yours.

347
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,870
But,

348
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,050
seeing you...

349
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,660
with this incredibly cool dream of 'wanting
to reach the top', I'm truly happy.

350
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,490
I will definitely support you.

351
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,720
You really are strong.

352
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,620
Am I?

353
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,710
I respect you very much.

354
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,720
I love you the most.

355
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,780
Mm.

356
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,670
It's the first time I've...

357
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,470
heard Toma's dream so clearly.

358
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,280
He said as long as I cheer him on,

359
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,250
he can keep working hard.

360
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,440
So,

361
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,210
I will keep telling him,

362
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,030
so that you can achieve your dream,

363
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,470
this time, it's my turn to...

364
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,420
support you.

365
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Well then,

366
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,630
my training course ends today.

367
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,140
Please continue to strive to
improve your skills from now on.

368
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,700
Good work, everyone.

369
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,580
Thank you very much.

370
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Emma...

371
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,870
Toma.

372
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,290
Yesterday...

373
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,230
I talked to Natsume-san.

374
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,870
And what did Natsume say?

375
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,700
He said, 'Go for it.'

376
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
I see...

377
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,870
In that case,

378
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,870
regarding the assignment to Paris,

379
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,430
I'll officially start processing it.

380
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,530
Okay.

381
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,860
Thank you so much.

382
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,490
Thank you for coming.

383
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,030
Customers haven't stopped
coming since noon today.

384
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,780
We're truly grateful to everyone.

385
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,990
Pre-orders for the new
foundation are quite high too.

386
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,800
The texture is really amazing, isn't it?

387
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,740
Pre-orders for the summer
collection will also start next week.

388
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,430
Let's all do our best together!

389
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,740
Yes!

390
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,060
- I'll send the data to headquarters first.
- Okay.

391
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,550
Welcome.

392
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,330
Welcome.

393
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,000
Excuse me, I'd like to see some lipsticks.

394
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:07,566
Certainly, these are this season's
new arrivals. Would you like to try them?

395
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,940
Paris, huh...

396
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:18,700
Emma said at least two years.

397
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,100
Can I really handle a long-distance
relationship with him for two years...?

398
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,650
No, no.

399
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,960
I need to pull myself together.

400
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,070
I also need to aim to become the best BA.

401
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,630
Huh?

402
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,750
But,

403
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,790
what exactly is a 'great BA'?

404
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,096
(Next Episode)
It can't be helped that it turned out that way.

405
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,459
The real thing is the best.

406
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,649
Even though he's just a new BA,
he seems quite troubled.

407
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,190
What does it feel like

408
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,820
to love your job?
