00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,574
Ma'am, you've been here for so long,
but you still haven't been promoted?

358
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,077
What does that have to do with anything?

359
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,539
That's why you said you hate Mrs. Roja.

360
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,208
Because when it's promotion time,
she ignores you.

361
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,086
Hate? Really?

Can't I just feel upset?

364
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,969
Just because I'm upset,
I'm suddenly involved in a hostage taking?

00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,012
Wow.

- [LOVE] Huh?

Mrs. Roja didn't let you get an advance.

371
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,150
Did you do this because of that?

What about you?

00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,739
Didn't Ma'am Greta scold you
because you're slow?

Ouch! You're crossing the line!
