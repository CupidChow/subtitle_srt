1
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,940
My name is Toru Takasugi.

2
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,460
3rd year at Omori High School, Bali

3
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,260
He's a Balinese Yankee.

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,680
Hey, this sweat is my island

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,760
I guess that's why.

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,040
Is it an island?

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,000
Sweat belongs to everyone

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,200
reactor.

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,960
Where is zare or zari?

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,520
You're free to fish for crabs.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:44,920
ah?

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,100
Hey, I said I was asleep.

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,760
Not you.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,780
It's time to leave

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,340
That's it.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,820
That will wake you up.

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,300
Looks like Sakuraeli

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,440
Do it!

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,080
Hey, what a bastard.

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,860
What is this?

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,820
Sakuraeri.

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,120
No matter how unreasonable the noise

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,200
I buy what is sold even in a fight.

24
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,860
Among men,

25
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,640
No, among the Yankees

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,960
Yankee common sense.

27
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,180
Hey, what a bastard.

28
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,060
I'm doing it again.

29
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:13,980
hey.

30
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,160
Don't be silly.

31
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,040
Oh, it's time for the inn.

32
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:18,620
picture?

33
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,290
What time is it now?

34
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,410
18:43.

35
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:27,670
picture?

36
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,890
Oh, seriously?

37
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,670
Hey, I'm going home.

38
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,790
Hey, it's you, you.

39
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,130
Hey, come on, you come on.

40
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,250
Yo.

41
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,090
I'm not going.

42
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,530
why.

43
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,430
Seriously, this sweat fluid

44
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,390
Because it belongs to everyone.

45
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,070
See you then.

46
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,670
Oh, hey, hey, don't run away.

47
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,270
hey hey.

48
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,380
No matter how unreasonable the noise

49
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,660
I buy what is sold even in a fight.

50
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,680
Among men,

51
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,500
No, among the Yankees

52
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,160
Yankee common sense.

53
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,220
It's open.

54
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,960
It was supposed to be.

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,520
Kishigishi becomes a tutor

56
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,180
Until I get there.

57
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,480
Buggy.

58
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,780
Chinese?

59
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,700
yes.

60
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,060
What does Toro-kun do?

61
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,180
Is there a Chinese sentence that says?

62
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Delcam…

63
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,700
a!

64
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:43,650
I love you, please

65
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,470
I love you, huh?

66
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,810
By no means a miracle worker

67
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,330
Did you receive it?

68
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,210
I didn't tell you!

69
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,370
That's amazing, Touroku

70
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:57,790
yeah!

71
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,390
I can write such difficult kanji

72
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,750
What!

73
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,350
Ma…

74
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,530
Well...

75
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,810
Yankees are around here

76
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,930
There's a guy who can't read Chinese.

77
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,110
Is that so?

78
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,350
Yankees are amazing

79
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,750
That's right!

80
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,510
It's playful!

81
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,670
but…

82
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,990
I love you too

83
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,370
Isn't that also Chinese?

84
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,330
Is it wrong?

85
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,010
Yes, these kanji are correct.

86
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,310
Touro is called teji.

87
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,050
kun likes kanji

88
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,410
What is it?

89
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,690
Anything cool

90
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,450
I like it, that's good

91
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,430
Right, Touro-kun too?

92
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:47,040
It's cool, isn't it?

93
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,660
teeth…

94
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,740
Small fish Tenkakoi are running alone

95
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,960
oh!

96
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,060
Those are the words of Buddha.

97
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,420
That's nice, Touro-kunpi.

98
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,120
It's tough!

99
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,960
Kixie, only I am the best

100
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,160
Strong is a famous saying, right?

101
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,180
Super cool!

102
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,900
That's a little different, isn't it?

103
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,720
The leaves are my existence in this world.

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,360
There's only one person left

105
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,100
It is said to be a priceless and precious existence.

106
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:31,730
What do you mean? Yes, what do you mean?

107
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:37,080
And this one is also technically Han.

108
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,120
It can't be called a sentence, han.

109
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,720
A sentence is written using kanji.

110
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,080
written in Chinese grammar

111
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,260
What does it refer to?

112
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,340
So it's a spell, right?

113
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,320
It looks like a spell now

114
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,960
Motouro-kun's name

115
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,980
You will be able to read it more easily.

116
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,900
Uro-kun's growth

117
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,440
It's totally fine if it's okay.

118
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,640
Yes, the end of term is almost here

119
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,600
It's a test, so let's do our best together.

120
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:20,750
Let's hang it up, okay?

121
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,370
Touro-kun's story ah,

122
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,510
What's going on earlier?

123
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,370
Well, it's just a fight, so no worries.

124
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:29,550
Wow?

125
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,450
Touro-kun is fighting

126
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,090
Have you come?

127
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,810
Almost any unreasonable thing

128
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,430
Even in a fight I was sold

129
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,410
I'm buying this Yankee

130
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:48,290
Is that common sense?

131
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,210
Maybe it's a squishy noise

132
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:51,910
Have you ever had a fight?

133
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,270
No, it's not sold.

134
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,930
Have you never done it?

135
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:06,330
No, I'm sure it's because I'm weak.

136
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,630
The crab looks weak

137
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,890
Everyone is more bored than me

138
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,210
It is clear that it may be possible

139
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,170
picking a fight with the weak

140
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,150
It is a cowardly thing to do

141
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:28,610
That's why

142
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,250
Wow, this is the way

143
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,950
This body hidden in plain sight

144
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,210
Look at me, so hit me.

145
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,150
hit?

146
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,610
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

147
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,170
I'm strong and say hit me

148
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,490
Even if it's from, it's okay!

149
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,490
Seriously, it's okay!

150
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,750
So feel free to say wow!

151
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,310
face!

152
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:01,870
picture?

153
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,990
No, just a fist punch

154
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,490
Right!

155
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,350
Is that so?

156
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,270
Sorry, I'm training my nose too.

157
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,310
I thought, no, I have to

158
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:10,730
Hey!

159
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,790
That's right, miracle

160
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,650
There's blood on your shirt

161
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,210
Why not!

162
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,590
This is totally fine, that's it.

163
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,430
Tork's nose...

164
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,390
No, I'm Tisci

165
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,050
If you want to attack with

166
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,770
Stop, come on, stop.

167
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,450
You're right, take that off.

168
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,630
Let mom wash it

169
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:39,200
Sorry Kiseki-chan,

170
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,860
The unexpected weakness is

171
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,440
Wet!?

172
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,200
Tork, help me!

173
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,700
my tutor idiot

174
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,160
Don't listen!

175
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,830
Yes, sorry, please borrow it.

176
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,570
It's perfectly fine to put it away.

177
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,230
My nosebleeds have stopped

178
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,850
That was really good.

179
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,090
Let's be sweet with your words

180
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:25,780
What?

181
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,200
Huh?

182
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,380
Moe!

183
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,740
This is gap moe!

184
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,020
kisishishishishishi

185
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:44,440
That's true, it's a mistake

186
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,860
It's too cute

187
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,640
Which is this...

188
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,410
Sorry, sweats

189
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,010
I don't usually wear it so I'm excited

190
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,110
Shi, I have an unexpected weakness.

191
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,210
Sweat!?

192
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,450
Always in a suit

193
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,590
Even though it's sharp

194
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,810
!?

195
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,270
Tork, help me!

196
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,570
Can I just look at it like this?

197
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,430
Can I take a video?

198
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,340
Tork, help me!

199
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:40,900
picture?

200
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,390
I'm sorry, are you okay?

201
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:28,760
The finished product

202
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,600
Shi-sensei today is another stupid son

203
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,460
Thank you very much.

204
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,580
Luke, you worked hard today too.

205
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,360
Is it true?

206
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,700
I’m an idiot for skipping school too.

207
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,440
That child of Rino was taught by the teacher.

208
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,200
I run back to work

209
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,680
Honestly, are you surprised?

210
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,000
Well, Kishi-sensei is at home.

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,500
If you're waiting, it's me from back then.

212
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,780
I ran away and went home.

213
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:04,160
Yes, but yes?

214
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,800
No, it's nothing.

215
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,320
Thank you for waiting.

216
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,140
Well, milk and toys

217
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,040
Thank you for your letter paper.

218
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,320
Is there such a thing?

219
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,380
It's probably your milk.

220
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,580
Hey, excuse me for stopping.

221
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:38,860
Please excuse me today.

222
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,420
I also memorized three Chinese words.

223
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,840
That's wonderful, isn't it?

224
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,220
Let Rukun grow, well.

225
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,420
I wonder if you remember?

226
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,340
But it's okay, Tolk.

227
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,420
If it is, then understand the meaning properly.

228
00:12:53,420 --> 00:13:05,400
I understand that, so I guess so.

229
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,560
How about Meka Tolkun?

230
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,660
It's over, I'll take it.

231
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:23,790
Thank you very much.

232
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,630
The umbrella is crispy

233
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,730
Yeah, if it were me, I'd never do it.

234
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,410
I hate it before me

235
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,610
line or tolkun is self

236
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:44,500
I'm an arrogant student.

237
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,480
What if I got 100 points?

238
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,860
Reward, reward

239
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,220
Is it?

240
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,480
Oh I'll do my best with that

241
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,150
Okay, I'll think about it.

242
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,110
Look at that!

243
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,850
Well, the will I learned today

244
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,770
Good luck Tolk

245
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:21,190
Well, what is Shiga?

246
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,710
Rakantara is finally here

247
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:29,410
Those who have ambitions like

248
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,090
It's finally happening oh yeah that's it

249
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,250
Still, it was a shame.

250
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,230
Rukun ah I don't remember it at all

251
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,730
No way, it's okay I

252
00:14:43,730 --> 00:15:04,020
It's difficult. It's difficult.

253
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:14,340
Ah, who are you?

254
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,660
Who is Kuraebi?

255
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,880
You're a creepy shrimp

256
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,620
You're better than that

257
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,940
My brother who has a beautiful moisture in front

258
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,260
Proper conversation and knowledge

259
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,420
What is teru na sesame pasta?

260
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:38,980
It's a waste.

261
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:48,940
- Hey, what is this photo?

262
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,700
That's right, you're fighting.

263
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,080
Kashitoteisacharacha

264
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,780
Don't be lazy

265
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,960
Is he still a Yankee?

266
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,640
Okay, what's good?

267
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,500
Yeah, I'm a Yankee

268
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,480
He's a Yankee in

269
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,220
So what are you doing with this photo?

270
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:10,830
Please try to explain

271
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:20,560
Shikishi this is me

272
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,640
I am a private tutor for

273
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,820
What's that, a private tutor?

274
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,920
You're cheating

275
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,700
There is a better theory

276
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,980
That's not a lie

277
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,340
As a former Yankee

278
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,940
Well, you're done.

279
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,440
You're real

280
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,800
The hustle and bustle of being a Yankee

281
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,160
We'll spend our time fighting

282
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,700
Dress like you

283
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,620
Studying with a private tutor

284
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,500
I don't have time to study.

285
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,700
It's a good study

286
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,720
What's that about you studying?

287
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,920
study study study

288
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,720
Which one is yours?

289
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:12,660
E-learning

290
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,020
Bunitomaraz

291
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:20,720
That's all there is to it

292
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,280
However, I will learn again.

293
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:35,010
What kind of spell is that?

294
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,950
I don't have time to study

295
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,210
The idiot who said that has fucking free time.

296
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,670
But I learned nothing

297
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,770
I told you my family

298
00:17:46,770 --> 00:18:02,630
Don't make fun of the teacher

299
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,730
When Reiten comes along

300
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,810
Well, the point is, I'll die if I sit down.

301
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,170
Well, it's like doing it.

302
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,190
This character and this character

303
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:24,550
It's the other way around, huh?

304
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:34,940
It's super squishy

305
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,420
I'm definitely curious.

306
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,860
Those straight eyes

307
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:50,060
I'm not saying this.

308
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,720
Why did things develop so quickly?

309
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,080
I can't keep up, but...

310
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,600
Suki-sukisnanoto

311
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,840
Uru-kun, fight again.

312
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:10,580
Did you come here? Yes, this is it.

313
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,840
Or assaulted once inside

314
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,320
You did it, Tooru-kun.

315
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,460
It's no laughing matter

316
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,860
What is this first aid kit?

317
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,640
van four dimensional pocket

318
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,160
Is it connected to

319
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,300
Look at me, it hurts a little

320
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:43,490
Please be patient, Tooru.

321
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,330
why are you fighting today

322
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,190
Why did you do this?

323
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:56,040
Genuine garden teacher

324
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,020
It's okay to say that

325
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,380
I'm going to spend my time in Ka, Tsutomu.

326
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,500
I don't have time to be strong

327
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:07,050
It's important to me

328
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:12,240
Please forgive me for making fun of you

329
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:22,090
Toru-kun who wasn't there is a hundred

330
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,690
100 victories is a good thing

331
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,730
No matter what, don't fight

332
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,050
to defeat the enemy's soldiers

333
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,970
is the good of good

334
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,430
Do you know the Chinese sentence?

335
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,310
What are those words from Sun Tzu?

336
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,390
The meaning is all wars

337
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,670
It's best to win

338
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:44,950
No, what the fuck is that?

339
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,050
People who are scared of saying kanbun

340
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:47,810
Isn't that an excuse?

341
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,930
No, this is never scary

342
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,490
This is not the kanji that says

343
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,410
Text is an opponent without a fight

344
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,590
subjugate the soldiers of

345
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,010
is the best thing to do

346
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:01,770
Are you serious?

347
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,070
How to do it

348
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,230
Le with me twice a week

349
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,030
working together

350
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,780
Please be confident

351
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,900
Tooru-kun, you are fighting

352
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,960
become stronger than win

353
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,660
Start walking down the road with me

354
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,620
I'll win in a fight

355
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,880
There's nothing like becoming stronger

356
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,440
Of course

357
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,730
No, no, no, about studying

358
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,390
Of course I'm studying

359
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,990
It's impossible to win

360
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,810
I'll say it out loud.

361
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,410
But I've been looking like this for 3 years

362
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,930
It's like we'll meet again forever

363
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,590
How did he win by studying?

364
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,830
It's Tsunta, Tooru-kun and me.

365
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,410
Believe and follow me

366
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,950
Please, yes, I am Tooru-kun.

367
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,930
believe in the potential for growth

368
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,490
I am a proud student.

369
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:22,630
I got it from 100

370
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:27,370
Reward if you score

371
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,310
That's what it means.

372
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:39,380
I'm worried, Tooru-kun, yes.

373
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,920
The treatment is completed.Study

374
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,940
Sorry, restarting

375
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,720
That's why the face is no good, the face

376
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:08,640
I'm sorry but it's brutal

377
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,080
The friendship between

378
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,740
It's all about going against your heart

379
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,160
not a very close friend

380
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,640
Even if I liked you

381
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,440
I can't say it either.

382
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,680
From me, Yankee

383
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,960
Rumo's direct I love you

384
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,420
That's the person I love

385
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,640
What is the beginning of love?

386
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Uru-kun's wonderful things

387
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,280
I want to know more about

388
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,100
Yes, it's a huge hit.

389
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,180
people and things you like

390
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,460
I know about it myself

391
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,340
Wouldn't you like to?
