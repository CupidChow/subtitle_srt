1
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:32,366
Hey, hey, look, look!
That person looks like a prince, right?

2
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:36,367
True! I wonder what his job is?

3
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:52,367
Yo, Takasugi.

4
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:55,367
You were quite bold yesterday.

5
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:57,367
Don't get cocky, hey!

6
00:00:57,367 --> 00:01:01,433
Ooh, ooh.
Small fries are so noisy.

7
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:03,367
What did you say?!

8
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:07,367
Do you know what they call
people like you?

9
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,367
Huh? What?

10
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:13,367
Weak... Dog?

11
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,367
Cat?

12
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:20,367
It's becoming more vague!

13
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:25,367
"The weaker the dog, the louder it barks," right!
Don't speak if you don't know!

14
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:28,367
You idiot!

15
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:30,367
Shut up!

16
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:34,367
Come at me all at once!

17
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:42,367
Entering range! Hmph!

18
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,367
Ah, Toru.

19
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:48,367
Hey. What are you doing?
It is already afternoon.

20
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:51,367
Just entertaining some people looking for trouble.

21
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:53,367
Again?
Did you lose?

22
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:55,367
No way.
I beat them up thoroughly.

23
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,367
Yeah!

24
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,367
By the way,
I met Akaishi-senpai yesterday.

25
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:04,367
Eh! Seriously?

26
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:07,367
Unfair! I want to meet him too.

27
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:10,366
Toru, you really still like Akaishi-senpai.

28
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:12,367
Of course!

29
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:16,367
Anyone who hears the legend of
Akaishi would definitely be amazed...

30
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:20,367
Akaishi-senpai fought against 100 police officers, right!

31
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:24,367
Ah, that fight.

32
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:29,367
Right... the police attacked Akaishi in a group, but...

33
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,367
He did not budge at all.

34
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:35,367
Before they knew it, the police officers
were piling up, falling one by one.

35
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:38,367
I thought it was a giant garbage truck.

36
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,367
So cool!

37
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:44,367
After that, they say he went alone
to the police headquarters and destroyed it.

38
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:48,367
I heard he went on a rampage at the Yakuza office.

39
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:52,367
I heard he dueled a gorilla and won!

40
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:56,367
Akaishi-senpai is truly a real man!

41
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:59,367
I also want to become strong like Akaishi-senpai!

42
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:06,367
What are you doing, Toru?

43
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:09,367
If you want to be strong, you must do sit-ups, sit-ups!

44
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:12,367
That's true!
I will join!

45
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:19,367
Oi! You guys do it too!

46
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
- They always look happy, don't they.
- It must be nice.

47
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:34,367
Ouch, slightly overdid it...

48
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:36,367
Hey! Takasugi!

49
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:39,367
- Huh?
- You are skipping class again!

50
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,367
Shut up.
You should praise me for actually coming to school.

51
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:47,367
You idiot!

52
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:50,367
And the test from that time.

53
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:52,433
What is this?!

54
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,367
Oh! Full House.

55
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:58,367
Don't joke around!

56
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:04,367
Skipping lessons, always fighting,
and then getting this score on a test!

57
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:06,367
Don't underestimate school!

58
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:09,367
That is because the lessons are boring.

59
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:15,367
Takasugi... Don't think you can
graduate if this continues.

60
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,367
Huh?

61
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:21,367
With grades like this, you are guaranteed to not advance a grade!

62
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,367
That's great then.

63
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:35,367
If you keep going like that, you won't
have a proper future!

64
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:39,367
I am not interested in a proper life.

65
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,367
Akaishi-senpai!

66
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:53,367
I will definitely become like
Akaishi-senpai in the future!

67
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Good at fighting, riding motorcycles,
smoking, opposing society.

68
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:15,367
I will become a true cool man just like that!

69
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:22,367
Aah, I'm hungry.

70
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:25,367
Toru!
Say "I'm home" when you come home!

71
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,367
- Did you wash your hands?
- Shut up, I did!

72
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:31,367
And you...
Mr. Yamauchi called today.

73
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:34,367
That damn Yamasen...

74
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,367
What do you actually want!

75
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:41,367
Shut up!
I don't care about graduating!

76
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:45,367
I want to die at age 27
like Jimi Hendrix and become a legend.

77
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:50,367
Don't talk stupidly!

78
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:52,367
Your father in the sky will cry!

79
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:57,367
He just took a plane for a business trip out of town.
Don't say things that cause misunderstandings.

80
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:01,367
Anyway, you must graduate.

81
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:03,367
What is this?

82
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:06,367
- I already ordered a private tutor.
- Hah!?

83
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,400
He will come starting today.

84
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,367
What are you doing, you old hag!

85
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:12,367
There is no way I want to join
such lame private tutoring!

86
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,367
Huh?

87
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:17,367
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts...!

88
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,367
Don't think you can win against me.

89
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:24,367
St... strong...

90
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:31,367
He will come at 19:00,
so study properly, okay.

91
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:39,367
A private tutor is probably just a soft university student.

92
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,367
If the person is lame, I will beat him up!

93
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:57,367
Just come in!

94
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Allow me to introduce myself.
I look forward to working with you.

95
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:16,367
I am the private tutor, Kishi Knight.

96
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:25,367
A neat two-block cut parted in the middle.

97
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:28,367
Wearing a suit vest dapperly.

98
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:35,366
This man is an inhabitant of a world
that is the complete opposite of mine!

99
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:41,366
Ah... he smells nice.

100
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:49,367
He is a soft man...

101
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:52,367
That means, an enemy!

102
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:55,367
Well then, Toru-san.
Let's start studying.

103
00:08:56,367 --> 00:09:00,367
I will give him such a hard time
that he won't want to come again.

104
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:07,367
Sensei, I have no intention to study.

105
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:11,367
My textbooks and pencil case,
I left them all at school.

106
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,400
A soft big brother like this must be...

107
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,367
Hiii...

108
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:24,367
I cannot do it in such a violent place!

109
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:27,367
I'm going home!

110
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,367
There, give up already!

111
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,367
- That is not a problem.
- Eh?

112
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:43,367
Please use this!

113
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:50,367
A... all subjects...

114
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:54,367
Th... this person... is so prepared!

115
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:56,367
But...

116
00:09:56,367 --> 00:10:01,367
Sorry, I cannot study using a mechanical pencil.

117
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,367
I am on the wooden pencil team.

118
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:11,367
Take that! A nitpicking excuse meant for a delinquent!

119
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:14,367
- I understand.
- Huh?

120
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:20,367
I have all types.
Any thickness is available!

121
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,367
F...?

122
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,367
I've never seen that...

123
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,367
Let's begin.

124
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,367
Th... this person is not daunted at all!

125
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:38,367
- Since today is the first meeting...
- In that case...

126
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:42,367
First, to see Toru-san's ability,
please work on this...

127
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:45,367
An ordinary person who doesn't cry
when I stare at them sharply is...

128
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:50,367
Wah!
His eyelashes are long.

129
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:58,367
You don't need to be so tense, it is alright.

130
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:01,367
Eh... Eeh!?
Wh... what does this mean?

131
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,367
Head...?

132
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,367
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts...!

133
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,367
Mom just hits me...

134
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,367
Even my dad never patted my head!

135
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:15,367
Just kidding. Actually, I am nervous too.

136
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:17,400
We are the same, aren't we.

137
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,367
Wh... what is this...

138
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:22,367
Kind of cute...

139
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:27,367
Let's relax together.
Let's study while having fun, okay!

140
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,367
Having fun...

141
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:34,367
Yes!

142
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:38,367
It feels... different from the teachers I imagined.

143
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:44,367
First, let's do a light test.
Please try doing these questions.

144
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,367
Japanese History questions.

145
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:53,367
It can't be helped...

146
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,367
But...

147
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,367
I am best at Japanese History.

148
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:06,367
Is that so!
I am looking forward to it.

149
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:11,367
Behold my true ability!

150
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:17,367
"What is the name of the woman said to rule Yamataikoku
in the Chinese history book Gishiwajinden?"

151
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,367
Matsuko!

152
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:29,367
"Who was the main figure of the rebel army leading
more than 30,000 people in Shimabara and Amakusa?

153
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,367
Sanshiro!

154
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:41,367
"Who was the person leading the Black Ships
that came to Uraga in 1853?"

155
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,367
Bon Jovi.

156
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,400
"Who was the 5th Shogun of the Edo Bakufu who
established the Shorui Awaremi no Rei?"

157
00:12:57,367 --> 00:13:00,367
Tokugawa...

158
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,367
Ieie!

159
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,367
Yosh!

160
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,367
How about that!

161
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:14,367
Yes! All of them are wrong.

162
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,367
Eh? You're lying, right?
I was so confident.

163
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,367
But, it was close.

164
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:25,367
I understand the intention of your answer
in several parts. For example, this one.

165
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:28,367
Tokugawa Ieie...?

166
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:36,367
Indeed, in the Tokugawa family, there are many
names using "Ie," but Ieie does not exist.

167
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:40,367
Huh? Is that so?

168
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:43,367
I feel like there was one.

169
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:47,367
The correct answer
is Tokugawa Tsunayoshi.

170
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:51,367
- Tsunayoshi? No way there is a person like that.
- There is.

171
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:55,367
Tsunayoshi sounds...
like a dog's name.

172
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,367
Ooh, very sharp.

173
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:01,367
Tsunayoshi indeed had the nickname
"Inu-Kubo."

174
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:05,367
Eh! Ah, really?
See, it really is like a dog.

175
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:11,367
The neighbor grandfather's dog has a similar name,
so it's easy to remember.

176
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:16,367
Toru-san has an interesting way of thinking.

177
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,367
That is a very amazing thing, you know.

178
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:23,367
What the heck...
Even if you praise me, you won't get anything.

179
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:27,367
It's not that.
Toru-san has a talent for studying.

180
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,367
Hah? No way!

181
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:36,400
Studying is not just memorizing,
but understanding from that kind of thinking is also very important

182
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:42,367
Please be confident, Toru-san.

183
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,367
By the way,
can you stop calling me "Toru-san"?

184
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:55,400
- Why?
- I am younger...

185
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,967
Besides, I'm not used to being called that.
Just call me by name, it's fine.

186
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:03,367
I cannot do that.
You are a precious student.

187
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:05,367
It's fine, really.

188
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:11,367
In that case... how about "Toru-kun"?

189
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:14,367
- Eh?
- Toru-kun.

190
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:18,367
Hee!? To... Toru-kyun!?

191
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:23,367
Dangerous...
My heart is pounding so easily.

192
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:25,367
Is it not allowed?

193
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:30,367
Aah no no... that is fine.

194
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:35,367
In that case, don't call me
Sensei, just call me by name.

195
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,367
- Call by name?
- Yes.

196
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:40,367
Just call me "Knight."

197
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:44,367
His words are like a newly dating couple...

198
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:48,333
Aah no, I can't!

199
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,367
Why?

200
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:58,367
I am a genuine delinquent,
so I am strict about seniority.

201
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:01,367
Is that so.
Delinquents have neat rules, don't they.

202
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Dangerous, I must not be swayed!

203
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:16,367
But Sensei's name is "Knight"?

204
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:18,367
Yes.

205
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:21,367
What a strange name.
What is the kanji?

206
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:24,367
This.

207
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,367
Ki... Kishi!?

208
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:32,367
It is written as "Kishi" but read as "Knight"!

209
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:36,367
I cannot handle that name!
This person... is strong...!

210
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,367
I apologize that the name is too sparkling.

211
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:42,367
No, that is really strong in my opinion!

212
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:45,367
- Is that so?
- The impact is huge.

213
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:48,367
What have people called you so far?

214
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,367
"Kishi-kun."

215
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,367
The impact of "Knight" is totally gone!?

216
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:01,367
What a waste!

217
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:06,367
Unfortunately, I do not have a nickname...

218
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:09,367
What a waste...

219
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:12,367
Ah!

220
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,333
In that case, how about "Kishikishi"?

221
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,367
Eh?

222
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:23,367
Eh? Not allowed?

223
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:28,367
Because the kanji is "Kishi Kishi"...

224
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:32,367
Oh no... was that a landmine?

225
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:39,367
I am happy! Kishikishi!

226
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:41,367
Ah... you like it?

227
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:45,367
Yes!
This is the first time in my life
I have been given a nickname!

228
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:47,367
Kishikishi, huh...!

229
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,367
Like the pandas Shinshin and Shan Shan, it's cute!

230
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:53,367
Ooh... he is that happy...

231
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:56,367
Thank you.

232
00:17:56,367 --> 00:18:00,367
Toru-kun is a genius at giving nicknames!

233
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,367
Nickname genius...

234
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:07,367
Next is Han-Cha, the leader.

235
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:10,367
Who is Han-Cha, hey.

236
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:12,367
Come on, Maru-Bou.

237
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:16,367
Why am I on the police side.

238
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:19,367
You guys are all talk.

239
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:22,367
Oh... not bad, Akabeko.

240
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,367
That is an insult, you know.

241
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:31,367
Hah... Well...
Well, it's just normal?

242
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:35,367
I was always envious of school friends
who were called by nicknames!

243
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,367
Enken, Jumbo...

244
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,367
Key-bou, Gorirahanakuso!

245
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:43,367
Ah... the last one seems like an insult.

246
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:47,367
I see...

247
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:52,367
It turns out he is different from the teachers
I have met so far...

248
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:55,367
No no no!
Don't be fooled, me!

249
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,367
That teacher...

250
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:03,367
If you keep going like that, you won't
have a proper future!

251
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:08,367
Surely they are all the same...
I won't be fooled!

252
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:10,367
Toru-kun.

253
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:16,367
Eh what?

254
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,367
Ah... Is he staring at me sharply?

255
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,367
I won't lose!

256
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,333
His eyelashes are really long!
And, he smells nice!

257
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:39,367
Toru-kun. You don't need to worry about anything.

258
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:42,367
Don't need to worry about anything?

259
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:46,367
I will definitely make you happy.

260
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:49,367
Definitely happy!?

261
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:53,367
Leave everything to me.

262
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:58,367
A... a confession of love!?

263
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:06,367
We just met today, no way...

264
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:10,367
You're lying, right...
This is the first time I've been confessed to!?

265
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:16,367
I understand your feelings of anxiety.
But please rest assured!

266
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:21,367
Wow... Such a leader aura!
Amazing, an older person...

267
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,367
Entrust it to me!

268
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,367
What should I do!?

269
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:36,367
Being told that so suddenly...
I am not mentally prepared...

270
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,367
Study seriously and we will definitely pass!

271
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:42,367
Eh?

272
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,367
Eh?

273
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:48,433
Ah... Pass?
Talking about passing?

274
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:50,433
Yes.

275
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:56,367
What the heck...

276
00:20:56,367 --> 00:21:00,367
- Let's start studying!
- What is with this natural charmer!

277
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:04,367
- Turns out this person... cannot be underestimated...
- Now, review the test from earlier.

278
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:07,367
Have you memorized the name of the 5th Tokugawa Shogun?

279
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,367
- Tokugawa Yoshiyoshi.
- Tsunayoshi.

280
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:13,367
Toru-kun seems to like repeated words.

281
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,367
Like a baby!

282
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:32,167
Sensei... are you alright?

283
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:38,133
I heard sounds that didn't seem
like studying...

284
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:43,133
I apologize, Mother.
I got carried away with Toru-kun.

285
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:48,133
That child has indeed been naughty since long ago.
I wonder who he resembles...

286
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:54,167
Sensei must be troubled too, right?

287
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:57,133
Not at all.
Toru-kun is a very good child.

288
00:21:57,133 --> 00:22:00,133
- Really?
- Yes!

289
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:04,167
In that case, Mother.
I will take my leave for today.

290
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:06,167
Ah...

291
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:19,200
"Let's do our best together," huh...

292
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,167
No no no...

293
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:29,167
I won't be fooled!

294
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:36,167
Come at me! Come at me!

295
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,167
Toru, you're noisy!

296
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:45,167
Starting today, Toru-kun's lessons begin.

297
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:48,167
He says he is good at Japanese History.

298
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:53,133
I will help him as much as I can
so he can graduate properly.

299
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:56,167
Kishi.

300
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:16,133
Kishikishi.

301
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:28,167
I really hate adults
who have the title "Sensei."

302
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:30,167
That is more natural for me.

303
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:33,167
Eh what? This.
A kiss!? A kiss, huh!?

304
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:36,200
Toru-kun indeed has a talent for studying!

305
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
See, knowledge is important, you know!
