1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,020


2
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:21,720
   

3
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,020
   

4
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,219
Father God, come on.

5
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,560
A'Chi, why are you so happy?

6
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,659
These were all made by hand, not by Immortal skills.

7
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,320
You haven't had dishes from the Human Realm, right?

8
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,500
Please sit and have some.

9
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,619
Were these all made yourself?

10
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,739
No, not me. But it contains my goodwill.

11
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,360
They were made by Qing Mu.

12
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,819
This fish is very fresh. He caught it himself.

13
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:08,160
This fruit wine was made by him from the plums on the back mountain.

14
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,819
All these dishes took him a whole day to make.

15
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,120
Please don't give him a slap in the face.

16
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,520
A'Chi... did he really make all these?

17
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,940
Yes.

18
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,460
Taste it.

19
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,199
 Perhaps I can only have only one meal cooked by him in my life. 

20
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,940
 Forget it. 

21
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,199
Father God, if you like it, Qing Mu can cook for you every day.

22
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,959
Lord Qing Mu.

23
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,580
Yes.

24
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,179
Relax.

25
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,460
I'll feel comfortable if you relax.

26
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,900
Yes.

27
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,339
Chang Que.

28
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,620
Yes, Upper God.

29
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,380
Go and fetch ten night-shining pearls of ten thousand years.

30
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,420
It's a gift for the Lord of the North Sea.

31
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,860
Yes.

32
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,140
Today, to thank you for the meal,

33
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,040
I will give you ten night-shining pearls of ten thousand years.

34
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,460
I believe it's fair to you.

35
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,600
It's getting late.

36
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,140
Qingchi Palace is inconvenient for foreign guests.

37
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,360
Lord, you should go back to the North Sea soon.

38
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,120
Feng Ran.

39
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,240
See our guest out.

40
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,880
Father God.

41
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,340
Hou Chi.

42
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,660
Upper God Gu Jun,

43
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,219
I love her so deeply and sincerely.

44
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,280
I truly want to marry her.

45
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,560
Why do you insist on refusing me?

46
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,619
Lord Qing Mu, you've saved my daughter several times.

47
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:19,300
We appreciate you for it.

48
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,360
You are the dragon and the phoenix among the people and the leader of the immortals.

49
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,020
But my daughter is too naughty to be a good match with you.

50
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,680
You still keep refusing me.

51
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,619
Why are you dissatisfied with me?

52
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,300
There can be no other.

53
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,580
It's just that I am reluctant to marry off my precious daughter.

54
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:48,200
I won't agree with your marriage.

55
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,720
Father God!

56
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,420
Feng Ran.

57
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,980
See him out.

58
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,240
Yes, God.

59
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,520
Please, My Lord.

60
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,760
Qing Mu bids farewell.

61
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,420
Qing Mu.

62
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,420
Qing Mu!

63
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,280
Qing Mu!

64
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,480
Father God. Father God.

65
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,760
Why do you hate Qing Mu so much?

66
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,779
I told you. I don't want you to leave me.

67
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:05,459
Since when did you become so unreasonable?

68
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,600
I've been bullied and mocked among the three realms.

69
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,899
Only Qing Mu has treated me so well and with his whole heart.

70
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,059
He makes me laugh. He even protects me with his life.

71
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,979
He's such a person who'd go against the three realms just for me.

72
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,520
Why did you refuse him for one perfunctory reason?

73
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm not intentionally perfunctory.

74
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,020
There are some things I can't tell you.

75
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,799
It's not something I can decide.

76
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,880
Why can't you?

77
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,600
Is it because of my lot?

78
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,220
In fact, I always wanted to ask you about it.

79
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,800
I wasn't given birth by Wu Huan.

80
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,920
I am not from the Flood Dragon Clan, either.

81
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,940
You didn't take me from the side of some hill.

82
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,739
For a long time, I thought my spiritual vein was blocked,

83
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:51,360
so I couldn't cultivate myself.

84
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,040
But Jing Yuan told me that

85
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,959
there is a powerful seal in my body that suppresses my spiritual power.

86
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,340
I know he didn't lie to me,

87
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,699
because I often recall some memories that do not belong to me.

88
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,099
When I was at Pilgrim Hall, I even saw the memories at the God Realm.

89
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,939
Father God, why can I see memories about the God Realm?

90
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:14,880
Why did I cultivate from Pilgrim Hall that the Heavenly King can't even cultivate?

91
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,480
Hou Chi, you've grown up.

92
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,240
I shouldn't continue to hide your lot.

93
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:35,460
In fact, there is a godly consciousness from the God Realm slumbering inside your body.

94
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,680
You're that goddess.

95
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,140
I am... a goddess from the God Realm?

96
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,080
60,000 years before, when the Doom of Chaos came,

97
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,619
the devils came for a fight. All the gods died.

98
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:53,739
You helped me with cultivation.

99
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:59,319
So during the Doom, I used up all my spiritual power to protect one of your godly consciousness.

100
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:01,839
But it was too weak.

101
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,719
So I came to the Human Realm.

102
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:06,759
I cultivated it in Huajing Pond for thousands of years.

103
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,020
Then you were born.

104
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,080
How about Bo Xuan?

105
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,219
Is he also from the God Realm?

106
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,879
No, he's just an ordinary immortal.

107
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,560
I once helped him when I came down into the realm.

108
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,240
To repay me, he agreed to stay in Qingchi Palace and take care of you.

109
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,679
It was I and Bo Xuan who sealed the godly consciousness in your body.

110
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,319
Father God, I still don't understand it.

111
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:40,780
Since she helped you, why didn't you wake her up after saving her?

112
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,440
It's her last wish.

113
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,340
As a goddess, she needed to be responsible for all living beings.

114
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,000
She couldn't control her destiny.

115
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,680
Back then, she died in the Doom of Chaos.

116
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,430
Her last wish was...

117
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,320
 I hope in my next life, I'm not a goddess anymore. 

118
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,560
If she has a next life, she won't be a goddess anymore.

119
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,580
But even she lost the memories,

120
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,880
she's still the most honorable one in the three realms.

121
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,580
It turns out I'm really not your daughter.

122
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,940
I was born from a godly consciousness.

123
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,720
You and Bo Xuan have treated me so well.

124
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,840
It's all because of the godly consciousness inside me.

125
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,460
For her last wish, you sealed my spiritual power since I was little,

126
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,980
despite being mocked by the three realms.

127
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,220
Hou Chi, it's not what you are thinking.

128
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,459
Is she Chief God Shang Gu?

129
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,520
How did you know?

130
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,960
I saw her when I devoured the Pilgrim Hall.

131
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,120
She looked the same as me.

132
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,220
Father God, in the past, I thought I was abandoned by my mother.

133
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,720
But at least, I still had Bo Xuan and my Father God who loved me so much.

134
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,400
Now I finally realize that

135
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,840
the reason why I exist is to fulfill another's last wish.

136
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,560
Since this body doesn't belong to me,

137
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,100
why did you give life to me?

138
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,639
I...

139
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,359
I never really owned anything.

140
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:45,360
Identity. Family.

141
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,480
Nothing belongs to me.

142
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,019
Hou Chi, Bo Xuan and I just want you to live happily and safely.

143
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,420
I won't listen!

144
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,199
I don't want to hear anything from you anymore.

145
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:01,580
You only care about her.

146
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,340
Hou Chi. Hou Chi!

147
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,040
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,440
Hou Chi, what happened?

149
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,660
What's wrong with you?

150
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,920
Are you angry with your father?

151
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,459
Silly you.

152
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:47,899
It's okay that he turned me down.

153
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:49,399
I can try harder.

154
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,799
He is your father.

155
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,860
He cares about you the most.

156
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,580
You shouldn't be angry with him because of me.

157
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,400
You don't understand.

158
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,799
He isn't...

159
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,439
Not what?

160
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:02,460
What happened exactly?

161
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,060
Qing Mu, do you like me?

162
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,740
Of course.

163
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,759
Am I really the one you like?

164
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,000
Do you like Hou Chi?

165
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,060
Of course, it's you.

166
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,040
Who else could it be?

167
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,059
I told you before. Our fates were predestined.

168
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:27,220
I felt very familiar with you when I first saw you.

169
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,180
It's as if we've known each other for thousands of years.

170
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,979
 In fact, I knew you earlier than you thought. 

171
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:41,519
 Thousands of years ago when I woke up at the North Sea, 

172
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,199
 I lost my memories. 

173
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,260
 But I kept dreaming of a girl. 

174
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,659
 Who is she? 

175
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:53,040
 The woman was standing in the thunder vortex wearing a black ancient robe. 

176
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,979
Thousands or tens of thousands years.

177
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,920
Do you like me

178
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,300
or the person you have dreamed of for thousands of years?

179
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,800
It's you in my dream.

180
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,000
No.

181
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,780
We are totally different.

182
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,139
I've never worn any dark black ancient robe,

183
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,520
nor appeared in your dreams.

184
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,120
She's not me.

185
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,359
Qing Mu, answer me.

186
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:29,979
Back to the day when we first met on Observation Mountain,

187
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:32,339
if you didn't see my bracelet,

188
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,420
nor think I was the destined one for you,

189
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,800
would you still have accompanied me to the demon clan to protect me with your life and fall in love with me?

190
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,320
I...

191
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,600
So...

192
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,040
So you all are the same.

193
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,240
Just because of the godly consciousness inside my body,

194
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,919
you all protect me and treat me well. Right?

195
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,160
What godly consciousness?

196
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,779
Hou Chi, I don't understand what you are talking about.

197
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,180
The person you like is inside my body.

198
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,380
One body can't contain two souls.

199
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,080
Either she devoured me or she vanished.

200
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:42,280
 I hope in the next life, I won't be a goddess and be with you. 

201
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,740
 Shang Gu, I won't let you die. 

202
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,319
If only one can survive, who would you choose?

203
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,080
You must not hurt her.

204
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,900
I see. "Don't hurt her."

205
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,760
Leave here.

206
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,040
I don't want to see you anymore.

207
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,219
No, Hou Chi.

208
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:25,999
I have no idea why I just said that.

209
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:27,880
Listen to me.

210
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,120
Qing Mu.

211
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,159
I told you the Lord of the North Sea shouldn't stay here in Qilian Mountain.

212
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,359
Upper God.

213
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:44,379
After I find Hou Chi, I'll come to apologize.

214
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,080
You aren't even clear about your feelings.

215
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,960
What's the point even if you bring her back?

216
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,139
What do you mean?

217
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:02,340
Just now Hou Chi asked about your choice, if only she or the godly consciousness in her body could survive,

218
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,780
who would you choose?

219
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,200
You can't even answer such an easy question.

220
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,680
How will you prove you love her?

221
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,320
I...

222
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,100
I don't understand what this godly consciousness inside her body means.

223
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,540
Hou Chi isn't my child.

224
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,099
She was born from Chief God Shang Gu's consciousness.

225
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:33,079
That consciousness is very powerful.

226
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,600
Once it revives, Hou Chi will lose her memory,

227
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,439
which means that for you, Hou Chi will disappear.

228
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:44,519
Qing Mu, Hou Chi isn't an ordinary immortal.

229
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,140
There won't be a good result if you insist on getting married.

230
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,660
It would be better to end all this soon to avoid all the pain in the future.

231
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,120
No.

232
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,879
I won't give up on Hou Chi.

233
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,999
Don't you have any doubts about it?

234
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:01,619
Why do you feel familiar with her?

235
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,239
Why do you care about her?

236
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:06,400
Is it really because she's Hou Chi?

237
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,900
If a person does not even know who he is, isn't it too early to rashly ask for someone else's marriage?

238
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:18,840
May I ask if you're talking about...

239
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,780
True God Bai Jue?

240
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Looks like you already have the answer in your head.

241
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,240
Bo Xuan.

242
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,860
Did you take care of me just for repaying my Father God's favor?

243
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,300
Why did you all protect me?

244
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,280
All for her, right?

245
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,890
Bo Xuan...

246
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,280
I've made up my mind.

247
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,660
I'm going to leave the Qingchi Palace to travel around the three realms.

248
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,900
Father God.

249
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,800
Here you are.

250
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,499
What's that?

251
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:37,099
I recently acquired a new piece of Red River Jade.

252
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:38,919
I want to give it to you as a gift.

253
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,439
Jian'er, you've always been obedient.

254
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,339
Back to the time when your Mother God was in the God Realm,

255
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:46,999
she likes jades from the immortals of Red River very much.

256
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,679
How about giving it to her?

257
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,820
All according to the arrangement of God Father.

258
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,480
 Report! 

259
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,299
Your Majesty, a report from the Luocha Region.

260
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,060
Go ahead.

261
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,899
The demons attacked them again.

262
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,039
Prince Jing Yang asks for your order

263
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,739
if you could send him more soldiers to help him fight back,

264
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:05,939
even... even annex the Demon Clan.

265
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,159
Let Jing Yang only defend the barrier between the immortals and demons.

266
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:12,139
If the demons don't attack us, we won't start the war.

267
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:13,660
Yes, Your Majesty!

268
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,659
Father God, if the Demon God attacks us,

269
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,720
I'm afraid my brother will...

270
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,540
It seems I need to go to Qingchi Palace in person.

271
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,419
Heavenly Queen, as you demanded, I've taken the immortal guards and blamed it on the demons.

272
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:37,920
It caused a conflict as expected.

273
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,639
Just now there was a report from the Luocha Region.

274
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,239
Prince Jing Yang asked for reinforcements.

275
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,720
What did His Majesty respond?

276
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,560
His Majesty is begging for peace

277
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,160
and is not allowing His Highness to start a counterattack.

278
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,059
It's what I expected.

279
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:57,500
Feng Nv, assign the soldiers to help Yang'er in the Luocha Region right now,

280
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,979
and remember to help him in secret to counterattack the demons.

281
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:06,799
If His Majesty learns of it, he'll blame you.

282
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,859
When soldiers fight, there will be casualties.

283
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:14,079
Luocha Region will have a steady stream of evil spirits for our use.

284
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,240
Compared with that,

285
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,960
it doesn't matter even His Majesty blames me.

286
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,319
- Leave me alone! Leave me alone! 
 - Don't move.

287
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,040
Let go of me! Let go of me!

288
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,160
Kid, if you don't obey,

289
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,180
I'll swallow you right now!

290
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,640
Miss Immortal, help me!

291
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,880
Immortal?

292
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,479
How bold you are!

293
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:45,659
Demons and immortals aren't allowed to enter the Human Realm.

294
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,379
How you dare snatch a human secretly!

295
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:48,439
Who are you, little immortal?

296
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:50,019
How dare you intervene into our business!

297
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:52,299
My master is the three-headed fire dragon.

298
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:54,479
This kid is the sacrifice for him.

299
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,879
You'd better get lost now.

300
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:58,959
Otherwise, if you anger him, he may destroy your family!

301
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,759
My family?

302
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,359
If he dares come to Qilian Mountain,

303
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,720
I'll definitely welcome him.

304
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,620
You are... Upper God Hou Chi from Qingchi Palace.

305
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,480
Let's go.

306
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,000
Who are you? Where are you from?

307
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,059
I'm Bai Shuo. I live in Dibei City.

308
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,720
How did they snatch you?

309
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,819
I have no idea. I got snatched when I woke up.

310
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:24,339
Miss Immortal, I want to go home.

311
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:27,599
Don't worry. I'll take you home right now.

312
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,000
 Hou Chi doesn't want to stay in the Immortal Realm... 

313
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,220
   
 or the Demon Realm. 

314
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,300
Only the Human Realm.

315
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,780
Wife, don't cry.

316
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,980
I've sent the guards to look for her.

317
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,980
It's useless.

318
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,440
There have been children missing one after another in the city.

319
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,899
People said they were snatched by the demons.

320
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:03,580
It must have happened to our child Shuo'er.

321
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,400
It won't.

322
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,720
- Shuo'er. 
 - Shuo'er!

323
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,979
- Dad. 
 - Shuo'er!

324
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:13,259
Shuo'er, where did you go?

325
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,099
Dad, I was taken by the demons.

326
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:18,220
Then this immortal lady saved me.

327
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,279
Thank you very much for saving my daughter.

328
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,619
A simple gesture. Don't mention it.

329
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,379
I've set up a spirit barrier for your mansion.

330
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:29,620
From now on, there won't be demons to attack you.

331
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,979
Wife, leave with Shuo'er.

332
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:33,600
All right.

333
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,039
You may not know that in fact, I'm the mayor here.

334
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:42,299
Recently, there have been many demons in the city.

335
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,399
Even though I sent guards to patrol,

336
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:46,439
many kids still get lost.

337
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:51,360
Now, I have no idea how to protect the city and people.

338
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,199
You're a powerful immortal.

339
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:57,159
Please stay here to defend my Dibei City.

340
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:59,099
I'll go and check it now.

341
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:01,260
Thank you very much.

342
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,099
Hey. Her Royal Highness has left.

343
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:14,940
But why isn't our master worried about her?

344
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,759
How do you know that he isn't worried?

345
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,159
Moreover, Lord Qing Mu is looking for her.

346
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,599
They'll be back soon.

347
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,760
It won't be that easy.

348
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,459
I heard that Upper God and Hou Chi had a fierce quarrel.

349
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:32,820
Her Royal Highness left the palace in tears.

350
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,900
- Did you see it in person? 
 - No.

351
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,760
Then, why are you talking nonsense?

352
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,699
Upper God is not good at expressing himself.

353
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:43,499
But he loves Her Royal Highness the most.

354
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:46,260
Why would he have a quarrel with her?

355
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,499
But she has been waiting for her Father God for a long time.

356
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:51,439
And she was willing to run away from home.

357
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:53,600
She must be heartbroken.

358
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,119
Stop talking nonsense!

359
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,499
If Upper God were to hear it, he'd be very upset.

360
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,600
Don't you have anything to do?

361
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
- Master. 
 - Master.

362
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,839
Master, I have herbs to prepare.

363
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,620
I'll leave now.

364
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,860
Just leave!

365
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,699
Master, don't listen to them.

366
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:19,199
Hou Chi is mad at you.

367
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:21,999
After she calms down, she'll be back.

368
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:26,319
Now, she's at the Bai Mansion in the Human Realm, being accompanied by Lord Qing Mu.

369
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,939
Don't worry.

370
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:29,920
Get some rest.

371
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,060
You already know.

372
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,600
   

373
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,780
 This body doesn't belong to me, 

374
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,980
 why did you still give life to me? 

375
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,760
 I... never really owned anything. 

376
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,940
 Identity. Family. 

377
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,380
 Nothing belongs to me. 

378
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,700
 All you care about is her. 

379
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:33,000
 A'Chi, I hope that day will never come. 

380
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,680
Go.

381
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,640
Stop!

382
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,900
Leave the children.

383
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,520
 Hou Chi? 

384
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,560
 What if she still doesn't want to see me... 

385
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,999
Please spare us, Upper Immortal.

386
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:53,959
Where are you from, demons?

387
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:56,839
How you dare snatch children in the Human Realm!

388
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,779
We work for Lord Three-Headed Fire Dragon.

389
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,379
He asked us to go to the Human Realm

390
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,679
and snatch boys and girls for his cultivation.

391
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,199
Please spare us.

392
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:06,739
We're just following his demand.

393
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:08,860
Lord Three-Headed Fire Dragon?

394
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,059
Go back to the Demon Realm!

395
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,679
If you intrude the Human Realm again,

396
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:14,699
I'll make you all disappear forever!

397
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:17,680
 - Yes. 
 - Yes. 

398
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:24,840
The Heavenly King and Demon Emperor made the deal 60,000 years ago that

399
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,420
both of them wouldn't intrude into the Human Realm.

400
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,380
How come the three-headed fire dragon has such audacity?

401
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,460
Perhaps, something happened to the Demon Clan.

402
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,739
Tell Jing Yuan in Xuanjing Palace that

403
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:43,140
I'm waiting for him in Dibei City in the Human Realm.

404
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,040
 Now, I must protect these people first. 

405
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,719
It's been 60,000 years.

406
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:20,700
Qingchi Palace is still the same as before.

407
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,400
Gu Jun,

408
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:28,499
it was my fault for not protecting Hou Chi in Blue Dragon Pavilion that day.

409
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,440
Let bygones be bygones.

410
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,259
Today, your coming here...

411
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,320
isn't just for chatting.  Right?

412
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,500
Gu Jun, be honest with me.

413
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,480
Is Hou Chi God Shang Gu?

414
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,320
No.

415
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,540
If she isn't,

416
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,950
then how was she able to enter the Pilgrim Hall

417
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,240
and inherit the Power of Chaos?

418
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,040
The reason she could enter Pilgrim Hall

419
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,140
is only because of chance and luck.

420
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,460
Never mind.

421
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,919
If you don't want to talk about Hou Chi,

422
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,239
I won't ask you anymore.

423
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:22,360
As you may know, Demon God has appeared.

424
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,619
I didn't expect that he was hidden in the Demon Realm as Demon Lord Zi Yue.

425
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:31,279
Compared to his personality back then,

426
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,119
he's patient enough to show his true body now.

427
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,839
The Demon God is very ambitious.

428
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,920
Back then he wanted to kill all living beings of the three realms

429
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,600
to become Chief God of Chaos and control the God Realm.

430
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Now he is back.

431
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,160
Sooner or later he will sacrifice everyone for the three realms again.

432
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,639
We have to find a way to stop him in time.

433
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:53,399
In the past, there were three True Gods to stop him.

434
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,260
Now they have all passed away.

435
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,359
If Demon God wants to destroy the three realms,

436
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,260
no one could stop him.

437
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,099
Last time, he showed his power in the Heavenly Palace.

438
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:09,079
I could feel that he hadn't recovered his power of True God.

439
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:15,000
But still, the power from the three of us may not kill him.

440
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,020
What if we can restart the God Realm

441
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,040
and wake up all the gods who are sleeping?

442
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,980
In that case, maybe we can stop him.

443
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,780
Restart the God Realm?

444
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,960
Easier said than done.

445
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,979
Once we collect four True Gods' divine weapons,

446
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:34,999
we can restart the God Realm.

447
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:37,379
Now, the Tai Cang Spear has chosen its master.

448
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:40,339
Halberd of Sun and Moon is under the barrier of immortals and demons.

449
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,799
If we can find the Emperor Sword and Purple Moon Whip,

450
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,940
it won't be difficult to restart the God Realm.

451
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,879
During the Doom of Chaos, the Purple Moon Whip was lost.

452
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:52,500
I'm afraid the Demon God has it already.

453
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,499
So we must find the other three before he recovers the power of a True God.

454
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,120
Then we'll have a chance.

455
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,299
Gu Jun, even if it's hard to restart the God Realm,

456
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,139
we have to give it a try.

457
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,840
Master Zhi Yang left the three realms to us.

458
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,740
We can't just watch the three realms repeatedly be destroyed by the Demon God.

459
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,240
I shouldn't turn you down, since it's about the doom of all living beings.

460
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,399
But last time, we both tried.

461
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,039
No one could open the Heavenly Pillar to take out Halberd of Sun and Moon.

462
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:32,920
That's why I came here today.

463
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,459
I want you to take Qing Mu to the Heavenly Pillar.

464
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:39,860
Tai Cang Spear and Halberd of Sun and Moon belong to the same vein.

465
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,700
They were all made by Ancestor God Qing Tian.

466
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Perhaps, Qing Mu could use the Power of Tai Cang to take back the Halberd of Sun and Moon.

467
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,759
If the immortals have two divine weapons,

468
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:52,019
even if we can't restart the God Realm,

469
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:55,720
we can counter the demons at least.

470
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,499
Okay, I'll promise you.

471
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:13,899
Feng Ran, bring Qing Mu back here.

472
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:15,940
Yes, Master.

473
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,960
 He must be back to the North Sea. 

474
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,839
- Miss Immortal. 
 - What happened?

475
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:30,919
Miss Immortal, who are you thinking of?

476
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,719
I've been calling you for a long time.

477
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,699
Is there a problem?

478
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,119
Play with me for a while, please.

479
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,340
Okay, let's go.

480
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,779
Are you really puzzled about who you like?

481
00:34:50,779 --> 00:34:54,340
I only love Hou Chi. Why did you say that?

482
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,159
I'm just scared of meeting her.

483
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,199
I'm worried that our relationship won't last long.

484
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,759
Won't last long?

485
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:04,739
If you're determined, then how will the relationship be short-lived?

486
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,140
No matter what, it's about Hou Chi.

487
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,140
I need to think about it carefully.

488
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,619
Oh, yes. Upper God Gu Jun wants to see you.

489
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,860
He wants to see me?

490
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,679
Though I can't help you with your worries,

491
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:27,140
perhaps when you go back, you can win that difficult old man's favor.

492
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,760
Your Majesty.

493
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,159
Your Majesty, I'm just got back from Wutong Forest.

494
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:48,100
Sorry for making you wait.

495
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,659
What happened in the Phoenix Clan?

496
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,839
Some phoenixes are about to be born.

497
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:55,659
The birth of a young phoenix is ​​a major event of the Phoenix Clan.

498
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,939
As the patriarch, I should be there.

499
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,000
So I went back to Wutong Forest for a couple of days

500
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,400
and dealt with some business.

501
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,720
A'Huan, if there's some business in the Phoenix Clan,

502
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,760
send Feng Nv to deal with it.

503
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,940
You don't have to work too hard.

504
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,179
Before Ancestor Feng Yun fell, he assigned me as the new patriarch.

505
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:21,719
I can't fail his trust.

506
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:25,779
The business in the Heavenly Palace is already enough to bother you.

507
00:36:25,779 --> 00:36:28,240
I just want you to relax a bit.

508
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,480
Never mind.

509
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,059
I'll stop talking.

510
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,940
Do you like that Red River Jade?

511
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,780
I like it very much.

512
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,159
It's nice that you like it.

513
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:46,639
Your Majesty, is this why you asked me to come here today?

514
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:53,160
Recently, the immortals and the demons have started to battle in the Luocha Region.

515
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,459
Did you send reinforcements to Yang'er?

516
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,779
The demons have been seeking a fight for a long time.

517
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,240
Once the battle starts, they won't end it easily.

518
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,920
You ordered Yang'er to defend rather than attack them.

519
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,920
He's on his own in the Luocha Region.

520
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,099
If anything happens to him, how can you bear any mishap?

521
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:16,099
He's always been impatient.

522
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,120
It's a good opportunity to train him.

523
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,039
Do you still remember when the God Realm still existed?

524
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:27,659
There was peace between the immortals and the demons,

525
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:30,279
and harmony in the three realms.

526
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:33,660
Now the two are against each other.

527
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,760
We failed the gods' expectations.

528
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,580
You're the Heavenly King.

529
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,820
For the three realms, you can ignore your son's safety.

530
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:48,700
But as his mother, I can't leave my child alone.

531
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,939
A'Huan, I understand your worries.

532
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,439
But still for reinforcements,

533
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,000
I hope it'll be the last time.

534
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,460
- Your Highness. 
 - It's a key moment to level up my divine power.

535
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,020
No one can stop me.

536
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,780
Kill those who have spoken too much.

537
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,460
Yes, Your Highness.

538
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,180
   

539
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,760
Demon God is still here!

540
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,040
Upper God Gu Jun,

541
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,120
didn't True God Bai Jue kill the Demon God back then?

542
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,220
Who could understand a god's thoughts?

543
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,739
Back then, the four True Gods were like siblings.

544
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:03,460
Maybe True God Bai Jue couldn't bear it.

545
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,599
A god attempted to destroy the world.

546
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,080
How could he not bear to kill such a god?

547
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,199
Young man, don't say such silly words.

548
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,919
Today, the reason I asked you to come here is that

549
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:22,299
I want you to help the Heavenly Palace to restart the God Realm

550
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,220
and protect the peace of the three realms.

551
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,140
Don't worry, Upper God Gu Jun.

552
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,400
Now that I have Tai Cang Spear with me,

553
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,200
even if you didn't instruct me to do so,

554
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,159
I won't let the Immortal and Demon Clans go to war.

555
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,600
All right.

556
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,379
In this case, get some rest for one day.

557
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:44,700
Tomorrow, go with me to Heavenly Pillar to take back the Halberd of Sun and Moon.

558
00:39:51,130 --> 00:40:00,910


559
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:10,059
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

560
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:16,939
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

561
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:23,359
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

562
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:29,549
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

563
00:40:29,549 --> 00:40:36,420
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

564
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:42,950
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

565
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:50,224
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

566
00:40:50,225 --> 00:40:57,000
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

567
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:14,019
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

568
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:20,499
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

569
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:27,780
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

570
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:36,280
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

571
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:42,859
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

572
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:49,739
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

573
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:56,124
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

574
00:41:56,124 --> 00:42:02,699
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

575
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:13,325
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
