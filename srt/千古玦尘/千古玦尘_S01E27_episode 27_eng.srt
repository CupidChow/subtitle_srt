1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:21,500
   

3
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,939
   

4
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,979
Upper God Hou Chi. Lordess Feng Ran.

5
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:32,138
We're fairies in the Heavenly Palace.

6
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:33,939
What are you doing here now?

7
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:38,699
Lordess Feng Ran, we're here to pay homage to Upper God Hou Chi.

8
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:41,958
Me?

9
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:44,039
Your Highness is an Upper God.

10
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,019
But you've seldom appeared in the past 60,000 years.

11
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:47,359
Absurd!

12
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,578
Is Upper God Hou Chi some precious exotic beast?

13
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:52,118
Sorry for my words. Please punish me.

14
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:53,518
Don't be afraid.

15
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,679
You came to see me. Now you've seen me.

16
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:58,218
You should leave if there is nothing else.

17
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,659
 Yes, Your Highness. 

18
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,558
There are rumors that Upper God Hou Chi is very vulgar.

19
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,278
Since they saw you today,

20
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:11,439
then they know that the rumor is not true.

21
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,359
Are Lord of the North Sea and my second brother back?

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,499
Yes, Your Highness the Princess.

23
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,159
They must have saved my big brother.

24
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,739
I know that nothing can stop him.

25
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,060
Y-Your Highness.

26
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,478
Why are you stammering?

27
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,799
What else?

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,879
The soldier outside the palace gate reported that

29
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,378
Lord of the North Sea came back with Qingchi Palace's Upper God and Lordess Feng Ran.

30
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:44,638
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,399
How dare he?

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,319
Father God bestowed our marriage.

33
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,420
How could he come back with that Hou Chi?

34
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,699
Where are they now?

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,199
After Second Highness took them to the Purple Pine Hall to rest,

36
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,038
then he and Lord Qing Mu went to the Great Hall to see His Majesty.

37
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:02,600
Father God.

38
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,599
You were able to save Jing Yang this time

39
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,999
and stopped the three-headed fire dragon from becoming a god,

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,999
you have contributed greatly.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,738
I will reward you well.

42
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:21,699
Father God, the battle with the three-headed fire dragon

43
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,818
all depended on the efforts of Lord Qing Mu.

44
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:26,040
I dare not take credit for it.

45
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,159
Jian'er, you don't need to be so modest.

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,319
Lord of the North Sea has contributed to the three realms this time,

47
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,638
so I declare the North Sea your domain.

48
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,799
You can enjoy unlimited honor of Heavenly Palace.

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,299
Your Majesty.

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,079
Lord of the North Sea, what do you mean?

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,358
I wonder if you still remember that when I left the Heavenly Palace,

52
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:51,579
I asked you for a promise.

53
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,599
Of course, I remember.

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,638
What? Is the North Sea not enough for you?

55
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,859
What I asked for is not the territory of the three realms.

56
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,700
Then what do you want? Just say it.

57
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,439
Please call off the engagement between Princess Jing Zhao and me.

58
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,218
No. Father God.

59
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,879
No, Father God.

60
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,360
Qing Mu. Qing Mu.

61
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,779
Zhao'er, back off!

62
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:28,539
Father God, no.

63
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,078
Lord of the North Sea wants to break off the engagement.

64
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,758
It is arrogant of him to refuse such a lucky engagement.

65
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:43,078
Qing Mu, did you really mean what you just said?

66
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,379
Yes.

67
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:50,119
Why? Is my daughter not good enough for you?

68
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:52,078
I have no such intention.

69
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,278
Princess Jing Zhao is noble,

70
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,398
I really dare not treat her casually.

71
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,299
It's just that I've already fallen in love with someone,

72
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,319
and will not marry others except her in my life.

73
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,978
If I marry the princess, it will be unfair to her.

74
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:05,699
Please forgive me.

75
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,078
Your Majesty's good intentions, I really can not accept.

76
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,578
Father God.

77
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:18,120
Your Majesty!

78
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,800
Lord of the North Sea, I would like to know who this woman really is.

79
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:33,039
You would rather give up the North Sea and Jing Zhao to marry her.

80
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,658
The one I like is Upper God Hou Chi of Qingchi Palace.

81
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,319
She's the only one I'll ever marry. May Your Majesty agree.

82
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,138
It's really her.

83
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,300
 - This Qing Mu is too bold. 
 - Right. 

84
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,600
Father God, you can't promise him.

85
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,100
If the engagement is to be broken off,

86
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,780
how can I stand in the three realms in the future?

87
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,279
Your Majesty, your order has always been kept.

88
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,240
How can you change it for Lord of the North Sea?

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,999
I've already said that

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,078
as long as Qing Mu can bring Jing Yang back,

91
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,018
then I'll grant him a promise.

92
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:13,978
All of the gods heard that,

93
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:17,860
how can I go back on what I said?

94
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,339
Your Majesty, then the Tai Cang Spear?

95
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,539
Forget it.

96
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,959
Qing Mu,

97
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,558
I'll take back your engagement today.

98
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,999
From now on, your marriage...

99
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,599
Father God.

100
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,620
...depends on yourself.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

102
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,140
Are you worried about Qing Mu?

103
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,958
Heavenly Palace has always acted tough.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,800
Even if Qing Mu's plan is perfect, I'm worried that something will go wrong.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,558
In Qingchi Palace these past years,

106
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:13,078
I've already regarded you as my own sister.

107
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,479
Although I don't have your comprehensive mind,

108
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,358
and I can't help you now.

109
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:21,678
I want to tell you that whether it is a mountain of swords or a sea of ​​fire,

110
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,159
I'll stay by your side.

111
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,218
Father God has canceled the engagement between Qing Mu and Jing Zhao.

112
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:31,139
From now on, the marriage of the Lord of the North Sea will be decided by himself.

113
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,698
Didn't you want Qing Mu to cancel the engagement?

114
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:57,439
Now that it is canceled, why do you look unhappy?

115
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:08,000
Seeing Qing Mu and Hou Chi, I couldn't help but think of Zhao'er.

116
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,780
Qing Mu.

117
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,078
Qing Mu, what's wrong?

118
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,459
Qing Mu. Qing Mu.

119
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:27,999
- Qing Mu, are you okay? 
 - Qing Mu.

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,899
Qing Mu!

121
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:31,300
- Qing Mu, are you all right? 
 - Qing Mu, what's wrong?

122
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,298
Jing Jian, how is Qing Mu doing?

123
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:46,099
Wasn't he just fine?

124
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,500
He was hurt by the Dragon's Breath of the three-headed fire dragon.

125
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:57,438
This Dragon's Breath is so treacherous and overbearing that when it first enters the body

126
00:08:57,438 --> 00:09:00,100
it will be mistaken for an ordinary aura and is difficult to be detected.

127
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,719
But when it attacks, it has already invaded into his spiritual vein.

128
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,118
 - What happened? 
 - Nothing. Let's go.  

129
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,719
Then is there any way to cure him?

130
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,519
The three-headed fire dragon is already a demi-god.

131
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,558
His Dragon's Breath is difficult to be dissolved by ordinary spiritual power.

132
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,500
Only immersing the power of an Upper God into Qing Mu's body can dissolve the Dragon's Breath.

133
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:28,479
Wouldn't it be that only the king and queen can save Qing Mu?

134
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,698
I'm going to beg the king.

135
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:32,399
Hou Chi, after the discussion in the hall today,

136
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,158
my mother quarreled with my father over Qing Mu's withdrawal from the marriage.

137
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,439
My father couldn't bear that, so he has gone to Pilgrim Hall to retreat.

138
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:39,699
Pilgrim Hall?

139
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:41,038
That is a sacred place of Heavenly Palace.

140
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,999
There is a god barrier outside it,

141
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,759
only Upper Gods can step into it.

142
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,578
If anyone tries to break into it,

143
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:49,739
they will be smashed by the power of the barrier.

144
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:52,698
Once Father God enters Pilgrim Hall,

145
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:55,760
he will not come out for months.

146
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,358
He was injured extremely badly.

147
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:01,199
If he can not be healed by this time tomorrow,

148
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,159
his life will be in danger.

149
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,760
Now, the only one who can save Qing Mu is my mother.

150
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:15,478
I'm going to beg Mother God now.

151
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,498
Wait. Let me go.

152
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:18,558
No, Hou Chi.

153
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,699
Today, Qing Mu refused to marry Jing Zhao,

154
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,099
she will definitely make things difficult for you.

155
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:24,718
You also said it was because of the engagement,

156
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:28,439
then even if Jing Jian goes to beg her, she won't change her mind.

157
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:39,098
Qing Mu gave up the marriage granted by Heaven and the North Sea for me.

158
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:40,798
I can't just wait here.

159
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,279
As long as I can save him, I won't hesitate to do anything.

160
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,719
I can bear everything.

161
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:04,358
Hou Chi of Qingchi Palace begs to see the queen.

162
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,319
It turned out to be Upper God Hou Chi.

163
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,279
Just then, I didn't recognize you from a distance

164
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,839
and I thought you were just a fairy.

165
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,300
Please inform her of my arrival.

166
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,998
Unfortunately, the queen is resting now.

167
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:18,719
Please wait here for a moment.

168
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:21,038
Wait.

169
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,959
How long will the queen rest?

170
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,399
How could I know the things of the queen?

171
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,279
Sometimes it's only for half an hour.

172
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,099
If she is in a bad mood,

173
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:31,519
she may refuse to see guests for three or five days.

174
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,478
By the way, I heard that an incident happened in the hall today,

175
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:36,839
which made the queen unhappy.

176
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,579
I'm afraid you have to wait a few more days.

177
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,999
The queen doesn't have to see me.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,899
But what if it's about the safety of the Heavenly Palace and the Immortal and Demon Clans?

179
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,339
Mother God, they humiliated me so much in the hall.

180
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,579
Please, Mother God, you must get justice for me.

181
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,238
Qing Mu has broken off the engagement,

182
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:09,238
but he has not yet married Hou Chi.

183
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:11,258
You still have the chance.

184
00:12:11,258 --> 00:12:13,059
But I want to ask you.

185
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:14,980
Mother, please ask.

186
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,038
You are the princess of the Heavenly Palace with the blood of a golden dragon.

187
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:22,680
You will inherit the Heavenly Palace in the future.

188
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,659
Are you sure you won't marry others except him?

189
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:31,559
Mother God, I wish for nothing else in my life but this person.

190
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,159
Even if he doesn't like you

191
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,640
and abandons this marriage without any pity?

192
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,759
That's because he doesn't know me well yet.

193
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,879
Between her and me, I think there is no difference.

194
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,819
As long as Qing Mu marries me,

195
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,420
being together forever,

196
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,640
he will treat me with deep love.

197
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,819
Good. You are truly my daughter.

198
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:15,680
I've never given up in the ups and downs of my life,

199
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,299
the same goes for you.

200
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,698
But my father has already promised to that.

201
00:13:22,698 --> 00:13:26,579
Your Queen, Goddess Hou Chi is waiting outside.

202
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,159
Since she came to see me by herself,

203
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,950
it seems that...

204
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,880
you still have a chance.

205
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,438
- How are you? 
 - What happened to me?

206
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:03,339
You were hurt by the Dragon's Breath of the three-headed fire dragon.

207
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:06,479
Do you know that it is extremely dangerous and will kill you?

208
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,719
Don't worry. Hou Chi has gone to beg my mother.

209
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:12,238
As long as she helps you, you will be safe.

210
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:14,418
- Jing Jian. 
 - What?

211
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:16,640
How could you let Hou Chi…

212
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,979
   

213
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:25,000
Hou Chi has come to greet Your Highness the Queen.

214
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,079
 Shang Gu? 

215
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,279
 No. 

216
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,659
 She may look similar to Shang Gu, 

217
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:35,979
 but their temperaments are too different. 

218
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:37,479
Your Highness.

219
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:43,639
In terms of rank, you and I are both upper gods.

220
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,598
It's suitable to bow your hands,

221
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:48,039
but I am your honorable elder.

222
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:50,639
You won't show respect to your mother.

223
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,460
Is that what your father taught you all these years?

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,959
I grew up in Qingchi Palace,

225
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,918
and only have one father, Gu Jun, in this world.

226
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,020
I've never had a mother god.

227
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,498
Your Queen is noble,

228
00:15:03,498 --> 00:15:06,920
how dare I get involved with you at will.

229
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,080
You are just like your father god.

230
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,980
Just say it.

231
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,358
What is it you want?

232
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:22,019
I'm here to make a deal with you.

233
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:26,359
- A deal? 
 - It has been 60,000 years.

234
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,918
I was worried that you would forget Qingchi Palace,

235
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,179
but just now you mentioned my father god.

236
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:35,159
You must know the reason why Qingchi Palace exists.

237
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,839
In the past, when the God Realm was closed,

238
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,859
Master Zhi Yang ordered my father, the king, and the queen to manage the Lower Realm.

239
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:44,299
Immortals and demons have been fighting for a long time, with constant friction.

240
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:47,398
Qingchi Palace is impartial and not controlled by the two clans,

241
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,500
which makes the three parts of Heaven live in peace with each other.

242
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,759
Does Your Highness the Queen believe I am right?

243
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,060
Yes.

244
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,839
Today, I'm here for the matter between the immortal and demon clans.

245
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,659
If you agree to my petition,

246
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:06,799
I'm willing to lead the Qingchi Palace to submit to Heavenly Palace to resist the demons.

247
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,439
The Qilian Mountain has thousands of miles of spiritual veins,

248
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,939
if we get it, the Heavenly Palace will go to a higher level.

249
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:20,100
Within 100 years, there will be a few more gods.

250
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,399
At that time, it will be difficult for the Demon Clan to be the enemy of the Immortal Clan.

251
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,300
Your proposal is really heartwarming.

252
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,959
But you're so generous,

253
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,860
I think you're here for something more important.

254
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,880
Let me guess.

255
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:42,220
Is it for the Lord of the North Sea, Qing Mu?

256
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,839
It is indeed for Qing Mu, the Lord of the North Sea.

257
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,079
He was hurt by the three-headed fire dragon.

258
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,780
Only the power of Upper Gods can save him.

259
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,259
I really wonder how your father would feel if he were here.

260
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,859
How would he feel when he saw that his daughter,

261
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:06,239
whom he had worked so hard to protect, to surrender Qilian Mountain to someone else for a man?

262
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:08,399
You're wrong.

263
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,879
Power is not the only thing that matters in this world.

264
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,759
If my father were here,

265
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,238
he would only hope for me to be happy

266
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:20,440
and do what I want to do for the people I love.

267
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,358
The Heavenly Palace has always valued strength,

268
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,838
so you have forced the Lord of the North Sea to fight for the Heavenly Palace several times.

269
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,419
What I did was also in line with what you wished, right?

270
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,759
Qingchi Palace is loyal to the Heaven Palace,

271
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,580
and the demon clan won't be a problem,

272
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,138
that is in line with my wish.

273
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:41,738
But, Hou Chi,

274
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:46,779
now I'm unwilling to agree to your request.

275
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,519
Why?

276
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,439
Because you haven't given me what I want.

277
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,159
You overestimate Qingchi Palace and yourself.

278
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,159
I will not take back the Qilian Mountain just because of nostalgia.

279
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:07,999
If the Heavenly Palace army goes there,

280
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,980
you can't stop me with your ability.

281
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:16,759
What you want is Jing Zhao's marriage, right?

282
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,159
That's right.

283
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,759
For 60,000 years, you have never come to see me in the name of my mother god.

284
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,499
Even today, there is still no affection at all.

285
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:34,458
I want to know that apart from your past with my father god,

286
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:38,339
what else could make you so disgusted with me?

287
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,279
I don't care about you at all.

288
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,598
But what I see today makes me interested in you.

289
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,559
You look so proud but have to bow to me,

290
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,519
which really makes me happy.

291
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:03,518
Qing Mu, don't be so worried.

292
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,550
Although my mother is unhappy with your decision to break off the engagement,

293
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,078
she is not unreasonable.

294
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,399
After all, Hou Chi has a blood relationship with her,

295
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,899
she won't embarrass her too much.

296
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:13,478
If she really won't trouble us,

297
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,479
she shouldn't have said those words in the hall today.

298
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:19,860
- That's because… 
 - But, Qing Mu, Hou Chi is begging the queen to save your life.

299
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,759
What if you break in like this and annoy the queen?

300
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,779
If the queen really wants to save my life, just call me a villain.

301
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:29,999
I will bear any punishment myself.

302
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,279
His Majesty had promised to cancel the engagement between Jing Zhao and Qing Mu.

303
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,899
If you mention the marriage again,

304
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:47,739
are you not afraid that the immortals will laugh?

305
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,919
If Qing Mu takes the initiative to ask for marriage

306
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,958
and explains it clear in front of everyone,

307
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,298
then it would just be a youth's joke to withdraw the engagement.

308
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,100
His Majesty has always been benevolent, so he might agree.

309
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,599
Qing Mu has already said that the person he loves is me.

310
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,639
So what explanation, then, would Your Highness have?

311
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,579
All the immortals know that although in name you are an Upper God,

312
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:23,078
your spiritual power is that of a fairy.

313
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:26,078
But the Lord of the North Sea, Qing Mu, was already

314
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:28,238
the first Upper God in the God Realm 1,000 years ago.

315
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:32,700
How can you match him in terms of power?

316
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:34,759
In my opinion,

317
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:38,838
Lord of the North Sea is only in love with you for the moment.

318
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,999
Zhao'er met with Qing Mu earlier than you.

319
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,338
In the Heavenly Palace, there have been rumors of their love for many years.

320
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:48,019
At that time, I just needed to spread the gossip.

321
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:51,238
Everyone will think that you took the initiative to pester Qing Mu.

322
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:57,099
At that time, Upper God Hou Chi will end up being teased.

323
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:02,679
It turns out that you have already thought about it clearly.

324
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,738
I was abrupt.

325
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:09,399
To tell you the truth, it's very easy for me to save Qing Mu.

326
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:11,899
But you insulted Jing Zhao many times,

327
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:14,378
I really can't forgive you.

328
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:17,039
If you really want me to save him,

329
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:23,358
then kneel here for a few hours.

330
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,480
When I'm in a good mood,

331
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,300
I may be able to agree to this.

332
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,778
What? You and I are both Upper Gods,

333
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:40,198
but in terms of seniority, I am tens of thousands of years ahead of you.

334
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,760
Can't you kneel to me?

335
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,479
Now in the Heavenly Palace, I'm your master.

336
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:50,098
I'm older than you, and I am the senior, you are the junior,

337
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:53,560
so you should kneel to me.

338
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,259
Besides, don't you want to save Qing Mu?

339
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,339
No need to kneel!

340
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,759
Goddess Hou Chi and you are both Upper Gods,

341
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,338
so there are no superiors and inferiors between you.

342
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:12,079
No need to kneel.

343
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,158
Qing Mu, you're injured. What brings you here?

344
00:22:16,158 --> 00:22:20,780
If I didn't come, were you really going to do such a stupid thing?

345
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,679
Lord of the North Sea, Qing Mu, came here late at night,

346
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,618
isn't it enough to make trouble in the hall?

347
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:29,558
Although I'm humble, I'm still strong-willed.

348
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:33,899
I don't want to see Hou Chi humbly do what she doesn't want to do for me,

349
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:36,720
and to please the people she doesn't want to see.

350
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,999
Qing Mu.

351
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,198
Do you know what kind of crime it is to break into  Fu Yao Hall at night?

352
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:44,198
I'm not talented, so I can't really guess as to why

353
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,579
you want to violate common decency as queen

354
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:49,140
to trouble Hou Chi and me all the time.

355
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,540
Just because we are in love with each other,

356
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,590
why do you force us with power and our lives?

357
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,599
Well, since you forced me to marry in spite of the order of His Majesty,

358
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,118
then I don't mind another charge of disrespect.

359
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,839
Anyway, I'm a dying man.

360
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,298
Qing Mu, don't do that.

361
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:11,899
Let's go. I don't want to stay here.

362
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:15,178
Lord of the North Sea, Qing Mu, is truly brave.

363
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:19,680
When did I say that I would go against the will of His Majesty?

364
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,050
But I won't save you until she kneels for a day.

365
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,299
She will never kneel.

366
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:31,299
Hou Chi, didn't you boast of your deep love for Lord Qing Mu?

367
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:33,799
His Majesty is in the Pilgrim Hall now.

368
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,099
If you refuse to kneel for me, then go and beg him.

369
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:41,240
Pilgrim Hall.

370
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,378
It's said that Pilgrim Hall is protected by the god barrier from ancient times.

371
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:47,118
If you are not an Upper God, she would surely be smashed to death by the barrier.

372
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:50,359
Your Highness, you're going to kill Hou Chi.

373
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,670
Your life or his,

374
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,420
it's up to you.

375
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,999
Let's go.

376
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,259
How's it going? Did the queen agree to save him?

377
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:18,118
She almost agreed, but…

378
00:24:18,118 --> 00:24:20,759
If you really go to Pilgrim Hall, I will be angry.

379
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,118
It's about your life.

380
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,559
I must go to Pilgrim Hall to beg the king to save you.

381
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,738
No. I won't let you go.

382
00:24:26,738 --> 00:24:28,399
Let me go to beg my father.

383
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:31,458
I have the divine power given by my father for protection, so I will probably be fine.

384
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,759
I should go, my cultivation is higher than yours.

385
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,758
No. You stay here to take care of Qing Mu.

386
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:39,238
I'm going to Pilgrim Hall now. I have the name of an Upper God.

387
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:40,660
Enough.

388
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,739
Hou Chi, you and I have not been together

389
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:47,339
for a long time since we left Qingchi Palace.

390
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,879
I'm not afraid of death at all.

391
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,159
As long as I have you with me, I will die with no regret.

392
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,939
I want to go to the North Sea, can you accompany me to go there?

393
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:13,338
I can't see enough of the place where we fell in love.

394
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:17,659
Qing Mu, let's go back.

395
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:19,430
Hou Chi,

396
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,290
in fact, I knew you much earlier than you thought.

397
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,659
1,000 years ago,

398
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:28,958
I woke up in the North Sea without memory,

399
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:31,920
but I kept dreaming of a woman.

400
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,279
What woman?

401
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,759
That woman looks just like you,

402
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,479
standing in the vortex of thunder.

403
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:41,859
How could the person in your dream be me?

404
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:45,119
It's you.

405
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:51,260
Our destiny may have began earlier than when we met each other.

406
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,179
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

407
00:25:55,179 --> 00:26:01,580
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

408
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:06,038
After I met you, I understood what annoyance was,

409
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:09,599
what happiness was, and what feelings and desires were.

410
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:14,799
Fate has treated me well

411
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,880
by letting us meet at this moment.

412
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:20,859
I'm already satisfied.

413
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,760
But I…

414
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
If there is an afterlife,

415
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,739
I hope you will meet me before I meet you.

416
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,158
But if there is no afterlife, where can I find you?

417
00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:40,660
Then live well alone.

418
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,610
I don't want an afterlife but this life.

419
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:51,300
I don't want you to give up Qingchi Palace for me,

420
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,459
nor give up your dignity and life for me.

421
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:58,120
Even if you get this life for me,

422
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,999
I will live in regret and guilt.

423
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:11,080
I only hope you can be happy.

424
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,858
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

425
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:20,120
Qing Mu, let's go back now. I must save you.

426
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,699
Zhao'er, what did mother say?

427
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:38,159
She refuses to see you.

428
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,718
She said that if Hou Chi refuses to leave Qing Mu,

429
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:42,700
she will not save him.

430
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,299
Zhao'er, I know that you feel aggrieved.

431
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:48,179
But Qing Mu is in danger now.

432
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:51,759
If you really like him, you should take his life as a priority, not your anger.

433
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:54,939
Brother, of course, I know what is at stake.

434
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:58,498
But no matter how I begged Mother, she refuses to save him.

435
00:27:58,498 --> 00:28:02,079
Does she really want Qing Mu to die?

436
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,879
Don't talk nonsense.

437
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,440
Our mother is proud of her life, and she loves you very much.

438
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,180
Maybe she is just very unwilling to see you get treated unjustly.

439
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:14,239
Okay.

440
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:18,338
Then I'll keep begging Mother until she changes her mind.

441
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,939
They are back.

442
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:37,900
Where is Hou Chi?

443
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,459
Qing Mu is dying.

444
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:42,119
Hou Chi is not here, she must have gone to Pilgrim Hall.

445
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,999
She can't survive there with her low spiritual power.

446
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:46,358
No. I have to save her.

447
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,979
You stay here to give spiritual power to him to keep his life.

448
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,839
I'm going to Pilgrim Hall.

449
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:53,499
It's a matter of Qingchi Palace. You're in an awkward position.

450
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:57,499
If you are involved, it will definitely cause you to be unfaithful and unfilial.

451
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:58,960
Feng Ran!

452
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,978
   

453
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:12,899
Mother God, how can you be in the mood to look at paintings?

454
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:16,898
After tonight, Qing Mu may die.

455
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:18,880
Have a look here.

456
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,419
This is Yu Ran from the Phoenix Clan who has cultivated to an Upper God at the age of 3,000 years.

457
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:28,570
His grandfather is Feng Yun, the former patriarch of the Phoenix Clan.

458
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:34,679
He is good-looking, highly skilled in martial arts, and considered honorable.

459
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,779
Mother God, what do you mean?

460
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:39,759
I changed my mind.

461
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,960
Qing Mu is a person who would rather die than surrender.

462
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,899
Even if you marry him, you can not change his mind.

463
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:51,920
Mother God.

464
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,059
I am not rushing to marry Qing Mu.

465
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:57,858
I only hope that you can save him.

466
00:29:57,858 --> 00:30:00,279
In my heart, there is only Qing Mu alone.

467
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,880
No one can replace him.

468
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:09,318
Your Queen, bad news.

469
00:30:09,318 --> 00:30:11,039
What happened?

470
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,039
Hou Chi broke into Pilgrim Hall,

471
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,800
and is now being confronted by the heavenly soldiers.

472
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,459
Hou Chi is really not afraid of death.

473
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:24,380
I won't allow them to be presumptuous in the Heavenly Palace.

474
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,799
Pilgrim Hall is a sacred place in the Heavenly Palace.

475
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,699
Even you are the Upper God of Qingchi Palace, you can't break in without permission.

476
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,198
Hou Chi, how are you doing?

477
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:57,679
Feng Ran, help me block the heavenly soldiers.

478
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,180
Hou Chi.

479
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:01,640
Hou Chi!

480
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,660
Hou Chi!

481
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:29,099
 Your Royal Highness. 

482
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,460
The barrier of Pilgrim Hall has no effect on her.

483
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:14,419
Dispose of this intruder who trespassed on the spot right now.

484
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,319
Jian'er, what do you mean by this?

485
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,978
Mother God, what happened today was all my idea.

486
00:33:36,978 --> 00:33:42,419
If you want to punish Lordess Feng Ran, please punish me as well.

487
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,639
Your idea?

488
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,118
Do you think I'm a fool?

489
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:52,360
Don't make up such rhetoric for a moment of bravery.

490
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,818
Mother God, Qing Mu is my best friend.

491
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,580
Feng Ran.

492
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,120
Feng Ran is the one I love.

493
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,858
Today, I dare not concede, and cannot concede.

494
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:16,800
If you really want to enter Pilgrim Hall,

495
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,579
please kill me first.

496
00:34:59,379 --> 00:35:02,799
Hou Chi of Qingchi Palace is asking to see Your Majesty.

497
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,960
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

498
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,039
 His Majesty is meditating. 

499
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,880
 I can only use spiritual power to wake him up, but my spiritual power is weak. 

500
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,699
 Fine, I can't care so much. 

501
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:22,178
Your Majesty, Qing Mu has been poisoned by the Dragon's Breath.

502
00:35:22,178 --> 00:35:24,678
Only you can save him in this world.

503
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:27,420
Please, help him.

504
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,698
Please save Qing Mu, for the sake of my father.

505
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,460
Hou Chi.

506
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:54,359
Hou Chi.

507
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,740
Why am I not as good as her?

508
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,300
Why is it you?

509
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,059
Where is Hou Chi?

510
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,719
In order to be with you, I disregarded the will of my parents. But what about her?

511
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:17,059
She made you into such a state, but you still think about her.

512
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:21,979
Qing Mu, have a look! I'm the one who is saving you now.

513
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:25,740
Don't hurt her. Don't hurt her.

514
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,940
You won't let me bother you, then I will save you.

515
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,998
Not only to save you, but also to let you never forget me forever.

516
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,840
Hou Chi?

517
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,619
Do not rush. Your spiritual power is weak.

518
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:00,298
I will pass some spiritual power to you, then you will feel better.

519
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,159
What?

520
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:29,980
Pilgrim Hall chooses Hou Chi as master.

521
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:01,999
 Bad Bai Jue, leaving me alone to study here, but slips into the Lower Realm to have fun himself. 

522
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:06,019
 When I take over the post of Chief God, I will demote you to the Lower Realm first. 

523
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:08,359
 Let you live in the deepest part of the North Sea 

524
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,919
 for 10,000 years. No. For 60,000 years, 

525
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:13,859
 so that you will never see the sun. 

526
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,320
Hou Chi.

527
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,300
No.

528
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,599
She may not be able to bear the Power of Chaos.

529
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,479
It's dangerous to go on like this.

530
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,679
 Congratulations on Her Royal Highness's birthday. 

531
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,138
 How is it? Is Goddess Yue Mi satisfied with this? 

532
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,139
It's impossible.

533
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,220
Absolutely impossible!

534
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:23,400


535
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,999
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

536
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,900
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

537
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:43,400
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

538
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,500
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

539
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:56,400
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

540
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,900
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

541
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:10,200
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

542
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,300
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

543
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,999
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

544
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,500
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

545
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:47,600
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

546
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:55,200
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

547
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:02,720
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

548
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:09,700
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

549
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:15,999
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

550
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,600
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

551
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:34,380
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
