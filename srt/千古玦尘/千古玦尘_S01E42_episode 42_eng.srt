1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,960


2
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:21,530
   

3
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,950
   

4
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,577
Master, you're finally back.

5
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:30,389
The Demon Realm has been in chaos when the Purple Moon disappeared.

6
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:32,859
Demon Emperor was hurt very badly.

7
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,170
What happened to Her Royal Highness?

8
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,549
Is Master Shang Gu going to wake up?

9
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,250
Go and find Feng Ran. Ask her to come to Xuanjing Palace quickly.

10
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,672
Yes.

11
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,608
Hou Chi? Hou Chi.

12
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:04,209
Your child is of the divine vein and he will take all of your energy.

13
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:07,670
His birth will cost your god consciousness.

14
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,369
I can feel that it's going to be born.

15
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:14,768
Promise me.

16
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:22,750
Protect my child even if I die.

17
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,850
No, Hou Chi.

18
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,749
I beg you. You must protect my child.

19
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:34,350
He... He's innocent.

20
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,810
Okay. I promise.

21
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,370
I'll keep him safe no matter what happens.

22
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,048
Hou Chi, you're the closest person to me.

23
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:07,109
I'll try every possible way to keep you and the child safe.

24
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:08,469
 ♫ Separated by life and death ♫ 

25
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:13,374
 ♫ He guards the three realms for her ♫ 

26
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:18,599
 ♫ The idea of living still echoes in my ears ♫ 

27
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,349
 ♫ Once again ♫ 

28
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:27,500
 ♫ This love will never die ♫ 

29
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,860
Shang Gu.

30
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,850
Master.

31
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,349
If you need anything, just let me know.

32
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,229
Shang Gu.

33
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,029
Shang Gu.

34
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,528
- Leave us. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

35
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,030
Sen Yu!

36
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,489
Is Demon God out of his mind?

37
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:43,680
How can we fight against the Immortal Clan without the Purple Moon?

38
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,189
Most of the demons at Triple Heaven rely on it to cultivate their power.

39
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,609
Let's go back to see His Majesty.

40
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:51,209
Okay.

41
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,648
Guard the camp!

42
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:56,070
Let's go.

43
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,808
The two clans are negotiating.

44
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:09,008
Jing Yang, what do you want?

45
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:13,548
Demon God disrupted the Blue Dome of Heaven and stabbed True God Bai Jue.

46
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:17,609
I was ordered to kill you all!

47
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:22,110
Guards! Kill all the demons to remove potential threats!

48
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,850
 Yes, sir! 

49
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,949
A'Qin.

50
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,810
Sen Yu!

51
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,269
A'Qin! Go!

52
00:05:53,269 --> 00:06:00,129
Tell Father that Master Tian Qi brought the Demon Clan to this unfortunate situation.

53
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,789
Just leave!

54
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,790
No!

55
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,688
Why? Why didn't you leave?

56
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:43,529
Without the Purple Moon, you won't be able to defeat him even if you use your demon elixir.

57
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,050
Behind me is our clan.

58
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,520
I must fight even with no hope of winning.

59
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,589
Great. We're not leaving.

60
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:57,310
We'll fight this to the last breath.

61
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,890
Stop it.

62
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,250
Brother, I beat the drum.

63
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,850
The Demon Clan didn't invade the Luocha Region.

64
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,950
Sorry. I needed to save someone.

65
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,309
Jing Jian, are you out of your mind?

66
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:21,630
You're helping the demons?

67
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,269
Brother, please withdraw. Don't make me turn against you.

68
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:27,949
Today, Demon God caused such a scene at the Blue Dome of Heaven.

69
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,609
There's no room for a negotiation between the two clans.

70
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:34,089
We must kill all the demons once and for all.

71
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:36,479
Brother, don't make more mistakes.

72
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,609
Demons are also living creatures. Why do you have to exterminate the clan?

73
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:43,429
Move away! It's Mother God's order to kill the demons!

74
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,249
But Father God has ordered to make peace with them!

75
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:47,770
You...

76
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,870
You're just like Father, with useless, soft hearts!

77
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,149
Please calm down.

78
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:15,550
If it were not for Mu Guang, I could've taken down both of them!

79
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,029
Heavenly soldiers are on guard. What if they found out...

80
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,229
- I fear nothing. What are you so scared of? 
 - You said we should be cautious, like on thin ice.

81
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,030
Wh-What's happening to me?

82
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,269
I can't control my evil auras.

83
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,809
For the sake of a marriage of 60,000 years, I don't want to make Mu Guang angry.

84
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:53,988
But I do resent his temper, he is indecisive and full of benevolence and morality.

85
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:58,089
How can I deal with those True Gods with him here?

86
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,260
What if Tian Qi seized the chance

87
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,470
and told Bai Jue it was me who caused Yue Mi's death?

88
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,349
I was going to kill Tian Qi and Hou Chi at the wedding.

89
00:09:12,349 --> 00:09:14,249
But the move turned out to be self-defeating,

90
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:17,350
bringing Shang Gu back to life.

91
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,429
I miscalculated.

92
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,229
But Tian Qi hasn't restored his power

93
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:32,890
while Hou Chi hasn't been awakened as Shang Gu.

94
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,149
Such a good opportunity.

95
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:40,000
I can't miss this great opportunity.

96
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,629
Feng Nv.

97
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,908
Your Highness, but...

98
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:51,249
Just do as I have commanded.

99
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:54,008
If anything happens, I'll take care of it.

100
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:55,789
But if His Majesty were to blame...

101
00:09:55,789 --> 00:10:00,068
After all, the death of Yue Mi was just an accident.

102
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:03,830
Mu Guang won't punish me heavily as we've been married for 60,000 years.

103
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,190
Even if he learns that I've become a devil,

104
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,860
I know how to cope with that.

105
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,350
Sure.

106
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:23,548
Are you all right?

107
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:25,530
I'm fine.

108
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,308
Master Jing Yuan has returned to Xuanjing Palace with Hou Chi.

109
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,490
He asked me to bring you to him.

110
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:33,896
This is...

111
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:36,589
Earlier Master took back the power of the Purple Moon...

112
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,389
These people must have bad intentions.

113
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,269
You go in first and leave it to me.

114
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:07,868
Your hair...

115
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:10,668
What on earth happened at the Blue Dome of Heaven?

116
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:14,970
Gu Jun is dead.

117
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,069
Did Wu Huan do that? I'll go and kill her.

118
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:19,780
Feng Ran, come back.

119
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,789
Hou Chi is about to wake up as Shang Gu.

120
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:29,350
But her spiritual body is so weak that she can't bear the Chaos power core,

121
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,329
not to mention that she just gave birth.

122
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:34,089
She needs your help.

123
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,350
This child...

124
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,290
It's Qing Mu's child.

125
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,769
Slow down.

126
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:17,281
Your Highness, you're finally here.

127
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,869
It's the Demon Emperor...

128
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,750
Something has happened to him.

129
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:02,089
Emperor Father,

130
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,950
your son's here.

131
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,509
Look at me.

132
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:11,669
Talk to me!

133
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:21,789
Emperor Father! Last time when I made a mistake,

134
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:26,349
you said you'd get to me when I came back.

135
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:29,070
Now I'm back to take my punishment.

136
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,029
Please punish me! Criticize me!

137
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,130
Emperor Father.

138
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:40,809
Wake up.

139
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:23,089
With a Demon God like that, how can we possibly win?

140
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:31,109
His Majesty integrated his life's power into the Purple Moon.

141
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:37,409
When Demon God took it back, he took all the demon power from our emperor!

142
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,529
I should've rebelled against him!

143
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,748
Sen Yu, calm down.

144
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:49,309
No matter what he has done, Demon God is the foundation of our clan.

145
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:53,668
An internal feud in a time of great danger will give the Immortal Clan an opportunity.

146
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:56,150
Sister Qin, you're heartless!

147
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,988
His Majesty treated you as if you were his own daughter.

148
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:04,109
Now he's gone, yet you want to forget about revenge.

149
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:07,169
In such a crisis, you're trying to stir up trouble!

150
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:11,830
If you do care, come up with something to help His Highness.

151
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:21,569
I cannot accept that the life of my father ended up like this.

152
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:24,489
Where are the seniors of Xuanjing Palace?

153
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:27,090
They were angry over Demon Emperor's death

154
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,690
and set off for Purple Moon Spring with their grievances.

155
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,430
Sen Yu, are you going to kill Demon God?

156
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,110
As a son, I have to avenge my father.

157
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,690
And as a young prince, I have to protect our clan.

158
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:52,910
But if Demon God dies, then nobody can protect our clan.

159
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:05,170
Sen Yu!

160
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:09,788
Sen Yu! Sen Yu!

161
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:26,469
Everyone, what is the meaning of this?

162
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,988
Purple Moon Spring is where Master lives

163
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,949
and no visitors are allowed.

164
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,628
If Demon God had a clear conscience, then why is he hiding from us?

165
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:38,988
He took away the Purple Moon and now half of our life's cultivation has gone.

166
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:41,890
Shouldn't he show up and explain it to us?

167
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:47,308
But without it, your cultivation wouldn't have been so high.

168
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,639
Master just took back what belonged to him.

169
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,890
Why does he need to explain that to you?

170
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,250
Just leave here.

171
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,429
Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless.

172
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:58,170
"Take back what belongs to him"?

173
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:05,610
Zi Han, the Demon Clan did receive help from Jing Yuan.

174
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:10,668
But for 60,000 years, we turned against the rest of the world just for him.

175
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:13,068
And all the demons worked to keep him safe.

176
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:16,950
Isn't his responsibility as a Demon God to protect the clan?

177
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:21,890
But he took back the Purple Moon for a private affair

178
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,590
and put us in such a terrible situation.

179
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,210
We served him as our god.

180
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,300
But what are we to him?

181
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,629
He treated us like we were animals!

182
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,110
Listen. You'd better move away.

183
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,450
Your Highness,

184
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,289
be cautious with your words.

185
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,789
Be cautious with my words.

186
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,428
My father is lying dead in the hall.

187
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:05,709
That's what he was rewarded for his loyalty of 60,000 years.

188
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,989
You asked me to be careful of my words?

189
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:14,969
I'm his son. I swear I'll never become an immortal unless I avenge my father.

190
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,210
Demon Emperor died?

191
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,929
But without demon power, he would turn into a human at most.

192
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:21,329
How come he's dead?

193
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:25,389
If Demon God can't bring him back to life,

194
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:28,550
then he must pay for it in blood.

195
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,128
Sen Yu, I know you're angry about what happened to Demon Emperor.

196
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:35,570
But we mustn't jump to conclusions.

197
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,420
Listen! Now Master is back

198
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,650
and he'll try every way to recover your power!

199
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,329
And for the sake of Demon Emperor, I'll just let you go.

200
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:48,209
Now leave.

201
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:51,549
Today, we can say that nothing happened.

202
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,810
Don't trust him, Your Highness!

203
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,030
Demon God doesn't care about our survival.

204
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,109
Purple Moon is right there inside Demon God!

205
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,109
Kill Demon God and take back Purple Moon!

206
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,810
Shut up!

207
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,309
Xiaoli!

208
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:11,130
Xiaoli. Xiaoli!

209
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,089
Demons!

210
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:17,710
Kill Demon God and take back the Purple Moon!

211
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,169
Hou Chi. Hou Chi.

212
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:39,370
Look.

213
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,710
It's a boy.

214
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,160
See how cute he is! So tiny.

215
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,140
He resembles his dad.

216
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,650
Hou Chi,

217
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,010
give him a name.

218
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,680
His dad has already gone,

219
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,900
and so will I.

220
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,409
Just call him... Qi. 
  (Means "abandoned") 

221
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,230
Qi.

222
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,969
Qi...

223
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,908
Little one, we share the same name.

224
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:27,809
We'll call you Yuan Qi.

225
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,209
Good name.

226
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:32,769
He's going to do great things.

227
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:43,730
Yuan Qi, your mom doesn't have proper gifts for you.

228
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:50,329
But there are some toys bought by your grandpa when I was little.

229
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:52,268
They are for boys.

230
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:57,670
Now you'll have them and I think you'll like them.

231
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,060
Your grandpa had a good eye

232
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,690
and you'll like the toys he chose.

233
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:09,529
Hou Chi...

234
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:17,360
If he should ask about his parents,

235
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,370
please tell him that

236
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,509
his dad is the Lord of the North Sea, Qing Mu,

237
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,370
a hero who fights against violence and protects the weak,

238
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,248
and a man who devotes his life to his loved ones and justice.

239
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:35,360
And tell him his mom lived a happy, carefree life

240
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,860
with good friends around,

241
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:45,050
being loved by her husband and father.

242
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,569
Hou Chi, you need to take a break.

243
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:50,129
You'll be fine.

244
00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:52,210
Just rest.

245
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,050
Tell him all these by yourself when he grows up.

246
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:05,349
Hou Chi...

247
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:15,149
No need to console me.

248
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:21,030
True God Shang Gu has sacrificed her life to guard the three realms.

249
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:26,289
Now, I'll return the favor on behalf of the realms.

250
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:30,430
If Master God Shang Gu wakes up and can still remember me,

251
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,730
and my love story with Qing Mu

252
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:39,000
as a happy couple in this world...

253
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:45,910
Please tell her, I do have my complaints,

254
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:51,630
but I still feel lucky that she'll wake up from my body.

255
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:57,589
I haven't achieved much with my life,

256
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,469
but I get to make a great contribution before it ends.

257
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,930
I guess I lived up to the name of Upper God,

258
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,730
which was earned by my father.

259
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:15,829
Please don't feel sorry for me.

260
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:24,850
Actually, it's such a relief for me.

261
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:30,229
After Qing Mu left, I wanted to accompany him for a long time.

262
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,000
Tell me. What does the world look like for me

263
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,350
when my god consciousness is gone?

264
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:48,069
I believe I'll meet Qing Mu again, right?

265
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:55,149
I will definitely see Qing Mu again...

266
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,119
- Hou Chi. 
 - Hou Chi.

267
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:08,825
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

268
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,349
Don't forget I'm a god.

269
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:17,229
You are not my opponents.

270
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,089
I won't hurt you, because we're all demons.

271
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:25,769
How can you, a god, bear to see us sinking into such a situation?

272
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:30,989
Your Highness, God Zi Han only has blind loyalty.

273
00:24:30,989 --> 00:24:32,829
Since when has he ever shown compassion?

274
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:35,668
You cunning fox! All you want is trouble!

275
00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:38,669
Do you want me to unveil who you really are?

276
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:46,268
It's unclear what caused the death of Demon Emperor.

277
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:50,089
I'll go and check you carefully after I deal with this.

278
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:56,409
Calm down, everyone. Don't panic.

279
00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:00,908
Master has promised to return your cultivation long before he took back the Purple Moon.

280
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:04,388
It will be returned to you sooner or later, it will just take some time.

281
00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:07,629
- Some time?  How long will that be? 
  - How long? 

282
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:10,129
 You must be clear! 

283
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:13,428
100 years!

284
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,929
It'll only take 100 years.

285
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:17,770
I, Zi Han, am willing to use my core power as a guarantee.

286
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,430
Only 100 years.

287
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,010
Do you mean that?

288
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,690
Come back to me 100 years later,

289
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,770
if you don't have your demon power back by then,

290
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,689
I'll let myself be taken, without a fight.

291
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:34,688
- How about my father? His cultivation for tens of thousands of years... 
 - You wish!

292
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:44,470
You'll all die today, no need to wait for 100 years.

293
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:46,709
Why are you here again?

294
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:49,009
Aren't you done?

295
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:55,650
How can an immortal be so brazen in the land of the Demon Clan?

296
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,450
Do you think we can't fight you?

297
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,690
God Slayer Flower... Why do you have a weapon of the devils?

298
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:08,348
It's toxic! Protect yourself.

299
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:22,609
Feng Ran, now you need to take Hou Chi and Yuan Qi to Qingchi Palace

300
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:25,530
and start the Guarding Array left by Gu Jun.

301
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,908
Don't remove it no matter what happens.

302
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:31,300
Bear it in mind.

303
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,128
Why should we go to Qingchi Palace?

304
00:26:33,128 --> 00:26:35,710
Isn't this the safest place?

305
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,510
I'm afraid it no longer is.

306
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,569
When she wakes up, she'll no longer be Hou Chi.

307
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:47,569
She'll be Shang Gu.

308
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:54,250
Will you treat her and protect her just the same?

309
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:58,050
She can be Shang Gu or Hou Chi,

310
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,009
for me, she hasn't changed.

311
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,310
Master.

312
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:27,150
Master, where are you going?

313
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,049
Jing Yang, you despicable villain! Taking advantage of the weak.

314
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:38,229
Shame on you!

315
00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:40,820
Your Highness, please don't provoke him.

316
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,970
Xiaoli!

317
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,780
- How are you feeling? 
 - Your Highness...

318
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,810
I won't let you die.

319
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,989
Ignorant of the times.

320
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,670
I'll send you all away on the road together!

321
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,150
I know what to do.

322
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,909
No, Your Highness.

323
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:42,189
Xiaoli. Xiaoli.

324
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,029
Watch out!

325
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,150
If anyone should fail the Demon Clan,

326
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,820
it'd still be me and no one else!

327
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:17,209
Demon God.

328
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:19,360
You should've foreseen this for your clan

329
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,100
when you made a scene at the Blue Dome of Heaven.

330
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,430
Your demon power is too weak to match your title as a Demon God.

331
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,490
Thanks to my Mother God for allowing me to take out this weapon!

332
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,589
It seems you were nothing more than a waste.

333
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:54,830
Bai Jue?

334
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,630
I thought you were in a coma.

335
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,900
Brother, don't be rude in front of Master.

336
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,829
How dare you use a weapon of the devils?

337
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,790
Tie yourself up and go see your father for punishment.

338
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:19,450
Where's the criminal, Hou Chi?

339
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:24,268
She's under my protection.

340
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:25,809
Stay out of it.

341
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:27,989
Then protect her for your whole life.

342
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:31,924
Even if she had ten lives,

343
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:34,450
it won't suffice to atone for her crime of seriously injuring a True God.

344
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:48,630
Zi Han.

345
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,510
Zi Han.

346
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,469
I...

347
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:09,288
Master, I was seriously poisoned.

348
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:11,068
I'll die soon.

349
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,349
Nonsense!

350
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:14,710
My power can reach Heaven and Earth.

351
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,929
How can I not be able to save you?

352
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:20,090
Right.

353
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:24,110
Master, you're such a capable man.

354
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:29,830
But, Master, now the Purple Moon is gone

355
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,430
and Sen Jian's dead,

356
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,640
who will...

357
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,640
protect you after I die?

358
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:51,550
Master, I just made a decision for you,

359
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:56,769
to restore the power of the Demon Clan in 100 years.

360
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:00,529
Please keep our word.

361
00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:04,550
I don't want them to dig my grave to get to me.

362
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,869
I don't want them to give you a bad name.

363
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:11,269
Okay.

364
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,830
Lord Zi Han, I promise

365
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:20,500
I'll always bear in mind what you said.

366
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,089
I used to take orders from you.

367
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:29,990
Finally, I got you to do what I wish.

368
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:40,388
Master, you're the one that I envy the most in my whole life.

369
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:46,689
You live a carefree life, doing things that you feel like doing.

370
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,269
Yue Mi left, and now you're also gone.

371
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:59,909
Zi Han,

372
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,970
I promise you...

373
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:09,590
from now on I won't act willfully.

374
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:12,990
I promise you.

375
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:52,808
Lordess Feng Ran, where are you going with Hou Chi?

376
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:58,028
Feng Nv, things have changed and now Hou Chi has woken up as Chief God Shang Gu.

377
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:01,608
If you dare do anything bad, you're guilty of offending a Chief God. That's forbidden!

378
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:03,049
So what?

379
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:05,080
The God Realm is gone,

380
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,140
and the Immortal Clan is about to eliminate the demons.

381
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:10,049
Now, the realms follow the words of Master Bai Jue and the Heavenly Palace.

382
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:14,269
She's nobody unless Master Bai Jue speaks for her.

383
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:16,789
Guards! Take them!

384
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,389
Get out of here!

385
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,470
Why are you here?

386
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:32,388
Don't get me wrong. It was Master Bai Jue. He sent this old dragon to save you.

387
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:34,690
Bai Jue sent you to save us?

388
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,769
What does that mean?

389
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:39,090
Bash us one day and help us the next?

390
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,309
I have no idea what's going on between you.

391
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:48,009
The only thing you need to know is that this old dragon is now in allegiance with Master Bai Jue.

392
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:51,689
You're such a rotten, disgusting person!

393
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:57,108
It wasn't my intention to mess with Qingchi Palace.

394
00:34:57,109 --> 00:34:59,309
It was Wu Huan, the evil woman, who incited me!

395
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,588
Please forgive me, Lordess Feng Ran.

396
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:03,749
Don't be mad at me. I'm nobody.

397
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,108
Kick down the ladder once you take the advantage?

398
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:09,170
You're really a sneaky, nasty person without a life principle.

399
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,969
Follow whoever has the strongest power.

400
00:35:10,969 --> 00:35:14,389
That's this old dragon's principle!

401
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:18,929
No need. I'll do it myself.

402
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,130
Master.

403
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:36,549
Mu Guang, from now on the Demon Clan are subjects of the Blue Dome of Heaven.

404
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:40,489
You should assist Sen Yu to help the demons recover their power within 100 years.

405
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:41,690
Do you have any objections?

406
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,309
The demons are also creatures of the realms.

407
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,509
I'll listen to you, Master.

408
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,729
But I'm not aware of the mistake that Jing Yang has made.

409
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:53,069
Why did you ask him to be on his knees here?

410
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:57,709
He used God Slayer Flowers and tried to massacre the Demon Clan.

411
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,389
Shouldn't I punish him?

412
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:01,588
You wretch!

413
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:03,289
Where did you get the flower?

414
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:05,689
I was wondering, too.

415
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,920
 Her Highness wanted me to give you this. 

416
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:29,229
 Your Highness, inside it are God Slayer Flowers. 

417
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,149
 It's highly toxic and can kill a god. 

418
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:34,769
 Mother God is too cautious. 

419
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:38,789
 Why is it necessary? We have Master Bai Jue here. 

420
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,289
 I have no idea. 

421
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:43,229
 Her Highness warned you that 

422
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,610
 this can only be used as a last measure. 

423
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:07,529
Father God.

424
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:09,009
Not me!

425
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:11,449
It... It was Mother God!

426
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,908
Master, my son has a bad, naughty nature.

427
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:21,388
While waiting for his Mother God to leave the Netherworld, he must have accidentally taken the flower to play with.

428
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:23,130
It was a huge mistake!

429
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,949
It's my fault! I didn't teach him to behave himself.

430
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,828
Please spare his life.

431
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,868
 Please spare his life, Master! 

432
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:33,470
Is that so?

433
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:37,030
Jing Yang's power is only that of an Upper Immortal.

434
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,868
How did he manage to control the flower?

435
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:41,370
Master!

436
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:46,070
My brother has guarded the immortal border for years.

437
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,270
Please forgive him!

438
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,588
I can spare his life, but he can't escape from punishment.

439
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:55,330
Absolutely.

440
00:37:55,330 --> 00:38:00,050
Let the Sky Thunder strike him twenty times and he shall be grounded for 100 years.

441
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,610
Bastard!

442
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,249
Thank Master for his mercy!

443
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:08,230
Thank you, Master!

444
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:16,169
Only when there is a ceasefire between the two clans can there be peace.

445
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,340
In the future, whoever dares to disrupt the peace,

446
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,000
I will not forgive him lightly.

447
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,890
 We'll bear it in mind, Master. 

448
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,610
How long will she be sleeping like this?

449
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,209
I don't know.

450
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:50,849
Perhaps one month or a hundred years.

451
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:55,210
It all depends on herself.

452
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:59,650
Chang Que, is there some medicine that can help to wake her up?

453
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:05,170
60,000 years are not very long.

454
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,209
We can still wait.

455
00:39:07,209 --> 00:39:10,809
Demon God, what is Bai Jue thinking of?

456
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:15,008
He was so ruthless to Hou Chi when at the Blue Dome of Heaven.

457
00:39:15,008 --> 00:39:17,750
But today he helped us.

458
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,710
Maybe he did that for Shang Gu.

459
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:30,069
Today, thank you for not revealing the fact that my power was damaged.

460
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:33,469
I'll need to thank you, too, for sparing my brother.

461
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,348
You probably hate me.

462
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:38,270
I dare not.

463
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,069
But I do have a question for you.

464
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,329
Say it.

465
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:46,329
You obviously don't like me, but you promised me to fulfill the marriage contract.

466
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:51,750
Did you do it to make Hou Chi forget about you, or for the sake of Master Shang Gu?

467
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,749
You do know I don't like you.

468
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:55,890
Then, why do you stay here?

469
00:39:57,189 --> 00:40:01,629
I've given up my hope for love for the rest of my life.

470
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:04,929
But maybe I can gradually get close to an honorable life.

471
00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:07,930
Living in the Blue Dome of Heaven is the best choice for me.

472
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,120
At least, in others' eyes,

473
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,560
I'm still the closest person to you.

474
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:18,828
So straightforward, you are more sincere than you were before.

475
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:22,990
I lost all my face at our wedding today.

476
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,850
Now I beg for your mercy.

477
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,628
Please don't have me driven out of the Blue Dome of Heaven.

478
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:30,930
Those who cross the river and demolish the bridge are disdainful.

479
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,909
Keep your nose clean and you shall get the honor you want.

480
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:46,940


481
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:59,689
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

482
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:06,624
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

483
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:13,090
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

484
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:19,250
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

485
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:26,050
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

486
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:32,649
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow♫ 

487
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:39,924
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

488
00:41:39,925 --> 00:41:45,625
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

489
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:03,769
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

490
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:10,249
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

491
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:17,329
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

492
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:24,530
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

493
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:32,609
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

494
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:39,489
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

495
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:45,874
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

496
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:52,299
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

497
00:42:52,300 --> 00:43:01,900
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
