1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,990


2
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,700
   

3
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,340
   

4
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,550
 At the beginning of the God Realm, 

5
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,819
 Ancestral God created three realms of God, Immortal, and Demon. 

6
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,369
 After teaching the skills of cultivating spiritual power, 

7
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,899
 Ancestral God vanished into the void. 

8
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,369
 The God Realm is the superior of all. 

9
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,870
 Four True Gods command the God Realm and all gods. 

10
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,500
   

11
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,660
Look!

12
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,279
Yue Mi, Viburnum Blossom Feast comes every year.

13
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,510
What's the fun in that?

14
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,989
Here at Pu Hua's marriage temple,

15
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:21,499
a matchmaking event is held every 1,000 years.

16
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:22,619
All living creatures of the three realms

17
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:24,699
want to take this chance to find their partners.

18
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,930
That's the fun part.

19
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,339
Here you are.

20
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,810
What for?

21
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,829
- Look at them.  
  - It's so lively! 

22
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,990
 I love this place. 

23
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,369
No need to cover my face.

24
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,159
The reason I'm here 
    

25
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,339
is to appreciate the scene of the Lower Realm.

26
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:41,860
Said someone who bagged me

27
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,879
    
 to cover you for your travel.

28
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,259
You promised to behave.

29
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:47,680
It totally slipped your mind, right?

30
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,360
Fine, I'll do it. I'll cover my face.

31
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,310
Your portrait hangs at the center of the Temple of Gods.

32
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,670
What if some lower Immortal recognizes you and tells Zhi Yang about it,

33
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,259
we'd be punished for sure.

34
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,979
Yue Mi, calm down. Okay?

35
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,970
Whatever blame it is, I will take it.

36
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,530
How could Pu Hua the geezer do that?

37
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,169
He keeps drinking in the God Realm,

38
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:20,849
leaving all the lonely creatures unattended.

39
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,339
Now the world is at peace.

40
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,750
Instead of cultivating their power,

41
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,649
the demons are pursuing marriage.

42
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,519
That's boring and superficial.

43
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,459
Goddess of the Stars and the Moon.

44
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,720
Now that you're bored, shall we go somewhere else?

45
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,100
- Come on. 
 - Hold on!

46
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,360
We took a long journey.

47
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,720
Are you hiding something?

48
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,080
Stop guessing blindly.

49
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,470
I wondered it on our way here.

50
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,649
Of all the places, why the marriage temple?

51
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,089
Looks like you're stuck on someone.

52
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,900
Give it back!

53
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,929
Say it!  Who has the privilege?

54
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,620
That's a secret.

55
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,889
If you have a target,

56
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:55,520
why not ask Pu Hua yourself?

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,489
I can ask him for you if the cat got your tongue.

58
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,220
You know nothing.

59
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,000
I would like to find a partner

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,640
to kill the time in our extended life.

61
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,020
But over the past 10,000 years,

62
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,410
not a single god goes after me.

63
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,800
As the saying in story scripts go,

64
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,950
for the right man, love lasts for 10,000 years after a glance.

65
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,089
But to gods like us, 10,000 years is just like a blink.

66
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,729
It's not a big deal for us.

67
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,249
Once you feel a chemical reaction,

68
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,610
you wouldn't act so indifferent.

69
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,190
Feel a chemical reaction?

70
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,320
I just learned the "skill".

71
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,080
I can help them out.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,409
I saw her here first!

73
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,100
You!

74
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

75
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,009
Let go!

76
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,180
Punk!

77
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,059
Don't touch me!

78
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,800
That's inappropriate!

79
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,440
Why...

80
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,280
Pu Hua taught me the skill himself.

81
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,530
Why did this happen?

82
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,110
With that little spiritual power,

83
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,520
you must have gotten it wrong!

84
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,449
 Get off me! 

85
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:10,009
 What do you want? 

86
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,760
 Go away! 

87
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,890
Think of something.  Zhi Yang will find out soon.

88
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,659
- Miss! 
 - Miss!

89
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,160
Miss, you're gorgeous.

90
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,449
Do you like me?

91
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,400
Wait for me.  Miss!

92
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,219
 Shang Gu! 

93
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,050
Where is she?

94
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,179
- What? 
 - Where did she go?

95
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:27,910
Miss!

96
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,160
At the dawn of the world,

97
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,330
- Ancestral God founded the God Realm. 
  - Ancestral God founded the God Realm. 

98
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:57,390
- Using the Power of Chaos, he created all creatures. 
   - Using the Power of Chaos, he created all creatures. 

99
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,100
- All creatures fell to the Lower Realm. 
  - All creatures fell to the Lower Realm. 

100
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,470
- 100,000 years later, the Heavenly Realm appeared. 
  - 100,000 years later, the Heavenly Realm appeared. 

101
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,980
Master Bai Jue.

102
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,160
   

103
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,830
What did I tell you on your first day learning here?

104
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,160
A devoted student must not be late.

105
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,820
Gods and Immortals may act as they like,

106
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,350
but they shall not violate the rules.

107
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,790
Master, we didn't mean to be late.

108
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,040
There's a woman rushing boldly into the galaxy.

109
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,000
You should regret your errors, not blame others.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,730
Immortals mustn't do this.

111
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,040
Now you know you're late,

112
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,969
why not use the Flying Sword spell I taught three months ago?

113
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:39,930
Why is that?

114
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,450
Sorry, my skill got rusty.

115
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,000
Why didn't you practice?

116
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,490
Come.

117
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,809
Are you scared?

118
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,580
Yes, I am.

119
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,410
Keep practicing and you will overcome the fear.

120
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,529
Yes, Master.

121
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,310
Go back to repent.

122
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,740
Stop bluffing, just show yourself.

123
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,389
I thought that teaching kids would turn you into a nice person.

124
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:51,530
10,000 years later, you're still bad-tempered. 
    

125
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,110
Hurry.

126
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,819
What could you expect from a gourd cut open?

127
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,080
A real god should live freely,

128
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,529
just like the way I do.

129
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,900
Today, I will teach you a lesson.

130
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,850
Watch and learn.

131
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,169
Stop laughing!

132
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,880
I'm only thirsty.

133
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,149
Bai Jue.

134
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,490
Continue the fight once I finish the drink.

135
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,470
Master Tian Qi, I think people fight by hand, not by bragging.

136
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,129
 Exactly! 

137
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,830
 All talk. 

138
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,169
You're talkative for a fire beast.

139
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:43,439
I'm a Qilin! Not some fire beasts.

140
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:46,670
All right, warm the wine for me.

141
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,599
Look, Master! He's so disrespectful. How could he do that?

142
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:49,909
Take the day off.

143
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:52,419
Hong Ri, take them back to rest.

144
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,900
Yes, Master.

145
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,900
Ice cube.

146
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,929
Those hairs are from a nine-tailed fox!

147
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:22,469
That fierce animal existed since the foundation of the Heavenly Realm. Did you hunt it?

148
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:24,910
Just some exercises for my leisure time.

149
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,380
All you think about is Zhi Yang.

150
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,640
The wine is for you. Help yourself.

151
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,399
I knew it. I knew you hadn't forgotten us all these years.

152
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,700
If you are here to check on me, you may leave.

153
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,350
No way.

154
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,330
I'm here to take you back.

155
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,000
I've sent uncountable instruction feathers to you.

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,620
But you hardly reply.

157
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,339
Shang Gu's 10,000th birthday is next month.

158
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:55,229
The last time you saw her was at Universe Pavilion when she was born.

159
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:59,109
We are the only Four True Gods born by the universe.

160
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:01,130
You have no excuse to be absent this time.

161
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,150
In terms of her extended life, she's only a teenager.

162
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,560
We will meet at last.

163
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,910
We can wait for another 10,000 years.

164
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,730
That's not up to you.

165
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,339
   

166
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:12,930
Zhi Yang gave the order.

167
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,929
He asks you to return to celebrate Chief God of Chaos's birthday.

168
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,109
All in all, Shang Gu will be the Chief God of Chaos in the future.

169
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:27,459
Once those old-timers find out you're absent,

170
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,489
they'd punish you for being disrespectful.

171
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,300
Besides, Shang Gu is...

172
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,250
I'm not finished!

173
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,670
Listen up!

174
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,210
Don't you collude with her to cheat me again.

175
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,959
Or I will cast you away from the God Realm.

176
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,710
Yes, Master Zhi Yang.

177
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,910
Zhi Yang is annoyed for sure this time.

178
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,339
You were struck by three strikes of Sky Thunder for falsely replying to the memorial. Remember?

179
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:03,339
Of course! It took me a month to recover!

180
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,570
I'm afraid it will take two months this time.

181
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,980
Don't worry.

182
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,459
Do you have a plan?

183
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,910
I'm afraid not.

184
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,439
But I could find some story scripts for you in the Lower Realm.

185
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:17,350
I'm sure they will amuse you while you recover.

186
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,690
Stop making fun of me.

187
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,689
I'm not afraid of Zhi Yang, all right?

188
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:29,060
It's about losing face.

189
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,529
As a return for you accompanying me to the marriage temple,

190
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,880
I'll take Holy Thunder for you.

191
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,179
No need for that. I'll meet my own debts.

192
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Maybe I should run away and hide.

193
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,619
When Zhi Yang calms down,

194
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:50,709
he'd spare me half the punishment at least.

195
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,220
Come on.

196
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,169
Nearly the entire God Realm is looking for you.

197
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,339
Where could you go?

198
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,970
How about the deserted hall?

199
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,949
Abyss Hall?

200
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:01,659
It belongs to Bai Jue!

201
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,270
He's hard to deal with. I won't recommend it.

202
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,210
He's been wandering in the Lower Realm for 10,000 years.

203
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,699
I don't think he'll be back soon. It's left unmanned.

204
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,860
Bless us, Ancestral God. Don't send Bai Jue back now.

205
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,939
Zhi Yang.

206
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:26,080
Have you found Shang Gu?

207
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,950
Bai Jue!

208
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,070
It's been a long time. You look great. 
    

209
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,439
No need to lick his boots.

210
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:44,169
He's been cultivating over the past years.

211
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:47,549
He asked for a fight the moment we met. Aggressive as always.

212
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,780
Birthday present for the Chief God of Chaos.

213
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,370
Let me see.

214
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,709
A peach?

215
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,319
Did you grow it yourself?

216
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,780
There's a peach forest on Observation Mountain.

217
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,160
You picked it up randomly!

218
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,080
What's the difference?

219
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,519
Got some tasks to do, bye.

220
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,080
Bai Jue.

221
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,110
I know you don't like parties.

222
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,689
The reason I asked you back is more than celebrating Shang Gu's birthday.

223
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,019
It's not for Shang Gu?

224
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:25,969
Then, why did you give the order?

225
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:29,139
Since Shang Gu was born

226
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:31,969
with blocked sacred meridians, she has little spiritual power.

227
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:34,579
As the Chief God of Chaos, she can't handle the Power of Chaos.

228
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:38,369
I want you to stay in the God Realm and teach Shang Gu yourself.

229
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:40,799
How is that possible?

230
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,039
Stubborn as Bai Jue is, Shang Gu cannot stand him!

231
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,449
Besides, Shang Gu grew up under my watch.

232
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:48,160
If she needs a teacher, it ought to be me.

233
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,739
Although Tian Qi is mischievous,

234
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,100
I think he can handle a child who's only 10,000 years old.

235
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,880
Bai Jue has the point!

236
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,209
Bai Jue! If Shang Gu turns to be as eccentric as Tian Qi,

237
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,049
the God Realm would be endangered before the devils attack.

238
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:09,099
Endangered? How is that so?

239
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,099
I'm only teaching her! How could we destroy the realm?

240
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,980
Shut up!

241
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,049
Bai Jue, of the three of us,

242
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:21,049
you're the only one who can open up the ancient sacred meridian.

243
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,999
- Not interested. 
 - I am!

244
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:25,230
Shut your mouth!

245
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,910
Bai Jue.

246
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,289
Fine. You will know this sooner or later.

247
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,980
Come with me.

248
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,400
The barrier of the Nether World is cracked! When?

249
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,839
The Power of Chaos has been dispersing since last month.

250
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,159
Do you know that Ancestral God uses the Power of Chaos to create the barrier.

251
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,109
Now the power is weakening.

252
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:07,590
The barrier will soon split up.

253
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,519
Once that happens, it will be a disaster.

254
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,129
Maybe the ancient sacred meridian is meant to be blocked.

255
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,520
Even if you don't care about the devils,

256
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
don't you remember the Doom of Chaos?

257
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,339
It will strike in 1,000 years.

258
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,539
Only Chief God of Chaos can fight against it.

259
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,760
But we don't even know what the Doom of Chaos is!

260
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,150
She's only a teenager. How can she handle it?

261
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,710
That's why I asked you back. To teach her.

262
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,030
It's a matter of the God Realm. Do it for the late Ancestral God.

263
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,860
When the day comes,

264
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,130
I will dedicate my life to stopping it.

265
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,029
Doom for the God Realm is approaching.

266
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:47,999
It reminds me of our teenage time.

267
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:52,839
Tian Qi, do you remember it when Ancestral God took us to the war?

268
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,880
In the flesh! Bai Jue even...

269
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,829
Zhi Yang, we are not young anymore.

270
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:04,649
We shouldn't bring those stories up.

271
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,629
If priests of the Lower Realm heard it, the three realms would make fun of him.

272
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:09,219
That would be embarrassing.

273
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:11,429
You took a vow.

274
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:13,259
My bad. I shouldn't do it.

275
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:14,769
It's my fault.

276
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,330
We didn't mean it. Forget about it.

277
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,929
What are Shang Gu's characteristics?

278
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,650
Shang Gu?

279
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,789
Shang Gu is obedient, diligent, and studious. She has the talent.

280
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,790
And she never causes trouble.

281
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,619
If it wasn't that her meridians were blocked,

282
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,459
she'd wield the instruction feather of Chief God.

283
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,269
- For real? 
 - Sure.

284
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:38,859
I've spent the last 10,000 years in peace.

285
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:42,039
Okay. I can assure you that no one will disturb you at Abyss Hall,

286
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,499
especially the goddesses.

287
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,989
I can't do much for her.

288
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:47,740
It all depends on her.

289
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,850
It's a deal.

290
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,040
Do not go back on your word.

291
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,839
Why didn't you tell him about the naughty girl?

292
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,980
You shouldn't have laughed!

293
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,409
Making trouble.

294
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:02,950
You've spoiled Shang Gu.

295
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,670
Did I laugh?

296
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,209
 Look at you, Shang Gu. Good intentions always end up with bad outcomes. 

297
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,919
 Trying to share Zhi Yang's workload, 

298
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,090
 but I responded to the memorial in the wrong way. 

299
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,499
 Trying to make matches, but I cast the wrong skill. 

300
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,560
 Are you stupid or something? 

301
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,810
 Isn't that the Goddess of Snow? 

302
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,320
 What's she doing here in Abyss Hall? 

303
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,459
Grow up nicely.

304
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,499
When Master Bai Jue comes back, 
    

305
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,670
he'd be delighted to see you.

306
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,070
 Bai Jue has been away for 10,000 years. 

307
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,459
 She's still here watching over them. 

308
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,499
 This affection is really touching. 

309
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,290
Who's here?

310
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,980
Master Bai Jue.

311
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,860
Greetings, Master Bai Jue. I'm Xue Ying.

312
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,930
 That's Bai Jue. 

313
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:39,639
It's been 10,000 years. You still look the same.

314
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:41,830
Why are you here?

315
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,979
Master Bai Jue, I know you like the Zanghai flower.

316
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,849
I've been looking after them every day while you were away.

317
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:53,149
I make sure the scene here looks the same as the day you left.

318
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,049
Master Bai Jue...

319
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:04,949
I gave out the order that no one is allowed here at Abyss Hall unless I summoned them.

320
00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:07,799
Goddess of Snow, you violated the rules. Take your punishment.

321
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,320
 That's so cruel! 

322
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,620
Does it hurt?

323
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,590
Not at all!

324
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,949
I should raise the tree higher.

325
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:28,309
I should teach the spy a lesson.

326
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:29,989
Me? A spy?

327
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:32,640
I don't care about who you are. Leave now.

328
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,049
You, too.

329
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,619
Hold on. Goddess of Snow devoted so much effort to the flowers.

330
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:40,040
How could you do that?

331
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,790
Why are you so inhumane?

332
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,060
- I am a god. Why should I be humane? 
 - You!

333
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,209
This hall belongs to me. I can burn it as much as I like.

334
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:50,150
It's not your business.

335
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,990
Everything in the God Realm is within Shang Gu's responsibility.

336
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,029
Shang Gu?

337
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:58,289
Your Royal Highness.

338
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,789
Don't worry. I will see justice done for you.

339
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:03,870
I will banish this heartless man to the Lower Realm.

340
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,519
What? You? Chief God?

341
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,870
That's me!

342
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,949
 Let go! What do you want? 

343
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:14,799
 - Get off me! 
 -  Punk! Why are you so rude? 

344
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,890
 What's going on? 

345
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,970
I'm afraid you're the one who should be banished.

346
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,260
I was helping them with their marriages.

347
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,279
It was just an accident.

348
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,960
Abusing spiritual power, violating the rules.

349
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,689
You're much worse than talentless.

350
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:31,459
You are irresponsible.

351
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,259
You're no better than me!

352
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,929
You may look handsome from the outside.

353
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,739
But on the inside, you're so heartless.

354
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,999
What did Goddess of Snow do wrong? You don't deserve her!

355
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:43,269
If you ask me, it's better for you to stay outside the God Realm.

356
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,869
I don't want to see you at all.

357
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:48,890
Your presence is staining this realm.

358
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,619
What do you want? I'm Chief God of Chaos-to-be!

359
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,309
Did Tian Qi raise you?

360
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:57,919
So what?

361
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,410
Learned nothing but his shortcomings.

362
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,519
Let me go! What do you want?

363
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,770
Release me!

364
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,829
Today, you skipped the Viburnum Blossom Feast and made a mess.

365
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,970
You should be punished with ten claps of thunder.

366
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,159
How dare you! Let me go!

367
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,650
Zhi Yang tricked me into teaching you.

368
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,040
He lied to me, saying you were obedient, diligent, and studious.

369
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,020
I hope that you won't fail him.

370
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,739
Notify Zhi Yang that I have punished you for him. Don't thank me.

371
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,499
You, Bai Jue! Just you wait!

372
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,890
You'll see who's in charge of the God Realm!

373
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,879
I have no idea why goddesses like Bai Jue at all!

374
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:43,409
For his stern look?

375
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:44,640
Or his lecture?

376
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,430
Or how he punishes others with thunder?

377
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,549
I feel so sorry for Goddess of Snow! What a waste!

378
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:53,939
The story scripts say love starts from nowhere and lasts long.

379
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,449
If I had a crush on such a bastard, I'd be scared to death!

380
00:22:57,449 --> 00:23:00,040
Exactly! Bai Jue is like an ice cube.

381
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,259
How could he match the lovable Tian Qi?

382
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,260
Don't mention him or Zhi Yang!

383
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,730
We share the same father, Ancestral God. We were all born by the universe.

384
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,979
Why am I a loser? They all have great power.

385
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:12,050
Could I have been adopted by Ancestral God?

386
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,470
Poor girl. A lower god born to be a chief god.

387
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,270
They all look down upon you.

388
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,809
Yue Mi, you're the best.

389
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:24,440
You can't stand it when I suffer, right?

390
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,710
Put off your show.

391
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,549
Spit it out. What else do you want me to do?

392
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:37,049
Help me demolish Abyss Hall.

393
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,790
- I'm up to something suddenly. 
 - Yue Mi!

394
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,500
My naughty girl.

395
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,099
That's Bai Jue!

396
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,809
A true god with the greatest cultivation.

397
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,900
My power is less than a tenth of this!

398
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,589
But he's driving me mad! You can't watch me suffer.

399
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:50,889
How about going after Zhi Yang?

400
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,020
Maybe he knows what to do.

401
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,159
What's going on?

402
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,180
I was reviewing the memorials.

403
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,879
You asked me here urgently. What's the hurry?

404
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:06,769
Look at her. She's pissed off. She hasn't had anything today.

405
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:08,329
She even talked about death.

406
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:09,760
Whoever it is, it's a powerful god.

407
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,279
Who else could it be?

408
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,650
The one you summoned back.

409
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,730
Dear girl,

410
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,979
why are you going on a hunger strike?

411
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:27,550
- Yue Mi, go fetch the jadelike libation. 
 - Sure.

412
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,019
No need for that. I don't want it.

413
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:32,280
I'm fine.

414
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,240
I'm okay.

415
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,260
Who did it to you? Tell me about it. I'll do you justice.

416
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,870
It's all about Bai Jue! He is the one at fault.

417
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:44,899
All I did was criticize him. Guess what?

418
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:49,649
He threw me out from Abyss Hall in front of Xue Ying!

419
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:52,590
You should cast him away from the God Realm.

420
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,999
If not, I'd starve to death.

421
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,460
Bai Jue?

422
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,860
Are you loathe to it?

423
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,280
It's not like that.

424
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:03,590
Actually, this is quite tricky.

425
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,859
Tricky?

426
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,649
How hard could that be? No one dares to disobey you.

427
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:11,460
Wait, are you on his side?

428
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,969
Dear, you know I'm on your side. Right?

429
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,210
Shang Gu, I do want to help you.

430
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,649
But Ice Cube Bai is a true god, too.

431
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,409
We're on equal footing.

432
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,590
To make it worse, I cannot beat him at fighting.

433
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,100
Unless the God Realm is gone, I couldn't cast him away.

434
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,609
Well... isn't there any other way?

435
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,619
There is a way.

436
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,809
What is it?

437
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,629
Shang Gu, you can make it to Upper God.

438
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:51,149
Once you possess the Power of Chaos, wield the instruction feather of Chief God.

439
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,769
Once you become Chief God of Chaos,

440
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,599
you can do whatever you want to him.

441
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:57,700
That's a good idea.

442
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,019
Zhi Yang, it sounds good.

443
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,869
But will it take a long time?

444
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:06,879
It's not that hard!

445
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:09,529
Learn everything from Ice Cube Bai.

446
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,729
Once you're ready, the three of us will fight together and cast him away.

447
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:14,999
That's right!

448
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:18,589
Once you graduate, no one can bully you!

449
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:20,240
How's that possible?

450
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,859
Who am I? I'm the Chief God of Chaos.

451
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,550
I'd lose face if I call him "teacher"!

452
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,360
Shang Gu.

453
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,019
Forget about it.

454
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,639
Bai Jue is going too far this time.

455
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,309
I'll go to Abyss Hall with you. Let's fight with him.

456
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:41,999
It's okay if we lose.

457
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:43,669
We can run away together!

458
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:45,710
We'd rather be humble immortals in the Lower Realm

459
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,159
than having you suffer at Abyss Hall.

460
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:51,339
Humble immortal?

461
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:52,959
How could we do that?

462
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:56,459
Based on Shang Gu's character, she'd be bullied as a humble immortal!

463
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:58,240
Hurry up, pack her stuff.

464
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,729
Send her to Pu Hua Cave. Have her make matches with Pu Hua.

465
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:06,019
Even in the Lower Realm, you'd be a respected immortal.

466
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:07,750
I...

467
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,570
- But... 
 - That's enough.

468
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,489
Now that you've become enemies, I can't see you suffer.

469
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:16,049
- I... 
 - Stop hesitating.

470
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:17,810
You'd live a peaceful life.

471
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,590
Just be a match-making immortal with Pu Hua.

472
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,620
I...

473
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,239
Yue Mi, Pilgrim Hall is like home to me. I'm not going anywhere.

474
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:26,310
It's a deal.

475
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,220
You two must not meet each other again.

476
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,789
And I can't have you suffer.

477
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:33,159
Yue Mi, pack her stuff up and send her to Pu Hua Cave.

478
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:35,990
Hold... Hold on! I'm willing to do it.

479
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,889
To do what?

480
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,379
To learn at Abyss Hall.

481
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,439
With a long life, I'm sure I'll learn everything and kick him out!

482
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:46,790
Okay. Put on your shoes.

483
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,549
Come on, my dear. Just sit down.

484
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,560
You'll catch a cold.

485
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,759
You're acting so bossy.

486
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:21,269
You're here to be his apprentice.

487
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:23,689
It's my first day at school as Chief God of Chaos.

488
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:26,220
We must make it a grand occasion.

489
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,809
Last time, he threw me out from Abyss Hall.

490
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:32,109
This time, I'll have him invite me!

491
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,869
 Master Bai Jue. 

492
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:38,080
Stand up! Don't greet him.

493
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,589
I said, stand up.

494
00:28:39,589 --> 00:28:43,159
Cut it out. You're to take him as your teacher, not to declare war.

495
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:45,820
Hurry up. Go.

496
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,549
Shang Gu of Pilgrim Hall is here to learn from True God Bai Jue.

497
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:01,560
Please take me as your apprentice.

498
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,249
Zhi Yang told me about it. You agreed to teach me.

499
00:29:07,249 --> 00:29:11,349
I believe True God Bei Jue must be a god of his word.

500
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,449
I can teach you on three conditions.

501
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:15,689
What conditions?

502
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,860
Even 30 conditions will be fine!

503
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,840
Take off your jacket.

504
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,549
Yue Mi, did you hear that?

505
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:28,119
He asked me to undress! That's inappropriate!

506
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,399
My girl, just bear with it.

507
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,379
To study in Abyss Hall,

508
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,379
there is no Chief God or Royal Highness.

509
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,649
Get rid of the title "Chief God."

510
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,899
You'll be nobody until you step out of Abyss Hall.

511
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:43,429
During that time, you're only a servant here.

512
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:45,380
Can you do that?

513
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,529
- Bai Jue. Anyway, Shang Gu is... 
 - Take it off.

514
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:51,680
I agree with that.

515
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,019
I haven't possessed the Power of Chaos.

516
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:55,470
I'm not Chief God yet.

517
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,020
Now that I've never obtained it,

518
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,020
I have nothing to lose.

519
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,639
- What are you doing? 
 -  To study in my hall, you must be devoted.

520
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:16,259
Destroy these toys and never touch them again.

521
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,150
Can you do that?

522
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,139
I grew up with them. They are my treasures.

523
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,639
I'll leave them behind. Why must I destroy them?

524
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:27,689
No pain, no gain.

525
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:29,760
If you can't stand losing ordinary things,

526
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,499
you'll never be Chief God.

527
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,770
You'd only be a joke.

528
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,919
You may leave if you are reluctant.

529
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,440
I will not take in absent-minded students.

530
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,750
I will destroy them. I will.

531
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:55,099
Now that you can do it, you may come in.

532
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,220
Are you sure about this?

533
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,859
Bai Jue is right. No pain, no gain.

534
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:05,049
Once I learn all his skills,

535
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,770
the first thing I'll do is tear down his hall.

536
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,530
It's revenge for my treasures!

537
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,460
There is one more condition left.

538
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,499
Bold as you always are.

539
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:22,020
The days ahead will be tough for sure!

540
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,059
Are you sincere about learning from me?

541
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:36,570
Of course! I'm nothing but sincere.

542
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:40,939
 No way! No one likes to see your poker face. 

543
00:31:40,939 --> 00:31:43,289
 Stop acting. 

544
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:48,079
 Once I become Chief of God, I will manipulate you as I want! 

545
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,600
Master, Shang Gu at your service.

546
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,569
 How do you like that? You've earned the respect of Chief God. 

547
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:02,889
 What a privilege for Abyss Hall! 

548
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,690
What a privilege!

549
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,510
You read my mind! Shameless!

550
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,899
Covertly cursing me, telling lies, shouldn't you be ashamed?

551
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:20,199
I might have cursed you. But it did you no harm at all.

552
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,020
If only you can achieve what you just said.

553
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,339
I'll wait here. Wait for you to be Chief God and manipulate me as you wish.

554
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,520
You sealed my spiritual power!

555
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,469
That's the third condition.

556
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:36,259
It's better for you to learn without your little power.

557
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:40,289
Now you're learning from me, you must obey my rules.

558
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:43,260
Come here at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. Don't be late.

559
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,670
What should I do?

560
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,209
Master Bai Just has given the order. You're here as the lowest servant.

561
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:13,910
You'll start with learning the basic etiquette from me.

562
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,649
You're only his Spirit Animal! How dare you command me?

563
00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:21,549
As Master Bai Jue said, you're no longer Chief God here.

564
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:23,709
I used to help around the Abyss Hall.

565
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:25,690
No wonder I'll teach you first.

566
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,529
No wonder you'll learn from me.

567
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,399
You're giving me a hard time!

568
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,970
Where's Bai Jue? I want to meet him!

569
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,819
Master also said that you may leave by yourself if you're discontent.

570
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:42,619
Then you should never bring it up that you used to learn here.

571
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:44,910
Sweeping is my favorite chore.

572
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,849
I'm not used to intimacy.

573
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,959
Please behave, Tian Qi.

574
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:15,849
How did you do that?

575
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:17,900
Do what?

576
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,030
That girl is sweeping for you!

577
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,150
Pay more attention.

578
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:35,479
She's obedient, diligent, studious,

579
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:38,680
she has the talent, and she never causes trouble.

580
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,350
Don't use that against me. It was Zhi Yang who said it.

581
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:48,359
If it wasn't for the future of the God Realm, she would not be qualified to learn here at Abyss Hall.

582
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,849
Bai Jue, Shang Gu is better than that.

583
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:53,540
You two just met.

584
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,519
After some time, you'll see that she's lovely, adorable, and outgoing.

585
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,890
Lovely, adorable, and outgoing.

586
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,460
That's right!

587
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,849
That does not boost her power.

588
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,400
Will that take a great responsibility?

589
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,619
- You! 
 - Sorry! I'm sorry.

590
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:28,069
Here, have some water. I didn't mean it.

591
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:30,720
I didn't mean it. I swear!

592
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,629
Bai Jue, Bai Jue. Keep doing it.

593
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:40,589
Once I master it, I'll expel you from this realm.

594
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,360
That's one of a kind! The only copy of the three realms.

595
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,190
How could you...

596
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,710
What should we do?

597
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,160
It's from Yue Mi. Have some.

598
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,649
Your engraving looks awful.

599
00:36:09,649 --> 00:36:12,250
Here, read while I engrave.

600
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,930
Get up.

601
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:19,069
What? I learned writing with Zhi Yang! Are you looking down upon me?

602
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:24,549
Are you loafing on the job so as to leave all the chores to me?

603
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,920
Not at all!

604
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,330
Then read it for me!

605
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,829
What a bargain for Bai Jue! Watch and learn.

606
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,880
Master.

607
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,710
Shang Gu, come with me.

608
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,540
What do you know about the three realms?

609
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,119
Piece of cake!

610
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,129
Although I'm not into cultivating,

611
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,359
I love watching plays and hearing stories.

612
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:04,930
As for the three realms, 70,000 years ago, Ancestral God divided the universe in three.

613
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,729
The Netherworld at the far north where the devils and the demon gods reside.

614
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:11,059
The Netherworld borders with the God Realm and the Demon Realm.

615
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,809
It's sealed by the barrier. That place is isolated.

616
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:15,500
The immortals live in the southwest.

617
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,029
With many blessed lands, there are many famous immortals and schools.

618
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,310
The demons are located to the southeast.

619
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,749
Most of them mutate from spiritual things, living in communities.

620
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:26,679
You've been here for some days.

621
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:31,169
If you can pass this test, I'll teach you spells and natural laws.

622
00:37:31,169 --> 00:37:32,920
For real?

623
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,450
Tiger Demons live here at Blood Forest.

624
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,489
It's hard to cultivate there as it lacks spiritual aura.

625
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:42,059
Tiger Demons complain about it.

626
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,960
Cheer them up and you can pass the test.

627
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,890
That's so hard!

628
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,919
Tiger Demons are all unsmiling giants.

629
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,889
I can't juggle jobs.

630
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,709
Although I'm a god, I cannot manipulate their moods.

631
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:01,410
As Chief God, it's your job to bless all living creatures.

632
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,229
If you fail at this, you cannot take responsibility.

633
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,889
As a teacher, you ought to teach me knowledge.

634
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:12,399
Instead, you're humiliating me with an impossible task.

635
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:16,509
You can tell Zhi Yang about it if you don't think I'm qualified. Put off the show.

636
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:19,829
I'm not making it difficult. Maybe I overrated you.

637
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,779
Forget about it. I'll make it easier for you.

638
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:25,360
Fetch something for me from Blood Forest.

639
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,950
Wait.

640
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,959
Pacifying Tiger Demons won't scare me off!

641
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:32,299
It's better to stick to that when facing obstacles.

642
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:35,120
Save the lecture to yourself!

643
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,099
Shang Gu, what's wrong? Tell me about it.

644
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:50,460
Did Bai Jue embarrass you again?

645
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,159
He's always been aloof.

646
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,029
Over these years, no one except Hong Ri can get along with him.

647
00:38:57,029 --> 00:39:00,709
Cultivating with him will be challenging.

648
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,879
Don't mind him.

649
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:04,309
It's your birthday tomorrow.

650
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,640
You always like parties.

651
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,040
I'll hold a grand feast for you. How's that?

652
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,370
If you don't feel like going to class,

653
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,400
it's the Spring Equinox in the Demon Realm.

654
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,239
There are many blossoms. I can take you for a walk.

655
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:19,460
Demon?

656
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,919
Right! You're God of Demons. I should have asked you.

657
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:26,849
Tian Qi, do you know how to cheer a demon up?

658
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,030
Cheer a demon up?

659
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:33,360
Demons are straightforward. We cherish friendship.

660
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,610
An amicable friendship will do.

661
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,190
Amicable friendship?

662
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:42,310
For example... a warm hug.

663
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,060
Amicable friendship.

664
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,060
Your Royal Highness.

665
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,689
 Your Royal Highness. 

666
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,919
Don't bother. Rise up.

667
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:03,439
Your Royal Highness, it's your birthday tomorrow.

668
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:05,439
We know you're not into cultivation.

669
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:07,269
So, we prepared some gadgets for you.

670
00:40:07,269 --> 00:40:09,200
We hope you like them.

671
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,289
I'm sure they suit me! I love every gift you have presented before!

672
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:16,190
We strongly recommend opening it.

673
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,509
We prepared them for a long time.

674
00:40:18,509 --> 00:40:20,680
For a long time?

675
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,309
But it's only my 10,000th birthday.

676
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:33,259
That's too extravagant.

677
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:36,869
Wait... You've got many worshipers, haven't you?

678
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,199
Stop making fun of us.

679
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,089
We're not God of Marriage or God of Fortune. There aren't many worshipers.

680
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:45,639
Your birthday is a grand event in our realm. It should be ceremonious.

681
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:47,270
Exactly!

682
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,479
So, I'll take them.

683
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,119
But there's no free lunch.

684
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:53,090
What can I do for you? Just name it.

685
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,190
Well...

686
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,260
Nothing? I'm leaving.

687
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,959
Your Royal Highness, I do have a wish. Please hear it.

688
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:02,619
Say it out. We all admire True God Bai Jue.

689
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:05,160
But Abyss Hall forbids us from entering.

690
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,579
Now Your Royal Highness is learning from him.

691
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:10,569
Your Royal Highness, you've seen my sincerity.

692
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:12,370
Making a match?

693
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:18,239
Even after getting into Abyss Hall, I'm still making matches.

694
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:20,470
What a surprise!

695
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,649
Tell me about it.

696
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:26,229
What's so special about Ice Cube Bai?

697
00:41:26,229 --> 00:41:28,730
What do you see in him?

698
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,960
I don't get it.

699
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:50,020


700
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:58,720
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

701
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,600
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

702
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:11,819
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

703
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:18,079
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

704
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:25,080
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

705
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:31,539
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

706
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:38,759
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

707
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:45,420
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

708
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:03,959
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

709
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:10,439
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

710
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:17,620
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

711
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:24,220
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

712
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:32,799
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

713
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:39,679
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

714
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:46,359
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

715
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:52,659
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

716
00:43:52,660 --> 00:44:02,380
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
