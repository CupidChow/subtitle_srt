1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:10,010


2
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:21,000
   

3
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,100
   

4
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:30,740
Come on.

5
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,399
If I want to live, Heaven can't kill me either.

6
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,659
Who said we can't fight against Heaven?

7
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,600
I will show everyone in the three realms today that I will definitely conquer Heaven.

8
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,780
Qing Mu is Bai Jue.

9
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,340
It's impossible.

10
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,340
He is going to…

11
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,439
He is drawing thunder into his body

12
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,170
to reshape his spiritual veins.

13
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:56,601
What courage!

14
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,278
Is Qing Mu taking the divine ordeal?

15
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,400
Could it be that the three realms will produce a fifth Upper God?

16
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,780
49 thunder ordeals have fallen,

17
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,450
which is already a divine ordeal.

18
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:23,416
Now there are 32 more,

19
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:26,062
which is exactly the…

20
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:31,160
The number of nine times nine.

21
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,000
Besides a True God, who else can trigger the 81 thunders?

22
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,179
Huan.

23
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,600
Is he Bai…

24
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:47,041
Demon power.

25
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:49,402
He has demon power.

26
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,219
Top of demigod.

27
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,959
A demigod has finally appeared in the Immortal Realm.

28
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,100
If not for the need to reshape the spirit veins,

29
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,838
Lord of the North Sea may have become the pinnacle of an Upper God.

30
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,900
Such an adventure is a fluke.

31
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,479
It's a matter of time before he becomes the fifth upper god.

32
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,920
Hou Chi.

33
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:11,060
Zhao'er.

34
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,500
Hou Chi.

35
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,280
 Upper God Gu Jun. 

36
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,700
Gu Jun?

37
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,820
Wu Huan, if you dare to hurt Hou Chi again,

38
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,060
I will bury your entire Heavenly Palace.

39
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:00,344
- Hou Chi. 
 - Hou Chi.

40
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,340
Mu Guang, you are at least the King of the Heavenly Realm,

41
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,620
and promised me that you would protect Hou Chi.

42
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,419
Now Wu Huan is attacking her in front of you,

43
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,919
what kind of a promise keeper are you?

44
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,278
- Gu Jun. 
 - Ridiculous.

45
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:23,479
She pretended to be Hou Chi,

46
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,699
there is no Dragon Elixir in her body.

47
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:30,479
As her elder, can't I ask clearly?

48
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,619
My daughter, how could I not recognize her?

49
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,500
She was young and weak, and her inner elixir was defective,

50
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,699
so I've already melted her inner elixir and nurtured her with my heart's blood.

51
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,950
You have never cared about her,

52
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,799
and your identity as her Mother God is also fake.

53
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,519
I think you shouldn't be her mother anymore.

54
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:49,760
Gu Jun, what do you mean?

55
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,400
Gu Jun,

56
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,978
you hinted that I was her mother

57
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,939
in front of all the immortals.

58
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,819
I didn't expose it for old times' sake.

59
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,239
But now, are you regretting your words?

60
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,539
Yes.

61
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,399
I'm regretting my words now,

62
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,359
what are you going to do about it?

63
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,840
Today, I'll make everything clear.

64
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,920
My daughter Hou Chi was not born by Wu Huan.

65
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,978
60,000 years ago,

66
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,779
in order to let my daughter Hou Chi

67
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,279
rightfully exist in the three realms,

68
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,939
I chose Wu Huan.

69
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:37,400
Unexpectedly, my mistake has been misunderstood by the immortals so far.

70
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,100
If that is the case, I'd like to clarify here that

71
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,780
Wu Huan has never been the mother of Hou Chi.

72
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:55,750
Gu Jun, if you wanted me to admit, I'll admit.  If not, I won't.

73
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,579
How dare you insult me like this?

74
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:01,120
There are many things I dare to do.

75
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,059
For what you've done today,

76
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:06,279
I can kill you 100 times.

77
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:11,258
I let you go also because of the past in the God Realm.

78
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,079
You should reflect on yourself.

79
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,479
- You… 
 - Gu Jun, you are an Upper God,

80
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,460
so be careful with your words.

81
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:26,100
Girl, you're really something.

82
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,450
You almost tore down the Heavenly Palace.

83
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:32,398
Don't worry. Your father is here.

84
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:34,819
Let's talk about it when we get back.

85
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,339
Wait.

86
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,539
The people of Qingchi Palace can leave,

87
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,239
but Qing Mu must stay.

88
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,939
Wu Huan, he just doesn't want to marry your daughter.

89
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:48,700
Why do you have to kill him?

90
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,698
Because of the demon power inside him,

91
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,240
today I have to kill him.

92
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,619
You are avenging your personal revenge.

93
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,600
I don't know what you are talking about.

94
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,738
I'm doing this for the whole Immortal Realm.

95
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:06,938
Just now, the young man carried the Ninth Heaven Black Thunder with his divine power.

96
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:08,219
If he was a demon,

97
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,680
he would have been beaten back to his original form.

98
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,539
Then you would have had no chance to talk about it here.

99
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,740
He clearly has demon power.

100
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,738
Yes, he has a little demon power, so what?

101
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:24,298
He was burned by the Dragon's Breath of the three-headed fire dragon,

102
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:27,099
so it's normal to have demon power in his body.

103
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,260
How can you conclude that he is a demon?

104
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,938
I've heard that he saved your son

105
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:37,618
a few days ago from the three-headed fire dragon.

106
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:43,020
Is this how you people in the Heavenly Realm treat your benefactor?

107
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,030
You are really shameless and immoral.

108
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,190
Gu Jun, you're wrong.

109
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,680
Even if he saved Yang'er and has the grace of the Heavenly Palace,

110
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,138
that is not as important as the matter between Immortal and Demon Clans.

111
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:00,478
If his origin is unknown, it's not too much for the Heavenly Queen to check him.

112
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:04,279
Mu Guang, don' forget that when the God Realm existed,

113
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,818
Immortal and Demon Clans were originally one clan; there was no enemy.

114
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,499
 - Yes. 
 - Upper God Gu Jun is right. 

115
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,018
Well, that's all for today.

116
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,880
There are still doubts about this matter.

117
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,458
We can't make a hasty conclusion.

118
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:30,100
Your Majesty, before we figure it out, we can't let them go.

119
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:36,498
Upper God Gu Jun.

120
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:38,839
Don't be so polite.

121
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,220
Upper God Gu Jun.

122
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,520
I'm Qing Mu, I'd like to give my body as a betrothal to marry Upper God Hou Chi.

123
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:52,019
I beg you to agree.

124
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:06,159
Young man, why do you think I will betroth Hou Chi to you?

125
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,499
Just because you survived a few thunder ordeals?

126
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:20,138
My love for Hou Chi can withstand the test.

127
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:23,619
I'd like to swear to Heaven that as long as I live,

128
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:26,058
within the three realms and nine states,

129
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,100
I will kill the gods if they hurt her,

130
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,899
and I will kill the devils if they humiliate her.

131
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,699
If I violate this oath,

132
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,699
I will definitely be devoured by devils and my soul will be scattered.

133
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,919
You're dreaming.

134
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,078
From now on, I'll stay in Qingchi Palace for 10,000 years.

135
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:52,299
If you are in trouble,

136
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,800
you can come to Qilian Mountain for tea.

137
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:59,279
But my daughter won't marry.

138
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,099
Qing Mu, that's our lord's temper.

139
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,679
He just didn't show a good face to those two,

140
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,199
he was already very good to you.

141
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,818
Besides, Hou Chi is his beloved one,

142
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,820
it's too casual for you to ask for marriage.

143
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:31,138
How about this?

144
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:33,299
You can wait for a few more days.

145
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:50,938
Sister, you've also seen that

146
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:53,958
the love between Qing Mu and Hou Chi has already gone beyond life and death,

147
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,820
so don't torture yourself again.

148
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:00,479
Listen to me, give up on this.

149
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:09,519
I broke all my spiritual roots for him,

150
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,859
but in the end, I still got nothing.

151
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:18,539
The love in this world, even if I try my best,

152
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,340
I still can't catch it.

153
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,419
Second Brother,

154
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,880
I'm tired.

155
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,059
Zhao'er.

156
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,379
It seems that I have underestimated this flood dragon before.

157
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,918
Your Master, now all the three realms regard you as the God of Destruction.

158
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:46,578
Gu Jun is even more loyal to Royal Highness.

159
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:50,298
If you want to take her away, I'm afraid it won't be easy.

160
00:12:50,298 --> 00:12:55,180
The future of Shang Gu is not for others to decide.

161
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,659
Wu Huan, you dare to hurt Hou Chi.

162
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,058
It seems that you have been a supreme being of the three realms for so long

163
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:06,700
that you've forgotten the honorable and inferior.

164
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,720
- He is Demon God Tian Qi. 
 - Demon God.

165
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,479
Your Majesty, wasn't the Demon God killed by the True God Bai Jue long ago?

166
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,179
I live with the gods, who can kill a god?

167
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,018
Mu Guang, I haven't seen you for 60,000 years.

168
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,278
You're doing a decent job as Heavenly King.

169
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,439
My Demon Clan does not come to offend your Immortal Clan,

170
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,559
but you sent your two sons into the Swamp of Netherhill

171
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,058
to stop the three-headed fire dragon from becoming a god.

172
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:42,938
Isn't it enough for you to be the lord of the Immortal Realm?

173
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:45,719
And do you want to annex the three realms?

174
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,359
Demon God, Heavenly King was originally the lord of the three realms chosen by Master Zhi Yang.

175
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,299
If it were not for the rebellion of the Demon Clan,

176
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,858
how could the three realms be at odds?

177
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:00,498
Don't confuse right and wrong here.

178
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:05,398
How dare a filthy phoenix speak in front of me?

179
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:11,339
- You… 
 - Demon God, what are you doing here today?

180
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,759
Since I've returned,

181
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,938
I must make you immortals pay the price.

182
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,578
Although I don't like your small land,

183
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:24,219
if your immortals offend my demons by half an inch,

184
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,378
I will definitely let you disappear

185
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:30,980
like the Blue Dragon Pavilion.

186
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:43,819
Father God, is he really the Demon God Tian Qi?

187
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,799
Demon God has appeared, the three realms are in danger.

188
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:51,559
Yang'er, ring the Blue Dragon Bell.

189
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:56,318
Summon the immortals of the three realms into the Heavenly Palace to discuss countermeasures.

190
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:58,499
Yes, Father God.

191
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,139
How come it's been so long and there's still no news from Her Highness?

192
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,458
I don't know if anything has happened.

193
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:25,919
Jia Ye.

194
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,719
Master Upper God.

195
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:32,739
Master, you are finally back.

196
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,299
If you still didn't come back, our Qingchi Palace

197
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:37,058
would have been bullied to death by the Heavenly Palace.

198
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:40,498
Don't worry, no one will dare to bully us again.

199
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:41,659
By the way,

200
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,458
why are so many Qilian Mountain cave mansions missing?

201
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,060
You haven't returned for 10,000 years.

202
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,678
The spiritual veins and aura of Qilian Mountain are not as good as before.

203
00:15:50,678 --> 00:15:53,118
Some immortals cultivated slowly,

204
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,899
thinking our Qingchi Palace was in decline,

205
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,739
so they all moved away.

206
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,699
Bastards.

207
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,658
Go to tell those immortals that it won't be easy for them to come back.

208
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,540
Yes, Upper God.

209
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,218
Your Majesty, Demon God has appeared.

210
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:19,880
I wonder if you have a countermeasure?

211
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,199
Don't panic.

212
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,918
Demon God was hurt by True God Bai Jue,

213
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,918
and has not yet recovered his true god power.

214
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:28,478
Otherwise, with his divine power

215
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:30,478
he would have already turned our Heavenly Palace into ruins.

216
00:16:30,478 --> 00:16:33,859
How could he only destroy one hall and leave?

217
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,200
Your Majesty is right.

218
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:40,319
In my opinion,

219
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:43,038
today the Demon God made such a big fuss in the Heavenly Palace,

220
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:45,299
but was just pretending.

221
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,598
Your Majesty,

222
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:49,478
even if his divine power is greatly damaged, he should not be underestimated.

223
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:52,798
He wanted to destroy all beings in the three realms to become the Chief God alone.

224
00:16:52,798 --> 00:16:55,399
If he regains his power and regenerates this intention again,

225
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,818
I'm afraid there will be trouble.

226
00:16:56,818 --> 00:16:58,379
What you said is correct.

227
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:01,589
Jing Yang, you lead 50,000 soldiers to the Luo Cha Region,

228
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:03,238
to guard the immortal-demon barrier.

229
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:05,598
If there is any demon movement, report it at once.

230
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:07,598
Yes, Father God.

231
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:10,599
The appearance of the Demon God is the most important event in the three realms.

232
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,598
We Immortal Clan should work together to deal with it.

233
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:17,939
From now on, all of you guard your own family,

234
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,958
and don't let the demons get the chance.

235
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,460
 Yes. 

236
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,179
Your Majesty!

237
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,359
Since Gu Jun has been back, Demon God has appeared,

238
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,118
plus our Heavenly Palace, the heavenly triad has formed again.

239
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:45,218
No one will let anyone go.

240
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:47,138
If we don't break it,

241
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:50,539
we will repeat the 60,000-year stalemate.

242
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,659
Your Majesty, apart from confronting the demons,

243
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,498
how should we deal with Qingchi Palace?

244
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:57,738
Have you thought about it?

245
00:17:57,739 --> 00:17:59,019
Think about what?

246
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,318
Think about why you deceived me for so many years?

247
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:02,919
Hou Chi is not your daughter,

248
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:04,779
why didn't you tell me that?

249
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:07,480
I…

250
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:12,858
For all these years you never asked me about that,

251
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,298
I thought you didn't care about it.

252
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:15,759
I don't care about it,

253
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,180
but have you been honest with me?

254
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,299
A mortal woman would have told her husband about it,

255
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,299
instead of hiding it like you and letting the misunderstanding happen.

256
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:30,460
Have you ever considered my feelings?

257
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,519
Of course, I care about your feelings.

258
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,939
We already have three children.

259
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,519
All these years I've been doing my best to take care of the Heavenly Palace.

260
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,419
How can you question my love for you because of this?

261
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,080
Well, then tell me. What happened back then?

262
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,539
It was because Gu Jun was away all the years round,

263
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,558
and you came to Qingchi Palace to see me, so I followed you.

264
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:02,399
I've always felt guilty to Gu Jun.

265
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:05,858
When he came to me with that unshelled egg,

266
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:08,118
I took pity on the child,

267
00:19:08,118 --> 00:19:11,299
so I agreed to be her nominal mother.

268
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,779
Unexpectedly, I didn't expect it to lead to so many misunderstandings.

269
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:25,279
A'Huan.

270
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:35,639
Who knows the pain in my heart after all these years?

271
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,120
It's my fault.

272
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,539
I didn't consider your feelings.

273
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,299
As for the grudge with the Qingchi Palace,

274
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:50,038
it was because I loved you so deeply that I offended Gu Jun.

275
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:54,500
There are so many things in the past, let's put all of them down.

276
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,719
In the future,

277
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:03,240
don't go and make trouble with Hou Chi and Qing Mu. Okay?

278
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:26,118
Upper God, Jia Ye has informed all the immortals that

279
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:28,978
Qilian Mountain won't be easy to come and go as they please.

280
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:33,009
The immortals have long been accustomed to holding their heads high and stepping on the low.

281
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:35,799
Qingchi Palace has always been neutral in the three realms,

282
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,699
and we are not friendly with the Heavenly Palace.

283
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,419
Take this opportunity to punish them.

284
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,880
Qilian Mountain will be quiet later.

285
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,279
I think those immortals are all regretful.

286
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,218
As long as you are here, no one will dare to bully our Qingchi Palace.

287
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:54,378
Feng Ran, I've been away for 10,000 years.

288
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,999
All these years,

289
00:20:56,999 --> 00:21:00,198
thanks to you for keeping Qingchi Palace in order.

290
00:21:00,198 --> 00:21:01,838
Master, why did you say this?

291
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:03,618
If you hadn't taken me in,

292
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:06,338
who knows what would have become of me.

293
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:08,358
From the moment I stepped into Qingchi Palace,

294
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:12,198
it has been my home, and you and Hou Chi are my family,

295
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:14,218
so this is what I should do.

296
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:17,939
But I didn't expect that Hou Chi was not the daughter of Heavenly Queen.

297
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:23,799
Over the years, she has been ridiculed and suffered a lot because of her life experience.

298
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,099
It was truly heartbreaking.

299
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,980
I also had no choice back then.

300
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:35,879
When I came back this time,

301
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,358
I found that Hou Chi's spiritual power

302
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:39,879
has improved a lot compared to 10,000 years ago.

303
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:43,399
Is it related to the immortal lord on Blue Dragon Pavilion?

304
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:45,400
Do you care about that?

305
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,419
At Blue Dragon Pavilion, I didn't get the chance to ask Hou Chi about it.

306
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:51,818
Tell me more about him in detail.

307
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:55,418
He is from the North Sea, and was gifted since he was a child.

308
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:57,859
He reached the peak of lord within a thousand years.

309
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,699
He is famous in the Immortal Realm.

310
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:02,418
The Heavenly Palace has repeatedly courted him. He was unmoved.

311
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:06,999
He has only been sincere to Hou Chi and safeguarded our Qingchi Palace everywhere.

312
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:11,090
I think he and Hou Chi are very…

313
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,230
What?

314
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:13,979
They are very good for each other.

315
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:15,900
Stop talking nonsense.

316
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,099
God, you also saw on Blue Dragon Pavilion,

317
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:22,379
he and Hou Chi had experienced life and death several times.

318
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:25,358
They've already exchanged their thoughts and feelings, and have identified each other.

319
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:27,039
If you want to stop it now,

320
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,718
I'm afraid it won't work.

321
00:22:28,718 --> 00:22:31,519
Moreover, Lord Qing Mu is a person of integrity and pure nature,

322
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,318
and not one to cling to the rich and powerful.

323
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,578
This kind of character is really rare in the three realms.

324
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:36,899
- Why do you… 
 - Say no more.

325
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:38,959
I have to make herbal medicine for Hou Chi.

326
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:42,959
Her body is more important than anything else.

327
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,459
Looking at his attitude,

328
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:56,700
I'm afraid that Hou Chi and Qing Mu will have to suffer a lot.

329
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,940
Master, I never expected that

330
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,880
you would fall in love with Hou Chi,

331
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,198
and fell into it so deeply.

332
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:19,839
What should I do?

333
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,719
Father God.

334
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,218
A'Chi, you haven't recovered yet.

335
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:30,559
Why are you here?

336
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,359
I'm fine.

337
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,239
Although I injected you with spiritual power at Blue Dragon Pavilion,

338
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,179
your foundation is weak.

339
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,378
These immortal herbs, which I picked from the top of the snowy mountains,

340
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:47,919
are most useful to you.

341
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,160
Let Chang Que make them for you later.

342
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:56,618
A'Chi, why is the spiritual power in your body so strong?

343
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:58,899
Father, I had an adventure in the Heavenly Palace.

344
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:01,679
And inexplicably refined the divine power of Pilgrim Hall.

345
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,320
So now I can help you guard Qingchi Palace.

346
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,659
Pilgrim Hall.

347
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,300
What?

348
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:16,039
A'Chi, why did you bring such a precious elixir to me?

349
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,200
It's wasted.

350
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,400
Father, don't be stubborn.

351
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,499
I can see it.

352
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:25,560
What do you see?

353
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,879
You're injured.

354
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:30,239
It's a small injury; it doesn't matter.

355
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,559
Small injury?

356
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,640
Then where have you been all these 10,000 years?

357
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:40,640
I picked these herbs one by one from the top of the snowy mountains.

358
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,600
Your foundation is weak,

359
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,139
so it's good for your health to eat these.

360
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,260
In previous years, you would send a letter back by instruction feather after leaving.

361
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,519
But this time you've been gone for so long without a letter.

362
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,000
I met some ancient divine beasts on the way.

363
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,539
And when I fought with them, I accidentally injured my spirit vein,

364
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:03,579
so I had to enter into meditation to heal.

365
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:08,980
But I didn't expect to wake up after 10,000 years.

366
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,599
Have you recovered from your injuries?

367
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:15,160
Your father is an Upper God,

368
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,519
this little injury is nothing to worry about.

369
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:23,178
All right!  A'Chi, drink your medicine.

370
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:24,839
Father God,

371
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:30,319
this medicine is from my heart anyway.

372
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,299
A'Chi, let me feed it to you.

373
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,419
Okay! A'Chi, be a good girl.

374
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:45,098
How about this?

375
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:48,579
You drink half, and I drink half.

376
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,180
Father God,

377
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:17,449
you don't know how much I missed you

378
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,099
after so many years without seeing you.

379
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,740
A'Chi, take a walk with me.

380
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,399
Lord Qing Mu, what brings you here?

381
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:45,218
Qing Mu asks to see Upper God Gu Jun. Please report it for me.

382
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:52,299
Please wait for a moment. I'll go back to report to my master.

383
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,559
It's been hard for you these years.

384
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,820
Father God, don't say that.

385
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,819
I'm the young master of Qingchi Palace, it's my duty to guard it.

386
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:08,918
Little Chi has finally grown up.

387
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,119
I'm very pleased.

388
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,019
Now that I have returned, I'd like to see

389
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:16,799
who dares to bully our Qingchi Palace.

390
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:24,209
Father God, have you heard any news about Bo Xuan during your travels?

391
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,040
No.

392
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,059
But counting the days,

393
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:33,698
Bo Xuan should have already transcended the ordeal and turned into a god.

394
00:27:33,698 --> 00:27:36,259
But now he has not returned yet,

395
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,739
- perhaps he… 
 - No.

396
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:43,018
Although in the past 10,000 years, there was no immortal who has advanced to a god in the three realms,

397
00:27:43,018 --> 00:27:45,599
I still believe that Bo Xuan must not have failed to overcome the ordeal.

398
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,118
As long as I don't find him, I believe he is still alive in this world.

399
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,419
It was for your father's sake.

400
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:56,099
I also believe that with Bo Xuan's strength,

401
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:58,260
he will be safe.

402
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:04,079
Father God, I have one more thing.

403
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:06,139
The young man Qing Mu at Blue Dragon Pavilion,

404
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:09,780
he treats me sincerely and so do I.

405
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,618
You and he?

406
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:14,599
We have promised for life, forever.

407
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,099
Qing Mu is upright and clear about good and evil.

408
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,239
I can't be wrong about him.

409
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:24,218
Your Highness. Upper God.

410
00:28:24,218 --> 00:28:27,298
Chang Que, why are you so rash?

411
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:29,478
Your God, Lord of the North Sea is here.

412
00:28:29,478 --> 00:28:33,219
And he is now waiting outside to see you.

413
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,318
He's just in time.

414
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:38,919
Invite him to the main hall.

415
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,479
Yes.

416
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,839
Let's go.

417
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:56,058
Qing Mu greets Upper God Gu Jun.

418
00:28:56,058 --> 00:28:57,660
Stop it.

419
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,459
I am seeing you today because I want to make things clear to you.

420
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:12,860
I know very well how you feel about Hou Chi.

421
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,339
But I don't agree with your marriage.

422
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,300
Father God.

423
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:34,739
I hope you don't come back to Qingchi Palace again.

424
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:37,940
Farewell.

425
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:42,879
Father God!

426
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,239
Hou Chi, don't worry.

427
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:50,439
How could father be so…

428
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:52,079
You should think from his perspective.

429
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:54,380
You've been apart for so many years.

430
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,919
Now you're reunited,

431
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:58,879
but Qing Mu comes to ask for marriage.

432
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:02,600
Which father would be willing to part with his daughter?

433
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,949
But just now my father said that Qing Mu will not be allowed to come to Qingchi Palace anymore.

434
00:30:06,949 --> 00:30:10,599
He said not to come again, instead of definitely not coming.

435
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:13,599
I think he still has a chance.

436
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:16,958
Right, Hou Chi, I still have a chance.

437
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:20,878
I was too eager today to consider your father's feelings.

438
00:30:20,878 --> 00:30:23,718
Don't worry, I won't give up.

439
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:27,218
I'll let him accept me one day, and believe that I can take care of you.

440
00:30:27,218 --> 00:30:29,099
Take a few more days.

441
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:33,400
I think your Father God is testing Qing Mu.

442
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,119
- Testing? 
 - Yeah.

443
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,160
Master, destiny makes fool of the people.

444
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:25,500
What if you recall all this and see the situation now?

445
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:30,647
Hou Chi and Qing Mu are in deep love,

446
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,719
but I can't bear to see Hou Chi sad.

447
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,939
Father God.

448
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,498
Princess has just recovered and she must not drink,

449
00:32:07,498 --> 00:32:10,479
is this how you serve her?

450
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:11,598
We servants were wrong.

451
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:14,359
But Your Princess insists on drinking, we servants truly could not stop her.

452
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,618
May Your Majesty forgive us.

453
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:18,719
Forget it, you can all leave.

454
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,460
How's your body?

455
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,500
It's all right.

456
00:32:31,979 --> 00:32:35,499
When I found out that you had lost the Dragon Elixir that day,

457
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:37,720
I was very anxious

458
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,100
and said some harsh words to you.

459
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,559
The Dragon Elixir is your foundation.

460
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,718
If you lose it, you will be nothing.

461
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:49,438
I care about you.

462
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:52,759
I was confused,

463
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:55,879
so I did such a ridiculous thing,

464
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:58,539
and let Father and Mother worry about me.

465
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:00,679
I know I was wrong.

466
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,479
It's not all your fault.

467
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:07,138
If I had known that Qing Mu liked Hou Chi,

468
00:33:07,138 --> 00:33:11,799
I would never have given you the marriage,

469
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:14,480
then it would not have ended up in this situation.

470
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:19,200
The marriage was from my own will.

471
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,100
But after these things,

472
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,719
I also see many things clearly.

473
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,580
Zhao'er.

474
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,899
You grew up in the Heavenly Palace,

475
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,318
enjoying a pampered life.

476
00:33:32,318 --> 00:33:35,479
We are all obedient to you,

477
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:38,600
which developed your arrogant temperament.

478
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:41,639
We thought it was good for you.

479
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:46,039
Feelings of affection... can not be forced.

480
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:49,739
You have suffered this time,

481
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,540
so you must remember the truth of it.

482
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,519
I know.

483
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,518
From now on, I will love myself

484
00:34:00,518 --> 00:34:02,438
and will not act recklessly.

485
00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:04,319
That's good.

486
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:06,600
The loss and regain of your Dragon Elixir

487
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,679
has given great damage to your spiritual power.

488
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,240
You'd better retreat and cultivate for a while,

489
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,380
it's helpful in recovering your spiritual power.

490
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:20,739
All right.

491
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,699
You can't stand the cold wind.

492
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,879
Let me send you back to have a good rest.

493
00:34:30,259 --> 00:34:32,180
Father God.

494
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,520
If you want to cry, then just cry.

495
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:38,179
I will always be with you.

496
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:06,099
The Demon God appeared, so he will not be far from awakening.

497
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:11,798
When he becomes a True God and uses Yue Mi as a reason to attack me,

498
00:35:11,798 --> 00:35:14,739
how can I resist it?

499
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:18,000
Rely on Mu Guang.

500
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,000
No. I have to improve my spiritual power.

501
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,780
There is not much time left for me.

502
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,600
 This bow is made by evil spirits. If you use it to cultivate, it can improve your spiritual power. 

503
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,179
 Evil spirit? 

504
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,739
 It is the resentment and evil thoughts of those who died in vain. 

505
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:43,640
 All the indignation in their hearts has produced immense power, 

506
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,259
 so this bow is incredibly powerful. 

507
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:51,439
For 60,000 years,

508
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,800
I'm no longer the little divine servant,

509
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,320
but the lord of the Heavenly Palace with the power of an Upper God.

510
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,159
The devil weapon that I couldn't control before,

511
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,339
can I not control it now?

512
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,940
Feng Nv.

513
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,399
What is Queen's command?

514
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:44,740
Master, recently the immortals took the lead in attacking

515
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,399
on the grounds that the immortal generals were missing.

516
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:48,478
We fought a few rounds, and we both have had wins and losses.

517
00:36:48,478 --> 00:36:50,479
But we still lost a lot.

518
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:55,638
Both have had wins and losses.

519
00:36:55,638 --> 00:36:58,760
They're bullying our Demon Clan for the lack of great demons.

520
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,578
Pass my order down.

521
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:04,058
Immediately order the three-headed fire dragon to the Luo Cha Region,

522
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:06,120
and add a demigod.

523
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,280
Let's see how the Immortal Clan can still behave.

524
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:12,300
Yes, Your Master.

525
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,819
I thought about this all night and can't come up with any ideas.

526
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:32,840
Hou Chi, does your father like anything in particular?

527
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,278
In addition to his baby daughter, he cares most about his weapon room.

528
00:37:36,278 --> 00:37:37,639
I asked Chang Que.

529
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:41,819
He saw that over these years the god was away, he has been lazy and did not clean it.

530
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,559
Okay, since it's a test,

531
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:47,250
then I will start with cleaning the weapon room.

532
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,620
Are you really going to clean it?

533
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,098
The more people who don't lack anything, the more he needs to be sincere.

534
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:59,618
Hou Chi, don't worry.

535
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:01,638
I'll show your father my sincerity,

536
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:04,180
and let him rest assured to give you to me.

537
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,878
What's wrong?

538
00:38:09,878 --> 00:38:11,398
Nothing.

539
00:38:11,398 --> 00:38:12,818
I'm going.

540
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:14,258
Go ahead.

541
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:15,619
I'll go.

542
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,329
Go.

543
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,100
   

544
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,940
Upper God.

545
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,860
Upper God.

546
00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:12,499
Let's go.

547
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:32,080


548
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:41,139
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

549
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:48,040
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

550
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:54,439
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

551
00:40:54,439 --> 00:41:00,639
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

552
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:07,540
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

553
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:14,049
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

554
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:21,339
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

555
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:27,940
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

556
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,159
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

557
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:51,659
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

558
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:58,840
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

559
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:05,940
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

560
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:14,019
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

561
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:20,860
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

562
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:27,259
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

563
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:33,760
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

564
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:44,160
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
