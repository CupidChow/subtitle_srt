1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:10,020


2
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:21,480
   

3
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,700
   

4
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,300
I'm willing to accept punishment.

5
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,840
Hou Chi? Who is that?

6
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,479
The three realms all changed when I woke up.

7
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,380
My memories are still from the Netherworld.

8
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,780
The Netherworld?

9
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,759
We haven't seen each other for years.

10
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,679
But you didn't greet me when you saw me.

11
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,899
I dare not. Master Shang Gu, you just woke up.

12
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:56,878
Are you... all right?

13
00:01:56,878 --> 00:02:00,718
I'm full of spiritual power and the Power of Chaos.

14
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,559
Forget it. The friendship between us no longer exists.

15
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,980
I'll talk about something else.

16
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,100
For the past 60,000 years, were you the patriarch of the Phoenix Clan?

17
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,839
Master Shang Gu, there's something you don't know. The God Realm was in chaos.

18
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,438
And the Phoenix Clan was in a panic.

19
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:24,520
Elder Feng Yun ordered me to be the patriarch.

20
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,560
I couldn't hardly refuse it. I had to take it at a difficult moment.

21
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,669
The three realms all knew it.

22
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,559
If you don't believe it, you can ask other immortals.

23
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:39,219
Since you were the patriarch of the Phoenix Clan,

24
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:41,599
why did you kill Wu Xi and Feng Yan in secret?

25
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,079
Master, you are wrong.

26
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,658
It was Elder Dan Feng who killed Feng Yan.

27
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:48,699
Who is Elder Dan Feng?

28
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:51,429
What relationship does she have with Feng Yan?

29
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,780
Elder Dan Feng killed herself because of guilt.

30
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,559
I really don't know the situation.

31
00:02:55,559 --> 00:03:00,759
That means, all my doubts can't be solved by any evidence?

32
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,000
I didn't mean that.

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,279
You have really changed a lot in 60,000 years.

34
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:13,759
No, from the very beginning,

35
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,359
I underestimated you, Wu Huan.

36
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,620
I don't want to see you anymore.

37
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,999
When the God Realm is unsealed, you are not allowed to enter.

38
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,320
Wu Huan will follow your command, Master.

39
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,520
   

40
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,060
Do you want this?

41
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,239
I want to have that.

42
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,959
This one, okay.

43
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,559
Here.

44
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,479
- Delicious. 
 - Delicious?

45
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,498
Did Master Shang Gu really wake up?

46
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:10,698
If it's true, will the wedding of True God Bai Jue be...

47
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:15,679
It might be the Heavenly Palace's turn to get the bad luck.

48
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,059
Dong Hua greets Master Shang Gu.

49
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:33,519
Auntie, have you gotten revenge for Yuan Qi?

50
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,839
I won't let you feel aggrieved.

51
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,440
Everybody may rise.

52
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,980
Today is Lord Dong Hua's birthday,

53
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,738
but I came rashly and Yuan Qi spoiled your spiritual spring.

54
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:49,480
My nephew and I feel guilty for that.

55
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,459
Master, your coming is the greatest honor for my Daze Mansion.

56
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:59,599
This Doomsday Elixir was made when I was bored.

57
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,580
I wanted to give it to Yuan Qi as candy.

58
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,458
But now I'll give it to you as a token of my regard.

59
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,998
It's said that it's refined by the True Gods

60
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:13,279
to help immortals pass their tribulation and become a god.

61
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,129
Master's gift is precious. I thank you.

62
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:19,439
No need to be polite, Dong Hua.

63
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,979
Feng Ran told me that Lord Dong Hua has profound cultivation and merits.

64
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,940
Presumably, your time to ascend to a god is not far away.

65
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,039
When you become a god, and if you have spare time, just visit Pilgrim Hall.

66
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,639
All thanks to your favorable words.

67
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,758
Master, since you've mentioned, are you going back to the God Realm soon?

68
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:39,749
But the God Realm was closed 60,000 years ago.

69
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:42,800
I have my plan for this.

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,420
Let's go.

71
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Jing Zhao greets Master Shang Gu.

72
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,540
Jing Zhao?

73
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,760
Are you the daughter of Mu Guang and Wu Huan?

74
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,300
Bai Jue's newly-married wife?

75
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,679
Yes.

76
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:04,260
I've been sleeping for thousands of years and I don't know much about the Immortal Realm.

77
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,510
So I don't know how old you are.

78
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,379
Jing Zhao is 20,000 years old.

79
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:11,479
20,000 years old?

80
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,759
Not too young.

81
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,699
Let me ask you. Are you the same as your Father God

82
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:19,019
who administers to the three realms and benefits the common people?

83
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:21,359
- No. 
 - Or have you created a school like Dong Hua

84
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:23,439
who has many apprentices

85
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,900
to contribute briefly to the three realms?

86
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,759
You have no virtue of honor or power of merit,

87
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,700
what's your qualification to visit me?

88
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,039
Only because of your humble identity as the princess of the Heavenly Palace?

89
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,759
Don't you want to know this kid's identity?

90
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,420
- His mother is... 
 - Zhao'er.

91
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,260
Mother God.

92
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,199
Yuan Qi, who hit you earlier?

93
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,619
Mother God.

94
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:02,219
Wu Huan, considering you're the Heavenly Queen, I'll save you some face.

95
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:05,639
Please instruct your daughter well when you get back.

96
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,290
Don't make the same mistake.

97
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,540
Mother God.

98
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,599
Did she really slap Wu Huan?

99
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,999
What was Wu Huan's expression?

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,439
Did her face turn green to white, and then to purple?

101
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,319
Third Uncle, weren't you against us going to Observation Mountain?

102
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,669
Why do you come asking now?

103
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,940
Don't you want a weapon?

104
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,959
That depends on how good it is.

105
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,499
Little boy.

106
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,200
Wu Huan was slapped by my auntie

107
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,820
and her face instantly swelled into a pig's head.

108
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,199
Why did Bai Jue marry a woman like Jing Zhao?

109
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,319
It is really pitiful to harm such a good child as Yuan Qi.

110
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,079
Shang Gu, tell me the truth.

111
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,018
Do you mind Bai Jue marrying someone else?

112
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:11,738
He even treats his own son like that.

113
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:14,389
If I still can't forget the ignorant love,

114
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,518
wouldn't it be ridiculous?

115
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,738
By the way, is the name of Yuan Qi's mother Hou Chi?

116
00:08:20,738 --> 00:08:21,900
How do you know?

117
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,100
Can't I know?

118
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,379
Do I have some connection with this Hou Chi?

119
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:29,260
It was indeed not good to visit Observation Mountain.

120
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,939
Someone deceased, no need to tell you about it.

121
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,689
It's only been 60,000 years, why is everyone so weird?

122
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:42,500
How are we weird?

123
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,239
I'm the same as before, having no secrets to hide from you.

124
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:49,739
Tian Qi, I've talked with you about reopening the God Realm.

125
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:52,599
Now that you are awake, everything is settled.

126
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,349
It's time to unseal the God Realm.

127
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:57,418
I'll cultivate hard to recover my divine power during this time.

128
00:08:57,418 --> 00:09:00,479
Let's choose one day to go to the Bronze Bridge and have a try.

129
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,039
Okay.

130
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:08,279
This brat. He has to trouble me to fix it.

131
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:18,359
Yuan Qi.

132
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,238
Auntie. What's the matter, Auntie?

133
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:25,658
Help me watch your Third Uncle.

134
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:28,418
If there is anything abnormal, tell me right away.

135
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,659
Third Uncle?

136
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:33,340
You don't want to do that?

137
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,109
When I complete the task...

138
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,119
The delicious wontons in Nanhai City.

139
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,719
Deal!

140
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,519
If Mu Guang didn't stop me,

141
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,199
I should have killed Hou Chi in person.

142
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,339
How could I be humiliated today?

143
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,978
Wu Huan, Master Shang Gu has awoken.

144
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:21,819
Such a big news.

145
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,699
I was going to Xuan Tian Hall

146
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:30,118
to tell you this good news.

147
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:32,100
The Chief God told me on Observation Mountain

148
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,159
that she's going to the Qingchi Palace for cultivation.

149
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,320
We are not far from the day when we open the God Realm.

150
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,259
Since that's the case, I won't bother.

151
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,339
By the way, I have something to ask.

152
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,038
Your Majesty, please.

153
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,840
Where is Feng Nv now?

154
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,899
Feng Nv?

155
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,859
She said she wanted to go to the Lower Realm to cultivate a few days ago.

156
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,399
I allowed her.

157
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,050
I think she must have gone back to the Wutong Forest.

158
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,799
You are not sure about it, either?

159
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,579
I dare not lie to you.

160
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,420
Recently, the Immortal Realm is far from peaceful.

161
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,340
Many immortals have died unnaturally.

162
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
Someone found out...

163
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:30,319
that these tragic deaths were all related to Feng Nv.

164
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,499
Feng Nv's nature is pure, how could she kill others?

165
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:38,578
Your Majesty, please investigate carefully.

166
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:42,180
I hope so.

167
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,180
I have to go to the Blue Dome of Heaven.

168
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,458
If there is any news about Feng Nv tell me immediately.

169
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,399
Shang Gu has become powerful.

170
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,280
The battle against the True Gods can no longer be delayed.

171
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,129
Now only the plan of dividing and demoralizing

172
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,800
can reverse the situation.

173
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,079
Go to the Luocha Region now.

174
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,379
I need more evil spirits.

175
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes.

176
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,540
Who still misses you?

177
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,239
But I, the Chief God, just got used to wearing it.

178
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:41,798
If I don't wear it, my wrist is too light.

179
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:43,779
Auntie, why are you not sleeping?

180
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:46,539
I should be asking you this.

181
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:49,049
I did a good job that you entrusted me with.

182
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:52,740
I saw my third uncle sneak out of Qingchi Palace.

183
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,020
For the past ten thousand years,

184
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,039
he didn't like hanging out and has few friends.

185
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,740
He must be up to something.

186
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,159
Auntie, you can catch up with him now.

187
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,519
When I come back, I'll take you to Nanhai City to eat wontons.

188
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,800
It's really nice to have a mom.

189
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,820
 Don't they seldom talk to each other? 

190
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,720
 Why did Tian Qi give the ancient Emperor Sword to Bai Jue? 

191
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,100
Seek a chance to unseal the God Realm.

192
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,139
Shang Gu is already suspicious.

193
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:41,420
I'm afraid that if it continues,

194
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,360
she'll recall her past with you.

195
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,840
I'll strictly watch Jing Zhao.

196
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,820
I won't let her reveal more.

197
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,229
If Shang Gu comes again, just show your indifference to her.

198
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:54,918
If it's useless, use some scandalous manners.

199
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,580
Scandalous manners?

200
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,490
 What are they talking about? I can't hear clearly. 

201
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,799
What are you doing?

202
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,598
If I recall it right,

203
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:38,579
I told you not to come to the Blue Dome of Heaven if it wasn't necessary.

204
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,039
Where is my Emperor Sword?

205
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,899
Why can't I feel its spirit?

206
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,319
Is this your excuse for coming to my room?

207
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,040
I've seen everything just now.

208
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,940
You're planning something with Tian Qi, aren't you?

209
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,819
 If it's useless, use some scandalous manners. 

210
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,599
Our fate has been over since 60,000 years ago.

211
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,069
If you insist on pestering me, I'll feel upset.

212
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:01,678
During the battle with Xuan Yi, I lost my life once.

213
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:04,139
Therefore, I told you that I wanted to try living differently

214
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,080
and I meant it.

215
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,330
If you, my Chief God, can't forget our past love,

216
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't mind enjoying the passion with you one more time.

217
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,259
Bai Jue, why have you become so disgusting now?

218
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,640
Don't you like it?

219
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,780
But all the other ladies like that so much.

220
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,019
Don't take yourself too seriously.

221
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,199
Tian Qi and you are hiding something from me.

222
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,360
I will figure it out.

223
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:43,259
Master Bai Jue, Mu Guang and Sen Yu have arrived.

224
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,080
A'Qi, where is your mom?

225
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,119
She has been missing since this morning.

226
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,960
Where did she go?

227
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:02,400
Third Uncle is back. Why hasn't my mom come back?

228
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,780
Didn't she tell you?

229
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,099
I just woke up so I don't know where she went.

230
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:20,158
Fine. With your mother's divine power, nobody can hurt her in the three realms.

231
00:16:20,158 --> 00:16:22,399
She must feel bored staying in Qingchi Palace

232
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,200
and went to play in the Lower Realm.

233
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,479
That's not true, Third Uncle. My mom won't eat alone.

234
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:31,609
If she goes to the Lower Realm, she would certainly bring me with her.

235
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,160
A'Qi.

236
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,400
Yes, Third Uncle.

237
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,569
Be honest with me.  Are you hiding something from me?

238
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:43,410
- No. 
 - No?

239
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,399
Why do I feel that since your mom woke up,

240
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,139
you always stand on the wrong side?

241
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,619
Third Uncle, if I stand by your side, that will be the wrong side.

242
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:55,199
You two have deceived me once.

243
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,720
Is this time the same story?

244
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,620
Don't think too much.

245
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,159
Tell me everything. Where has your mom gone?

246
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:10,739
Third Uncle, I want to eat the savory smelling wontons from Nanhai City.

247
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,740
No truth, no wontons.

248
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,938
I get dizzy when I'm hungry,

249
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:21,380
and when I'm dizzy, I can't remember anything.

250
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,659
My mom told me that the wontons in Nanhai City are the best.

251
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:27,219
- Yuan Qi wants to taste them now. 
 - You!

252
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,899
I really can't handle your kind. Wait!

253
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,039
   

254
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
You say that I indulge my subordinates.

255
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,899
Where is the evidence? Prove it.

256
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:46,359
It can't come out of nowhere, can it?

257
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:49,838
All right. So much for the discussion, now it's lunchtime.

258
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:54,259
Let's have a banquet and talk while drinking, what do you think?

259
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,400
You are not dizzy now, are you?

260
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,199
Yuan Qi remembers now. My mom went out last night.

261
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:19,978
As for where she went, I really don't know.

262
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:22,500
Last night?

263
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,060
When did that happen? Why didn't I notice it?

264
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,018
You just slipped out of Qingchi Palace so you, of course, you wouldn't notice it.

265
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,740
How did you know I left Qingchi Palace?

266
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,238
Coincidence, just a coincidence.

267
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:39,558
Coincidence? You should have gone to sleep at that time.

268
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,080
I had to go pee.

269
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:56,679
Did your mom go out after me?

270
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,699
Be honest, tell me.

271
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:04,619
My mom thinks you're weird, so she has me watching you in secret.

272
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:08,059
I saw you sneak out and my mom followed you.

273
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:09,420
You...

274
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,439
She asks you to watch me once and then you stand on her side!

275
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:13,580
I can't stand on the wrong side!

276
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,680
You can't stand on the wrong...

277
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,919
Uncle treated you well for nothing. Give me the wontons.

278
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,778
These are the dried fruit snacks that I have saved up during the week.

279
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:33,440
I'll give them to you.

280
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,669
Third Uncle, don't be mad at Yuan Qi. Okay?

281
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,160
It hurts!

282
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,920
Don't repeat what you did last night in the future. No more chance.

283
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,500
You have my oath.

284
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,920
They are your favorites. Enjoy them by yourself.

285
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,099
Third Uncle, did you do anything wrong

286
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,240
that you can't let my mom know of?

287
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,620
   

288
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:47,680
Why can't I feel the spirit of the Emperor Sword?

289
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,800
Little thief, who are you?

290
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:52,399
Chief God.

291
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,659
This small dragon was too foolish to recognize you and spoke unintentional words.

292
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:57,159
Please punish me.

293
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,300
You know me?

294
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,078
The wind here is strong. Don't get cold, Chief God.

295
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,020
Both your temper, figure, and divine power

296
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,109
are far away from Hong Ri.

297
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,679
I was a downcast dragon in the Swamp of Netherhill,

298
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:13,078
so I can't be compared to Lord Hong Ri.

299
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:17,038
But your flattering look fits the taste of the current Bai Jue.

300
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:18,559
Thanks for your praise, Your Royal Highness.

301
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,679
Rise.

302
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,360
Thank you, Chief God.

303
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,930
My master is having lunch with Mu Guang and Sen Yu.

304
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,260
Your master is not willing to see me.

305
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,999
I don't want to see him, either.

306
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,570
Chief God, how honorable your identity is!

307
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,270
Besides, how close you and my master are.

308
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,159
Isn't the Blue Dome of Heaven a place

309
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,960
that you can come or leave as you like?

310
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,530
You said something sweet.

311
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,150
Sorry for my humble manner.

312
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,389
When the God Realm is unsealed,

313
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,700
please don't forget me, Chief God.

314
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,579
That year when you were badly injured and in a coma,

315
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:56,309
it was me that sent you back to Qingchi Palace.

316
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,189
I was seriously injured and in a coma?

317
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,900
Who was I seriously injured by?

318
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,109
Well...

319
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,159
Tell me.

320
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,230
This small dragon just did what he was ordered to do, I don't know anything.

321
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,930
I don't know.

322
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,580
What's that sound?

323
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,410
My master must have invited dancers

324
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,610
to cheer up the banquet.

325
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,189
He's really in the mood.

326
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,920
Let me report to him now.

327
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,500
Wait.

328
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,360
Yes, Chief God.

329
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,159
I'm indeed hungry,

330
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,410
but I don't want to deal with those people.

331
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,309
If you don't mind my ugly appearance,

332
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,130
you can go with my small dragon face

333
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,159
and leave after enjoying the meal.

334
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,499
Good idea.

335
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,820
What's your name?

336
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,229
Three-Headed Fire Dragon.

337
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,250
You're a smart dragon. Lead the way.

338
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,580
Chief God, this way, please.

339
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,760
Greetings, Mother God.

340
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,780
Mother God, why did you ask me to come so eagerly?

341
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,799
Master Bai Jue has grounded me for one year

342
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,450
because I mentioned Hou Chi to Master Shang Gu.

343
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,469
I come here in secret.

344
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,709
What?

345
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,890
Just because you and I offended Shang Gu at Dong Hua's birthday banquet yesterday?

346
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,060
Yes.

347
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,400
Was Father God angry with you?

348
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,039
Seems from now on,

349
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,879
there is no place for you in the Blue Dome of Heaven.

350
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,879
If you want to enjoy the esteem under Bai Jue's name,

351
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,290
that will be impossible.

352
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,020
Mother, you are overly concerned.

353
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,719
Even for the sake of Father God, Master Bai Jue would...

354
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,480
I know your father well.

355
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,820
Men are unreliable.

356
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,020
We can only count on ourselves.

357
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,210
Mother, do you mean...

358
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:59,460
I'll help you to be the master of the Blue Dome of Heaven.

359
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,620
Mother, are you going to kill the gods?

360
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,840
Are you crazy?

361
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,349
Zhao'er. Zhao'er.

362
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,999
Since your feelings for Bai Jue are gone,

363
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,060
why don't we take a gamble?

364
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,940
Let me go. No!

365
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,879
- Let me go. 
 - Zhao'er.

366
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,560
If I'm not fully confident of winning,

367
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,080
how could I risk both of our lives?

368
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,109
 What is going on today? 

369
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,299
 He drinks and even calls dancers. 

370
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,900
 Abnormal, very abnormal. 

371
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,780
 Did Master and Mu Guang collude in advance? 

372
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,519
 A trap. 

373
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,559
 This banquet must be a trap. 

374
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,189
 They want to please me 

375
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,380
 and then persuade me to retreat. 

376
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,850
 I'm quite hungry. 

377
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,740
 Disgusting. Don't look at him. 

378
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,589
The braised pork is fat but not greasy, really nice.

379
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,850
How can you say that?

380
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,350
Master.

381
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,179
I just want to say that both the demons

382
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:18,340
and immortals cultivate to improve spiritual power.

383
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,560
People of the Demon Clan are just aiming to cultivate their power.

384
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,409
Right, their behavior is a little bit aggressive.

385
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:29,219
 For the nice wine's sake, I'll endure. 

386
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:32,238
If the Immortal Clan can withdraw their troops first

387
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:35,519
and lend us the land of the Immortal Realm to cultivate,

388
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,478
we, the Demon Clan, would be better off.

389
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:40,319
Dream on!

390
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,478
The immortals and demons are the same.

391
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:46,899
Now, the Immortal Clan occupies areas with abundant spiritual power.

392
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,459
But we, the Demon Clan, have to cultivate on bitter cold land.

393
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:51,379
This is unfair.

394
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,400
The land of the three realms should be occupied by the capable ones.

395
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,560
It's been the rule since time immemorial.

396
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,690
If you are not convinced, bring your soldiers to occupy them.

397
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,080
You...

398
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,599
Demon Emperor. Heavenly King. Don't speak while drunk.

399
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,589
The war will lead to injuries and deaths.

400
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,679
How about each of us stepping back?

401
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,260
If so, the Demon Clan should take action first.

402
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,840
Why should we both retreat? Remember that you're from the Demon Clan.

403
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,478
Your Majesties, please enjoy yourselves while drinking.

404
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:33,198
This small dragon needs to relieve himself.

405
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:34,660
Wait!

406
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,189
You deceived me a thousand spirit beads and said that you would help me speak. Do you deny?

407
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,979
 If there is a master, there must be a slave. 
 (T/N: They are of the same kind.) 

408
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:44,198
Demon Emperor.

409
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:46,279
What are you murmuring with the Dragon Lord?

410
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,358
Just speak it aloud.

411
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:50,318
Fine, let me be frank.

412
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,518
Master Bai Jue, Three-Head just complained to me

413
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,980
that cultivating in the Swamp of Netherhill is really hard.

414
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,239
But now he has changed his mind.

415
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,639
I think there must be someone who is threatening him.

416
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,240
Sen Yu.

417
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,838
Don't forget that you are a junior.

418
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:10,359
And also, don't forget where you are now.

419
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,759
Aren't we in the Blue Dome of Heaven?

420
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,700
A place that hides filth, snakes, and rats.

421
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:23,538
The True God indulges in drinking, and his sacred beast takes bribes.

422
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:25,359
Two clans include the same and exclude the difference.

423
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,540
Is this the new rule that was set in the past 60,000 years while I slept?

424
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,060
Master.

425
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,500
You may withdraw.

426
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,560
 Yes. 

427
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,198
I've formally greet you as an apprentice, Master Bai Jue.

428
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,069
If you like girls pouring wine for you,

429
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,740
I should help as your apprentice.

430
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,879
Here, Master Bai Jue.

431
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,119
To my master.

432
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,489
Why?

433
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:09,320
You'd rather accept the dancers' wine than mine?

434
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,309
This wine...

435
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,660
This wine hates the most heartless men.

436
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,379
If a heartless man drinks it, he'll die.

437
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:27,939
What's wrong?

438
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,139
Are you also a heartless man, Master Bai Jue?

439
00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:34,239
It's okay. I can make an antidote for you.

440
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,530
It won't take too long.

441
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,360
Just 60,000 years.

442
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:47,199
Is it funny to see me as a fool?

443
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:50,080
Bai Jue, are you not sincere?

444
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,759
Did Yuan Qi's mom make the wound on your chest?

445
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,078
Why do you think so?

446
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,698
If I were her, I'd hurt you as well.

447
00:29:58,698 --> 00:30:00,559
You aren't sincere to Jing Zhao,

448
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,700
and you weren't sincere to Yuan Qi's mother, either.

449
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,400
And you treat your own son even more cruelly.

450
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,598
I laughed at my foolishness

451
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,579
of hoping to be someone who could match you

452
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:15,379
when I was in the Netherworld.

453
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:23,000
Stop drinking.

454
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,180
I was so eager to see you when I woke up.

455
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,179
I wanted to tell you what I experienced

456
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,780
in the Netherworld 60,000 years ago.

457
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,080
What about you?

458
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,358
Two ridiculous marriages,

459
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:42,619
and a son who hates you so much.

460
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,379
And your ruthlessness.

461
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,060
How should I face you when you act like this?

462
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,259
How should I deal with my love for you?

463
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,560
My feelings for you accumulated little by little.

464
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,780
Now they are all been taken away by you.

465
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,019
Is this what you wanted to see the most?

466
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,559
Congratulations.

467

 ♫ What's in my mind is what I can't get over ♫ 

468

476

Be careful, Chief God. Mind your step.

477
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,079
Don't follow me, I'm not drunk.

478
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,239
This small dragon won't spill out what happened today to others.

479
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:10,110
You're shrewd enough. Of course, I trust you.

480
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,039
I heard that you received 1,000 spiritual beads from someone.

481
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,000
- 2,000. 
 - What?

482
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,289
Half from Mu Guang. The other from Sen Yu.

483
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,630
No wonder you let me attend.

484
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,519
You and Bai Jue are a perfect match.

485
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,780
Thanks for your praise, Chief God.

486
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,400
Jing Zhao greets Master Shang Gu.

487
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,330
Have you forgotten what I told you on Observation Mountain?

488
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:37,959
I'm humble so I shouldn't have appeared in front of you.

489
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:41,029
However, there's something I have been thinking about for a long time.

490
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:44,109
And I think you should know it, Chief God.

491
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,929
Your Highness, what are you doing?

492
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:49,820
Haven't you forgotten Master Bai Jue's order?

493
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,459
Master Shang Gu is wise.

494
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,499
So even if I don't tell you, you must have been in doubt long before.

495
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:02,060
Did I guess incorrectly?

496
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,470
Master Bai Jue, Princess Jing Zhao went to see Master Shang Gu.

497
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:35,600
 Master, the three realms are yours. 

498
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,109
 But Jing Zhao has Master Bai Jue only. 

499
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,799
 I beg you to leave Master Bai Jue 

500
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,060
 and the Blue Dome of Heaven. 

501
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,100
 If you agree, 

502
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,760
 I'll tell you everything. 

503
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,559
 Are you using my curiosity to blackmail me with? 

504
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,750
 I dare not. 

505
00:33:52,800 --> 00:34:01,000
 I just want to use the story of Qing Mu and Hou Chi, and Master Bai Jue's past, in exchange for your grace. 

506
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:05,940
 Please fulfill my selfish motive. 

507
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,839
 I don't need anyone else to talk about my affairs with him. 

508
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,470
 I shouldn't have come today. 

509
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,869
I've never seen you so anxious like you are today.

510
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,359
What's the matter?

511
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,709
Is there anything you don't want me to see here?

512
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,229
Or are you afraid of Jing Zhao telling me anything?

513
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,369
I'll tell you what you want to know.

514
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:30,799
Fine.

515
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,380
Tell me then. What is the relationship between Hou Chi and me?

516
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,300
Who is Qing Mu?

517
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,069
The God Realm was sealed. You couldn't be involved.

518
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:41,839
And I was badly injured and fell asleep, too.

519
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,570
My body generated Qing Mu in the North Sea.

520
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,869
So you are Qing Mu and I'm Hou Chi?

521
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:48,469
Qing Mu has long been wiped out.

522
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,499
I won't recognize that humble body of an immortal.

523
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,000
Hou Chi lived in the Qingchi Palace and met Qing Mu.

524
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,219
They fell in love and got married in the Human Realm.

525
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,800
- So, Yuan Qi is our... 
 - Not ours.

526
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,200
He is their son.

527
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,430
You know it clearly!

528
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,530
Qing Mu and Hou Chi are just normal immortals.

529
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,149
Now that we have awoken,

530
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,999
they no longer exist.

531
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,769
Of course, their love should disappear.

532
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,050
Were you injured by Yuan Qi's mom?

533
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,279
Nice job.

534
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,929
Yes, she did give a nice stab so that with the wound

535
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:26,050
I have nothing to owe that couple.

536
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,260
Don't you feel any guilt towards them?

537
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,290
Yes or no, the result has been settled.

538
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,090
Why should you care?

539
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,630
Why did you hide this from me?

540
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,580
I didn't want to deceive you.

541
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,389
It was just not important to me. I didn't want to mention it, either.

542
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,970
Not important? No need to mention it?

543
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,960
Has Tian Qi told you

544
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,220
that for 60,000 years, Hou Chi called Gu Jun as Father God?

545
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:57,860
Gu Jun loved Hou Chi so much that he even died for her.

546
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,289
Tian Qi told me that Gu Jun was in the God Realm.

547
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,759
Why did Tian Qi lie to me?

548
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,210
What do you think?

549
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,020
He thinks it's not important and no need to mention it.

550
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,050
Now that you've woken up, you should cultivate hard to recover soon.

551
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,670
The past story is not important.

552
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,819
Now I don't have to give myself any more reasons.

553
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:27,800
You have indeed changed.

554
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,369
Although you seemed cold before, your heart was warm.

555
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:35,219
When you talked about the three realms and justice,

556
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:37,780
you wouldn't be regarded as false and aloof.

557
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:42,329
But now, you're heartless and merciless.

558
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,120
Don't talk about all the living beings.

559
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,359
I always take the lives of the three realms as my task.

560
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,970
This will never be changed.

561
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,570
It's fine if you don't want to continue our love,

562
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,519
but Yuan Qi is just a child.

563
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,519
You dumped him in Qingchi Palace

564
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,149
and let him know at his young age

565
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,260
that he is detested and rejected by his father.

566
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,189
How should he handle himself in the future?

567
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,760
Didn't I make myself clear?

568
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,210
I despise the love between Qing Mu and Hou Chi.

569
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:14,699
Their love story is a kind of mistake to me.

570
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,039
Yuan Qi is the result of that mistake.

571
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,809
Every time I see him,

572
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:22,269
I have to recall that unbearable past.

573
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,020
What a True God you are, Bai Jue.

574
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,970
Good job, master of the three realms.

575
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,390
I'll tell Yuan Qi.

576
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,220
His father is the Lord of the North Sea, Qing Mu.

577
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,070
But you don't deserve it.

578
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:46,509
You and I don't need to meet or miss each other.

579
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:57,440
 ♫ How many memories are written for you ♫

 You're a True God Bai Jue. 

585

 I don't want to see you again. 

591
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,669
 Let's wipe out all our grievances today. 

592
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:53,470
 After that, we have no more connection.

 Shang Gu, I've taken your memory after the Netherworld. 

595
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,700
 Therefore, you won't know what the Doom of Chaos is.

600

 It's best to wake up after the doom. 

601
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,870
 Whatever, I'll be with you every day. 

602
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,920
 Shang Gu. 

603
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,240
 Yuan Qi looks like me, 

604
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,200
 but his character is like yours. 

605
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,500
 You will like him and treat him well. 

606
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,849
 Sister Feng Ran. 

607
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:07,949
 Haven't you gone to the Human Realm 

608
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,980
 to watch the opera with Jing Jian? 

609
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,620
 I knew it, Sister Feng Ran. 

610
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,599
 You wouldn't leave me alone, would you? 

611
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,850
 Of course, I would never leave you... 

612
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,020
 and your mother, too. 

613
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,709
 Tell me. Where do you want to go? 

614
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,520
 I'll go with you. 

615
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,650
 I want to go to the Human Realm, too. 

616
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,359
 Your mother liked going to the Lower Realm for fun the most. 

617
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
 What would she enjoy there? 

618
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:42,559
 Have delicious food. Play poker and fly kites. 

619
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:45,240
 Yuan Qi wants to play them, too. 

620
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,739
 But you can't think about playing only. 

621
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:48,839
 Have you read these days? 

622
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,400
 Yes, the Classic of Mountains and Seas. 

623
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,139
 This kind of ancient book is hard to understand, which needs your persistent hard work. 

624
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:54,858
 Got it? 

625
00:40:54,858 --> 00:40:59,538
 Sister Feng Ran, why are you speaking so strangely today? 

626
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:01,979
 Can't I ask? 

627
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:03,460
 Of course you can. 

628
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,339
 Sister Feng Ran, I'm hungry. 

629
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:10,338
 Let's go now before it's too late, or my third uncle will find us. 

630
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:11,750
 Okay. 

631
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,640
 Let's go.

 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

645
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,832
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

646
00:43:19,832 --> 00:43:26,843
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

647
00:43:26,844 --> 00:43:33,233
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

648
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:39,754
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

649
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:50,233
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
