1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000


2
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:21,200
   

3
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,020
   

4
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,920
How did I fall asleep?

5
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:40,431
I kissed him?

6
00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:43,390
Impossible!

7
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:45,900
I won't believe it.

8
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,970
Where's Bai Jue?

9
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,160
It's still warm.

10
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,004
He seems to be cold but actually pretty caring.

11
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,990
Wu Xi!

12
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:25,019
Master Bai Jue, it's the battle of the Lower Realm.

13
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,726
You should tackle it fairly, so how can you help the Phoenix Clan?

14
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:31,689
If you really want to be fair, you can go to her region to challenge her.

15
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:36,093
How can you mention justice to me as you hid and waited to attack her?

16
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,019
Immortals live in Nanhai.

17
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,504
You're from a large race with many gods, so why do you still use so many despicable actions?

18
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:46,369
If you dare to intrude here again,

19
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,004
I won't mind getting round to killing your clans.

20
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:53,450
Let's retreat!

21
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:59,172
Do you still want a fight?

22
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:04,437
I've made a vow that I'd protect her at all costs, including my life.

23
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:06,579
Wu Xi!

24
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,072
Reluctant.

25
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:09,772
Wu Xi!

26
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,394
Why did you come?

27
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:13,590
I let Feng Yan off.

28
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:18,390
It's all my fault.

29
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,799
Let them leave.

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,654
You're a Chief God. Acting impetuously will do harm to the Three Realms.

31
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:27,050
Do you know how dangerous they are?

32
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,250
You're not helping them. You're harming them.

33
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,943
Maybe there's another way to solve it?

34
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:36,269
Maybe we don't have to kill him.

35
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,100
When you stop, you will suffer from chaos!

36
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,030
Feng Yan, you're the Phoenix monarch.

37
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,020
I'll take your core spirit back to the Phoenix Clan.

38
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:49,921
Well, you... Do you regret what you've done?

39
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:54,111
Stealing Feng Yan’s core is the most incorrect thing I have ever done;

40
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:56,622
anyway, I've never regretted it.

41
00:03:56,622 --> 00:04:01,465
If I don’t go this way, I don’t think I’d have known how much Yan'er loves me for the rest of my life.

42
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:06,200
If one day, you confront the same situation as ours,

43
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:10,499
I'm sure you'll make the same decision.

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,680
Stop the nonsense! Otherwise, I'll execute you at once!

45
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:20,965
Master Bai Jue, I know he should be executed for making such a huge mistake.

46
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,011
Anyway, he just wanted to save me.

47
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:27,069
Actually, it was I who disobeyed the will of my ancestors and didn’t want to be an ancient beast,

48
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,987
I also tricked Wuxi into stealing the core that brought about the bitter fruit of today.

49
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:34,487
- Thousands of mistakes, all wrong belong to me alone. 
 - Yan'er!

50
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:37,989
I promise I'll devote my soul to Your Royal Highness to make amends after rebirth.

51
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:40,520
Please spare his life.

52
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:48,380
As she's entirely responsible for it, that's another matter.

53
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,959
As you all know that Master Bai Jue is impartial and strict,

54
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,940
I'm sure he'll give you a fair judgment.

55
00:04:59,944 --> 00:05:01,420
Fine.

56
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,676
If you can do so after rebirth, I'll spare his life.

57
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:17,879
Yan'er.

58
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:21,440
If I can live again,

59
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:25,180
I hope I won't be the Phoenix monarch.

60
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,020
Yan'er.

61
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:38,660
I want to be your Feng Yan.

62
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:49,180
Yan'e!

63
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,680
Yan'er!

64
00:05:57,766 --> 00:06:01,955
Yan'er! Yan'er!

65
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:07,500
Yan'er! Don't...

66
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,921
Yan'er!

67
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:11,488
Don't leave me!

68
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:13,100
Yan'er!

69
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:18,380
Yan'er!

70
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:44,560
Shang Gu!

71
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,340
Don't kill him.

72
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,280
Don't talk anymore.

73
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:57,980
I'll bring you to the Phoenix Clan.

74
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:04,609
I heard Master Bai Jue brought Royal Highness back.

75
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,643
It seems she was seriously injured and now in the guest room.

76
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:09,810
Should we go to serve her?

77
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:12,099
Wu Xi hurt her!

78
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,319
We're all in a dangerous situation.

79
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,176
What if we can't serve her well and Master Bai Jue vents his anger on us?

80
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,276
You're right. We should save our own feathers first.

81
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:23,920
It's not the time to push ourselves forward.

82
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,188
Excuse me, Miss. There is something I want to ask.

83
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:30,188
Can you tell me whether Her Royal Highness needs anyone to serve her? 
    

84
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:34,254
Wu Huan? Shouldn't you look after spiritual herbs? Why do you come here?

85
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:38,730
Even if there's no one to nurse her, it still won't be your turn.

86
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,260
I'm just worried about her.

87
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,100
Why are you pretending to be kind at this time?

88
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,950
She's right. You're just a five-colored phoenix.

89
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,630
How dare you want to approach Chief God?

90
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:50,521
Do you still remember who you are?

91
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:51,980
Let's go.

92
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:08,799
Elder, why is Wu Xi's divine power so weird?

93
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:12,088
Why can't I cure her?

94
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:15,099
He's an Ancestral Wutong.

95
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,311
He used all his power to make his final attack.

96
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:22,499
It contains the Power of Ash Fire.

97
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,699
Your core power belongs to fire.

98
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,411
That's why you can't heal her.

99
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:29,654
I'll let Tian Qi...

100
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:31,620
He can't either.

101
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,987
Only the Phoenix monarch can dissolve it.

102
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:37,499
If a monarch is reborn, then we'll know what to do.

103
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,676
 - But now... 
 - So what should we do now? 

104
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:43,000
I can't let her meet with a mishap!

105
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:47,965
Don't worry. There's another way to save her life.

106
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:49,359
What is it?

107
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:53,710
There's a treasure called the Hydraulic Bead in the God Realm.

108
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,166
It's from Ancestral God and can heal everything.

109
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:03,700
Maybe it can dissolve the Ash Fire.

110
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:07,846
I know where it is. I'll go and fetch it.

111
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,160
Ice Cube Bai...

112
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,100
It hurts...

113
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:17,300
It hurts...

114
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:37,987
 Wu Huan, you must change your life. 

115
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,255
Who are you?

116
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,722
My name is Wu Huan.

117
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:55,243
I know our race has made a big mistake so I hoped I could come to serve Her Royal Highness.

118
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:57,977
Absurd! Do you know where you are?

119
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:00,360
How can you enter here?

120
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:06,332
Master Bai Jue, she must feel that her heart is being burned now.

121
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:12,078
We could use the water from Chilly Pool to reduce her pain.

122
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,320
Take care of her.

123
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,365
Yes, Master. I will take good care of her.

124
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:32,233
Fine.

125
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:36,987
As he's allowed you to stay here, then look after her with all your heart.

126
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:38,820
Yes.

127
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:05,899
I hope you can lend me the treasure and I'll send you a gift later on.

128
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,454
I'd like to help you with no gifts.

129
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:12,454
Anyway, it was granted by Master Zhi Yang

130
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:17,699
after the war between the gods and devils, so it's priceless for me.

131
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:20,755
Could I know your usage?

132
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,440
Save someone's life.

133
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:25,833
Is it for Her Royal Highness?

134
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,940
She's been hurt by Ash Fire.

135
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,980
You've never asked for my help for these past hundreds of thousand years.

136
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,254
I've never thought you would ask for my help for her.

137
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:42,499
Can I ask you one question?

138
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:50,579
Do you want to command me to give you the bead or ask for my help?

139
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:55,510
Say what you mean. How can you lend me the bead?

140
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,550
I only have one request.

141
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,940
I hope I can be your apprentice, staying with you.

142
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:32,254
You finally come back. I can't control her wound now.

143
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:35,119
It becomes more and more serious.

144
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:38,230
- Do you get the Hydraulic Bead? 
 - Yes.

145
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,210
Okay. Then please heal her.

146
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:44,260
Wu Huan, leave with me.

147
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:56,720
I hope you can be safe.

148
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,180
Ice Cube Bai.

149
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,554
Your Royal Highness! You have finally woken up.

150
00:14:32,144 --> 00:14:34,140
Who are you?

151
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:38,660
I'm Wu Huan, a member of the Phoenix Clan.

152
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,649
We're now in Wutong Forest.

153
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:45,243
Yesterday, Wu Xi hurt you and True God brought you back.

154
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:46,676
How is Wu Xi?

155
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,187
True God executed him.

156
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,900
What?

157
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,780
Your Royal Highness!

158
00:14:53,411 --> 00:14:55,632
It's just a skin trauma.

159
00:14:55,633 --> 00:15:00,499
Feng Yan only cared about Wu Xi so why must he kill him?

160
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,440
Where's he?

161
00:15:03,788 --> 00:15:05,671
I don't know.

162
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:09,410
You've just recovered. Please calm down.

163
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,855
If I had known,

164
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:14,044
I wouldn't have come here to choose.

165
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:18,154
I've broken up a couple and one of them was killed.

166
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:23,419
Your Royal Highness, it's a matter between Gods and Phoenixes.

167
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:25,699
It's decided by Ancestral God.

168
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,280
Don't blame yourself too much.

169
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,832
Ancestral God meant the sacred beast should come from the Phoenix Clan.

170
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,676
He didn't say it must be Feng Yan.

171
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:37,266
Bai Jue.

172
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:39,460
What is still ailing you?

173
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,611
We promised Feng Yan that we would not kill Wu Xi.

174
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:46,021
As you've killed him, what do we tell Feng Yan?

175
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,455
You can leave first.

176
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:51,180
Yes.

177
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:01,299
Have you cooled down?

178
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:02,640
No.

179
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:08,054
I promised you I would only abolish all his power.

180
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,240
I knew I'd misunderstood you.

181
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:16,676
You've just recovered. Don't act randomly.

182
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,076
The only thing you have to do is to choose your sacred beast.

183
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:24,380
Then the trouble can be blown over.

184
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:31,159
The girl who just looked after me seems to be a humble phoenix of the clan.

185
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:34,710
Phoenixes usually classify themselves by their origin.

186
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:39,510
I think many humble phoenixes envy Feng Yan's noble background

187
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,721
because she can be a sacred beast.

188
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:43,432
I think Wu Huan is the same.

189
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,400
You want to choose her?

190
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,776
Yes. If I choose her, then the rest of them will know that

191
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:54,040
I act fairly to all living beings

192
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,632
and I won't encourage their false notion.

193
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,400
By the way,

194
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:05,576
if I choose her, will the elders of the clan reproach it?

195
00:17:05,576 --> 00:17:07,430
Of course, they will.

196
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:14,798
So you need to find a surefire plan to subdue them and get their faith and help.

197
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:19,987
What are they?

198
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:25,199
Left is the true and right is the fake. It's all up to you.

199
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:34,820
You'd prepared for it!

200
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:40,569
I've never thought of it. You're so awesome! I respect you so much.

201
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:43,060
I don't like getting so close to you.

202
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:49,860
It's much closer when you hug me...

203
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,960
 ♫ Time is like you, disturbing my feelings and thoughts ♫ 

204
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:10,249
 ♫ I hold your warm hands tightly ♫ 

205
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,633
 ♫ The meteor is shining in the sky ♫ 

206
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:22,780
 ♫ I can never forget the memories of you ♫ 

207
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:30,540
What's wrong?

208
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:35,776
What's wrong? What bad luck!

209
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:41,599
Last night, I had a dream the cute flower that I'd grown for quite some time was picked by a pig.

210
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:46,887
Is there a pig in the God Realm? If there is, it must be a divine pig.

211
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:49,143
Of course, it's a god.

212
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:51,200
It's Ice Cube...

213
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,160
Don't drink too much.

214
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:57,121
You're right.

215
00:18:57,122 --> 00:19:03,976
Since they came back from the Netherworld, their relationship has changed.

216
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,600
I'm worried about her.

217
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,040
Why?

218
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,140
I'm worried Shang Gu won't belong to me.

219
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,099
She doesn't belong to you.

220
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,340
How doesn't she?

221
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,876
Before Bai Jue came back, she followed me every day!

222
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:28,920
However, now she can only see Bai Jue.

223
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,165
If I'd known it, I wouldn't have let him be her master.

224
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,610
It's her decision. What do you take her for?

225
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,600
Your child bride?

226
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,700
Why do you change the meaning? You say whatever you like.

227
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,360
It's my right to speak as I want.

228
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,860
If you don't want to hear me, you can go somewhere else.

229
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:47,587
Have you taken the wrong medicines?

230
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:51,260
There's medicine in the wine too, so don't drink it.

231
00:19:52,588 --> 00:19:54,111
Unreasonable.

232
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:59,138
Just stay here angrily and I'm going to the Lower Realm to replace him now.

233
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:01,743
I can't let them be together.

234
00:20:01,744 --> 00:20:04,299
It's important for them to chase Feng Yan's core spirit!

235
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,720
Don't make more trouble, okay?

236
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,099
It's my responsibility to help the Phoenixes.

237
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,126
Tian Qi.

238
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:18,519
If Shang Gu dislikes staying with Bai Jue, she'd leave herself.

239
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:22,643
It's their own business so why do you bother with it?

240
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:28,333
Then don't try to bother our matter.

241
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,860
I...

242
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,300
If you leave, don't come back anymore.

243
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,987
He looks like both a god and a demon.

244
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:53,740
I really like his appearance.

245
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,022
- Elder Feng Yun. 
 - Your Royal Highness.

246
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:12,300
Here's Feng Yan's core spirit.

247
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:17,155
Please take good care of it,

248
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:19,520
and give it to her when she comes back.

249
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,710
Yes, I've received your command.

250
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,444
I think you all know

251
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:32,020
that I'm here to find a sacred beast to stay with me.

252
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,829
There are some days for the Phoenix monarch's rebirth

253
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:38,276
so I want to choose a humble phoenix

254
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:41,520
to be my sacred beast first.

255
00:21:42,322 --> 00:21:46,810
How could a humble phoenix be worthy of Your Highness?

256
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:48,498
If you agree with it,

257
00:21:48,498 --> 00:21:52,777
I won't investigate the responsibility for losing the core spirit.

258
00:21:52,777 --> 00:21:56,680
Wu Huan, come over here.

259
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:06,922
Would you like to be my sacred beast for a thousand years?

260
00:22:06,922 --> 00:22:09,440
Let's go to the God Realm together.

261
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,220
Your Royal Highness...

262
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:14,965
are you sure?

263
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,444
How could I joke about it on this occasion?

264
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:19,900
I...

265
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:22,900
I'd like to!

266
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:29,443
I hope that no matter what your background is,

267
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:33,059
as long as you have the virtue and are able to practice,

268
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:36,632
you can be put in an important position from now on.

269
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:39,380
 Your Highness is lenient! 

270
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:45,240
I hope no one will find out the core spirit of the Phoenix monarch is fake.

271
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:51,020
Her real core spirit sits upon a flower

272
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,566
and the body of Wu Xi turned into a Wutong.

273
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:57,322
If they can wait, they still have a chance to meet.

274
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:01,438
 Superior syrup! 

275
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:03,698
I know you want to invite me to wonton.

276
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:05,054
 Come and have a look! 

277
00:23:05,055 --> 00:23:08,180
I'm hungry from walking for so long.

278
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,440
 Have a look! 

279
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,840
 Scented syrup! 

280
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,554
Sir, two bowls of wonton.

281
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:21,177
Okay.

282
00:23:21,177 --> 00:23:23,011
Wu Huan, won't you eat?

283
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:24,058
I'm not hungry.

284
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:28,019
Besides, wontons are nothing but ordinary things to little gods like me,

285
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,580
so just let me serve you to have them.

286
00:23:34,711 --> 00:23:36,580
Here you are.

287
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:47,044
The Immortal Realm is quite interesting.

288
00:23:47,044 --> 00:23:50,100
They would call the food "wonton."

289
00:23:50,877 --> 00:23:55,060
I think its fate is to be eaten by me.

290
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,665
Tasty! So delicious!

291
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:05,020
Its taste is amazing chaos.

292
00:24:12,211 --> 00:24:13,899
I caught you!

293
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,511
You dare to eat the Chief God.

294
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:18,680
How should I punish you according to the laws of the gods?

295
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,120
So boring.

296
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,000
She's the sacred beast you chose?

297
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:51,177
Everyone in the God Realm hears her things!

298
00:24:51,177 --> 00:24:53,299
What an uncanny story!

299
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:55,959
Wu Huan, you're now my sacred beast

300
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:58,709
and now you're a member of Pilgrim Hall.

301
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:01,000
No matter how you're bullied in the clan,

302
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,866
you should be confident and practice here from now on.

303
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:06,311
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

304
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:08,999
There are many people in the God Realm who look down upon me as a Chief God

305
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:11,999
and you're a miscellaneous little phoenix who was also looked down upon by many people.

306
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:14,143
Let's practice hard in the future.

307
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:16,187
We will let those bastards look at us!

308
00:25:16,188 --> 00:25:18,119
Aren't you happy?

309
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,254
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

310
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:22,010
You get along well with each other.

311
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:24,822
Maybe it could be true.

312
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:26,249
You always neglect practicing

313
00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:27,610
and only focus on gossip.

314
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:29,400
Maybe your Immortal Tracking Bell is broken.

315
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,854
I've just checked it. It's still good.

316
00:25:32,854 --> 00:25:35,509
Your Royal Highness!

317
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:38,209
Xue Ying swaggered into Abyss Hall. I can't stop her.

318
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,070
Won't she fear being punished by Bai Jue?

319
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,987
I'm here just to tell you about this.

320
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:43,810
That she's now Bai Jue's apprentice.

321
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:45,387
Everyone knows it.

322
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:47,179
- Impossible! 
 - It's true!

323
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,180
And she said Master Bai Jue agreed with it.

324
00:26:06,088 --> 00:26:08,066
 I've waited for years 

325
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,240
 and I can finally get in here. 

326
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,780
 From now on, I can stay with him day and night. 

327
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:19,200
 I must catch an opportunity. 

328
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:30,088
 Do you remember when we first met in Plum Blossom Garden? 

329
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,987
 You said to me 

330
00:26:31,988 --> 00:26:34,810
 "The plum blossom is waiting for the snow." 

331
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:38,560
 I still remember it till now. 

332
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,420
Greetings to Master Shang Gu.

333
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,759
Master Bai Jue said you can't come in here.

334
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,755
Hong Ri, see her out.

335
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:51,054
Don't you know?

336
00:26:51,055 --> 00:26:53,365
Master Bai Jue has decided to take me in.

337
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:57,476
From now on, I'll live in Abyss Hall and practice with you.

338
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:58,565
Live in Abyss Hall?

339
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:00,180
Who said so?

340
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,543
Here's his instruction feather.

341
00:27:03,544 --> 00:27:06,400
Can you recognize it?

342
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:13,380
I won't believe it until he tells me.

343
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:17,133
Is it your business to bother his things?

344
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:18,365
You don't care about affairs

345
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:19,819
so why do you care about his matter?

346
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:22,100
Don't you think you put the cart before the horse?

347
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,632
I've heard that Your Royal Highness doesn't like practicing.

348
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:32,699
You just have the title but do nothing.

349
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:36,233
If so, you can go out to play as you want.

350
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:39,240
Why do you have to come here to torture yourself?

351
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:44,476
After all, not everyone can be his disciple!

352
00:27:44,477 --> 00:27:48,187
Some incapable guys should leave here as early as possible.

353
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:50,777
Otherwise, they'll stain his fame and bring shame upon themselves!

354
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:52,276
Finally to become a joke in the God Realm!

355
00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:54,119
Xue Ying, you force me to do this!

356
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,620
Emperor Sword!

357
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,299
Do you want to leave yourself

358
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,700
or be sent by my sword?

359
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,300
I've never thought Your Highness could be so powerful when angered.

360
00:28:22,677 --> 00:28:25,779
It seems you've carried out your joke.

361
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:29,140
You did dismantle my hall after learning skills.

362
00:28:29,966 --> 00:28:31,809
Greetings to Master Bai Jue.

363
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,800
Bai Jue! Explain it to me!

364
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,955
Shang Gu, from now on, you'll practice together.

365
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,522
So many gods are here

366
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,711
so why must you choose her?

367
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:48,680
Hydraulic Bead.

368
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,640
Goddess Xue Ying, because of anger, offended Her Royal Highness.

369
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,232
Goddess of Snow, if you can find another trick to play,

370
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:58,522
maybe Master could think highly of you a little.

371
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:00,800
Don't do it again.

372
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,660
Whoever dares to stir up trouble will be punished by me.

373
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,960
As I can stay with him every day, how can I not surpass you?

374
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,100
Wait and see.

375
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,560
Your Royal Highness.

376
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,410
Selection Day will be here soon.

377
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:58,920
Master Zhi Yang asked the gods to send you some banquet gowns.

378
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,880
Throw them out! All these white clothes!

379
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,044
Do you dislike my choices?

380
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:11,687
No.  I'm just angry seeing them.

381
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:23,476
She's just an apprentice. Not his wife.

382
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:25,260
So why are you in a rage?

383
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,699
He knows I hate Xue Ying and still apprentices her.

384
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,400
Just because of a Hydraulic Bead?

385
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,779
I can return the favor myself.

386
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:36,200
He must treat you as his family.

387
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,120
Who wants to be his relative...

388
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,721
You like finding teachers?

389
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:48,400
Then I'll satisfy her wishes.

390
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,644
Yesterday, Her Royal Highness left angrily.

391
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:07,420
I think she won't come today.

392
00:31:24,922 --> 00:31:26,365
Your Royal Highness.

393
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:28,099
Your Royal Highness is so pretty today.

394
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,743
Nonsense. When am I not pretty?

395
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,420
Don't come late tomorrow.

396
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,255
Besides, it's still cold in Spring.

397
00:31:38,255 --> 00:31:40,320
Put on more clothes next time.

398
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,409
Don't just talk about me, what about her? Look at your apprentice's clothes.

399
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,800
Is it summer now?

400
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,160
Goddess of Snow, you look so cool.

401
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,266
Are you kidding me? I dislike heat.

402
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:57,743
As you could use a Hydraulic Bead to be his student,

403
00:31:57,744 --> 00:32:01,740
you must be studious. Right?

404
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,209
Zhi Yang sent me all these books.

405
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:12,099
I'm now to give them to you.

406
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,580
To return your favor.

407
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:17,499
Thanks, Your Royal Highness.

408
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,054
You need to read with a peaceful mind.

409
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:21,009
You also know my temper,

410
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,943
I will definitely disturb you if you stay in Abyss Hall.

411
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:26,311
So I suggest that Goddess Xue bring them back to her hall.

412
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,555
Stay alone and learn them patiently.

413
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:29,632
Tell me when you finish.

414
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:31,711
I still have plenty of books.

415
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:33,319
Don't be too polite.

416
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:37,020
But I've already read them all.

417
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,354
Are you bragging?

418
00:32:39,354 --> 00:32:41,387
You don't believe it?

419
00:32:41,388 --> 00:32:43,476
Fine, it's reasonable.

420
00:32:43,477 --> 00:32:45,643
It's hard for you to read them all.

421
00:32:45,643 --> 00:32:46,876
Don't look down upon me.

422
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:49,900
Of course, I've read them all.

423
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,899
As you've read them all, I won't lend them to you.

424
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:55,300
Hold on.

425
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,099
"Classic of Mountains and Seas."

426
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,933
Though it includes all seas and mountains, it's hard to understand.

427
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:07,654
It looks quite new,

428
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:09,860
so have you really read it?

429
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:12,755
Of course, I have.

430
00:33:12,755 --> 00:33:15,000
It's just the "Classic of Mountains and Seas."

431
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:18,600
When shall we start?

432
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,898
As both of you've read it, let me test you.

433
00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:31,200
Xue Ying.

434
00:33:32,688 --> 00:33:34,430
Yes.

435
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,222
It says there's a creature born above West Sea.

436
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:40,869
It has a fine gloss. Its shape is the same as allium. What's its name?

437
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:42,866
The herb is called "Zhu Yu."

438
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:43,988
What's its use?

439
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,488
It can fill the stomach.

440
00:33:45,488 --> 00:33:49,029
The head of northern mountains is called "Fox Mountain." Go 250 li north from it.

441
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,365
It's called "Qiu Ru Mountain."

442
00:33:50,366 --> 00:33:53,700
- It's covered in jade with no vegetation. 
 - That's right.

443
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,920
Shang Gu.

444
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,121
Go ahead.

445
00:33:57,122 --> 00:34:00,540
You can ask me anything about this book.  There is nothing I can't answer.

446
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,466
The head of northern mountains is called "Fox Mountain."

447
00:34:04,466 --> 00:34:07,588
Go 300 li north from it. What's next?

448
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:09,488
 Fortunately, I'd prepared for it. 

449
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:12,499
Go 150 kilometers north from it. It's...

450
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,154
"Classic of Mountains and Seas"!

451
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:16,343
Hurry!

452
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:18,400
It's here.

453
00:34:20,022 --> 00:34:22,180
Can you answer it?

454
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:31,321
Your Royal Highness. It's called "Dai Mountain." It's covered in jade with a lot of cyan ore below it.

455
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:35,140
It's called "Dai Mountain." It's covered in jade with a lot of cyan ore below it.

456
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:40,840
Goddess of Snow, is that right?

457
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,020
Yes. Quite right.

458
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:47,355
Hong Ri, go and fetch two cups of hot tea.

459
00:34:47,355 --> 00:34:50,100
Yes. I'll fetch for Her Royal Highness at once.

460
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,400
There's an animal from the West Sea.

461
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,710
It's like the monkey and has white ears.

462
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,219
It can walk like humans. What's its name?

463
00:34:58,219 --> 00:34:59,987
It can walk like humans. Its name is...

464
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:04,300
- Oh, my goodness! Where is it? 
 - I can't find it.

465
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,187
Your Royal Highness, it's at the beginning of the book.

466
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:10,099
You've just said you know it thoroughly by heart,

467
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,632
so don't you know it?

468
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:15,080
- Can't you answer it? 
 - At the beginning...

469
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:18,655
Shang Gu!

470
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:21,720
Its name is Xing Xing. Eating it can enhance walking capabilities.

471
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,980
Its name is Xing Xing. Eating it can enhance walking capabilities.

472
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,832
You really have great learning.

473
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:34,410
So do your earrings.

474
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:37,422
Lying is worse than ignorance!

475
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:39,511
Fine. I see.

476
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:41,355
"Classic of Mountains and Seas" is obscure.

477
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:43,855
lt takes a lot of effort to memorize.

478
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:48,511
Shang Gu, I'll ask you more questions after several days.

479
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:50,432
I see.

480
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:54,011
Next, I'm going to ask something about the management of the three realms.

481
00:35:54,011 --> 00:35:57,200
As the Chief God, you should know them well.

482
00:35:58,477 --> 00:36:03,609
The simplest questions about it should be local customs, astronomy, and geography.

483
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,254
Knowing them can help you deal with the affairs of the three realms appropriately.

484
00:36:07,255 --> 00:36:09,200
So listen to my question carefully.

485
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,122
Tiger Demon lives in Blood Forest all year-round.

486
00:36:12,122 --> 00:36:15,465
As it's barren there, how do they practice?

487
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,654
Tiger Demons are brutal and bloodthirsty,

488
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:22,460
so they must improve themselves by eating others.

489
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,676
Oh, my! Unexpectedly, the Snow God just sits on paper and talks about it. 
  (Doesn't read the facts) 

490
00:36:26,677 --> 00:36:29,032
Tiger Demons carry forward the spirit of solidarity.

491
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:33,476
They start to practice with the help of Demon God Tian Qi's divine power.

492
00:36:33,477 --> 00:36:37,880
Then they inherit and accumulate spiritual power by generation.

493
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,565
As Blood Forest is hot all the year,

494
00:36:39,566 --> 00:36:42,320
I've never been there before.

495
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:45,666
That's why I don't know the reason.

496
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:47,488
Please punish me.

497
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,844
You don't need to be punished.

498
00:36:48,844 --> 00:36:51,910
You just need to know that there's no end to learning.

499
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,919
Don't be complacent.

500
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:56,680
Yes. I'll keep it in my mind.

501
00:36:59,688 --> 00:37:01,160
Your Royal Highness.

502
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,432
Pardon me. I forgot to bring one for you.

503
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,111
However, as you're an icy lady,

504
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:13,800
I think you don't need to warm yourself up by it.

505
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:18,500
Shang Gu. Enough.

506
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,620
You're a Chief God and closely related to the three realms.

507
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,222
You've just recovered. Take care of yourself.

508
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:26,720
I see.

509
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,300
Really?

510
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,600
When did Ice Cube become a warm-hearted man?

511
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,088
You're not telling me a story, right?

512
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:41,520
Come on. How charming am I?

513
00:37:43,277 --> 00:37:44,565
Look at you like this.

514
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:46,939
Could it be that you has full confidence in attracting Bai Jue?

515
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,019
- Eight or nine are not far from ten, right? 
 - 80%?

516
00:37:50,055 --> 00:37:55,380
80%... 70%, 60%, 50%, right?

517
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,765
I think you really fell in love with him.

518
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:01,620
You really fell into him deeply.

519
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:06,676
It's useless for me to keep it. You take it.

520
00:38:08,511 --> 00:38:10,040
Thank you.

521
00:38:25,322 --> 00:38:27,911
 He cared for me a lot at that time. 

522
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:30,177
 I think he likes me too, right? 

523
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:33,380
 But why hasn't he confessed to me? 

524
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,680
   

525
00:38:37,755 --> 00:38:39,480
Oh, I see.

526
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:41,998
Don't be afraid, Ice Cube Bai.

527
00:38:41,998 --> 00:38:44,540
I'll help you out.

528
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:49,379
Xue Ying?

529
00:38:49,379 --> 00:38:52,000
Let me see how you can tangle with him!

530
00:39:00,477 --> 00:39:03,254
Ancestral God! My dear father! Please bless me to succeed!

531
00:39:03,255 --> 00:39:06,420
Otherwise, it'll be vain for Yue Mi being single for years.

532
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,680
Perfect match.

533
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:38,733
Why are you in such a hurry? What's happened?

534
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:40,299
When I asked for your help,

535
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,369
I was worried Shang Gu not being able to take over the position of Chief God at once.

536
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:45,244
The dissipation speed of the Power of Chaos

537
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:47,480
in the Lower Realm is faster than our imagination.

538
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:51,066
As the Power of Chaos scatters,

539
00:39:51,066 --> 00:39:54,111
the barriers and seals everywhere must be damaged.

540
00:39:54,111 --> 00:39:56,810
You should dispatch gods to mend them.

541
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,454
Of course, I know I should.

542
00:39:58,455 --> 00:40:00,476
As it'll be Selection Day tomorrow,

543
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:05,022
leaders who're almost immortals will come to the God Realm to practice.

544
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:09,010
I want to find her a capable apprentice to help her practice.

545
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,610
The reason why I asked you to come is that

546
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:13,500
I want to know when she can take over the position.

547
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,050
She learns fast but only for a few days.

548
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,254
I'm afraid she still needs 10 thousand years.

549
00:40:19,255 --> 00:40:21,766
10 thousand years? No.

550
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:25,254
The longer she needs more time, the more dangerous the Lower Realm will be.

551
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,159
 Master Bai Jue. 

552
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,388
As you've guarded here for days, have you found anything unusual?

553
00:40:39,388 --> 00:40:41,622
Everything is normal.

554
00:40:41,622 --> 00:40:43,622
Please tell us what happened.

555
00:40:43,622 --> 00:40:48,055
Forget it. Just guard here well. I'll go to check myself.

556
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:49,400
Yes.

557
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,521
  The spiritual power here is thin. The barrier should be damaged.  

558
00:41:12,522 --> 00:41:15,611
 But the God Tying Chain hasn't been weakened. 

559
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:17,460
 It's Aura of Chaos. 

560
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:21,280
 Is it the God Slayer Flower? 

561
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:40,860


562
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:49,640
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

563
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:56,359
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

564
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:02,879
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

565
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,039
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

566
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:15,839
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

567
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:22,400
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

568
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:29,720
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

569
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:36,000
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

570
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:54,819
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

571
00:42:54,819 --> 00:43:01,300
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

572
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:08,479
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

573
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:14,700
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

574
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:23,559
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

575
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:30,439
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

576
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:36,919
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

577
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:43,419
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

578
00:43:43,419 --> 00:43:53,260
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
