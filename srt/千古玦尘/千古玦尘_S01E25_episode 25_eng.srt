1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,950


2
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:21,600
   

3
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,000
   

4
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,059
Master, I thought we were here to celebrate Her Royal Highness's birthday.

5
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:36,000
What are we waiting for?

6
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,979
Zi Han, we've been in Qingchi Palace for a long time.

7
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:50,838
What defines me are the many tasks waiting for me to deal with.

8
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,978
We should go back.

9
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:56,939
Sen Jian can handle them.

10
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,680
We can stay here for a few more days.

11
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,579
Now, Wu Huan already knows my identity.

12
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:07,500
Our clan must be prepared.

13
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,419
What does it mean that Your Second Highness would bring so many heavenly soldiers to Qingchi Palace?

14
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:47,239
I've brought an Imperial Edict for Qing Mu.

15
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,260
Please allow us, Lordess Feng Ran.

16
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,458
Since it's an Imperial Edict, you are allowed to go in.

17
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,899
But it's a rule here that these people are not authorized here.

18
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:59,720
All palanquins shall wait outside, too.

19
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,298
Wait for me here.

20
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:04,160
Yes, Your Highness.

21
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,239
Why did the Heavenly Palace ask you to come here with so many soldiers?

22
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,599
To pressure us?

23
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,519
Do they think we're shorthanded?

24
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,658
If Upper God Gu Jin were here, he would never tolerate this.

25
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:38,918
Please calm down. We should talk inside.

26
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,980
Why should I?

27
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,319
Well, then.

28
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,679
Where is Qing Mu?

29
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,799
Answer me first.

30
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,080
What do you want from Qing Mu?

31
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,358
Fine. Keeping silent?

32
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:57,479
Then I'll order my men to poke the hornet's nest at the gate of the mountain,

33
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,399
and we'll see if your heavenly soldiers will suffer or not.

34
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,339
Do you disagree?

35
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:06,699
I dare not.

36
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,000
Whether the hornet's nest in Qingchi Palace can be poked or not depends on Your Lordess and Upper God Gu Jun's decision.

37
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:13,579
Now you make sense.

38
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:18,418
Once you're done, I'll send them ointment to ease the pain and swelling.

39
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,618
If Heavenly Queen hears about this, I'm sure she will punish you.

40
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:24,699
Do whatever makes you happy.

41
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:25,858
Forget about it.

42
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:28,239
Those soldiers were ordered to be here.

43
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,519
They don't have a choice.

44
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,258
You are the one who should be punished.

45
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:33,418
Yes, Lordess.

46
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:37,458
Once it's over, I'm at your disposal.

47
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,619
You never yield to anyone, do you?

48
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,978
A'Huan, what are you thinking?

49
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,559
You have been restless these past few days,

50
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:17,179
is there something on your mind?

51
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,940
What else could it be?

52
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,940
It's about the children.

53
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,799
It's Zhao'er's marriage, right?

54
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:33,059
Jian'er has gone to find Qing Mu.

55
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,879
Everything will be realized.

56
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,359
What if he rejects it?

57
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,539
Back on Observation Mountain,

58
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,619
Qing Mu and Hou Chi stayed close to each other.

59
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:49,738
I'm afraid... he is stuck on her.

60
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,059
Your Majesty.

61
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:56,020
I know Zhao'er loves him.

62
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,859
But if Qing Mu disagrees,

63
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,420
we shall not force him.

64
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,439
Maybe I was overthinking.

65
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,198
What do you mean?

66
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,858
Qing Mu has the Tai Cang Spear.

67
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:11,720
If he is not on our side,

68
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,259
it would be impossible for you to reopen the God Realm.

69
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,598
Spit it out! What does the Heavenly Palace want?

70
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,738
It's not about how Qing Mu hurt your younger sister, is it?

71
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:37,178
Jing Jian, you're Qing Mu's close friend.

72
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:39,719
You can't do this to him.

73
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,999
Feng Ran.

74
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:46,978
As His Highness says, the edict is for Qing Mu.

75
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:50,838
Since it's between them, we shall stay out of it.

76
00:06:50,838 --> 00:06:53,320
You don't have to embarrass him anymore.

77
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,559
Hou Chi, I apologize for bringing the troops.

78
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:59,119
But Mother God insisted.

79
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,899
Since she insisted, there's no need to say more.

80
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:05,179
I don't want to hear a word about her business.

81
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,740
What's going on?

82
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,660
Ask him yourself.

83
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,418
You were doing fine yesterday.

84
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:20,158
Why is it so intense now?

85
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:22,659
We were not doing fine!

86
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:27,539
Qing Mu, this is serious.

87
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,019
- Do you mind coming with me? 
 - Stay here.

88
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:32,640
Feng Ran, let's leave.

89
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,419
What happened to make you so embarrassed?

90
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,939
It's safe between you and me.

91
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,698
I'd like to be frank with you.

92
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,819
But I'm sure you won't like it.

93
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,500
Father God and Mother God want you to take over the three armies, and lead the 100,000 soldiers of the Heavenly Palace.

94
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:56,020
Because of the spear?

95
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,339
Exactly.

96
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,538
I hate restraint. You know about me.

97
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:01,879
Please turn it down for me.

98
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,158
If only that were all.

99
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:07,799
Father God asked me here with another edict.

100
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:10,300
He sent me here...

101
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,279
to grant you marriage with my younger sister.

102
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,779
What did you say?

103
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,318
You know how I love Hou Chi...

104
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:20,739
Qing Mu, calm down, please.

105
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:23,520
How can I not know your feelings?

106
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,199
But this...

107
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,559
You should adapt to the overall situation.

108
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:33,239
Back on Observation Mountain, although you were possessed by the remnant soul of True God,

109
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:35,879
you did strike Jing Zhao and me.

110
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,358
It embarrassed the Heavenly Palace.

111
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:41,999
Secondly, others would question your intention.

112
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,859
Thirdly, you're now in the Qingchi Palace.

113
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:48,919
So, they want to restrain me with a marriage.

114
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,578
Although Father God and Mother God said this was an invitation for a chat,

115
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:57,478
they ordered me to bring soldiers.

116
00:08:57,478 --> 00:09:01,659
I'm afraid this is more than granting a marriage.

117
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,559
To pressure the Qingchi Palace.

118
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,460
If you don't come with me, I'm afraid...

119
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,958
The Heavenly Palace is going too far.

120
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,440
The storm will get worse in the future.

121
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,179
It's okay if they go after me.

122
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:20,119
But Upper God Gu Jun isn't around.

123
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,239
Hou Chi is here on her own.

124
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,280
She will be punished.

125
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,799
I'll go to the palace with you and settle this.

126
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,479
Okay.

127
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,058
Qing Mu, are you sure about leaving without saying goodbye?

128
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:48,598
Hou Chi must not know about this.

129
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:51,458
I must hurry up and reject them.

130
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,320
Qing Mu!

131
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,238
I know what this is about.

132
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:59,498
I heard the conversation just now.

133
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,938
Don't worry. I will not marry Jing Zhao.

134
00:10:01,938 --> 00:10:04,958
I will turn Heavenly King down now.

135
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,119
What's next?

136
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:09,698
Next? Next, I'll come back and stay by your side,

137
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:11,378
and live a happy life.

138
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,918
You know it's not that easy.

139
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:16,378
We just got together. Of course, I don't want you to leave.

140
00:10:16,378 --> 00:10:19,239
But I don't want to see your life in danger either.

141
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,938
You must be careful in your words and deeds when you go to the Heavenly Palace.

142
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:24,598
All that Heavenly King wants is the Tai Cang Spear.

143
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:26,698
As for the marriage, can they really restrain you?

144
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:28,739
They are not like the bandits in the lower realm.

145
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:30,378
But everything is possible.

146
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:33,138
If he really wants to hurt you, don't be fooled.

147
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:34,839
You have me.

148
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,239
These words...

149
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:40,039
I thought you always looked down upon me.

150
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,219
What's more, this time you must not visit Jing Zhao.

151
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:47,679
Don't even speak one word to her.

152
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,999
You're mine now.

153
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,378
If there is another love affair rumor, you know the consequences.

154
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:57,259
Of course.

155
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:59,099
It's not only Jing Zhao that I don't look at,

156
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:02,459
but I will not look at any woman there.

157
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:11,519
Since when did you both become an item?

158
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,279
I'm happy for you.

159
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,719
Hou Chi, you and Qing Mu are so in love with each other, it's really enviable.

160
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:24,518
Don't worry. This time to the Heavenly Palace, I will protect Qing Mu

161
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:28,499
and help him persuade Father God.

162
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:30,379
Thank you, Your Second Highness.

163
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:33,798
Forget about etiquette. Just call him by his name.

164
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,218
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

165
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:41,560
Let's go.

166
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:11,159
Master, as you ordered, I have summoned the demon troops in secret.

167
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,099
Once Wu Huan moves out,

168
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,420
we will declare war on the Immortals.

169
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,539
There's no rush.

170
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,599
Mu Guang wants to locate the Purple Moon Whip through you and reopen the God Realm.

171
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:29,858
She doesn't have the guts to provoke an immortal war, nor to anger Mu Guang for the time being.

172
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:36,799
I wanted to make you an Upper God.

173
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,218
After thinking about it, I dismissed the idea.

174
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,058
You're the Demon Emperor.

175
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:48,019
If you became an Upper God, the Immortal Realm would envy you.

176
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:52,178
Wu Huan might provoke a war between the immortals and our clan,

177
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:55,058
then we'd lose.

178
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:59,539
Master, you've been protecting our clan for tens of thousand years.

179
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:02,099
I really admire you.

180
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,499
I remember that there is a three-headed dragon in the Swamp of Netherhill.

181
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:09,399
He is powerful.

182
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:16,178
If we make him a god, firstly, it would pose a threat to the immortals.

183
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:20,498
Secondly, he is not too big a target.

184
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:28,798
This is a ray of pure divine power drawn by me from the Purple Moon.

185
00:13:28,798 --> 00:13:33,058
Bring this to the dragon and make him a god.

186
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:36,378
With one more Upper God in the Demon Clan,

187
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:40,220
Wu Huan won't strike us so easily.

188
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,239
Yes, Master.

189
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,219
 Qing Mu greets Your Highness. 

190
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,739
I'm impressed by your appearance, Lord of the North Sea.

191
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,258
No wonder Zhao'er likes you.

192
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:59,618
Rise up and take a seat.

193
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:01,379
Thanks.

194
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:06,198
Jian'er said that you came all the way here

195
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,359
to talk to me.

196
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:15,358
Your Highness, the reason as to why I have come is about the marriage with Princess Jing Zhao.

197
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:17,258
Marriage is a vital rite.

198
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:21,238
But I have no feelings towards Princess Jing Zhao.

199
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,919
My heart belongs to someone else.

200
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,379
I cannot take your edict. Please take it back.

201
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:36,180
Now Jian'er is close to you,

202
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,058
I'm sure you're smart enough.

203
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:42,080
This marriage is much more than love or feelings.

204
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,780
Do you understand?

205
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,138
I do.

206
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,760
Still, you turn us down.

207
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,319
No wonder you're a hero at such a young age.

208
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:57,938
It's just that being young is being young after all,

209
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,560
you don't know how to judge and weigh the situation.

210
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,919
Your Highness, I have made up my mind. It's not something out of impulse.

211
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:14,098
I'll forgive you for what you just said.

212
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:17,499
Think about it again.

213
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:21,818
Feng Nv, see Lord of the North Sea off.

214
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:23,680
I'll take my leave.

215
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,419
Mother God didn't get angry.

216
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,859
That's weird.

217
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,618
I find it weird, too.

218
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:45,999
I rejected her directly and told her about my status.

219
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,150
She didn't get angry, nor did she agree to it.

220
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,630
I can't figure out what she's thinking.

221
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:54,259
Mother God favors Zhao'er among us.

222
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:55,959
Could it be...

223
00:15:56,599 --> 00:16:01,318
she doesn't want to upset Zhao Er and has other plans in the making?

224
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:03,320
If that is so,

225
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,340
I'd rather send the Tai Cang Spear to Heavenly Queen.

226
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,179
The spear recognizes its owner. It's not up to you.

227
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:16,999
Besides, there was such a big commotion on Observation Mountain that day.

228
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:18,779
True God and a sacred beast were involved.

229
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,838
If you do want to give it away, you must find a reason.

230
00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:26,299
If you ask me, we must give it further thought.

231
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:28,058
We keep going further backward.

232
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:30,258
Stay here and Hou Chi will be worried.

233
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:31,618
They all say, "When a girl is of age, she must be married off." 
  (Idiom: it is hard to keep a woman at home.) 

234
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:34,759
I didn't know that you were sentimental, too. Too needy.

235
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,760
I am needy, so what?

236
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:39,899
There's no point talking about it.

237
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,639
Fine. We'll wait.

238
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,000
Although I'm not there,

239
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,240
I'm sure she's thinking about me.

240
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,619
I know what to do.

241
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:58,258
Did you hear it?

242
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:02,098
I begged Mother God and Father God for a long time to make them grant the marriage.

243
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:03,978
But look what he did.

244
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:05,738
I am the princess.

245
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:08,739
Now I've lowered myself, still, he's not moved.

246
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:11,139
Why don't I deserve him?

247
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:15,958
You're my sister. He is not worthy of you.

248
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:20,259
However, a relationship is not about qualification.

249
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:22,499
It's only love that matters.

250
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,440
Only love...

251
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,398
Jian'er, be honest with me.

252
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:33,018
When Mother God asked you to Qingchi Palace, you were reluctant to carry it out.

253
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:37,619
Was it because Qing Mu loves Hou Chi?

254
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:45,738
I knew it! It must be someone from Qingchi Palace who bewitched him!

255
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:47,179
Zhao'er.

256
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,139
Zhao'er!

257
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,939
Zhao'er!

258
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,238
Maintaining oneness, and achieving Ekaggata.

259
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:14,699
What a great novel!

260
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:20,379
The fairy's love. I'm deeply touched by the plot. Take a look?

261
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:22,460
Try it again.

262
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,699
And this one!

263
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,338
Fox demon and her damned immortal.

264
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,419
It's between a demon and an immortal. So much fun.

265
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,138
Hou Chi, I'm sure you'll like it.

266
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:30,539
Feng Ran.

267
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,499
Over the past few days, whenever I'm cultivating, you must come and make trouble.

268
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:35,779
Is it possible that you have nothing better to do at Qingchi Palace?

269
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,879
It was my fault in the past, I only cared about your cultivation.

270
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:41,899
I didn't expect to raise your temperament to a level of ignorance.

271
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,039
You just need some skills when you are in a relationship. Let me advise you.

272
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,799
Keep these books for yourself, I have other things to do.

273
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,779
Hou Chi, it's better to share the joy.

274
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:53,160
Just take a look.

275
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,139
Whenever bothered, Hou Chi would meditate or just sit in silence.

276
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:59,980
Where did she get that habit?

277
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,660
I have to carry out Plan B.

278
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,899
Why are you looking for me in such a hurry?

279
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,978
Your Royal Highness, although we do not accept guests here,

280
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:15,659
during festivals and ceremonies,

281
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,098
we ought to communicate with other palaces.

282
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:22,539
Besides, you will take charge of this place.

283
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:27,019
Shall we start by recognizing some people?

284
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,140
Why are you bringing this up now?

285
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,320
Forget about the details.

286
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:38,538
This is the senior disciple of Immortal Jin Yao, Immortal Yue Hua.

287
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:40,819
Do you know her, Your Royal Highness?

288
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,858
I don't know her at all.

289
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:45,179
Looks like she's only one or two thousand years old.

290
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,180
Why must I know this junior?

291
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,518
Your Royal Highness, this woman, you must not underestimate her.

292
00:19:51,518 --> 00:19:55,819
She is kind and amiable. Known to be elegant. She's already a well-known immortal.

293
00:19:55,819 --> 00:20:00,019
Most importantly, she had said 100 years ago that

294
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:02,939
she will only marry Lord Qing Mu.

295
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,719
See what I mean?

296
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,619
And this one.

297
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,200
The Princess Royal of the Dragon King of the West Sea.

298
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,158
I heard that she has known Lord Qing Mu when in the North Sea.

299
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:18,939
He must be her childhood crush.

300
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,498
You will come across to her one day.

301
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:24,199
Be sure to be guarded against her.

302
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:29,279
Cheng Que, what is this about?

303
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,879
Your Royal Highness, to be honest,

304
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:38,599
before Lord Qing Mu left, he gave us the order.

305
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:42,179
Either to amuse you or to remind you of him.

306
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,378
Whatever it takes, we must ease your anxiety.

307
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:48,018
Please don't keep anything hidden in your heart.

308
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:49,659
What are you doing now?

309
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,018
You are making me very flustered and anxious now.

310
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,960
Now I feel insecure.

311
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,759
Your Royal Highness, it's all my fault, I swear,

312
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,939
I will never bother you with these portraits again.

313
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,998
Come in, Feng Ran. I know you're eavesdropping.

314
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:15,559
This Qing Mu is really... What is he preparing for that he would choose all these portraits?

315
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,179
What is on his mind?

316
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,179
He's stupidly cute.

317
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,179
He doesn't know how to amuse a girl.

318
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,819
Then, what do you like about him?

319
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,019
His integrity, honesty, stupidity, cuteness, and boldness.

320
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,099
Everything about him.

321
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,780
Why am I telling this to you?

322
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,700
Thank goodness. Finally, you look alive.

323
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,399
Ever since Qing Mu left, you've been having a long face. You hardly smile.

324
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:43,158
Can you see my belly? I had two steamed buns today. It's still here.

325
00:21:43,158 --> 00:21:45,139
- Why is that? 
 - Why?

326
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:48,918
Because I'm calm. I'm not disturbed at all.

327
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,499
Your Royal Highness! Jing Zhao has come to our palace.

328
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:58,799
Now she asks for it. I'll teach her a lesson.

329
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,939
Listen to yourself! You're pissed off.

330
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,779
You're the opposite of calm or undisturbed!

331
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,279
Undisturbed. Right, I am.

332
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,900
Your Royal Highness,

333
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:13,960
are you planning on meeting her like this?

334
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:20,079
Back to the room with me.

335
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,560
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

336
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,400
   

337
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,820
I've been here for a long time!

338
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,419
Why isn't there anyone greeting me?

339
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,559
Is that how you treat a guest?

340
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,818
Please calm down.

341
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:42,540
Don't forget what Heavenly Queen said.

342
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:46,599
We have our own etiquette here.

343
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,899
If you mess around,

344
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,659
I'll send you back to your palace.

345
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,100
Besides, you're not invited here.

346
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,618
Hou Chi?

347
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:55,840
You...

348
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,850
you're not her.

349
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:00,939
Or what spell did you cast?

350
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,379
You know it perfectly if she is Upper God Hou Chi.

351
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:06,958
If it slipped your mind,

352
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:10,238
we can summon Sky Thunders to wake you up.

353
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:11,599
How dare you!

354
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,518
You're only a lower immortal.

355
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,319
How dare you say that to me!

356
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,738
Cut it off, Jing Zhao.

357
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:19,320
You came with great fanfare this time,

358
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,580
what were you planning to do?

359
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,059
Princess.

360
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,138
I apologize for what happened before.

361
00:23:30,138 --> 00:23:32,510
Sorry for annoying you.

362
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,550
Please forgive me.

363
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,758
This time, I'm here to send you an invitation.

364
00:23:40,758 --> 00:23:43,299
It's Mother God's birthday.

365
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,498
She would like to meet you.

366
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:50,039
Blood is thicker than water. I hope that you'll attend with love and affection.

367
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,218
Your Highness, please transfer my message to your mother.

368
00:23:53,218 --> 00:23:56,138
Qingchi Palace does not have anything to do with her.

369
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:58,138
I hope that she won't bother us anymore.

370
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:00,500
I'm afraid I can't do that.

371
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,679
You're a close friend to Qing Mu.

372
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,239
If you do not show up,

373
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:09,860
you'll miss my engagement ceremony with Qing Mu.

374
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,560
What did you say?

375
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,599
Your Highness, Lord of the North Sea has agreed to the marriage edict.

376
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:19,439
I'm just afraid that it will hurt the harmony of the two palaces.

377
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:23,298
Please forget about disputes and move on.

378
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:26,518
How is that possible? Qing Mu loves Hou Chi.

379
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:28,980
Why would he marry you?

380
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,738
Qing Mu only lived here for a few days.

381
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:35,419
You must have misunderstood him.

382
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,419
It makes sense. You envy me for everything I have.

383
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,519
It works the same for Qing Mu.

384
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,079
This time, he and I will become an immortal couple.

385
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,000
Are you still entangling with him?

386
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,459
Don't make me laugh.

387
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,398
He will come to me himself.

388
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:57,659
Besides, my rival isn't anyone but you.

389
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,518
What do you mean?

390
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:03,199
I mean... get out of Qingchi Palace

391
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:06,520
or I'll teach you a lesson with Sky Thunder.

392
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,659
You're threatening me!

393
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,539
It's not a threat, but punishment.

394
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:18,319
Because you have no manner nor self-knowledge, and broke into Qingchi Palace.

395
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,779
You cannot deny the three accusations.

396
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,738
You can hardly take the punishment

397
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:24,639
based on your poor cultivation.

398
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,680
Demon Emperor.

399
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,600
Demon Lord Zi Yue sent me here to give you the divine power of the Purple Moon

400
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,979
to help you ascend into a god.

401
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:16,758
It's of great importance.

402
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:19,360
This must not go wrong.

403
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,579
Don't worry.

404
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,199
I've been practicing here for 100,000 years.

405
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:29,200
This is what I've been waiting for.

406
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,359
With help from Demon Lord Zi Yue,

407
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,059
I'm sure I will make it to a god.

408
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,840
Good.

409
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:43,858
They're from Heavenly Palace!

410
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:46,379
Senior Prince Jing Yang?

411
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:48,200
How dare he!

412
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,679
Wait.

413
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,370
The Heavenly Palace is suspecting us.

414
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,559
Keep a low profile before becoming a god.

415
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,219
Yes, Your Majesty. I'll continue to cultivate.

416
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:05,819
I won't let them take the upper hand.

417
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,058
You must be busy. Don't worry about me.

418
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,439
Bear it in mind.

419
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:18,039
Think twice before you act.

420
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,959
Yes, Your Majesty.

421
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:21,620
Please.

422
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,140
Senior Prince Jing Yang!

423
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,278
Back then, he led a group of heavenly soldiers to the Swamp of Netherhill and Sen Yun,

424
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,679
and turned everything upside down.

425
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,079
He totally ignored me.

426
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:41,498
But now, I'll soon become a god.

427
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:44,119
I have no reason to fear you!

428
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:48,200
I must seek revenge!

429
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,179
It's too barren a place.

430
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,419
The Divine Weapon can't be here.

431
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,858
Still, they insisted that I should search here.

432
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:05,099
You. Check in the woods.

433
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,800
 Yes, Your Highness. 

434
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,819
 Jing Yang. 

435
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:25,739
 It's been a long time. You've been well. 

436
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:29,279
Who's there?

437
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:32,679
 Three-headed. 

438
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:34,398
You old bastard.

439
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:38,040
I spared your life when you retreated to cultivate.

440
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,018
How dare you come to me again!

441
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,118
Fine.

442
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:45,130
Today, I'll destroy you.

443
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,979
 You Immortals have been fighting like this for 100,000 years. 

444
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,998
Jing Yang, aren't you tired of this?

445
00:28:58,998 --> 00:29:01,480
I'm sick of it.

446
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,119
Stop. That's enough.

447
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,459
What the hell is this place!

448
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:16,838
Not even a palanquin.

449
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,339
I have to walk down this mountain on foot.

450
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:23,538
Your Highness, it's a rule of Qingchi Palace.

451
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:27,959
Whoever it is, palanquins must wait outside. They are not allowed here.

452
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,679
But this place belongs to the Immortals clan.

453
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,138
Why must I obey their rules?

454
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:33,699
Just carry on, Your Highness.

455
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,179
We're only steps away from the gate.

456
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,359
I don't care.

457
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,798
Whatever it takes, get me a palanquin!

458
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:43,380
Yes, Your Highness.

459
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,998
Are you sure about this?

460
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:51,098
What a spoiled princess!

461
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:53,759
- What if we get captured... 
 - Don't worry.

462
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,059
This area belongs to Qingchi Palace now.

463
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,659
How dare she mess around here.

464
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,919
We can't just let it go.

465
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:08,799
You dirty birds. I am a gold dragon.

466
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,040
Have dare you mess around with me!

467
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:13,600
Take this!

468
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:02,599
What did you say?

469
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:06,378
Jing Zhao went to Qingchi Palace, told Hou Chi I'd agreed to the marriage.

470
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:08,039
Did Hou Chi buy it?

471
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:12,160
She expelled her!

472
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:15,560
As expected of the person liked by me.

473
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,179
Father God summons all immortals for a meeting.

474
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:22,038
Something has gone wrong. Let's go.

475
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:23,519
Let's go.

476
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:28,940
What did you say?

477
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,320
Your Highness,

478
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,998
Senior Prince Jing Yang led a troop to Swamp of Nether Hill yesterday.

479
00:31:33,998 --> 00:31:35,299
We lost contact.

480
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,379
They haven't come back.

481
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:40,440
How is that possible?

482
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:45,378
Father God, please use your spiritual sense

483
00:31:45,378 --> 00:31:47,839
and see if he's in danger.

484
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,579
I've sensed him already.

485
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,059
His aura is weak, but he's safe.

486
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:56,278
Your Majesty, Senior Prince is there for the Divine Weapon.

487
00:31:56,278 --> 00:31:58,539
Now he's lost in the Swamp of Netherhill,

488
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,258
it must be the demon clan.

489
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:02,779
Feng Xian's words are wrong.

490
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,200
The Swamp of Netherhill was abandoned by immortals and demons.

491
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,100
Among them, there are people from both the Immortal and Demon Clans,

492
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,490
and most of them are people who have betrayed the two clans.

493
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:12,659
If it was by the Demon Clan,

494
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:17,519
even the powerful Demon Emperor cannot take them down in silence.

495
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:22,538
Immortals, please check out if the Demon Clan is behind this.

496
00:32:22,538 --> 00:32:24,419
Check the Swamp of Netherhill personally.

497
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,699
You're right, Your Majesty.

498
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,918
The key is to rescue His Royal Highness Jing Yang first.

499
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:34,499
The longer he stays, the more dangerous it is.

500
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,659
Father God, I want to make a recommendation.

501
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,830
Jing Jian, what do you want?

502
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,540
Don't worry, I will help you out.

503
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,738
Father God.

504
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:53,458
In my opinion, Qing Mu is the best candidate for this task.

505
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:55,819
He possesses a real Divine Weapon,

506
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,618
the Tai Cang Spear to handle it.

507
00:32:57,619 --> 00:32:59,940
He is the best option.

508
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,338
Lord Dong Hua,

509
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:03,839
Lord of the North Sea does not belong to our palace.

510
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,498
He doesn't work for us.

511
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:08,999
I don't think it's appropriate to entrust him this task.

512
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:12,659
Lord of the Wind, are you willing to take the duty?

513
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,780
I'm afraid I don't have enough power...

514
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:20,079
Father God, since there is no suitable candidate from the Heavenly Palace,

515
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:22,738
why not entrust it to Qing Mu?

516
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:25,879
I'm willing to carry it out with him and save my elder brother.

517
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,839
It's just this is extremely dangerous.

518
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,819
And it's Qing Mu's first time to enter the Heavenly Palace.

519
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,758
If we save my elder brother,

520
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:37,299
we should reward Qing Mu.

521
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,138
Naturally.

522
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:44,699
Qing Mu, I promise you a great reward to save Jing Yang.

523
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:46,399
Will you take it?

524
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,599
Your Majesty, I will take the task.

525
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,619
I'm not doing it for the reward.

526
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:55,799
But I do have a condition.

527
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,299
How presumptuous of you!

528
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,460
You are just a little lord of the North Sea.

529
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,060
How dare you bargain with His Majesty.

530
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,098
You have my word.

531
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:08,078
What I want is not about the clan or your palace.

532
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:09,499
It's only personal.

533
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,858
If Your Majesty agrees to it,

534
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:15,638
I will set off for the Swamp of Netherhill now and escort His Highness back safely.

535
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:20,320
Fine. I give you my promise.

536
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,179
Thank you, Your Majesty.

537
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,260
Hou Chi.

538
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,800
Are you still angry at Jing Zhao's tricks?

539
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,980
It's not about her.

540
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,018
Now that she shows up, it means Qing Mu didn't succeed.

541
00:34:55,939 --> 00:34:58,259
I'm worried about his safety.

542
00:34:58,259 --> 00:35:01,138
But I'm afraid I'd make it worse if I go there.

543
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:04,618
Never for once in my life have I hated myself for being incapable this much.

544
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:07,439
I'm useless. There is nothing I can do.

545
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,439
Jing Jian just sent a message saying Qing Mu just got a chance.

546
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:14,899
He can successfully break off the marriage.

547
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,319
He asked us to wait patiently and to not worry about him.

548
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:20,438
What... What chance?

549
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:22,139
Is it safe?

550
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,020
Just keep calm.

551
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:28,678
There's more news. Would you like to hear it?

552
00:35:28,678 --> 00:35:31,819
What's that? It must be good news!

553
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:35,098
You were looking for Bo Xuan. I asked my friend to look for him.

554
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:36,778
Did we find him?

555
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:40,759
A demon told me there are signs of a semi-god in the Swamp of Netherhill.

556
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:43,459
I'm afraid Bo Xuan is the semi-god there.

557
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,059
Swamp of Netherhill? I've been looking for a long time.

558
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:48,959
But I'd forgotten about the deserted places.

559
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:52,259
If the Demon Emperor ascends to a god, there would have definitely been a lot of commotion.

560
00:35:52,259 --> 00:35:55,259
But now the Immortal and Demon Realms are quiet.

561
00:35:55,259 --> 00:35:56,640
It could be Bo Xuan!

562
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,419
Exactly. Instead of overthinking here in the palace,

563
00:35:59,419 --> 00:36:02,000
you'd better go out and look for him.

564
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,859
Good. Let's go now.

565
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:14,679
This place is unique.

566
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:17,499
The spiritual power is so thin here.

567
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,939
I used to practice here at a young age.

568
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,499
It's full of marsh gas here.

569
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,979
There are mostly beasts with high spiritual power and a ferocious nature that live here.

570
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,659
We must be careful.

571
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,778
Have you been here before?

572
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:30,879
Many times. I used to play around here when I was a kid.

573
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,320
The beasts here nearly took my life.

574
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,099
There is movement!

575
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,660
Come over.

576
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:44,999
Come on. Next time, let me carry you.

577
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:48,938
I'm not good at flying. I wanted to practice.

578
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:50,900
Hou Chi?

579
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,059
Let's go. Take a look that way.

580
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:58,019
That's my wife. Why are you holding me off?

581
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,500
She's not your wife yet.

582
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,659
What do you mean?

583
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,259
You've been gone for days.

584
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,179
I'm sure you miss her.

585
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,098
How about this? I'll take Feng Ran away.

586
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,979
Good idea.

587
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,779
And there's more.

588
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,979
Good.

589
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:18,619
Let's go.

590
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,998
The Power of Laws is distorted here.

591
00:37:22,998 --> 00:37:24,640
What is Bo Xuan doing here?

592
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,920
This is only the outskirts of the Swamp of Netherhill.

593
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,099
By the way, shield your power.

594
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:31,460
Don't let others sense you.

595
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,600
Others?

596
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,878
There are plenty of demon beasts here. Many of them are as powerful as Upper Lords.

597
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,160
I was deserted here.

598
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,178
If it wasn't for the demon tree's help, I'd be dead.

599
00:37:40,178 --> 00:37:43,299
The place we're heading to, is there any threat?

600
00:37:43,299 --> 00:37:45,559
Nothing in particular. I can handle it.

601
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,259
But there's a three-headed fire dragon.

602
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,899
It's been here since ancient times.

603
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,678
He is very powerful.

604
00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:53,360
Although he doesn't like immortals, he's not bloodthirsty.

605
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,478
As long as we keep a low profile, we'll be fine.

606
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,079
Jing Jian? What are you doing here?

607
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:05,098
Qing Mu is in danger.

608
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:06,538
He's here, too?

609
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:08,259
Qing Mu and I were ordered here to look for someone.

610
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,938
As soon as we got here, we were crowded by demon clans.

611
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:12,579
Qing Mu sent me out.

612
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:14,180
I'm afraid he's in danger now.

613
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,839
Feng Ran, please help him out.

614
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,778
I'll go with you.

615
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:22,078
You don't have enough power. Just stay here and keep safe.

616
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,699
All right, it's far enough.

617
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,779
We won't bother them now.

618
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,359
You found it out.

619
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:37,660
You're not good at acting.

620
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,479
If it wasn't for Hou Chi's worry, she would not have fallen for it.

621
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,280
Please forgive me.

622
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,320
Who's here?

623
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,160
An Immortal? That's rare.

624
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,039
How dare you break in!

625
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:54,719
That's quite bold.

626
00:38:56,379 --> 00:38:58,058
I don't know the way around.

627
00:38:58,058 --> 00:38:59,319
I lost my way.

628
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:02,560
Please show mercy and spare my life.

629
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,619
No way.

630
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,818
It's been thousands of years since the last time I have eaten an immortal.

631
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:09,320
And I just captured a beautiful fairy.

632
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,619
I can't let you go.

633
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,879
If I'm to die, then I'll die. I'm not afraid.

634
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:22,478
Before I die, can I send an instruction feather

635
00:39:22,478 --> 00:39:25,078
to my beloved one about my last words?

636
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:26,259
Your beloved one?

637
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
What do you want to say?

638
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,959
Betrayer! You left me for the princess.

639
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,900
I hate you!

640
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,899
I'm not with Jing Zhao.

641
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,719
I only think about you.

642
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:39,420
Untie me first.

643
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,839
Jing Jian said your life was in danger.

644
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,880
Thankfully, you're safe.

645
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,379
I was so worried about you, and you were making fun of me.

646
00:39:56,379 --> 00:39:59,038
All right. I'm sorry.  I was wrong.

647
00:39:59,038 --> 00:40:01,179
I shouldn't have taken Jing Jian's advice.

648
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:03,398
He said I should prank you first then save you.

649
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:05,460
I will never listen to him again.

650
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,939
It's all Qing Mu's idea.

651
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,419
He asked me to distract you to make some room for them.

652
00:40:15,419 --> 00:40:16,659
I can't match him.

653
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,179
That's why I agreed to it.

654
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:20,080
Please forgive me.

655
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,058
Your Highness, it's only been a few days.

656
00:40:22,058 --> 00:40:25,378
You've got some nerves. Now you're lying to me.

657
00:40:25,378 --> 00:40:29,299
I'm following your instructions. To make things easier for them.

658
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:31,778
Since when did you listen to me?

659
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,960
I always do.

660
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,220
I always listen to you.

661
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:40,099
Good for you.

662
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:43,560
We'll wait here. Don't disturb them.

663
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:48,578
Why are Qing Mu and you here?

664
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,979
Are you stalking Hou Chi and me?

665
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:54,079
Of course not. We're here for...

666
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,839
Lordess Feng Ran, Father God gave us an order.

667
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,879
It's a Heavenly Palace's secret.

668
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm not authorized to disclose it to you.

669
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,678
Never mind. I don't know anything about your Heavenly Palace.

670
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,239
Where are you going?

671
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,739
It's a Qingchi Palace's secret. I'm not at liberty to say.

672
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:19,379
All right. We don't owe each other anymore.

673
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:22,578
Since you won't tell me, I'll just follow you.

674
00:41:22,578 --> 00:41:24,880
This place is too dangerous.

675
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,980
Lordess Feng Ran, please be careful.

676
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:44,980


677
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:53,620
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

678
00:41:53,620 --> 00:42:00,599
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

679
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:07,019
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

680
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:13,279
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

681
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:20,079
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

682
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:26,539
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

683
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:33,850
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

684
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:40,420
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

685
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:57,639
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

686
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:04,119
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

687
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:11,399
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

688
00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:18,400
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

689
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,479
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

690
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,360
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

691
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:39,839
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

692
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:46,339
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

693
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:57,160
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
