1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,800
   

3
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,800
   

4
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:29,620
Where are you going?

5
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:33,899
It's a Qingchi Palace's secret. I'm not at liberty to say.

6
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:37,818
All right. We don't owe each other anymore.

7
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:40,958
Since you won't tell me, I'll just follow you.

8
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,320
This place is too dangerous.

9
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,220
Lordess Feng Ran, please be careful.

10
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,198
Jing Jian, I grew up in the Swamp of Netherhill.

11
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:53,919
You... take care of yourself.

12
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,880
Feng Ran, what is this place?

13
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,039
Old guy, I'm back to see you.

14
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,379
Don't worry. I'm leading a good life now.

15
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,499
I eat and drink well in Qingchi Palace.

16
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:45,080
And a stubborn girl accompanies me.

17
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,839
You don't have to worry about me.

18
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,959
Feng Ran, he is...

19
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:58,639
He was killed by Sen Yun and Jing Yang.

20
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,919
He was my only family in the world.

21
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,838
I was born with misfortune.

22
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,860
I was abandoned in the Swamp of Netherhill before I was able to open my eyes.

23
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,219
When he picked me up, I almost died.

24
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:15,738
Demons here all said I wouldn't survive.

25
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,918
But he didn't believe it.

26
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,799
He kept me warm with his demon elixir for three days and nights.

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,579
So I came back to life bit by bit.

28
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,360
I asked him.

29
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,679
You're a demon. Why do you raise a phoenix?

30
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,179
He said he never went anywhere outside the Swamp of Netherhill.

31
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,939
He was too old to go anywhere else.

32
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:21,040
He hoped that I could show him around the three realms when I grew up.

33
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,200
He wanted to see the outside world.

34
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,578
But one day, the Immortal and Demon Clans fought above the swamp,

35
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:30,620
plunging the lives here in misery and suffering.

36
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,880
When Sen Yun and Jing Yang fought,

37
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,678
I hid under his protection.

38
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:38,639
To protect me,

39
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,920
he was burned to death by them.

40
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:18,040
 Help! Help! 

41
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,899
 Grandpa! No! 

42
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:30,239
 Grandpa! Grandpa! 

43
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,559
 Grandpa! No! Grandpa! No! 

44
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,840
 Grandpa! 

45
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,959
 Grandpa! No! 

46
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,760
 Grandpa! 

47
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
 Grandpa! 

48
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:16,660
 Grandpa! 

49
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:19,520
Feng Ran.

50
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,880
I'm willing to shoulder the burden of my brother's fault.

51
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,439
His figure and soul were both destroyed.

52
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,659
How will you shoulder it?

53
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,838
I know I can't make up for my brother's fault.

54
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,319
But if you want to kill me,

55
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,959
I won't resist.

56
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,319
You are you. Jing Yang is Jing Yang.

57
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,820
I will avenge my grudge against him with my own hands.

58
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:18,379
Sir, please rest assured.

59
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:21,779
I'll take good care of Feng Ran.

60
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,319
Old guy. Don't worry.

61
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:35,340
One day I will make the one who killed you pay for it with their blood.

62
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:49,840
Nasty Dragon! How dare you?

63
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,238
Do you believe I'll destroy the Swamp of Netherhill?

64
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,379
Because you led the immortals to occupy the places

65
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:00,300
with strong spiritual power of the demon clan,

66
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,919
I have had to use such a disgusting way to cultivate.

67
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,439
Today, I'll absorb all the spiritual power of you and those heavenly soldiers

68
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,279
to become cocoons as punishment.

69
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:20,700
Dragon Lord, the immortals are here.

70
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,519
I advise you to release me as soon as possible;

71
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,680
otherwise, my Father God will kill you when he comes.

72
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,220
You talk too much.

73
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,659
Who are those that have come?

74
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,939
Dragon Lord, four young immortals.

75
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:43,399
Judging from their cultivation base, they should be Upper Immortals.

76
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,299
Bring them here and let me see.

77
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,759
Yes.

78
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:49,819
You guys come with me!

79
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:51,520
 Yes. 

80
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,819
Have you canceled the engagement?

81
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:08,819
Don't worry.

82
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:11,740
I've figured out how to let Heavenly King cancel it.

83
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:16,258
His edict has been spread across the three realms and four seas.

84
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:18,379
It's not easy to cancel.

85
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:21,879
Jing Yang and the heavenly soldiers disappeared here not long ago.

86
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,720
Jing Yang has strong spiritual power but disappeared quietly.

87
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,879
Jing Jian and I think he was caught by the three-headed fire dragon.

88
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,478
I applied to come here.

89
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:35,439
He promised as long as I bring Jing Yang back, he'll grant one of my wishes.

90
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:38,340
Then I'll ask him to cancel the wedding ceremony.

91
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,060
I feel a bit upset.

92
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,180
Why?

93
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,959
Did you have any impression of Xuanjing Palace that day?

94
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,060
Do you know why Feng Ran killed Sen Yun, the third prince of the Demon Emperor?

95
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,158
 Even if Sen Yun deserves his death, 

96
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:56,199
 he's still the third prince of Xuanjing Palace. 

97
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,339
 He was my favorite son. 

98
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:04,039
When the immortals and the demons fought,

99
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:07,199
Sen Yun and Jing Yang mistakenly killed the old tree demon.

100
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,899
To get revenge, Feng Ran became the enemy of the immortals and the demons.

101
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:14,238
She wants to kill Jing Yang as soon as possible.

102
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:19,690
But now you want to rescue Jing Yang as a bargaining chip to break off the engagement.

103
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:22,520
I just wanted to break off as soon as possible.

104
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,458
But I didn't know Feng Ran had a grudge against Jing Yang.

105
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,659
I made a mistake.

106
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,918
It's not your fault. I didn't tell you.

107
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,660
Anyway, we can't ignore Feng Ran's feelings.

108
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,320
Let me think about other ways.

109
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,478
And you. Why are you here?

110
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:43,379
Feng Ran said there are signals that a demigod will become a god.

111
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:46,559
I suspect Bo Xuan is here. So we came.

112
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,440
Who goes there?

113
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:52,719
How dare you enter the Swamp of Netherhill?

114
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:57,078
Young man, are you here to rescue the immortal here?

115
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:58,999
What? Who are you?

116
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:02,320
We're the men of the three-headed fire dragon. Scared?

117
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,839
Did he capture the people of Heavenly Palace?

118
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,180
Take them away!

119
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,799
 Yes. 

120
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,479
Hurry up!

121
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,179
Spirit Gathering Trap.

122
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:20,380
He breaks the rules by forcibly absorbing the spiritual power of the heavenly soldiers.

123
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:23,118
How strong the evil aura is!

124
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:26,079
I'm afraid that the heavenly soldiers have been killed.

125
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,839
We underestimated the strength of the dragon.

126
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,340
I'm afraid he's going to be promoted to a god.

127
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,799
You'll die soon, but you still show your affection.

128
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,559
- How dare you? 
 - You absorb the spiritual power of so many soldiers.

129
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,640
The Heavenly King will punish you.

130
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,239
When the Dragon Lord becomes a god, Heavenly Palace will belong to the demon clan.

131
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,860
It doesn't matter that some upper immortals die.

132
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,259
Hurry up!

133
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,880
Go!

134
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:04,658
- Qing Mu! 
 - Jing Yang!

135
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,839
Well, Jing Yang.

136
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,159
I didn't expect you to be caught as a sacrifice for the Dragon Lord.

137
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,380
The heavenly justice is fair.

138
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,038
You robbed my fiancee by virtue of your power as the prince of Heavenly Palace.

139
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,080
I'll kill you today!

140
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,918
Chan Yu, report to Dragon Lord.

141
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,320
We've caught the immortals who came in.

142
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,658
Ask him to start the array.

143
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:29,099
It's okay that I'll guard here.

144
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,619
Yes. Let's go.

145
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:36,659
Either you die or I die today!

146
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:46,199
Your Highness, I was forced by the situation.

147
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,919
Excuse me.

148
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,678
With your power, are you afraid of those demons?

149
00:13:55,678 --> 00:13:58,879
You just wanted to embarrass me.

150
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,879
Once I get back to the palace, I'll report to my Mother God and have you punished for disrespect.

151
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,759
It is not easy for His Highness to be so majestic in such a tragic state.

152
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,718
Qing Mu, Father has made an engagement between you and Jing Zhao.

153
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,400
Why do you stay with her?

154
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,038
Do you want two wives for yourself? That kind of joy of everyone is impossible.

155
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,639
Why should we save this guy?

156
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,439
It would be better for him to be the sacrifice of the array.

157
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,919
Qing Mu.

158
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,359
You!

159
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,518
No use. The three-headed fire dragon is at the top of the demi-gods.

160
00:14:40,518 --> 00:14:42,879
You can't break his barrier.

161
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:46,380
We have to find a way out.

162
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,619
I have an idea, but His Highness will have to suffer.

163
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:58,060
You have a bad relationship with Qingchi Palace.

164
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,079
So it's the only way to let us save you.

165
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,579
What idea?

166
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,399
The three-headed dragon will be promoted to a god.

167
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,839
I'm afraid he's waiting for the Doom of Thunder.

168
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,600
If thunder falls into the cave,

169
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,459
the three-headed fire dragon will think his doom has come.

170
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,478
If he enters the cave to escape the doom, he'll open the barrier first.

171
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:22,279
You're distinguished.

172
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,539
You have never enjoyed the treatment of an upper immortal.

173
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:30,659
You're lucky. I don't want to give this kind of honor to most people.

174
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,159
Feng Ran.

175
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:08,459
Do you remember you saved...

176
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,379
Doom of Thunder!

177
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,280
I've waited for tens of thousands of years.

178
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,699
Now the day has come.

179
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,940
Thunder Ordeal?

180
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,220
Why did DooThunder appear in the Swamp of Netherhill?

181
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,139
Will the three-headed fire dragon become a god?

182
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,839
No. It's for Hou Chi.

183
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,380
Terrible.

184
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,238
My courtesy contains the spirit of Heaven and Earth.

185
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:57,319
Your Highness, please cherish it.

186
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,899
First, I hope you can marry a woman like a demon as soon as possible.

187
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,198
It seems that you like my blessings very much.

188
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,379
Second, I hope you'll have many kids

189
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:13,880
and have no peaceful day at home.

190
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,319
Third...

191
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,419
No big events today.

192
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:35,199
You give me such a grand ceremony. I don't deserve it.

193
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:38,360
But I won't take advantage of you.

194
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,399
Third, it's my return.

195
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,139
A thousand years ago, the heavenly fire rained down.

196
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:03,879
An old tree demon was burned to death.

197
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,839
Compared with what you did in the swamp then and what I did today,

198
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,319
is nothing.

199
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,559
Who are you?

200
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,920
How dare you trick me?

201
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,520
Qing Mu from the North Sea.

202
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:33,980
Tai Cang Spear? Why do you have it?

203
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,198
If you leave it here, I can spare your life.

204
00:18:40,198 --> 00:18:43,879
Three-head Fire Dragon, you absorb the power of immortals to practice evil spells.

205
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:46,059
Are you even worthy to have the spear?

206
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,538
Just a few immortals. I swallowed them all.

207
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:56,379
But for you, I've given you a way to survive.

208
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:57,919
But you refused.

209
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,040
So it's not my fault.

210
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,260
After I kill you,

211
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,559
the spear will belong to me.

212
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:30,078
Hey, girl!

213
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:32,159
Though you don't have much power,

214
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,799
the muscles and bones of your body are special.

215
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,180
Today, you'll both be my sacrifice today!

216
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,119
Hou Chi!

217
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,238
Did he hurt you?

218
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,780
I'm fine.

219
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,198
It's you!

220
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:17,279
How dare you fight against me?

221
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,078
No one can protect you anymore.

222
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:22,678
Dragon Lord, Hou Chi is my good friend.

223
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:24,620
I must take her away safe and sound.

224
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,899
Please be lenient with us.

225
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:30,319
Hou Chi? Gu Jun's daughter.

226
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,519
The fourth Upper God in the Heavenly Realm.

227
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,078
You made friends with your enemy.

228
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:44,299
You really surprise me.

229
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,359
Second Brother, why are you with that demon girl?

230
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,759
From now on, Heavenly Palace and Qingchi Palace are enemies.

231
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,579
Jing Yang, be cautious.

232
00:20:55,579 --> 00:21:01,319
Jing Jian, is he the secret of Heavenly Palace you mean? Stand aside!

233
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:06,998
Feng Ran, I came to save him because Qing Mu wanted to use Jing Yang's life as the bargaining chip

234
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:09,238
to cancel the engagement between Jing Zhao and him.

235
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:12,199
If you kill him, Qing Mu won't be able to cancel it.

236
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:14,419
Then, what can Hou Chi do?

237
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,359
Feng Ran, I really didn't know your about your feud with Jing Yang.

238
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,899
I am ashamed.

239
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:25,618
If you want to get revenge, I won't stop you.

240
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,938
Qing Mu! The Heavenly Palace treats you well.

241
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:31,380
But why do you stand by her?

242
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,979
Little girl! Don't forget that the old tree demon

243
00:21:35,979 --> 00:21:38,838
was burned to death by Jing Yang.

244
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:43,140
Have you forgotten the feud and become the lackey of Heavenly Palace?

245
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,040
Never!

246
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,260
Okay.

247
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,039
If you help me kill these immortals,

248
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:02,299
I'll let you torture Jing Yang and destroy his core spirit.

249
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:07,879
Hou Chi, don't let Feng Ran make more mistakes.

250
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:15,120
Feng Ran, no matter what you do, I will support you.

251
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:38,360
I'll settle the feud myself one day.

252
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,360
But today, I must take Hou Chi away.

253
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,699
Acting recklessly! Today, I will let you taste my power!

254
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:52,079
I'll swallow you to help me be promoted to a god.

255
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,619
God let me suffer the ordeal now?

256
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:06,100
You're so unfair!

257
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,780
Let's go, hurry up!

258
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,799
Why are you stunned?

259
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,518
If he succeeds, none of us won't escape.

260
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,578
Once the three-headed fire dragon becomes a god,

261
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:20,299
the swamp and the immortals will be destroyed.

262
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,639
Hou Chi is right.

263
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,279
Considering his temper, he'll massacre many people.

264
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,179
Even the king and queen won't be able to kill him.

265
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:28,118
Hou Chi, don't you want to stop him from becoming a god?

266
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:30,179
You can't. It's too dangerous.

267
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,740
Feng Ran, take Hou Chi away.

268
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:06,059
I'll help him.

269
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,598
Don't go there. Your power can't help them.

270
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,678
He failed. He won't let us go.

271
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:17,179
Feng Ran, you grew up here. Is there any shelter?

272
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,158
Yes. Even the Dragon Lord dares not to enter.

273
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:21,839
Follow me.

274
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:30,460
From today, I won't let you go!

275
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,318
Feng Ran, is this the place of World Destruction?

276
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,419
World Destruction?

277
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,000
It is said that 60,000 years ago, Demon God Tian Qi started the Array of World Destruction

278
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,518
to swallow the three realms so as to be Chief God of Chaos.

279
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,900
Then True God Bai Jue led the gods to kill him.

280
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,059
So the disaster was avoided.

281
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,458
Yes. It's the place of World Destruction.

282
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:00,999
I grew up in the Swamp of Netherhill.

283
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,380
Neither immortals nor demons dare not enter.

284
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,579
Even the three-headed dragon dares not.

285
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,598
The mist contains the stress of a True God.

286
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,039
We'll die if we stay here.

287
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,358
We'd better go out.

288
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,618
You can leave. The three-headed fire dragon's at the door.

289
00:26:21,618 --> 00:26:22,538
He's seeking your life.

290
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:25,598
Don't panic. I might have a way.

291
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,438
Before we came, Dong Hua said

292
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:40,999
your divine weapon of a  True God can resist the array's influence.

293
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,880
I didn't expect it to be of use here.

294
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,800
Place of World Destruction?

295
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,500
It's just a broken altar.

296
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,318
It's not scary at all.

297
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:52,999
Tian Qi was killed by us immortals easily.

298
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:56,178
Just now, I don't know who was so scared that he said he was going to go out and die.

299
00:26:56,178 --> 00:26:57,438
Why don't you go out now?

300
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,779
- You! 
 - Brother, be quiet.

301
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:03,598
Second Brother, what kind of drug did this demon girl give you?

302
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:05,400
You are always protecting her!

303
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:12,059
Feng Ran, he's the prince of Heavenly Palace; the future of phoenix lord.

304
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,219
You're a monster from the Swamp of Netherhill.

305
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:16,619
You don't even deserve to be his maid!

306
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:17,838
Don't bother him anymore.

307
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,679
Brother!

308
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,780
Feng Ran, my brother was injured.

309
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,239
Don't mind his words.

310
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:27,680
Prince of Heavenly Palace? Lord of the Phoenix Clan?

311
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,678
I should have discovered earlier that you are no different than Jing Yang.

312
00:27:30,678 --> 00:27:35,400
I didn't kill him because of Hou Chi and Qing Mu.

313
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,598
One day, I'll kill him!

314
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,678
If you dare to stop me again, don't blame me for being ruthless.

315
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:47,519
Second Brother, there are many good girls in the three realms.

316
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,358
- Why do you... 
 - Brother, stop talking.

317
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,679
Okay.

318
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,238
If Feng Ran comes to kill me one day,

319
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:57,079
what will you do?

320
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,280
If there is a day,

321
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:08,019
I will use my life to solve the grievance between the two of you.

322
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,580
Jing Yang's fault has implicated Jing Jian.

323
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,639
It's hard for him to have a good ending with Feng Ran.

324
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,259
Jing Jian treats Feng Ran...

325
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,219
He is very different to Feng Ran.

326
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,660
Is there any way to resolve this grievance?

327
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,739
I am afraid it will be difficult to resolve the feud.

328
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,118
I know Feng Ran very much.

329
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,718
She never changes her mind.

330
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:48,099
Qing Mu, for today, we owe Feng Ran.

331
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,119
 Shang Gu. 

332
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:56,800
 Shang Gu. 

333
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:10,820
What's wrong?

334
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,219
I saw some strange pictures.

335
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:15,359
What did you see?

336
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:17,199
I saw...

337
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:24,338
 You will understand that what Bai Jue's remnants said on Observation Mountain that day was true. 

338
00:30:24,338 --> 00:30:28,500
 You should have been the most distinguished god in the world. 

339
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,620
Nothing.

340
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,939
I just think she's sad,

341
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:36,239
and is waiting for something.

342
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,100
This is a relic of the struggle of the gods.

343
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,439
This stone statue must be an Upper God of the God Realm.

344
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:47,780
Though she died, her thoughts can still touch our hearts.

345
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,339
You're still alive? I'll kill you!

346
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:56,880
Be careful!

347
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,478
Feng Ran, take Hou Chi away!

348
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:13,980
Let's go!

349
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,198
Are you okay?

350
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,719
I'm fine.

351
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,900
Brother!

352
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:43,019
Go!

353
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,599
The power of a True God? You can use Bai Jue's power?

354
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:54,499
If you don't leave, I'll cut your sacred meridian

355
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,980
so you won't be able to do anything more.

356
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,339
Qing Mu.

357
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,159
Qing Mu, are you okay?

358
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,900
I'm fine.

359
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:10,638
Since you saved Jing Yang,

360
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,238
return to Heavenly Palace and let the king cancel the engagement.

361
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,298
Feng Ran, I won't use Jing Yang as a bargaining chip.

362
00:34:16,298 --> 00:34:18,860
I'll find another way out.

363
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,200
Tell me what I can do to help.

364
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,319
I know what you and Hou Chi think.

365
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,819
I'll get revenge one day, but I'm in no rush.

366
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:32,058
Jing Yang can be regarded as a bargaining chip to accumulate virtue for himself.

367
00:34:32,058 --> 00:34:35,798
Since the king promised you, go back and let him cancel the engagement.

368
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:40,119
As long as you and Hou Chi have no worries, I can feel at ease.

369
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,458
Now that Lordess Feng Ran has spoken, Qing Mu, please don't hold back any longer.

370
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,579
Feng Ran, I'll remember your kindness.

371
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:51,039
Thank you, Feng Ran.

372
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,958
Hou Chi, why are you being so polite?

373
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:56,979
As long as the two of you can be happy, that's the biggest reward for me.

374
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,059
Hou Chi, go back to Qilian Mountain with her.

375
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,260
After I report to the king and cancel the engagement with Jing Zhao,

376
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,750
I'll return to Qingchi Palace.

377
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,778
I don't trust Heavenly Palace. Let me go with you.

378
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:13,418
No. He's going to cancel the engagement.

379
00:35:13,418 --> 00:35:15,238
If you go, Queen won't tolerate you.

380
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,699
This is a matter between me and Qing Mu, I can't let him carry it alone.

381
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:22,239
Hou Chi, Father God is not a stubborn man.

382
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,619
Since you saved Jing Yang, he will keep his promise.

383
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:28,139
I saved Jing Yang not to cancel the engagement.

384
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:30,400
If not for the three-headed fire dragon's cruelty,

385
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,860
I wouldn't be involved in the dispute between the Immortal and Demon Clans.

386
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,499
Considering what Jing Yang did,

387
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:38,438
my Qingchi Palace has the right to kill him, not to save him.

388
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:40,719
Come on. You're not Jing Yang.

389
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:44,440
He's your burden. I shouldn't treat you like this.

390
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,019
Feng Ran, go back to Qilian Mountain.

391
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:49,320
I just said you can't go with him.

392
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,499
People in Heavenly Palace like to play with people's hearts. I can't let you go there alone.

393
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,079
But I won't make any trouble before you solve the problem.

394
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,238
Okay.

395
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,779
In that case, let's go back to the Heavenly Palace together.

396
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,239
Three-head.

397
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,799
With the purple fire from Master,

398
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,298
why did you fail to be a god?

399
00:36:20,298 --> 00:36:24,239
If Qing Mu didn't attack me

400
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:26,638
and the thunder cut one of my heads,

401
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:29,919
I would have been an Upper God.

402
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,919
You must have been greedy for Jing Yang's divine power that you attracted everyone from Heavenly Palace.

403
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:39,439
Master's fire is quite precious.

404
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:43,739
You wasted his efforts in vain.

405
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:47,020
Being a god itself is quite dangerous.

406
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:52,420
You shouldn't punish me for my failure.

407
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,240
Now, punish me.

408
00:36:57,879 --> 00:37:01,140
Master values you.

409
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,760
I'm not the man to punish you.

410
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:07,990
It's just a pity.

411
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:11,438
Your Majesty, you don't have to be too sad.

412
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:16,419
Though I failed, Qing Mu gained nothing, either.

413
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:19,439
He was attacked by my Dragon's Breath.

414
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,279
He's just a lord.

415
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,918
Dragon's Breath will invade his spiritual vein.

416
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:31,420
Lord of the North Sea only has a few days left.

417
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,159
Qing Mu was attacked by your Dragon's Breath?

418
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,000
Three-head.

419
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,360
You don't have to tell Master.

420
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,839
Qing Mu never takes part in immortal-demon battles.

421
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,900
So I have never treated him as an enemy.

422
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,238
But he came to the Demon Realm to save Feng Ran.

423
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,999
And he stopped you from becoming a god.

424
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,719
Obviously, he is taking refuge in the Heavenly Palace.

425
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:05,739
He seems to be Master's acquaintance.

426
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:08,499
Now he's the owner of the Tai Cang Spear

427
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:10,958
and the First Lord of the Immortal Realm.

428
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:12,979
If he dies,

429
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:16,678
we demons will benefit from it.

430
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,999
Don't worry.

431
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,638
He stopped me from becoming a god.

432
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,839
I just want him to die at once.

433
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,499
I won't tell Master about this.

434
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:44,039
In front of us is Purple Pine Hall.

435
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,719
Qing Mu and I will report to Father God first.

436
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,878
You two rest here first.

437
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:52,778
If there is any inconvenience, just tell an immortal servant.

438
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,039
Your Second Highness, don't be so polite.

439
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,718
The palace is surrounded by immortal air.

440
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:58,620
We'll be comfortable.

441
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,638
Go.

442
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,199
Please.

443
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,039
It's a long way to go.

444
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,439
When I chased after Hou Chi, I also went through many setbacks.

445
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,420
My brother killed her family.

446
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,199
I'm afraid it will be more difficult for me and Feng Ran.

447
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,299
Don't talk about me.

448
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:23,939
Ever since you entered the Heavenly Palace, you seem worried.

449
00:39:23,939 --> 00:39:25,720
What's wrong?

450
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:32,360
I'm just worried that going to the Heavenly Palace will cause trouble for Hou Chi.

451
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:35,918
Though Jing Zhao is naughty,

452
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:40,378
if Father makes the decision, she won't bother you too much.

453
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,279
I hope so.

454
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,719
Qing Mu, I want to ask you something.

455
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,819
What's the matter?

456
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:49,878
Canceling the engagement will hurt my sister.

457
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:51,720
She's a proud girl.

458
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,339
Don't make her too embarrassed when you cancel the engagement.

459
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:59,000
I will. Don't worry.

460
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,919
Okay. Let's go.

461
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:03,399
Let's go.

462
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,619
What's wrong?

463
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:16,378
Fine. Let's go.

464
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:25,660
I know you have grudges in your heart.

465
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,599
But Jing Jian is kind to you.

466
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,999
Did you forget he protected you in the Swamp of Netherhill?

467
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,799
I'm grateful to him.

468
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,599
But he is Jing Yang's younger brother after all.

469
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,258
I'd better keep some distance from him.

470
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:39,678
- That's her. 
 - She seems to be Upper God Hou Chi.

471
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,079
Who is there? Being sneaky! Come out!

472
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,939
 Upper God Hou Chi. 

473
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:47,459
 Lordess Feng Ran. 

474
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:49,339
We're fairies in the Heavenly Palace.

475
00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:51,279
What are you doing here now?

476
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,939
Lordess Feng Ran, we're here to pay homage to Upper God Hou Chi.

477
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,338
Me?

478
00:40:59,338 --> 00:41:01,459
Your Highness is an Upper God.

479
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,359
But you've seldom appeared in the past 60,000 years.

480
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,779
Absurd!

481
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:07,279
Is Upper God Hou Chi some precious exotic beast?

482
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,438
Sorry for my words. Please punish me.

483
00:41:09,438 --> 00:41:12,199
Don't be afraid. You came to see me.

484
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:16,218
Now you've seen me. You should leave if there is nothing else.

485
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:31,390


486
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:41,319
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

487
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:48,300
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

488
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:54,619
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

489
00:41:54,620 --> 00:42:01,000
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

490
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,779
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

491
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:14,249
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

492
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:21,475
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

493
00:42:21,475 --> 00:42:28,175
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

494
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:45,379
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

495
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:51,859
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

496
00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:59,039
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

497
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:05,640
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

498
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:14,124
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

499
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:21,025
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

500
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:27,474
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

501
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:34,049
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

502
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:44,000
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
