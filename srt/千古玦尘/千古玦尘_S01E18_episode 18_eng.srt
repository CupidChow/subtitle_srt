1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,970


2
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:21,500
   

3
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,420
   

4
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,560
You're not keeping the door for your master.

5
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,080
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,920
Lord Dong Hua has invited Qingchi Palace to his birthday banquet.

7
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,400
As I'm in charge of Qingchi Palace, when God Gun Jun is away,

8
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,750
surely I'd be here for His Lordship's birthday.

9
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,270
What? The host isn't sending me away.

10
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,390
But an Upper Immortal of the Heavenly Palace is sticking his nose to it?

11
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,070
What's wrong with an Upper Immortal from the Heavenly Palace?

12
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,160
Listen. Lord Dong Hua is from the Heavenly Palace.

13
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,370
We're supposed to be in charge of Daze Mansion.

14
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,300
When you defy me,

15
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,500
you're defying the Heavenly Palace!

16
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,040
Now, does Qingchi Palace thinks it's above the Heavenly Palace?

17
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,060
Masters, please calm down.

18
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,980
Lordess Feng Ran came here on behalf of the Qingchi Palace, as our honored guest.

19
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,420
The Heavenly Palace shows how much it values

20
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,670
Daze Mansion by sending the lord and the princess.

21
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,710
Your courtesies are equally valued and appreciated by Lord Dong Hua.

22
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,550
Enough...

23
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,520
Lord Zi Yuan, it's just about a few drinks.

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,180
Calm down for my sake.

25
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,480
Your Highness,

26
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,940
I've found out something that has made me worried these days.

27
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,270
I should have reported it to His Majesty.

28
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,420
But now I request your judgment since Your Highness is here.

29
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,130
Lord Zi Yuan, what is it?

30
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,680
Your Highness,

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:54,340
I found that someone in our Immortal Realm is colluding with the Demon Clan!

32
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,640
 Who is it? 

33
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,600
- You're saying... 
 - It's Feng Ran!

34
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,130
Your Highness! My Immortal friends!

35
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:06,110
She colluded with the Demon Clan with hostile intentions to our realm!

36
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,370
Guards! Take Feng Ran!

37
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,990
Wait!

38
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,410
Princess Jing Zhao,

39
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,240
Qingchi Palace is separated from the three realms

40
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,590
and not under the governance of the Heavenly Palace.

41
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,920
Even His Majesty needs to figure things out before questioning me.

42
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,630
Now you're going to take me down without asking?

43
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,310
Isn't this overbearing?

44
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,630
We all know that the Immortal Realm is not compatible with the Demon Clan.

45
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,770
How can I stand by when you're suspected of colluding with it?

46
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,430
I need to defend our peaceful universe.

47
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,540
What a "peaceful universe."

48
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,520
Although I came from the Swamp of Netherhill,

49
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,470
I broke off all relations to the Demon Clan since I joined the Qingchi Palace.

50
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,840
Do you have any evidence that I colluded with them?

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,530
Your Highness. My Immortal friends.

52
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,320
My disciples were running errands at Qilian Mountain a few days earlier.

53
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,820
A demon from Qingchi Palace showed up and hurt them.

54
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,980
Besides that, they took away the birthday present I prepared for Lord Dong Hua.

55
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,060
The Fire Coral.

56
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,220
We know that Upper God Gu Jun is away most of the time

57
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,400
while the Little God doesn't care.

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,800
Undoubtedly, Qingchi Palace has been under your control for thousands of years!

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,260
Now there's a demon in your palace.

60
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,420
If you weren't colluding with them, who else could it be!

61
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,570
Nonsense! There is no demon in Qingchi Palace!

62
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,100
Don't waste your time arguing.

63
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,830
Wu Wang.

64
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,650
Yes.

65
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,780
This was caused by a demon.

66
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,400
How can you make your claim based on a single scar?

67
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,990
Even if it was caused by a demon, how can you prove that it's associated with Qingchi Palace?

68
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,120
Then how can you prove your innocence, saying it's a wrong accusation?

69
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,270
 He sounds so sure about all these made-up stories. 

70
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,080
 Does he have another purpose? 

71
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,740
Feng Ran, Qingchi Palace is separated from the three realms

72
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,170
and shouldn't be involved in the fight between the immortals and the demons.

73
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,140
I reckon that my father has given Qingchi fair treatment for years.

74
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,580
You shouldn't collude with the Demon Clan when Upper God Gu Jun is away.

75
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,510
Fair treatment?

76
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,990
The Heavenly Palace and we are on an even footing.

77
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,890
Why do we need your "fair treatment"?

78
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,890
Jing Zhao, you're taking your chance to bully Qingchi Palace while the Upper God is away.

79
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,170
This gesture... is too ugly.

80
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,260
Outrageous!

81
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,150
Do you want to put on airs as a princess? Go back to the Heavenly Palace!

82
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,630
Fine.

83
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,820
Feng Ran, you won't admit it, will you?

84
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,250
I knew it! It's fine.

85
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,620
Let me tell you. I left a mark on the Fire Coral.

86
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,400
It's easy to find out if that demon comes from the Qingchi Palace.

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,390
Do you want to have a try?

88
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,590
How is it?

89
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,630
Feng Ran, what can you say about it now?

90
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,420
What a coincidence. I came here for you.

91
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,400
Your disciples sneaked into Qingchi Palace and stole the Spiritual Water!

92
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,370
The proof is the Fire Coral!

93
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:09,000
I didn't expect that these wicked creatures lied about it!

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,540
Lord Zi Yuan, take her down!

95
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,920
Yes, Your Highness!

96
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,800
Let me see whether the isolated Lord of North Sea

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,130
can still be so insolent.

98
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,400
What's she doing?

99
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,940
He's so petty! He tied me in front of the Main Hall.

100
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,920
 No. My spiritual power is weak, 

101
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,700
 I'd bring trouble to Feng Ran if I entered unprepared. 

102
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,400
 When in danger, instill your immortal power into the bracelet. 

103
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,410
 It'll instantly increase your fighting force. 

104
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,180
 It'll come into effect quickly and get you out of danger. 

105
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,530
The Queen's Phoenix Feather Fan.

106
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,730
Jing Zhao, you're shameless!

107
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,630
Morality is useless when it comes to people like you!

108
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,250
Years ago when serving the Demon Realm you almost got my brother killed.

109
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,590
Now you're colluding with them to damage the Immortal Realm.

110
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,720
It's unforgivable!

111
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,840
Lord Zi Yuan, take her down!

112
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,380
Yes, Your Highness!

113
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,680
Your Highness.

114
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,280
After all, Lordess Feng Ran is the head of Qingchi Palace.

115
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,620
Even if that were true,

116
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,260
we need to report to the Upper God in Qingchi Palace before punishment.

117
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,680
It's well known that the Upper God has been traveling for thousands of years.

118
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,240
It's about the Demon Clan and the Heavenly Palace has to deal with it.

119
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,900
Your Highness, there's a younger Upper God in Qingchi Palace.

120
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,460
Xian Shan, you're not referring to the useless one. Right?

121
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,350
I heard that she's weaker than an earthly immortal.

122
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,030
Such strong spiritual power!

123
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,130
Why does it look so familiar?

124
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,470
How can such a small potato have a big say?

125
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,630
How dare you insult the Upper God in Qingchi Palace!

126
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,370
Shut it down. You're so close to death.

127
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,420
Anyway. I'll do you a favor.

128
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,220
 She looks completely different 

129
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,500
 and resembles the girl a lot in my dream. 

130
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,160
Master! Master!

131
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,400
Who are you? How dare you break into Daze Mansion,

132
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,620
injuring an immortal and disrupting the lord's birthday banquet?

133
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,050
Break into it?

134
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,820
Have a look, Lord Xian Shan.

135
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,960
Isn't it an invitation written by your master?

136
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,620
I'm not breaking into it. I'm invited.

137
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,320
Greetings. I'm Xian Shan.

138
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,180
Jing Zhao, you hurt the head of Qingchi Palace;

139
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,230
I just injured one of your upper immortals.

140
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,930
We can call it even, right?

141
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,880
You're Hou Chi?

142
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,120
No way.

143
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,300
How come Hou Chi has such strong power?

144
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,900
Greetings, Upper God Hou Chi!

145
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,600
Greetings! Upper God Hou Chi!

146
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,720
- Greetings! 
 - Greetings.

147
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,690
You said I was too much of a small fry to have a big say?

148
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,600
No, no. No, Upper God. I didn't say that.

149
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,230
I had no idea you were visiting here.

150
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,430
Please, for the sake of Heavenly Palace...

151
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,600
The Heavenly Palace?

152
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,360
You were just talking about how my palace is colluding with the Demon Clan.

153
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,960
And now you forget it? So soon.

154
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,110
I was just talking rubbish...

155
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,720
It's nonsense.

156
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Hou Chi, there's solid evidence against Feng Ran's collusion with the Demon Clan.

157
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,840
I'll send her to Heavenly Palace for interrogation despite your presence.

158
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,820
Will you?

159
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,910
Will you say it yourselves? Or I'll do it for you?

160
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,190
Spare me! Spare me!

161
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,100
I dare not tell lies.

162
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,600
I got this wound in Qingchi Palace.

163
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,720
How dare you say that?

164
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,960
What are you afraid of?

165
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,180
I'm right here and she won't be able to pervert what is right.

166
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,720
This wasn't caused by the Demon Clan.

167
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,880
They applied some spiritual water that can transform the wound.

168
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,360
Qing Mu, you mean...

169
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,200
The spiritual water is made from the scales of psychedelic fish in the bottom of the West Sea.

170
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,540
Applying the nectar of the Feihong flower to the wound will return it to its original shape.

171
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,310
There's always some nectar at Daze Mansion

172
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,720
since it's Lord Dong Hua's favorite served with refreshments.

173
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
I'll send someone to fetch it.

174
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,500
I lied to you!

175
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,420
I beg for your mercy!

176
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,080
You two need to confess now!

177
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,360
What happened to this wound?

178
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,550
We... We did it.

179
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,520
These two disciples sneaked into Qingchi Palace and stole from the Spiritual Spring.

180
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,600
The Upper God didn't punish them because they were young.

181
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,190
In addition to the theft, now they are smearing us in public

182
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,160
saying our palace colluded with the Demon Clan.

183
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,640
Now it turns out that they lied because they lost the Fire Coral.

184
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,530
You lied to me! I'll kill you!

185
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,880
Don't yell about killing people all the time.

186
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,700
Give it to him.

187
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,600
Upper God,

188
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,880
it's just some gadget. Please keep it if you like it.

189
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,480
I've got better stuff back at home.

190
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,920
It was careless of me to be fooled by these two little bastards.

191
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,430
Please forgive me!

192
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,420
Surely they'll be punished.

193
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,240
But you were slandering us and that's even worse.

194
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,860
This...

195
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,040
is for your denigration of me!

196
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,670
This is for your insult of Qingchi Palace!

197
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:26,260
This is for your stab in Feng Ran's back 10,000 years ago in the Swamp of Netherhill!

198
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,080
I beg for your mercy! I beg for your mercy!

199
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,890
Please! For the sake of Lord Jing Yang,

200
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,710
spare me!

201
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:45,530
Jing Yang... I forgot that you've got three royal members as your backup.

202
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,000
But if I decide to punish you,

203
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,220
even His Majesty can do nothing about it.

204
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,940
Hou Chi, stop bullying us!

205
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,670
Bother, she injured me and Lord Zi Yuan.

206
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,670
And this is...

207
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,420
Your Highness, this is Upper God Hou Chi from Qingchi Palace.

208
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,990
You're Upper God Hou Chi.

209
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,100
I wonder what Jing Zhao and Zi Yuan did wrong

210
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,860
- to make you inflict punishment. 
 - Brother.

211
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,160
Your Highness is here just in time.

212
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,460
When Jing Zhao directed Zi Yuan to frame us

213
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,890
for collusion with demons, you didn't show up.

214
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,460
But now when Upper God Hou Chi is going to punish them,

215
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,340
you're here to see justice served.

216
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,960
- I... 
 - It's not that serious.

217
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,210
But I'm still sorry about the rude welcome for your first visit.

218
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,520
I'm afraid I haven't been a very good host.

219
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,920
Your Highness, judging from what Zi Yuan just did,

220
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,820
I'm not sure if the long-term good relationship between the two palaces

221
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,400
should be continued.

222
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,480
Jing Zhao was reckless

223
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,630
and what Lord Zi Yuan did can never represent Heavenly Palace.

224
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,400
This is a huge misunderstanding.

225
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Your Highness, please ask His Majesty,

226
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,840
by the rules of Heaven what shall be done to him.

227
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,530
Hou Chi, you...

228
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:14,350
No worries, I'll report it to Father God today.

229
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,490
Let's go.

230
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,260
Wait.

231
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,300
I have something important to ask you.

232
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,620
May I have a word with you at the rear hall?

233
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,180
No.

234
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,160
Qing Mu.

235
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,960
Let's go to Bo Xuan's bamboo house.

236
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,450
I can't go much longer.

237
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,040
What exactly happened?

238
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,230
My power...

239
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,300
It's you again!

240
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,130
Lord Qing Mu, you keep badgering us. What do you want?

241
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,280
Lordess Feng Ran, I mean no harm.

242
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,570
Lord Qing Mu, I haven't punished you for your disrespect.

243
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,570
And now you come to us by yourself.

244
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,710
God Hou Chi, all I want is to ask you

245
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,100
why you look so familiar to me.

246
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,980
But I've been living alone in the North Sea for thousands of years.

247
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,640
Lecher!

248
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,220
That's enough.

249
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,370
I just want to figure things out.

250
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,840
You're ridiculous!

251
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,300
How can I know your feelings about me?

252
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,040
Fine.

253
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,670
Where's my sword?

254
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,200
Your sword was shattered into powder by my palm.

255
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,230
You didn't burn it?

256
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,510
Yes, I did. So what?

257
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:31,230
In case you don't know, the sword is very precious to me.

258
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,890
Much as it's precious to you, it's just a sword.

259
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,870
I grant you my mercy and forgive you for your disrespect to an Upper God.

260
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,650
You'd better take what you have and leave me alone.

261
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,780
What do you want?

262
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,690
I only want my sword back!

263
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,020
I got you.

264
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,590
Lord Qing Mu, these Spiritual Beads are enough for you to buy a new sword.

265
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,320
I want my sword.

266
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,630
You're so boring!

267
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,670
Your spiritual power...

268
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,300
- Hou Chi, are you all right? 
 - Feng Ran, let's go.

269
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,690
What happened?

270
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,500
I'm fine.

271
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,080
My God Sense was somehow damaged.

272
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,180
I saw that Zi Yuan was going to kill you, I was so desperate and used the bracelet.

273
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,420
But your power is even weaker than that of a spiritual beast.

274
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,840
How come a bracelet can defeat the Phoenix Feather Fan?

275
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,600
Besides, Bo Xuan's just a common immortal.

276
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,340
Where did he get such a powerful object?

277
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,440
He told me that the bracelet can enhance my power instantaneously.

278
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,290
I used it for the first time and it wore me down in around15 minutes.

279
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,230
It's true that one can never get anything he didn't earn.

280
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,050
And why does Lord of the North Sea pester you?

281
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,310
His flying sword once chased after me and tore my gown.

282
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,550
In sheer rage, I burned his Spiritual Sword.

283
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,690
Lord Zi Yuan, you belong to the Heavenly Palace.

284
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,310
Why are you on your knees? My father didn't even punish you.

285
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,990
Stand up.

286
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,870
It's just a little trick.

287
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,850
Don't do it, Jing Zhao!

288
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,140
Lord Sky Thunder is very reckless.

289
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,640
How dare he make thunder above Daze Mansion at this moment?

290
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,140
They bit off more than they could chew.

291
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,020
You did it?

292
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,620
I just placed a restraint on Zi Yuan.

293
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,050
The first who tries to remove it would be punished by Sky Thunder.

294
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,210
You did it on purpose, right?

295
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,120
In that hall, who would do that first except Jing Zhao?

296
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,620
How can I let her go after she stabbed you in the back?

297
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,050
Now I realize that being an Upper God is really good.

298
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,050
That's you! Devoted and protective.

299
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,450
I feel much better. Let's go and find Bo Xuan.

300
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,080
Let's go.

301
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,640
Brother!

302
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,940
Jing Zhao, are you... all right?

303
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,640
Your Highness has such strong spiritual power!

304
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,450
You triggered the Thunder by the restraint.

305
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,000
My Lord, Jing Zhao's young and bold,

306
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,840
and she's behaved recklessly. Please...

307
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,860
The princess is straightforward. No big deal.

308
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,990
My Lord, this is beyond my spiritual power.

309
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,000
We need your help.

310
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,900
Even you can't remove it?

311
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,320
I think I can remove it.

312
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,270
But God Hou Chi has placed such a strong restraint.

313
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,940
If I do it by force, I'm afraid...

314
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,030
Lord Zi Yuan would lose half of his spiritual power.

315
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,225
You're among the top immortals that have the best spiritual power.

316
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:46,600
Even you can only save half of his power,

317
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,420
I guess no one else in our realm can help.

318
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,480
I need to take Lord Zi Yuan to apologize to Father God and make amends.

319
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,760
Please remove the restraint on him.

320
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,240
Okay.

321
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,340
Master! Master!

322
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,840
My Lord, this happened so suddenly,

323
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,720
and now I have to leave with Lord Zi Yuan and return to Heavenly Palace to report to duty.

324
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,970
Wait.

325
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,320
Can I ask you something?

326
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,790
Sure.

327
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,280
This was my first time meeting the Lord of the North Sea.

328
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,840
And I wonder how you two know each other.

329
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,080
Qing Mu and I subdued a demon beast at the North Sea.

330
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,940
We've been practicing skills together and have gotten to know each other better.

331
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,180
Does he have other connections?

332
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,490
Qing Mu doesn't have parents and is a loner.

333
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,260
He seems not to have any friends, either.

334
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,880
Why? You seem to be curious about him.

335
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,280
Nothing.

336
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,920
I think he's a fine and promising young man. I'm just a little curious.

337
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,120
Your Highness should return to the Heavenly Palace now.

338
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,480
Please visit observation Mountain someday. We'll enjoy a drink.

339
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,500
I will take my leave.

340
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,140
Master.

341
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,650
What are you thinking of?

342
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,240
The God of Qingchi Palace, with the Lord of the North Sea,

343
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,130
remind me of my old acquaintances.

344
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,960
Do you think the Little God looked like Upper God Gu Jun?

345
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,760
No, she looks like someone else.

346
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,080
What about the Lord of the North Sea?

347
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,150
Such a big hill! It's been so long. Yet there's no sight of the bamboo House.

348
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,880
You and Bo Xuan come here a lot, right?

349
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,760
Yes. And every time he brought me to fly here.

350
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,420
Where is the bamboo house exactly?

351
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,580
I don't know, either.

352
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,600
It'll take too much time. I'll go and search around.

353
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,250
Wait here.

354
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,540
Why are there sword sounds?

355
00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:00,080
Why is there a huge sword grave here?

356
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,830
It's you.

357
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,200
I just saved your life. Don't I deserve a "thank you"?

358
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,800
Thank you? Sure.

359
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,200
Thank you for saving my life, Lord of the North Sea. I'm so grateful.

360
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,380
Someday I'll visit you in the North Sea with gifts.

361
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,960
- Enough? 
 - No.

362
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,380
What do you want exactly?

363
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,740
I've been wondering why you gave me a sensation of deja vu.

364
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,140
Now, I've gotten the answer.

365
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,440
You're going to say that we had mystical bonds? Again?

366
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,330
You feel the same way?

367
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,430
Your behaviors just make me feel that you're very shameless!

368
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,580
Except that I feel nothing.

369
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,680
In the past years, you're the only one that has been able to see this sword grave.

370
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,360
You play this again?

371
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,640
Who can ignore such a big sword grave? You're being ridiculous!

372
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,960
I'm telling the truth.

373
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,980
Last time I was here with Jing Jian right beside me,

374
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,780
yet he couldn't even hear the sword sound.

375
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,500
Maybe there's some restraint put on it,

376
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,240
that can only be seen by people with mystical bonds.

377
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,360
See, only for people with mystical bonds! There are bonds between us!

378
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,080
There's a bond between me and the sword grave. Not between us!

379
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,900
Don't you dare follow me!

380
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,380
I shouldn't have chased her using my sword.

381
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,150
I can never restore my image!

382
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,910
Where have you been?

383
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,050
Forget it.

384
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,740
Lord Qing Mu is haunting me!

385
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,740
I don't think he's annoying. Why do you detest him?

386
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,510
Jing Zhao fancies him.

387
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,630
And I want nothing to do with anyone who has connections to her.

388
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,550
And I found the bamboo house! Let's go!

389
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,660
It seems that no one has lived here in the past years.

390
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,130
Come on. Let's go inside.

391
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,630
Perhaps we can find some trace left by Bo Xuan when he lived here.

392
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,090
 I didn't know about this spot behind Observation Mountain. 

393
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,340
 Who's Bo Xuan? 

394
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,790
 Did she come here for him? 

395
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,090
Will he practice his spiritual skills here?

396
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,000
Besides Qingchi Palace, this is the only place that I can think of where Bo Xuan has stayed.

397
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,320
Where could he be since he's not here?

398
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,330
Someone has got drunk here.

399
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:06,510
Indeed, there's a trace that he once lived here.

400
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,360
I've never seen Bo Xuan using this fan.

401
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,740
Watch out!

402
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,080
Are you okay, Hou Chi?

403
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,500
I'm fine.

404
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,660
Purple Moon Fan?

405
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,270
You know it?

406
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,720
This is an object of Demon Lord Zi Yue.

407
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,770
Who is Demon Lord Zi Yue?

408
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,220
As the most mysterious demon lord in three realms,

409
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,260
he has power that is comparable to the Demon Emperor's.

410
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,240
Zi Yue is a mysterious existence in the Demon Realm

411
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,990
and he can help with the demons' cultivation.

412
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,910
Therefore, the Demon Clan respects him a lot.

413
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,840
This person was named after the Purple Moon (Zi Yue).

414
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,840
There must be some connections to the Purple Moon.

415
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,340
I don't know.

416
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,290
I heard that he wears a mask all day long

417
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,600
and nobody knows what he looks like.

418
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,480
He always wears a mask... Could he be...

419
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,690
You mean, Demon Lord Zi Yue is Bo Xuan!

420
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:09,260
Bo Xuan has never taken off his mask when in Qingchi Palace.

421
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,730
But he has been cultivating his immortal power!

422
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,830
No.

423
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,310
That isn't matching...

424
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,750
They share lots of similarities.

425
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,830
Demon Lord Zi Yue is mysterious and so is Bo Xuan.

426
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,710
Feng Ran, except for here,

427
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,880
I don't know where to find Bo Xuan.

428
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,590
Why don't we visit the Demon Clan and meet Demon Lord Zi Yue?

429
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:34,840
After all, the fan he left has given some clues.

430
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,110
I need to find Bo Xuan and see if he's safe.

431
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,900
Okay. I'll go with you.

432
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,380
Let's go.

433
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,290
Lord Zi Yuan violated the rules of Heaven and

434
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,080
now he's exiled to the mortal world

435
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
and can never come back to the Immortal Realm.

436
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,330
No... Your Majesty!

437
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,000
I beg for your mercy!

438
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,310
I made a huge mistake!

439
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:08,320
Please, for the sake of my hard work for the Heavenly Palace,

440
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,030
spare me!

441
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,870
You slandered the head of Qingchi Palace

442
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,300
and offended its Upper God.

443
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,170
You almost ruined the 10,000 years of good relations between the two palaces.

444
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,670
How can you stay here?

445
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,540
Guards! Take him away.

446
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,660
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

447
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,410
Your Highness! Please save me!

448
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,080
Please help me to beg for mercy, Your Highness!!

449
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,180
- Father God! 
 - Yang'er.

450
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,880
- Yang'er, back off! 
 - I've saved your life.

451
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,510
 Help me! Your Highness! 

452
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,280
He gave such a harsh imperial edict.

453
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,510
His Majesty is angry indeed.

454
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,850
Zi Yuan has been insolent and

455
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,330
now he gets what he deserves.

456
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,110
Brother...

457
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,260
Father God, today at Daze Mansion,

458
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,460
Hou Chi was so defiant and disregarded the Heavenly Palace.

459
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,210
I want to know if your punishment on Zi Yuan

460
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,160
would contribute to her arrogance and belittle us?

461
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,840
If it goes on like that,

462
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,410
how can the Heavenly Palace reign over the Immortal Realm?

463
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,420
How come you don't see it!

464
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,100
Zi Yuan set Jing Zhao against Hou Chi,

465
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,410
which almost provoked a fight between the two palaces.

466
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,920
I've already broken my own rules to show him some mercy with such a punishment.

467
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,350
Hou Chi also injured Zhao'er. How can you ignore that?

468
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:41,160
But Zhao'er hit Feng Ran.

469
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,750
Father God,

470
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,710
my brother was just upset seeing me injured in the fight.

471
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,240
Brother,

472
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,720
the dignity of an Upper God was enshrined in the rules.

473
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,560
We're in the wrong.

474
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,000
Don't upset Father God.

475
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,370
Whose side are you on!

476
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,860
Zi Yuan and I have a lifelong friendship.

477
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,720
Father God enforces the law impartially, they will praise you for being fair.

478
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,470
I just don't know how Luocha's generals will view this matter,

479
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:13,210
as the Heavenly Palace wouldn't show mercy even to the eldest prince's savior.

480
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,860
I'm afraid when word gets out,

481
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,470
no one would go all out serving us in the future.

482
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,090
Nonsense!

483
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,840
Guards!

484
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,620
Your Majesty.

485
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,230
Take Jing Yang to Sky Hall

486
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,600
and he shall be on his knees for three days.

487
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,900
Let all the immortals see how the eldest prince bends the law for personal gain.

488
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,390
 - Yes.  
 - Stop.

489
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,210
Come on.

490
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,620
We're not in the hall.

491
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,380
No need to be mad at Yang'er.

492
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,540
He just values his friendship.

493
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,260
He saw his best friend punished

494
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,090
and younger sister injured.

495
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,150
The anger went to his head.

496
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,760
That's why he said things inappropriately.

497
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,670
He'll figure it out

498
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:07,480
and look at the bigger picture.

499
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:16,390
Father God, my brother was stationed in Luocha for a long time.

500
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,690
Surely, he still behaves like a soldier.

501
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,980
Please don't be mad at him.

502
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,210
Father God, please don't blame him.

503
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,680
He's just looking out for the Heavenly Palace.

504
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,580
Do you admit that you were wrong?

505
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:47,060
Brother... He must have admitted it.

506
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,890
Go back to your hall.

507
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,460
You can't step out of it without my permission.

508
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,110
Yes, Father God.

509
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,960
The Heavenly Pillar is a holy object

510
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,170
that sits on the barrier between the Immortal and Demon Realms.

511
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:39,410
It was born when the mortal world took shape to measure spiritual power and rank its owners.

512
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,640
I can't see my name on the ranking.

513
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:52,160
It's just a legendary story, not necessarily the truth.

514
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,800
See, Demon Lord Zi Yue isn't on it, despite his fame in the Demon Realm.

515
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,510
You followed us?

516
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,700
Not really, I was just passing by.

517
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,300
Lordess Feng Ran.

518
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,100
Hou Chi!

519
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,010
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

520
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,130
Thank you.

521
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,080
Where did you get that bracelet?

522
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,750
This is exactly what I wanted to ask you.

523
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,610
Our bracelets must have been made by the same person.

524
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:31,200
Do you know the lord, Bo Xuan?

525
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,020
You're looking for him?

526
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,450
What do you have to do with him?

527
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,580
Do you know him or not?

528
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,030
I don't know him.

529
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,510
- Tricked me again? 
 - No, I didn't.

530
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,580
Are you all right?

531
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,450
Lord Qing Mu, what can we do to get rid of you?

532
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:50,300
Lordess Feng Ran, what can I do to be with you two?

533
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,180
Never, while I'm here.

534
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,910
Sorry.

535
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,000
Oh no. If we don't enter the barrier at the same time,

536
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,080
we'll arrive at different spots.

537
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,850
You'll do anything to get what you want, won't you?

538
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,160
I'm not that kind of person.

539
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,640
I just want to know about Bo Xuan, the one who gave you the bracelet.

540
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,790
You're capricious. Leave me alone.

541
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,170
The Blood Forest is the most dangerous place in the Demon Realm.

542
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,870
How can you find Demon Lord Zi Yue without me?

543
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:03,310
You eavesdropped on me and Feng Ran! Shame on you!

544
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,610
Are you still waiting for Feng Ran?

545
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,680
Don't you know people can't arrive at the same spot

546
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,520
unless they enter the barrier at the same time?

547
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,240
She's not here, which means she won't be here later.

548
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,850
You separated me and Feng Ran on purpose.

549
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,810
I had no other choice.

550
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:22,260
Don't you have a strange feeling when looking at me?

551
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,880
I do.

552
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,670
Feeling familiar?

553
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,510
Like some medicine...

554
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,800
- What is it? 
 - Some quack medicine!

555
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,370
Where is your reserved manner in front of Jing Zhao?

556
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,450
Why do you become so cheeky and full of nonsense when you're with me?

557
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,260
This lord doesn't speak to other lordesses.

558
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:45,920
And I don't know why I'm so interested in you.

559
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,830
Then it's your bad luck!

560
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,940
Say whatever you want.

561
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,680
And if we can find Bo Xuan together and prove that there isn't a bond between us,

562
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,650
I'll apologize and accept any punishment.

563
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,910
Punishment for being disrespectful.

564
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,560
I can prove that right now without Bo Xuan.

565
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,320
That is the point of our divergence. You go that way and I go this.

566
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,160
Is it that no matter what I say or do, I'm a bad guy?

567
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:16,210
Fine. I'll play the bad guy.

568
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,410
The Swamp of Netherhill?

569
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,840
Why am I in my homeland?

570
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,250
No. Triple Heaven is far away. It's where I can find Demon Lord Zi Yue.

571
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,470
I need to reach Hou Chi soon.

572
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,040
Are you looking for me?

573
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,350
Promise to go with me and I'll save you.

574
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,950
Yes?

575
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,090
It seems that the bracelet can't protect you all the time.

576
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,470
It's crispy outside and tender inside. It's best to eat it now.

577
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,050
I was wrong just now.

578
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:37,660


579
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:47,480
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

580
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:54,360
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

581
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:00,760
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

582
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,980
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

583
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:13,560
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

584
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:20,310
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

585
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:27,580
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

586
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:34,330
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

587
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,390
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

588
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:57,940
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

589
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:05,140
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

590
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:11,940
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

591
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:20,220
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

592
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:27,140
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

593
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:33,530
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

594
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:40,070
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

595
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:49,970
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
