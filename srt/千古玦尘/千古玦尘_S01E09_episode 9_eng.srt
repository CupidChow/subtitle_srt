1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:12,050


2
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:21,500
   

3
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,739
   

4
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:29,739
- How about you feed me a bite? 
 - Stop it.

5
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:32,410
How can a nine-clawed lotus hurt you?

6
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,438
You used to stamp on the nine-headed serpent and kill the giant roc with your bare hands.

7
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:38,480
Since when you've been that fragile?

8
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,718
I don't remember being that powerful. You must be getting old and have a bad memory.

9
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,719
Shang Gu, just feed me for once.

10
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
Why are you here? I didn't invite you.

11
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:01,998
Are you here for me?

12
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:05,070
The nine-clawed lotus that injured Tian Qi came from the East Pond of Abyss Hall

13
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,970
and had nothing to do with Gu Jun.

14
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,200
It's my fault. I'm here to apologize to you.

15
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,538
Is this the attitude of your apology?

16
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:15,139
I'm the one who got hurt.

17
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,800
It's up to you to accept it or not.

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,999
Tian Qi, you're broad-minded.

19
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:21,940
So forget the matter of the nine-clawed lotus.

20
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,720
Don't mention it again in the future.

21
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,210
Sit down.

22
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,019
All right. It's not a big thing. I don't care about it.

23
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,298
Anyway, I have something more important to do,

24
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:41,499
which is during this month to train Shang Gu's beloved disciple Gu Jun.

25
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,479
If so, Gu Jun will lose.

26
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,738
Why do you think so?

27
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,558
Shang Gu, let's do our best.

28
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:51,378
In a month, let the bad Ice Cube…

29
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,220
Dark Serene Land.

30
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,218
I'm willing to lend Dark Serene Land to help Gu Jun become a god.

31
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,179
I don't believe that you could be so kind.

32
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:09,219
This is the pill made I made for Gu Jun to break through the cold veins.

33
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,400
When did you make it?

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,470
How do you know that Gu Jun was born with the cold veins? Aren't you expecting him to lose?

35
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,458
Shang Gu is following me to cultivate,

36
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,860
Gu Jun's matter is naturally our Abyss Hall's matter.

37
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:27,639
Shang Gu, let's be ambitious.

38
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,619
It's just an elixir, I'll help you make it.

39
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:32,719
Who dares to take the elixir mixed with alcohol?

40
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,279
I swear that I won't drink for a month.

41
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:41,859
No one believe that.

42
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:44,019
- You… 
 - Here you are, Shang Gu.

43
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,139
I would like to thank you for Gu Jun.

44
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,160
You're welcome.

45
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,078
Shang Gu, I have something else.

46
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:57,158
Elixir, magic weapons, armor, and wine, I have all of them.

47
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:59,018
So there is no need to bother others.

48
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,899
Don't you dislike Gu Jun?

49
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,349
Why are you so merciful suddenly?

50
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,139
Are you going to grab someone?

51
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,339
Today, at midnight at Pilgrim Hall, I'll give you the key of the secret realm.

52
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,019
Shang Gu, you promised me last night.

53
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,440
You can't go back on your words.

54
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,440
What are you doing?

55
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,280
You two stop it.

56
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:27,078
Tian Qi, Dark Serene Land is indeed most suitable for Gu Jun to cultivate.

57
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,798
All right, don't explain.

58
00:04:33,798 --> 00:04:34,939
I don't want to hear that.

59
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,620
See you tonight at midnight.

60
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,199
Wait.

61
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,019
When we made the battle agreement, we only said that if Gu Jun were defeated,

62
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,779
I would go to the Netherworld immediately.

63
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,579
But we didn't say that if Gu Jun wins,

64
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,500
what I should do.

65
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:57,620
Right.

66
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,338
It happens that the four of us are here, let's discuss it together.

67
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,299
It looks like I'm making a fool of myself again.

68
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,400
Shang Gu.

69
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:27,720
Shang Gu.

70
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,049
Bai Jue, you've been focusing on your cultivation for so many years.

71
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:35,258
Shang Gu has been brought up by me and Zhi Yang.

72
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:38,349
So it's not up to you whether Shang Gu goes to the Netherworld.

73
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:41,039
Zhi Yang, am I right?

74
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:45,119
Where is he?

75
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:47,878
Master, something urgent happened in the Lower Realm.

76
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:50,280
True God Zhi Yang just left to deal with it.

77
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,120
That old man.

78
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,559
Are you okay?

79
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,639
It doesn't matter. Your swordsmanship is really good.

80
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,579
Her Royal Highness is really right about you.

81
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:41,159
But what's the use of good swordsmanship?

82
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,799
I was born with cold veins and my spiritual power is in disarray,

83
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:47,959
so my path of cultivation is thousand times harder than others.

84
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,258
Don't lose heart.

85
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,179
Now that you've joined Pilgrim Hall, and Her Royal Highness values you so much,

86
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,559
naturally, she will try to help you achieve your cultivation as soon as possible.

87
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:59,558
If you need, you can ask me to practice swords with you anytime.

88
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:01,178
Thank you, Wu Huan.

89
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:05,978
Before, in the Phoenix Clan, I was just an inferior colorful phoenix.

90
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:09,299
Fortunately, Her Royal Highness promoted me to become what I am today.

91
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:13,298
I'm sure you can stand out one day.

92
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,649
I don't care about that.

93
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,019
Master, she doesn't dislike my background and treats me sincerely,

94
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:21,900
so I just want to fight for her.

95
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:26,780
Why are you practicing before I have arrived?

96
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,179
Lordess Wu Huan.

97
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,538
Then you can practice, I'm leaving now.

98
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:38,698
Lordess Wu Huan, wait a minute.

99
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:46,878
I see that you usually take care of Pilgrim Hall, which is really hard work.

100
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,858
This is the hot spring mud of the Golden Dragon Clan from our Mountain Tianci.

101
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:55,438
Turn it into spiritual water and put it on your skin for a nourishing effect.

102
00:07:55,438 --> 00:07:57,799
I bring it for you to have a try.

103
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:15,899
Thank you, Lord Mu Guang.

104
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,978
But in the future, please don't do that for me especially.

105
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:39,338
Thank God, you're finally smiling.

106
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:43,779
If you hadn't stopped me, I really would have fought with that Ice Cube.

107
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:46,118
It's not a festival, why did you set off fireworks?

108
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:50,818
As long as you are happy, I can set off the fireworks for you every day.

109
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:54,758
Save these words from story scripts to cheat other female gods.

110
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:58,009
Shang Gu, are you really stupid or pretending to be confused?

111
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:03,339
During so many years, can't you tell what feelings I have for you?

112
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,818
Shang Gu, I like you very much.

113
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:16,180
All the gods are witnesses, it's true.

114
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,539
Shang Gu, don't you have any…

115
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:28,809
Tian Qi, I've always regarded you as my brother.

116
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,900
I have never…

117

 ♫ How many memories are written for you ♫ 

118
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,718
It's windy here, I didn't hear what you said just now.

119
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:39,178
- Shang Gu, I'll see you tomorrow. 
 - Tian Qi.

120
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,099
I don't know what the feeling of being in love with each other is,

121
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,620
but I know the pain of not being able to get it.

122
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,259
You are the most important brother to me.

123
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:54,599
Since I am so important to you,

124
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:58,618
why can't the person you like be me?

125
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:00,170

All right, I'm teasing you.

128

Shang Gu, I like you.

129
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,618
It's enough to tell you this.

130
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:17,179
You can reject me, but you can't keep me away.

131
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:20,700
No matter 10,000 or 100,000 years,

132
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,500

Tian Qi, why do you want to suffer like that?

136
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,258
Right, of course, I'm suffering,

137
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:42,499
suffering so much.

138
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,078
Shang Gu, don't worry. I'll be your brother forever.

No matter what happens between us and what we go through,

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,760
It's almost midnight.

145
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,960
You came just in time. When the contest is over, please leave the God Realm yourself,

146
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,939
and don't let me expose your crimes in public.

147
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,099
I don't know why you said that.

148

If I am wrong, please tell me.

149
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,660
 What on earth did I do wrong? 

150
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,059
 Why are you just so cold to me? 

151
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,158
Bai Jue, I have something for you.

152
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,760
The thing about Shang Gu.

153
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:46,258
It's already midnight, why isn't Bai Jue here?

154
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,978
Your Royal Highness, have a cup of tea to calm down.

155
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:56,519
Master, in fact, I've had cold veins for more than ten years, so I'm already used to it.

156
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,339
Master, you don't have to care so much about it.

157
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,589
Since Bai Jue promised to lend Dark Serene Land,

158
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,419
there is no reason to break his words.

159
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,479
He will do what he promised.

160
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,939
If Master Bai Jue really changes his mind, it's my fate.

161
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:13,780
Just forget it.

162
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,318
Don't worry. Bai Jue will never go back on his promise.

163
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,219
This is the cloud fairy grass of our Phoenix Clan.

164
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,859
I make it into a sachet.

165
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,618
Wearing it on your body can suppress cold veins.

166
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:39,698
Although it's less effective than Dark Serene Land,

167
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,578
it is better than none.

168
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,298
Wu Huan, you're so kind to me. I really…

169
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:45,859
Don't say that.

170
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,819
Practice hard. If you can defeat Goddess of Snow this time,

171
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:52,179
it will be a winning glory for our Pilgrim Hall.

172
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,680
Here you are.

173
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,079
Don't worry, I won't let you down.

174
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,138
Zhi Yang is very busy now, but you're so drunk

175
00:14:10,138 --> 00:14:12,200
which is not proper.

176
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,939
I feel so sad, so I drink wine to activate my blood.

177
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,758
What? Are you going to fight with me?

178
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:25,339
That's what I want to do.

179
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,578
Helping you sober up. You're welcome.

180
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:33,819
I know that my being close to Shang Gu makes you unhappy.

181
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,138
You are jealous.

182
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,320
That's nonsense.

183
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,600
Unexpectedly, I didn't expect that True God Bai Jue would be like this.

184
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,058
You seem to be so tough on the surface,

185
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,979
but in fact, you are a wimp,

186
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,359
even not as brave as I am.

187
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,740
At least I dare to love, hate, and confess,

188
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:04,179
living more comfortably than you.

189
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,679
Shang Gu was born to be a Chief God, sooner or later she will be in charge of it.

190
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,258
The seven emotions to her are just a drop in the ocean of life,

191
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:17,039
which doesn't matter.

192
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,698
Are you trying to convince me or yourself?

193
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:25,618
As long as she can cultivate well and live well,

194
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:27,659
then that is enough for me.

195
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,238
That's enough for you, but what about for Shang Gu?

196
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:41,439
Bai Jue, I really think you are pathetic and selfish,

197
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:43,819
but not worthy of sympathy.

198
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,699
 I've been waiting for you for so many years, 

199
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:16,379
 but all you have done is for Shang Gu. 

200
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,579
 Bai Jue. 

201
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:26,139
Bai Jue, where are you?

202
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:27,498
Bai Jue.

203
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:28,980
Shang Gu.

204
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:36,799
- Sorry. 
 - Gu Jun and I have been waiting for you for a long time.

205
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:42,738
I promise you, if Gu Jun wins, you won't have to go to the Netherworld.

206
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,120
Really?

207
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,739
That depends on you.

208
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,399
Don't worry. I will urge Gu Jun to intensify his cultivation.

209
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,080
Same goes for me.

210
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,439
I will definitely defeat Gu Jun,

211
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,780
and see how you end up in front of the gods.

212
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,659
Thunder clouds are gathering.

213
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,200
Gu Jun, this is your ordeal.

214
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,138
Gu Jun, hold on. There are five left.

215
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,019
Master!

216
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:02,098
Her Royal Highness is in danger. How about we…

217
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,319
I believe she can do it herself.

218
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:19,400
 ♫ Who's standing on the cloud alone a millennium ago ♫ 

219
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:26,300
 ♫ The snow on the top of the mountains hasn't melted in years ♫ 

220
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,799
 ♫ Like the moon without dust ♫ 

221
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,199
 ♫ Risking your life to save the world ♫ 

222
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:41,579
 ♫ By swinging the sword and breaking the clouds ♫ 

223
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,299
Thank you, Master, for helping me become a god.

224
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,799
I didn't expect that the thunder ordeal of a god promotion would be so difficult.

225
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:56,799
 ♫ Leaving the figure wandering in old dreams ♫ 

226
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,118
 ♫ After thousands of tribulations ♫ 

227
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:02,098
 How lucky I am. 

228
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:04,299
 Even the thunders couldn't strike me. 

229
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,299
 ♫ You seem to be in front of me ♫ 

230
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,858
 ♫ You seem to be far away from me ♫ 

231
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:12,998
Then before…

232
00:21:12,998 --> 00:21:18,000
 ♫ Even suffering a lot, I am happy ♫ 

233
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,200
 ♫ You seem to be in front of me ♫ 

234
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,099
 ♫ You seem to be far away from me ♫ 

235
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:28,700
 ♫ Use the sword to break fate, 
cross the mountains and seas for you ♫ 

236
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,158
Master blocked the thunders for Her Royal Highness,

237
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:33,298
it seems that she has not forgotten that.

238
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:35,540
She's learned a lot.

239
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,920
   

240
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,579
Yue Mi.

241
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,879
Why are you so happy today?

242
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:02,800
Good news. Gu Jun finally broke through his cold veins and became a god.

243
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,999
If he wins the contest, I won't have to go to the Netherworld.

244
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:07,740
That's great. There's finally one happy thing today.

245
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,378
Just in case, I also taught him some sophisticated stunts.

246
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:12,278
He said he was confident to win the contest.

247
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:15,778
If so, I will be able to stay with you every day.

248
00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:17,878
You mean Bai Jue, right?

249
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,259
I don't want to get in his way.

250
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,879
What's wrong?

251
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,278
You just said that there's finally one happy thing today.

252
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:31,118
Is it all bad today?

253
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:34,098
Not only today, but it has also been a while.

254
00:22:34,098 --> 00:22:37,098
Every day in the Lower Realm, gods and immortals die inexplicably.

255
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:39,378
Even the heavenly soldiers are suffering,

256
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:41,619
and it's about to harm me.

257
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:44,700
Did the devils do it?

258
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,119
You'd better ask Zhi Yang.

259
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,799
But now I finally understand that

260
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,360
Bai Jue also has his own reasons for letting you go to the Netherworld to cultivate

261
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,019
and urging you to refine the Power of Chaos.

262
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,399
How many years have you fought for the spiritual veins?

263
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:17,799
 And how many of your clansmen have died? 

264
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,180
- Your Royal Highness. 
 -  Why don't you stop? 

265
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,699
Why is Zhi Yang so angry?

266
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:27,919
Master is worried about the dispute over the seven islands, so please don't go in.

267
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,559
 I know that in order to block the broken barrier, 

268
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,679
you have few spiritual veins left.

269
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,840
 And both of you are at the end of your tether. 

270
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,218
 If this problem is not solved… 

271
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:40,360
Why are there so few spiritual veins left?

272
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,179
Now the whole three realms are waiting for you

273
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:46,199
to take over the post of Chief God.

274
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:48,479
Because the Power of Chaos of the Lower Realm has collapsed,

275
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:52,800
the distribution of the spiritual energy of the whole three realms is out of balance.

276
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,359
Gu Jun, congratulations.

277
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,779
You've really made great progress.

278
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,320
Thanks to the help of master in Dark Serene Land,

279
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,519
I was able to successfully become a god.

280
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,059
Wu Huan,

281
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,939
also thank you for your sachet.

282
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:20,839
The sachet is of little use.

283
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,440
It's not worth mentioning.

284
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,058
By the way, tomorrow you will be in a contest with Goddess Xue Ying.

285
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,560
Don't let Her Royal Highness down.

286
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,379
Don't worry, I will live up to you and Master.

287
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,719
You've been used to using spells long ago,

288
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:13,499
but I made it in Swamp of Netherhill.

289
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:41,320
You cheated.

290
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,619
You've just been promoted to god, how can you have such a powerful divine sense?

291
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:48,058
Goddess of Snow, if you can't afford to lose, just say it.

292
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:53,078
I didn't use any of the tactics you used in your duel with my master.

293
00:27:53,078 --> 00:27:55,619
So I can't afford your charge of cheating.

294
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,019
Today, I was lucky to win,

295
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,479
so please Master Bai Jue withdraw your order

296
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:05,339
for my master to go to the Netherworld.

297
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,900
I have my own decision.

298
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,460
Shang Gu,

299
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,859
you should also intensify your cultivation in the God Realm.

300
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:19,378
Goddess of Snow, now that you have lost,

301
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:21,700
is it your time to keep your words?

302
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,499
Forget it. I will forgive you today.

303
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,579
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

304
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:34,200
Wait!

305
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,900
Your Royal Highness,

306
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,199
not long ago, in Everlasting Hall, there have been cases of arson

307
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:41,999
and the nine-clawed lotus wounding case.

308
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:45,099
I've checked it out and want to expose one person to you.

309
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:49,338
Hong Ri, wasn't it the conflict of several immortals that day?

310
00:28:49,338 --> 00:28:50,919
Zhong Li. Xia Hui.

311
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:53,439
Come out to confess quickly!

312
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:55,919
Your Master, it's her.

313
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,619
It was Goddess Xue Ying who suggested to us

314
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:01,219
to steal nine-clawed lotus from the East Pond of Abyss Hall to trap Gu Jun.

315
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:03,400
Goddess of Snow disregarded the laws so much,

316
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,220
please four true gods to deal with her according to the law.

317
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,238
Master, I was wrong.

318
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:11,138
I shouldn't disrespect Her Royal Highness.

319
00:29:11,138 --> 00:29:12,879
Master, I know I'm wrong.

320
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:14,820
Don't call me master again.

321
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,038
Because of your achievements in the war of gods and demons,

322
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:20,859
I will just punish you to be expelled from the God Realm

323
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,799
and exiled to the Netherworld to guard the barrier.

324
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,758
Zhong Li. Xia Hui. You are also expelled from the God Realm,

325
00:29:25,758 --> 00:29:26,978
and cannot enter again.

326
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:28,299
Hurry up!

327
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,879
Get up!

328
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,118
So many things have happened today,

329
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:50,559
and I don't want to make it worse.

330
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,959
In fact, no matter whether win or lose today,

331
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:56,039
I've already decided to go to the Netherworld immediately.

332
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,118
Until my divine power is completed,

333
00:29:58,118 --> 00:30:00,378
I won't return to the God Realm.

334
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:02,579
Shang Gu, don't do that.

335
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,279
10,000 years ago, I was born at Universe Pavilion.

336
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,840
I'm embarrassed to bear the false name of Chief God.

337
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,439
Even when Xuan Yi was in power,

338
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,860
he could protect the God Realm.

339
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,359
But my divine power is mediocre,

340
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,700
and I've never made any contribution to the three realms.

341
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,879
Maybe Goddess of Snow doesn't respect me for this.

342
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,719
Even if the three realms are handed over to me now,

343
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:38,579
I think you all will be worried. Right?

344
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,758
Therefore, I decided to cultivate in the Netherworld alone,

345
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,780
refining until the Power of Chaos is achieved,

346
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,139
to protect the safety of the three realms.

347
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,999
I may never grow up around you.

348
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,959
The three realms are so big, it's time for me to go out and take a look.

349
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:07,700
1,000 years is very short.

350
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:09,719
Wait for me.

351
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:57,518
Who are you?

352
00:31:57,518 --> 00:31:59,398
How dare you break into the Devil Realm?

353
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:01,360
Do you think your life is too long,

354
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,160
so you can come here to court your death?

355
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,560
If you want to kill me,

356
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,339
you need to have the ability.

357
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,700
She's going for the Demon King.

358
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,520
Let her go.

359
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,900
Shang Gu.

360
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,699
Shang Gu, I found some good story scripts in the Lower Realm.

361
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,158
Let's read them together.

362
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:51,840
Shang Gu.

363
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:57,680
My bad memory.

364
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,319
She's gone to the Netherworld for cultivation.

365
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,480
What are you doing?

366
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,619
You scared me.

367
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:33,560
Well, let me tell you the truth.

368
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,609
Shang Gu is has gone to the Netherworld for 1,000 years.

369
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:37,099
Without these things to accompany her,

370
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,659
I'm worried that she will be bored.

371
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,899
So I secretly came to bring her some toys and letters.

372
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:44,439
I almost forgot this.

373
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,919
You're the stumbling block to Shang Gu's success.

374
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,900
Bai Jue has worked so hard to teach her,

375
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,799
but you're always making trouble.

376
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:56,399
Look at you. What are these?

377
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,879
I'm just missing her, okay?

378
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:03,618
Ice Cube Bai let Shang Gu cultivate alone,

379
00:34:03,618 --> 00:34:05,399
will Shang Gu suffer a lot in the Netherworld?

380
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,540
Of course, she will.

381
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,179
But Bai Jue forgot that who brought Shang Gu up.

382
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,800
The god brought up by Master Tian Qi

383
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,500
is not easy to suffer a hard life.

384
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,959
That's true.

385
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,519
But as Shang Gu left, I feel empty in my heart.

386
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:28,019
Although she left to culltivate,

387
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:30,860
I still can't help but want to find her.

388
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,120
Don't you have anything serious to do?

389
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:36,458
No. Do you?

390
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:44,758
Come on. Let me show you my business.

391
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:46,520
Where are we going?

392
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,139
Why did you bring me here?

393
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,599
That's Altair.

394
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,359
That's Vega.

395
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,280
I know.

396
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Ancestral God punished them

397
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,360
so that they can't be reunited for many years.

398
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,650
It was really cruel.

399
00:35:04,659 --> 00:35:07,278
How about letting them reunite as soon as possible

400
00:35:07,278 --> 00:35:09,319
when Shang Gu becomes Chief God?

401
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:11,519
Although they can only see each other once a year,

402
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:14,879
they had many children, who are all left to Altair.

403
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,999
Vega only needs to enjoy life every year

404
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:18,338
without bearing the pain of raising children.

405
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:19,600
So she is very happy.

406
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,639
She is not as suffering as they say.

407
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,879
Can that be okay?

408
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:25,259
Why not?

409
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,399
As long as the couple have decided who will take charge of the house,

410
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:31,319
then it's all their own business, no one else can doubt.

411
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:35,279
What you said makes sense.

412
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,800
But sometimes when I see that they miss each other so much,

413
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,978
I secretly arrange for them to meet when no one notices.

414
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:49,679
I like your unruly temper.

415
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,660
Would you like to play chess with me?

416
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,460
Where are the pieces?

417
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:08,439
I didn't know that the usually fierce Goddess Yue Mi had such a leisurely mood.

418
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:10,979
- Will you play or not? 
 - Let's play.

419
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,278
You're here finally.

420
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:34,899
What?

421
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:36,699
Aren't you afraid of death?

422
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,360
I checked the ancient books before I came.

423
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,799
The reason why Bai Jue asked me to cultivate here

424
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:44,599
is that God Slayer Flower will release Aura of Chaos during its flowering period.

425
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,300
Only the Chief God in this world can absorb it to help me become the Power of Chaos.

426
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:49,839
The flower blooms for 1,000 years

427
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,359
and so does the cultivation for 1,000 years.

428
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:55,960
Right. But Bai Jue still left behind one treasure.

429
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,600
The shores of the Netherworld, the source place of the Guardian.

430
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,099
Looks like you did work hard.

431
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:06,599
I entered the Netherworld to cultivate my divine power.

432
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,579
I won't leave until it is completed.

433
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:10,759
As for coming to see you,

434
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:14,499
I want you to help me lay a barrier on the border of the Netherworld,

435
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:17,840
which can't even be broken by a god.

436
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,998
Are you afraid that those three will regret

437
00:37:19,998 --> 00:37:22,279
and drag you back to the God Realm?

438
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,339
I am afraid that I can't hold on to myself and count on others,

439
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:29,230
coveting the comfort of the God Realm.

440
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,939
You are still so honest.

441
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:36,558
I can help you, but you have to meet two requirements of mine.

442
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:38,119
What are they?

443
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,709
Our devils have always been bloodthirsty,

444
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:42,219
and the border of the Netherworld is guarded by countless devils,

445
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,478
even Bai Jue can't get any advantage when he comes.

446
00:37:45,478 --> 00:37:47,879
So your life in the Netherworld is up to you.

447
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:50,198
I won't be kind to you.

448
00:37:50,198 --> 00:37:52,399
My life is not so easy to take.

449
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:54,679
What's your second requirement?

450
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:58,998
I'm too lonely in the Netherworld,

451
00:37:58,998 --> 00:38:04,160
so I want you to come here often and chat with me.

452
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,600
I'm locked up like this,

453
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,840
are you still afraid that I will eat you?

454
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,899
If I die, then I can not chat with you.

455
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:17,700
You are so cute that I really can't bear to kill you.

456
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,639
Once my barrier is set,

457
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,899
unless you refine into a Chief God,

458
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,379
you can never get out of the Netherworld.

459
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,019
Have you thought it through?

460
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:34,859
I have never been so clear in my life as of now.

461
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,600
 Greetings Master Tian Qi. 

462
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:49,819
Master Tian Qi, just now, Her Royal Highness ordered that no one should enter the Netherworld.

463
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:51,160
Go away.

464
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,420
I'm going to cultivate with Shang Gu.

465
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,998
Now, do you know how dangerous the Netherworld is?

466
00:39:20,998 --> 00:39:24,039
What we should do now is to respect Shang Gu's decision.

467
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:26,420
I'm not like you, full of excuses.

468
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,779
I can't watch Shang Gu take risks.

469
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,098
Zhi Yang, hurry up,

470
00:39:31,098 --> 00:39:34,119
break the barrier with me to bring Shang Gu back.

471
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:36,359
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

472
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:38,639
38 gods have died this month.

473
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:40,579
When Shang Gu volunteered to go to the Netherworld,

474
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:45,078
I wondered that if we had delayed her growth by indulging her too much.

475
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:47,738
In fact, Shang Gu is stronger than we thought.

476
00:39:47,738 --> 00:39:50,259
If we take her out of the Netherworld now,

477
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,560
wouldn't it be a hindrance to her?

478
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:59,619
You'd better pray for her to be safe and sound.

479
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,099
Master, the separation of spirit will greatly consume the source of divine power

480
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:19,679
and will also damage life. Are you sure you should do this?

481
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:22,879
As long as she is safe, not to mention 10,000 years of life,

482
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,400
even if it is 100,000 years, it doesn't matter.

483
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,439
Don't worry, Master,

484
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:30,399
I'll stay here to protect your real body.

485
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:32,179
Please you must be very careful.

486
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,858
If the devils or Xuan Yi find your spirit,

487
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:36,459
your body will also be destroyed.

488
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,460
I know.

489
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:33,820


490
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,219
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

491
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:50,099
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

492
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:56,300
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

493
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:02,699
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

494
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:09,599
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

495
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:15,899
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

496
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:23,299
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

497
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:30,000
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

498
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:48,499
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

499
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:55,000
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

500
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:02,100
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

501
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:08,500
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

502
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,299
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

503
00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:24,200
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

504
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:30,579
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

505
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:37,200
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

506
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:46,900
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
