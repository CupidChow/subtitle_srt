1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:13,000


2
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:21,450
   

3
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,090
   

4
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,908
Tian Qi, no matter what your difficulty is,

5
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:32,949
at least I'm on your side.

6
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,868
Come back with me.

7
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:37,829
We can tackle all the tough tasks in the world.

8
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,000
Bai Jue, Zhi Yang, and Shang Gu are also waiting for you.

9
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:48,948
Since you left, Shang Gu has never smiled again.

10
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:51,868
The other gods punish her daily.

11
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,649
Don't you care about her feelings anymore?

12
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,349
In the God Realm, you followed me every day.

13
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:04,949
Now I look down upon you more for your behavior.

14
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,348
I'll say it again.

15
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:10,779
Get out!

16
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,990
Don't let me see you again.

17
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,068
You're lying!

18
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,809
Since we were children, you'd avoid looking at my eyes when you cheated me.

19
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:22,249
Tell me!  What happened?

20
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:23,868
Is it about Shang Gu?

21
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:25,228
Maybe...

22
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,629
- Maybe I can... 
 - What can you do?

23
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:33,189
With your little courage, would you dare help me turn against the gods?

24
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,409
Tell me!  Why do you start the Array of World Destruction?

25
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,269
If it is really related to Shang Gu...

26
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,228
My business can't be solved by anyone.

27
00:02:45,228 --> 00:02:46,949
So what?

28
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,219
In these years, how many difficulties have we been through together?

29
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,989
If you hadn't been tried, how would you know I can't help?

30
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:57,989
Yue Mi, neither of us is naive or young.

31
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,528
If I let you in, you will be harmed.

32
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,829
Then do it.

33
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:10,410
I'm not afraid of even death, not to mention the things about you.

34
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,789
- But... 
 - There is no "but,.

35
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:16,510
Hundreds of thousands of years have passed, we were born,

36
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,859
grew up, and fought together.

37
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,269
How many times have we faced life-and-death moments together?

38
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,499
How many times have we got drunk together?

39
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,250
How many times have we seen forever separation together?

40
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,409
Actually, I like...

41
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,769
Yue Mi!

42
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:46,769
Yue Mi! Yue Mi.

43
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,489
Goddess Yue Mi.

44
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,428
I meant to stop the Demon God from destroying the world.

45
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:04,709
I'm killing you!

46
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:07,429
No.

47
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,429
Don't let Shang Gu hate you.

48
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:21,110
Yue Mi.

49
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:29,028
 ♫ How many times, how many changes ♫ 

50
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:30,429
No.

51
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,429
Don't pay meaningless efforts.

52
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,628
My divine core power has been destroyed.

53
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:38,108
It's impossible, her power is weaker than a half-god's!

54
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:41,130
How could she destroy your core power?

55
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,809
Shang Gu was right.

56
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,010
A god's life is too long.

57
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,188
As long as it is,

58
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,829
it's not enough to be wasted by me like this.

59
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,389
I just wanted to tell you

60
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,709
that I know you love Shang Gu.

61
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,429
But I'm reluctant to give you up.

62
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,269
Being friends with a person I love

63
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,649
is really hard.

64
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,908
I love you.

65
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:19,009
I can finally speak out today.

66
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:21,068
I knew it.

67
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:23,310
I always knew.

68
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,248
But I was worried about losing you as friends if I refused you.

69
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:32,469
So these years, I pretended not to know about your love.

70
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:34,549
Yue Mi, it's my fault.

71
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,448
I'm selfish, I'm greedy. I don't deserve your love.

72
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:43,788
It's me to decide if you deserve it or not.

73
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:47,628
Being held by you like this...

74
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,228
Let me take you back to the God Realm now.

75
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,670
They must know how to save you.

76
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,469
I'm out of power.

77
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,210
The Array of World Destruction is almost finished.

78
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,908
Don't keep the people suffering.

79
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:05,708
Stop it. I'm begging you not to say it anymore. I'm taking you back now.

80
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,188
It's too late.

81
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:11,109
Tian Qi, live well.

82
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,048
Live a good life. For my sake.

83
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:26,929
Today, I'm really, really, happy.

84
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:36,670
 ♫ Let me be the shadows and light in your eyes ♫ 

85
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:42,149
Yue Mi. Yue Mi.

86
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:48,009
 ♫ Waiting for the time to meet again in your eyes ♫ 

87
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:53,488
 ♫ Exchange a lifetime for a second of encounter ♫ 

88
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,010
Yue Mi... Yue Mi!

89
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:05,810
 ♫ I'm willing to indulge in the long passing years ♫ 

90
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,389
 ♫ Waiting for the teardrops to shed a smile ♫ 

91
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,850
Yue Mi! You died because of me.

92
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:18,349
If I can't protect Shang Gu, wouldn't my life be meaningless?

93
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:24,390
 ♫ ...to be trapped in your heart forever ♫ 

94
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,180
It's impossible.

95
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:02,030
The star has faded. Has Master...

96
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,908
Master, why has the star faded?

97
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:32,050
No way.

98
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:34,250
It's impossible.

99
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,569
Absolutely impossible.

100
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:41,690
No way.

101
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,069
 Just wait, 

102
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:56,548
 wait for me to bring this fool back. 

103
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:00,470
 He should be punched seriously to release your anger. 

104
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:15,048
Wu Huan, why were you inside?

105
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:16,789
Have you seen my master?

106
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,929
Master Bai Jue, the Demon God killed Goddess Yue Mi to sacrifice her god's blood for his array.

107
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,589
The Array of World Destruction is being finished.

108
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,689
It's impossible. Master Tian Qi would never kill Goddess Yue Mi.

109
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:28,628
What happened inside?

110
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:29,988
How did Yue Mi die?

111
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:33,208
If there is any falsehood, I won't spare you.

112
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,429
Master, it was the Demon God.

113
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:39,529
He pushed the Goddess Yue Mi into the center of the array in person.

114
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:43,308
I saw Goddess Yue Mi's divine power collapse

115
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:45,988
and her core power be totally destroyed by the array.

116
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:51,068
I wanted to save her, but the Demon God nearly killed me.

117
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:55,969
Goddess Yue Mi saved me with her last breath,

118
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:59,149
or else, I couldn't have escaped.

119
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,949
Wu Huan!

120
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,308
Just as expected, the Demon God killed my master.

121
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:14,550
Sen Jian, go!

122
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,348
Tell my master that we can't hold on. Let him go quickly!

123
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,739
Everyone, stop.

124
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,188
This case hasn't been cleared yet.

125
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:34,488
If you don't want to die here, just keep the array together.

126
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:36,549
Hong Ri, keep an eye on them.

127
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:37,809
Don't fight against each other.

128
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,188
Yes.

129
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:41,290
Keep the array.

130
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:45,908
Tian Qi, I can't believe you sacrificed her life for the array.

131
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:50,339
We won't let you leave even if we die today.

132
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:02,350
Master Tian Qi, I will protect you well even risking my life.

133
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:14,489
- Master. 
 - You've fulfilled your responsibility today.

134
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:16,508
When the day we rebuild the realms,

135
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,809
Sen Jian, you will not be the leader of  the Tiger demons anymore.

136
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:23,188
I will hand the entire Demon Realm to you.

137
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:24,628
Master!

138
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:26,250
Go.

139
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:29,868
Master Bai Jue.

140
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:34,149
If he killed Yue Mi, I will never spare him.

141
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,009
Destroy his Array of World Destruction first.

142
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:48,989
How did Yue Mi die?

143
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:51,508
Tian Qi, when will you correct your mistake?

144
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:54,208
Bai Jue, both of us are True Gods,

145
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,589
being created by the Ancestral God.

146
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,189
You are in no position to judge whether I did right.

147
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:00,868
If so, I'll take you back to the God Realm.

148
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:03,270
Let's see how Shang Gu will judge you.

149
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,308
Do you want to fight against me just for these people?

150
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:11,349
Don't forget, we are the only four from the same origin.

151
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:13,009
These people?

152
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:15,469
"These people" you mentioned

153
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,949
are all heroes who made merit to the God Realm.

154
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,299
The Array of World Destruction

155
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,269
will ruin the effort of all the Gods including Ancestral God,

156
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,269
as well as everyone in the realms.

157
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,430
And so what?

158
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,949
We can rebuild it.

159
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,230
If all the realms are ruined.

160
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,668
But something will disappear forever

161
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,988
if we lose it.

162
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,629
Why do you think of the world like this?

163
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:40,669
When have you become so heartless?

164
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,789
I should have detained you in the God Realm.

165
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,149
If so, Yue Mi wouldn't have died so tragically.

166
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,068
You don't deserve to mention her.

167
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,909
Not even mention the word "heart"!

168
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,510
Tian Qi, stop making more mistakes.

169
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,050
Shut up!

170
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:16,889
Mu Guang, calm down.

171
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,829
Let's wait till Master Bai Jue figures it out.

172
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,089
Hong Ri, if Master Bai Jue were the one who died today,

173
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:25,329
would you also be calm like this?

174
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,108
Tian Qi, I promised Shang Gu to bring you back.

175
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:35,409
For Yue Mi's sake, for Shang Gu's sake,

176
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:37,810
for the lives in this world,

177
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,949
stop doing anything wrong, Tian Qi.

178
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,628
Pay the price for my master's life!

179
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:49,290
Stop!

180
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:56,509
Today, I'll let you know,

181
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:58,950
I am the law.

182
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:23,668
Because of you, the whole realm is in chaos and many people have died.

183
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:28,549
Tian Qi, this world can no longer tolerate you.

184
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:33,209
Bai Jue, you will regret.

185
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,030
Sooner or later, you will regret.

186

195
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:36,528
 Dangerous? Why is it dangerous? 

196
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,269
 Do you think I'll teach the God Realm into disunity? 

197
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,150
 Shut up. 

198
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,229
 A sign of core spirit being separated from your body. 

199
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,709
 These years, have you been... 

200
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,369
 The damage of core spirit during the cultivation is common. 

201
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:50,209
 No need to fuss. 

202
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,069
 Don't think that I'll tell Shang Gu about this. 

203
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:54,949
 You want to gain her sympathy? 

204
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,710
 No way.

 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

227
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:21,348
 Ten thousand years ago, I was born in Universe Pavilion. 

228
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:23,469
 Tian Qi was the first person I saw. 

229
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,428
 Yue Mi and he have been with me every day and have taken care of me. 

230
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,639
 He's my most intimate brother and the one I trust the most in the whole realm. 

231
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:35,869
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

232
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,850
Where is Yue Mi?

233
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,130
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

234
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:43,379
Do you know where she is?

235
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,169
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

236
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:56,949
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫ 

237
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,788
Where is Tian Qi?

238
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:01,308
Where is Tian Qi?

239
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,469
He killed many gods.

240
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,510
I had to kill him.

241
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,449
Why did he kill so many people?

242
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:19,169
Did he tell you the reason?

243
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,750
Let me see Zi Han.

244
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:32,029
Zi Han has followed him for many years, he must know the reason.

245
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:34,050
He won't meet you.

246
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,470
At least he won't in a few ten thousand years.

247
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:39,750
I didn't protect them well.

248
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,519
This is not your fault.

249
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,750
I'm the Chief God of the world.

250
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:46,610
Everything is under my watch.

251
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,789
Even if I dig three feet in the ground, I will dig out the truth of the matter.

252
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,229
 Come on, Shang Gu. 

253
00:21:28,229 --> 00:21:30,308
 You drink by yourself here again. 

254
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:32,529
 Why didn't you invite me? 

255
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,710
 He killed many Gods. 

256
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,680
 I had to kill him. 

257
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,169
Yue Mi,

258
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:08,289
I didn't protect you well.

259
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:11,569
And I didn't figure out Tian Qi's intention.

260
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:17,369
Everything is my fault.

261
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,689
If you have any complaints,

262
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,630
don't blame Tian Qi, just come to me.

263
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:09,289
I grew up with you and Tian Qi.

264
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:14,028
Tian Qi does things out of tune

265
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:16,370
and speaks in a serious way.

266
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:21,130
Yue Mi, can you meet me in my dream?

267
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:23,630
Tell me...

268
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,949
Why did Tian Qi choose to destroy the world?

269
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,669
What is the unspeakable trouble?

270
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,390
Your Royal Highness.

271
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,650
Has your wound gotten better?

272
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,188
Thank you for asking, it's almost healed.

273
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:53,748
Fine. I feel drunk and I am going back.

274
00:23:53,748 --> 00:23:55,689
You should go back and take an early rest as well.

275
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:58,359
Your Royal Highness, on the night before Master Yue Mi left,

276
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:02,168
she told me that if she couldn't come back,

277
00:24:02,168 --> 00:24:04,989
I should give you a message.

278
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,449
What did she say?

279
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:10,539
My master said that what she pursued her whole life was happiness,

280
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:14,308
wine, and a clear conscience.

281
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:18,159
But there was something that made her owe you an apology.

282
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,609
I don't think that she didn't owe me anything in her life.

283
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,800
On the day you held a birthday party for her,

284
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:28,259
she led you to the Peach Woods to talk about Master Bai Jue.

285
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,268
That was for her personal intention.

286
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,010
She hoped you could forgive Master Bai Jue

287
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,169
and the Demon God could stop his affection for you.

288
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:41,030
My master kept feeling guilty over this

289
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,989
and didn't know how to tell you

290
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,350
or how to face the Demon God.

291
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:50,860
Deliver my command.

292
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,929
From now on, no one else is allowed to live in the Yue Hua Hall of Peach Woods.

293
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:58,290
It will belong to the Goddess of the Stars and the Moon forever.

294
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,289
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

295
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:07,189
From now on, I will light up the stars of this God Realm for you.

296
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:11,350
As long as I am alive and the God Realm exists,

297
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,689
the Goddess of the Stars and the Moon will never change.

298
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,590
I thank Your Royal Highness.

299
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,308
Are you here to comfort me?

300
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,029
No. Follow me.

301
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:18,969
 Yue Mi. 

302
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,350
 Yue Mi. 

303
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,369
 What happened inside? 

304
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:24,749
 How did Yue Mi die? 

305
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,549
 If there is any falsehood, I won't spare you. 

306
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:28,788
 It was the Demon God. 

307
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:31,788
 He pushed the Goddess Yue Mi into the center of the array in person. 

308
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:33,989
 I saw Goddess Yue Mi's divine power collapse. 

309
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,109
 Her core power was destroyed. 

310
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,350
 I'm killing you! 

311
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,490
I myself got hurt and bled.

312
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,510
Can they really trust me?

313
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,540
Mu Guang.

314
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,460
Why do you come?

315
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:29,130
Goddess Yue Mi was killed.

316
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,630
I...

317
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,789
I feel worried about you.

318
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:39,488
Goddess Yue Mi and Master Tian Qi were very close.

319
00:27:39,488 --> 00:27:41,629
Although I saw it in person,

320
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:46,790
I can't believe that Goddess Yue Mi

321
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,548
was killed by Master Tian Qi.

322
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:51,950
Don't call him a master.

323
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,110
He doesn't deserve it.

324
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:58,370
Master Bai Jue killed him with his spear,

325
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,029
this is what he deserves.

326
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,870
What's wrong?

327
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:12,169
I just thought of

328
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:16,689
Goddess Yue Mi's love for Master...

329
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:18,989
For the Demon God for so many years...

330
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,049
I feel sorry for her.

331
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:30,649
Others could see that my master was sincere towards the Demon God,

332
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:35,670
but only the Demon God would act like he knew nothing.

333
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,108
It's cold at night and you're injured,

334
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,990
go back and get some good rest.

335
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,690
I'm sorry for your loss.

336
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:09,779
Why have you brought me to Secret Pavilion?

337
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,710
I want to ask you for help.

338
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:16,489
Purple Jade Whip?

339
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:18,629
I wanted to send the Purple Jade Whip to Secret Pavilion,

340
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,569
but...

341
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:22,490
How can you not handle such a small thing?

342
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,870
I'm not in the mood to fiddle-faddle.

343
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:31,629
It's weird.

344
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,130
You are the most powerful God in all the realms,

345
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,489
but your power can't control the Purple Jade Whip.

346
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:39,559
Purple Jade Whip is intelligential.

347
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,808
How could it obey the one who killed his master?

348
00:29:41,808 --> 00:29:46,329
People must think that True God Bai Jue is heartless.

349
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:50,329
He wouldn't feel sad or sorry even he were to kill his brother.

350
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:52,668
Actually, when Tian Qi died under the Tai Cang Spear,

351
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:55,470
you felt very guilty.

352
00:29:57,189 --> 00:30:00,329
I sent someone to investigate before Tian Qi started the Array of Destruction,

353
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,990
nothing big happened in Everlasting Hall.

354
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,510
He must have had no other choice.

355
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,869
I set a seal. It won't cause any trouble.

356
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,209
Thanks.

357
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:19,889
I return this to you.

358
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:21,729
Xuan Yi was to become the God of Chaos,

359
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:25,569
but he escaped from the God Realm before he inherited the Chief God's instruction feather.

360
00:30:25,569 --> 00:30:27,349
Tian Qi was aloof from worldly affairs,

361
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:31,519
but caused the disaster before I inherited the Chief God's instruction feather.

362
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:34,729
I was eager to take the Chief God's instruction feather.

363
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:39,509
But now every time I see it, I just feel very upset.

364
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,528
I'm tired. Go to sleep now.

365
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:55,050
 Bai Jue, you'll regret. 

366
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:59,909
 Sooner or later, you'll regret. 

367
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,549
 Xuan Yi escaped. 

368
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:05,130
 Tian Qi wanted to destroy the world. 

369
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,749
 Both are related to inheriting the Chief God's instruction feather. 

370
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:11,549
 Maybe there is really some other reason behind it. 

371
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,888
 A thousand years ago, Zhi Yang told me 

372
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:47,209
 that the Power of Chaos in the Lower Realm has vanished. 

373
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,650
 He urged me to cultivate the Power of Chaos 

374
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,090
 and to be Chief God of Chaos soon. 

375
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:56,159
 So Bai Jue came to teach me with all his effort. 

376
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,930
 I can't let them down this time. 

377
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,849
 Why is the Power of the Chaos in the Lower Realm vanishing even faster? 

378
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:05,788
 Why are there so few spiritual veins left? 

379
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:08,489
 Because all of the realms are looking forward to 

380
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:12,029
 Your Royal Highness taking over the Chief God's instruction feather soon. 

381
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:15,650
 Why did Zhi Yang and Tian Qi let me play around, 

382
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,169
 but suddenly ask Bai Jue to teach me? 

383
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,749
 Only the things on earth can fill the earth 

384
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:22,909
 and replenish the Chaos aura. 

385
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:27,989
 But now I know that Bai Jue has his reason to insist on asking you 

386
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:30,509
 to practice in the Netherworld 

387
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,210
 and to urge you gain the Power of Chaos. 

388
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:37,388
 Why did Bai Jue ask me to cultivate the power in a thousand years 

389
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,148
 that should have been gained in ten thousand years? 

390
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:42,250
 He could have taught me step by step. 

391
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,989
 You bear the Power of Chaos, 

392
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,068
 so you should remind yourself at any time 

393
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:48,130
 that once you get the Chief God's instruction feather, 

394
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,869
 you'll be responsible for all lives on earth. 

395
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,350
 You have the duty to explore the Human Realm. 

396
00:32:53,189 --> 00:32:54,129
 Why? 

397
00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:55,509
 Xuan Yi abandoned the chance 

398
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,148
 of governing the entire realms officially, 

399
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:59,030
 but instead escaped from the God Realm 

400
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,930
 and then governed the realms. 

401
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,068
 Why did Tian Qi who doted on me 

402
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,890
 change into a totally different person from before? 

403
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,689
 I am the most powerful god in the God Realm. 

404
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:13,768
 I will become the most deserved Chief God in the God Realm. 

405
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:19,929
 Why? Why? 

406
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,330
 There must be something I don't know. 

407
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,069
 I can't lose anyone without any reason. 

408
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,590
Master.

409
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:03,510
What's the matter?

410
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,229
A royal decree was issued from Pilgrim Hall.

411
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,899
On the day Master Shang Gu is to be crowned,

412
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,130
she will merge the Chief God's instruction feather.

413
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,569
Seven thousand years have passed,

414
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,350
finally, the Chief God of Chaos has emerged!

415
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:27,190
Ring the Chaos Bell and inform every god

416
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,790
that the Chief God of Chaos is coming.

417
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:49,029
The Chief God of Chaos will emerge.

418
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,349
Congratulations, Devil King, your wish is coming true.

419
00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:11,650
Devil King.

420
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,610
Bring this divine weapon to the Universe Pavilion.

421
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:20,969
Show them what the real Doom of Chaos is.

422
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:25,170
Yes, Demon King.

423
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:55,249
I can't believe the Chief God of Chaos will inherit the crown of the Chief God

424
00:35:55,249 --> 00:35:57,069
right after the Demon God has been killed.

425
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:01,079
She indeed behaves like a chief of the God Realm by her quick actions.

426
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:06,509
My master is only complying with destiny. Goddess of Snow, you have no right to judge.

427
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:10,868
A junior as you are, if I am in no position to judge then would you have the right to judge?

428
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:12,989
The Demon God made chaos, many people were harmed.

429
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:14,828
Everything in our God Realm is undone.

430
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:17,148
A Chief God of Chaos is exactly needed to supervise.

431
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:19,269
Now, Her Royal Highness is inheriting the Chief God's instruction feather

432
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:21,628
shows her true demeanor as the Chief of the God Realm.

433
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:25,008
I was wondering who it was. It's the Goddess of the Stars and the Moon's disciple.

434
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:26,628
Have you become a god?

435
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:29,348
A man who lives in degradation is wandering about,

436
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:32,089
what would the Goddess Yue Mi

437
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,428
and the other eleven star envoys think in Heaven.

438
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:39,029
Goddess of Snow please mind your words as a senior.

439
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:43,469
Just a little fellow, how dare you to speak so rudely to me?

440
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:45,969
Goddess of Snow, you also know that a junior should respect his senior, right?

441
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:50,090
- You... 
 - Goddess Yue Mi sacrificed herself for the world.

442
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:53,269
My master issued a command yesterday,

443
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,948
that promoted Mu Guang from the Twelve Stars into the God of Stars and Moon.

444
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:01,769
From today, he is also a god, the same as you.

445
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,030
 The wasteland of the Demon Realm. 

446
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,108
 Tian Qi? 

447
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:39,568
-  Master Tian Qi, did the Qiong Qi who scared Her Royal Highness, escape from here?  
 -  Tian Qi. 

448
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:41,550
 Just look around. 

449
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:45,489
 I can't understand Zhi Yang. 

450
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,289
 Just some beasts, why so serious? 

451
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:57,449
 And let's talk about Bai Jue, 

452
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:58,850
 why was there such a coincidence? 

453
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,508
 Bai Jue went on business in the Lower Realm and confronted with Shang Gu. 

454
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:03,149
 He must be following her in secret. 

455
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:07,068
 Obviously he loves Shang Gu, but always acts decently. 

456
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:13,129
 Master, now that we are here, let's just have a look. 

457
00:38:13,129 --> 00:38:15,210
 Look for what? 

458
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,040
 Annoying! 

459
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:28,690
 The Ancestral God's Barrier of Chaos was broken. 

460
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,989
 It's strange. 

461
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,549
 Although there's some evil aura, 

462
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,008
 - the seal seems... 
 - To vanish by itself. 

463
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:39,489
 The Barrier of Chaos was built by the Power of Chaos. 

464
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:44,649
 Except for Her Royal Highness, no one else can impel the Power of Chaos to break the barrier. 

465
00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:46,510
 Could it be... 

466
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:48,970
 Master? 

467
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:53,888
 Do you remember the warning the Ancestral God left before he died? 

468
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,869
 Before the Ancestral God died, he said the Doom of Chaos was coming 

469
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,609
 and only Her Royal Highness who takes over the crown of Chief God can remove the doom. 

470
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:09,009
 Master, do you mean that the vanishing Barrier of Chaos 

471
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:10,628
 is related to the Doom of Chaos? 

472
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:12,628
 But Her Royal Highness has gained the Power of Chaos. 

473
00:39:12,629 --> 00:39:14,800
 She'll get the instruction feather tomorrow. 

474
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,669
 Why is the Power of Chaos in the Lower Realm still vanishing? 

475
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:19,429
 It's abnormal. 

476
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:21,750
 Let's go to the Universe Pavilion. 

477
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:05,409
 Master, do you want to ask the Ancestral God by Chaos Stone? 

478
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:10,990
 Now this is our only way to investigate what the Ancestral God's warning was. 

479
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,288
 But it has always been the Ancestral God who gave instructions by his own initiative. 

480
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:16,348
 - If we ask randomly... 
 - It's about Shang Gu. 

481
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:18,309
 No mistake is allowed. 

482
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:22,009
 No matter what the consequences maybe, I will bear them. 

483
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:27,709
 Ancestral God, please tell me. What's the Doom of Chaos? 

484
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,810
 Master. 

485
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,470
 Get away! 

486
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,890
 Master! Master! 

487
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:55,549
 Ancestral God, please tell me!  What is the Doom of Chaos? 

488
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,888
 Master. Master! 

489
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,690
 The Doom of Chaos has appeared. 

490
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,369
 The God Realm will be destroyed. 

491
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:12,689
 Only if the Chief God of Chaos faces the disaster by sacrificing her life 

492
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:15,588
 will the Doom be solved. 

493
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:17,389
 Nonsense. 

494
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:20,069
 You old fellow! 

495
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:24,689
 You asked Shang Gu to take painstaking efforts to gain the Power of Chaos and become the Chief God, 

496
00:41:24,689 --> 00:41:29,188
 just to make her take your place and sacrifice herself for all the beings in the world? 

497
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:45,970


498
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:55,269
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

499
00:41:55,269 --> 00:42:02,150
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

500
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:08,569
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

501
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:14,729
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

502
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:21,730
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

503
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:27,990
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

504
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:35,410
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

505
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:42,070
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

506
00:42:53,670 --> 00:43:00,509
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

507
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:06,990
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

508
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:14,169
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

509
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:21,370
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

510
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:29,350
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

511
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:36,230
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

512
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:42,610
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

513
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:49,209
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

514
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:59,030
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
