1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,010


2
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:21,040
   

3
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:26,020
   

4
00:02:04,922 --> 00:02:08,411
Luckily, we're both gods.

5
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:11,520
From now on, I'll stay with you forever.

6
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:18,718
Three Realms exist so the world is there and I'll be with you.

7
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:20,222
Do you agree?

8
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:54,174
Master, you don't know how much Her Royal Highness worried about you.

9
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,299
She went to Phoenix Clan to find for you the pith of Wutong to be the inducer.

10
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:59,955
I'm so glad about it.

11
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:01,480
Bai Jue.

12
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:07,720
I've brought you something to eat. And then you can...

13
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,320
Your gown.

14
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:28,758
What's this?

15
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,519
Hong Ri sent it here just now.

16
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,368
It records what treasures Zi Han has stolen.

17
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:34,958
Let me see.

18
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:41,807
What happened?

19
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:43,460
Impossible.

20
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:47,461
If Tian Qi really steals them,

21
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:51,678
then he's going to assign an Array of World Destruction to ruin the Three Realms.

22
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:53,760
What's the array?

23
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,680
When the devils rebelled, they almost ruined the God Realm.

24
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,444
In order to defeat them, Ancestral God created an array.

25
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,420
It was created based on the Three Stones of God

26
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,288
and developed by Chief God's instruction feather, supplied by a True God's core power.

27
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:10,243
It will absorb Chaos aura from Immortal Realm and Demon Realm.

28
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:11,910
Use the spiritual aura from all the creatures

29
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:14,860
to turn the operator into the most powerful God of Chaos.

30
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,733
As soon as the one becomes God of Chaos, he or she will surpass Ancestral God.

31
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:20,022
He or she will be the most powerful god in the world.

32
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:22,388
Why have I never heard about it?

33
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,666
It has to sacrifice all creatures.

34
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,488
It's too heartless.

35
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,530
That's why Ancestral God didn't use it

36
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,755
but spent all his power defeating the Devil God and suppressing the devils.

37
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:34,720
Tian Qi took it away so he wants...

38
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,744
I can't believe it! He's not that kind of person.

39
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,277
There must be another use.

40
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:40,544
Maybe he's just doing this on a whim.

41
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:44,640
We must trust that he won't make such a terrible blunder.

42
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,576
If he wants to be the Chief God, according to his power,

43
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:49,400
does he need to wait that long?

44
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,179
I agree with you.

45
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:53,344
I can't believe he'll do so either.

46
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:54,820
But...

47
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,798
But it has happened.

48
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,199
I'll go to the Lower Realm to ask him!

49
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,088
No. You can't go to see him.

50
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:04,798
Acting recklessly will only let you be in danger.

51
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:08,022
All gods are talking about his escape.

52
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:09,639
If you go to meet him,

53
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,540
you'll let Pilgrim Hall be the next target.

54
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,622
Now every god is jittery

55
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:17,566
for they're all afraid of another war between the gods and devils.

56
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,479
As you're the Chief God,

57
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,677
you should console them first.

58
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:23,699
But...

59
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,960
Zhi Yang and I will find it out and stop him.

60
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:39,380
Why do you ask me to come?

61
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,740
Do you have any news about Tian Qi?

62
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,566
What's the matter?

63
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:48,880
Why this expression?

64
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,640
What happened on Earth?

65
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,772
Nothing.

66
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:56,518
I just want to borrow your Immortal Tracking Bell.

67
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,188
- You want to find Tian Qi? 
 * Yes.

68
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:02,700
You let him off because of your former friendship so why do you want to find him back?

69
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,380
Do you know what he's stolen?

70
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,455
Three Stones of God.

71
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:10,100
The Array of World Destruction?

72
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,340
Impossible!

73
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,966
He's not competitive so how will he deploy the Array of World Destruction?

74
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,655
Even though we still believe him,

75
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:19,740
how could the other gods trust him?

76
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,660
If I don't go and ask him,

77
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,549
it's a risk for all creatures.

78
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,133
Do you want to know the truth or to bring him back?

79
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:33,840
What if he does deploy it?

80
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:41,677
Yue Mi, I know he treats me well.

81
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:45,580
Otherwise, I'd have already asked the others to arrest him.

82
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:52,639
I've known him for thousands of years.

83
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,380
I know he thinks highly of friendships.

84
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,800
But now, everyone in the God Realm says he has rebelled.

85
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,680
I really feel sad for him.

86
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,320
It's my first time seeing you be like this.

87
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,855
Do you like...

88
00:07:07,855 --> 00:07:10,460
But he thinks I'm only his friend.

89
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,600
He only misses and cares about you.

90
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,920
But my only love is Bai Jue.

91
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,360
You know it clearly.

92
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,333
- If I had known your mind, I would... 
 - I see.

93
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,520
I know you treat him as your brother.

94
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,822
And also I know it's not your fault.

95
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:38,477
Well, Shang Gu, do you know?

96
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,320
Do you know how much I envy you?

97
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,600
Though you did nothing,

98
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,879
he still fell in love with you.

99
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,266
I also admire the relationship between Bai Jue and you.

100
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,260
But he...

101
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,580
has never cared about me.

102
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:59,880
Though I'm your best friend,

103
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,500
I've never known your mind before.

104
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,120
Love can't be imposed.

105
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,820
I just want to accompany and protect him

106
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,300
even though he can't think of me when he rejoices.

107
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,366
I just wish to drink with him when he's in a bad mood.

108
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,160
That's enough.

109
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,788
How could it be enough?

110
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:27,980
You're a nice goddess

111
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,588
and you deserve the most valuable love.

112
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:32,980
I'll tell him your mind

113
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,877
when I figure it out.

114
00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:36,158
Don't.

115
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,279
I already know the answer.

116
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,120
There is no need to tell him.

117
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,760
I only wish he can be safe.

118
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:52,760
Shang Gu, I can lend you the bell

119
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,339
but you need to promise me that you won't kill him

120
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:59,620
no matter what happens in the future.

121
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,640
I beg you.

122
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,266
Yue Mi, we're friends.

123
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:07,088
You don't need to be like this.

124
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,558
Don't worry.

125
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,140
I won't let others kill him.

126
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:33,844
Master, as you are recovering,

127
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:36,480
how about taking a break and reading them tomorrow?

128
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,720
We've never met the array before

129
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:45,520
so we have to find the solution in the books.

130
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,540
As long as it can't be solved,

131
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,760
I can't be at ease.

132
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,999
Master.

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,520
Though Master Tian Qi always acts recklessly,

134
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,865
how could he finally choose to be the next Devil God?

135
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:05,059
We know nothing about the truth

136
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:07,040
so don't be wrongly informed.

137
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,319
 I never thought you could find me so soon. 

138
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,149
 You've grown up. 

139
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:37,565
 So has your ability. 

140
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:39,943
Tian Qi, where are you? Come out.

141
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:43,279
Is it the time to chat?

142
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,589
You must tell me the truth.

143
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,539
Why did you steal the Three Stones of God, take away the Chief God's instruction feather,

144
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:50,787
and are leading the Demon Clan to rebel?

145
00:10:50,787 --> 00:10:52,820
What do you want to do?

146
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,476
Since you already know the answers,

147
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:58,465
why do you come to ask me?

148
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:00,376
I won't believe it.

149
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:02,543
How much effort have you made

150
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:04,276
to develop the Demon Realm and Immortal Realm?

151
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:07,100
How can I believe you want to ruin them?

152
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:09,687
Listen to it.

153
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:12,199
Humanity, justice, and morality.

154
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,158
You're really Bai Jue's apprentice.

155
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,238
But he forgot to tell you something.

156
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:20,800
Gods can act, too.

157
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,840
You think that you're important to me

158
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,687
and I will give up everything as long as you ask.

159
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:33,319
Shang Gu,

160
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,200
could it be that sitting on the throne of the Chief God for a long time has made you dizzy?

161
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,238
When you were a baby,

162
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,598
the Chief God ordered the other gods

163
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:46,060
to play in a ten-thousand-year friend drama.

164
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,700
You actually took it for real.

165
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,818
The eyes can't be deceived.

166
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:56,599
If you want, I can let you be the Chief God.

167
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,280
You don't have to do all this.

168
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:00,860
Naive.

169
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,865
I'm the Demon God.

170
00:12:03,865 --> 00:12:05,839
Even if you wanted to do so,

171
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,940
how would they allow it?

172
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,959
Only when I use the array

173
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,678
and absorb all the Chaos Aura in the Lower Realm,

174
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,118
I can be the strongest Chief God of Chaos

175
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:22,360
and then dominate the whole world.

176
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,299
As I'm now here, I will bring you back.

177
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,478
I won't let you make another mistake.

178
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:31,340
Tian Qi, come back with me.

179
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,560
You hurt me?

180
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:54,199
It's a lesson for you.

181
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,220
You should know you're not the master of the world.

182
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,620
Get out of the Swamp of Netherhill.

183
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,420
What if I refuse?

184
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:09,040
Shang Gu, listen to me.

185
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,276
I'd never fallen in love with you.

186
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:14,880
What I've done for you

187
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,018
was to just let you live till you could get the Chief God's instruction feather.

188
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:21,058
 I'll be your brother forever. 

189
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:24,899
 No matter what we meet and experience, 

190
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,820
 I'll always be with you. 

191
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,620
Go back to the God Realm.

192
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,160
When I become the most powerful main god,

193
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,420
maybe I will look at our past affections.

194
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,240
Don't let those idiots come here again.

195
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,640
Otherwise, I'll do something evil,

196
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,760
just like Xuan Yi.

197
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:45,221
Your Royal Highness!

198
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:46,678
Why did you get hurt?

199
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,960
I'm fine. Don't tell the others.

200
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,765
- Report. Master Bai Jue has come. 
 - Bring him to the study.

201
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,599
Don't tell him I got hurt.

202
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,360
Yes.

203
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:13,576
Master Bai Jue, what's the matter in the God Realm?

204
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:15,132
Nothing.

205
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:18,032
Where's Shang Gu? Is she still resting?

206
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,643
She didn't sleep all night and just woke up.

207
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:25,160
You can leave now.

208
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,840
Why have you suddenly come here?

209
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:36,733
You're injured.

210
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:39,448
Let me see.

211
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,720
He hurt you.

212
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,360
Where is he?

213
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,154
Don't go.

214
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:58,839
He's made up his mind.

215
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,900
It's useless for you to go.

216
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:05,499
I just want him to know he can't hurt you so easily.

217
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,940
I've made a big mistake so I should be punished.

218
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,789
Even if he didn't hurt me, I...

219
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,340
He made the mistake.

220
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,320
Don't blame yourself too much.

221
00:16:22,955 --> 00:16:25,143
But that day,

222
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:27,520
it's me who let him off.

223
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,960
He told me that the reason why he'd stayed with me for years

224
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,900
was to get Chief God's instruction feather.

225
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,100
He's my closest brother.

226
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,420
Before, I'd never thought that we would be like this.

227
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:55,680
Maybe I shouldn't have come back from the Netherworld.

228
00:17:25,622 --> 00:17:27,600
Let's go somewhere.

229
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:42,598
Why do you bring me here?

230
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,939
Before your birth, Tian Qi and I always drank here.

231
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:51,869
At that time, all gods helped Ancestral God set up the God Realm and the world.

232
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:54,598
The depth of our friendship can give life and death.

233
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,265
On the eve of the war between gods and devils, we still came here.

234
00:17:59,265 --> 00:18:03,420
However, most of them had passed away.

235
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:07,438
After the war, I blamed myself too much.

236
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:10,418
I hated that I couldn't protect more people.

237
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:12,259
While our lives are immortal,

238
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,438
we can't be overwhelmed by regret and hate.

239
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:17,743
If we sink into the past, then where's the future?

240
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:19,519
You're right.

241
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,879
Even if we'll fight in the future,

242
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,105
we still can't waste the present time.

243
00:18:24,673 --> 00:18:27,353
As we still can be together,

244
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:29,241
let's enjoy the scenery,

245
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,686
drink some wine, and have a chat.

246
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:55,879
The Lower Realm thinks we're free and happy.

247
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,220
They think we can change the world with our minds.

248
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,159
However, the fate of the world is unpredictable.

249
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,300
Sometimes we still have to accept it with resignation.

250
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:11,800
Bai Jue,

251
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,478
if I commit such a serious crime someday,

252
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:18,554
what would you do?

253
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:21,580
As long as I'm with you, I won't allow it to happen.

254
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,620
What if it really happens?

255
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,176
If it were before,

256
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:30,399
I would definitely answer you, "Public affection is greater than private affection."

257
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,520
But I don't know what to answer now.

258
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,920
Maybe you have your own difficulties.

259
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,838
I'd like to be punished with you.

260
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,078
As I can hear it from the just and stern Master Bai Jue,

261
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,443
I think I can die without regret.

262
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:47,865
Don't say that.

263
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:51,021
You're a Chief God. You should be with the three realms forever.

264
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:54,400
No matter how important Tian Qi is to me,

265
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,958
I can't abandon the whole world because of personal affairs.

266
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,060
I'm the Chief God.

267
00:20:01,922 --> 00:20:04,799
- Shang Gu. 
 - Be at ease.

268
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,160
I will stop him.

269
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,379
Not only for Tian Qi but also because of my duties as Chief God.

270
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,078
The array really can arouse Chaos aura in the Lower Realm.

271
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:56,832
It was established by Ancestral God. It won't go wrong.

272
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:01,159
Well, it needs at least 24 hours to be set up completely.

273
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,799
The God Realm won't give us so much time.

274
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,958
I'll stay here to protect it

275
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:07,159
and use my core power to catalyze it.

276
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,759
I'll leave the outside of Swamp of Netherhill to you.

277
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,899
I won't let you down.

278
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:14,480
Zi Han.

279
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,639
Once it's established,

280
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,039
the Demon Realm will also be ruined.

281
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,879
It's your hometown.

282
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,065
Will you have no resentment towards me in your heart?

283
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:27,880
- They... 
 - Master.

284
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,021
Every demon's spiritual power comes from you.

285
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:35,965
If Demon God is gone, what's the meaning for the Demon Clan to exist?

286
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:42,287
True Gods are your friends.

287
00:21:42,287 --> 00:21:43,954
So are we.

288
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:47,610
As long as you want, we vow to follow you forever

289
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:52,500
even though the world blames or reviles us.

290
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:35,143
Chief God, as we're still tacking the Tian Qi case,

291
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:36,765
why do you toll the Chaos Bell?

292
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:38,465
What happened?

293
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:41,087
He's right. We've failed to meet you for days

294
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:43,032
so please tell us the reason.

295
00:22:43,032 --> 00:22:47,199
The reason why I'm calling you to come is to tell you about a matter.

296
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:51,354
Master Bai Jue and I have learned that Demon God Tian Qi

297
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:55,220
is trying to set up the Array of World Destruction in the Swamp of Netherhill.

298
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:01,318
As he's powerful and holds Chief God's instruction feather,

299
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,239
who can stop him if he wants to ruin the realm?

300
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:07,365
We still know nothing about how he escaped.

301
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:10,100
Your Royal Highness, are you trying to let this matter go.

302
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:12,639
No.

303
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,759
It's me who let him off.

304
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,900
I commited the crime and I'll be responsible for it.

305
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,787
The most urgent matter is to catch him back here

306
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:26,340
and stop him from setting up the array.

307
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,980
Bai Jue.

308
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,760
Lead the troops to the Swamp of Netherhill.

309
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:35,054
Zhi Yang.

310
00:23:35,054 --> 00:23:36,143
Please go ahead.

311
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:37,732
The God Realm is the foundation of the world.

312
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:41,721
Lead all gods to guard Universe Pavilion to keep all creatures safe.

313
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:42,854
Understood.

314
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,076
Gu Jun.

315
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:46,932
Let's go to Nanhai to pacify the chaos that has erupted.

316
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:48,399
Yes.

317
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:52,765
Chief God! I want to join Master Bai Jue's troops

318
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,665
to catch Demon God back.

319
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,665
Please allow me to do so.

320
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:59,954
The world now allows no omission.

321
00:23:59,954 --> 00:24:02,999
I've thought it over and found that

322
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:07,699
only Bai Jue can be stern and fair to accept the task.

323
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:09,510
During the war between gods and devils,

324
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:12,165
our constellation envoys were the vanguards.

325
00:24:12,165 --> 00:24:14,420
As the whole world is in danger,

326
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,280
how can we, the constellation envoys, stay out of it?

327
00:24:21,444 --> 00:24:24,040
Chief God, please agree.

328
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:29,520
As Goddess of Stars and Moon petitions,

329
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,920
then you can go with Bai Jue.

330
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:35,840
Thanks, Chief God.

331
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,399
As of now, the God Realm is heavily guarded,

332
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,018
you can go and stir up troubles but don't bring it back to me.

333
00:24:52,018 --> 00:24:54,440
Why are you so nervous, Goddess of Snow?

334
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:57,399
Most of the gods are trying to protect themselves

335
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,310
and other Upper Gods are overwhelmed,

336
00:25:00,311 --> 00:25:02,354
so how can they have time to take care of you?

337
00:25:02,354 --> 00:25:05,679
By the way. Shang Gu tolled the bell to summon all gods.

338
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,700
Did anything happen?

339
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:12,999
All of you devils really care about the God Realm.

340
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,060
My Demon King and the Snow Goddess are of the same heart,

341
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,940
of course we should care about it.

342
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,238
Don't act out of character.

343
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,919
I can tell you.

344
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,779
Shang Gu told them Tian Qi has stolen the Three Stones of God.

345
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:30,559
Then she asked Bai Jue and Yue Mi to go and arrest the Demon God.

346
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,198
And she'll go to the Lower Realm to put down the chaos,

347
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,300
preventing any disasters.

348
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,478
If Demon God ruins the Lower Realm, the Netherworld can't survive.

349
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:44,880
What does Demon King want to do on Earth?

350
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,598
As Bai Jue will go to the Lower Realm,

351
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,458
the array is impossible to be established.

352
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:53,639
He will be leading troops to the Swamp of Netherhill.

353
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,976
If you dare play tricks,

354
00:25:55,977 --> 00:25:57,860
I won't let you off!

355
00:26:01,688 --> 00:26:03,238
Calm down.

356
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:07,719
According to his capabilities, who can hurt him?

357
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:10,718
As long as you can complete the task,

358
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:16,060
then the Demon King will give you whatever you want.

359
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,679
 The plum blossom is waiting for the snow. 

360
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,500
 It's a good name. 

361
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:31,238
 The plum blossom is waiting for the snow. 

362
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:35,159
 It lets me wait for you 30 thousand years. 

363
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,279
 No, it's not because of my words. 

364
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,279
 It's because you're obsessed. 

365
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,799
 Master! 

366
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,510
 Do you know how much effort I've paid to come back to the God Realm? 

367
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,919
 Master! 

368
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:51,843
 Why do you still refuse to see me? 

369
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,500
 Master! 

370
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,740
 I've loved you since I first saw you. 

371
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,540
 But you only care about her. 

372
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,280
 Please don't blame me. 

373
00:27:30,988 --> 00:27:32,387
The God Realm is in trouble.

374
00:27:32,387 --> 00:27:35,159
Almost every god has errands to do.

375
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,099
As God Wu Huan manages Pilgrim Hall,

376
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:40,560
why did Chief God forget you?

377
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:43,200
It's so strange.

378
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,965
Her Royal Highness fears I will be in danger

379
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:50,800
and some evil guys will seize the chance to stir up trouble

380
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:53,840
so she asks me to stay here.

381
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,540
Sounds nice.

382
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,639
Though I'm from a humble family,

383
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,759
I'm exceedingly stupid.

384
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,759
If Goddess of Snow has nothing to do,

385
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,478
you can stay in your hall.

386
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,780
Don't taunt me here.

387
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:16,318
That day when we were in Pilgrim Hall,

388
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,220
was there anything fake about the Phoenix monarch's case?

389
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,338
I'm here to tell you your master is merciless.

390
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:29,043
If you don't want to be expelled from the God Realm

391
00:28:29,044 --> 00:28:31,318
and do miscellaneous affairs in your clan,

392
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:34,840
you should plan for yourself.

393
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:40,780
What do you mean?

394
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,519
Today's war is your most perfect chance.

395
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,318
If you can stop Tian Qi's plan,

396
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:51,060
I'm sure you'll gain an unusual status here in the future.

397
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,978
If we want to get established or a higher status in the God Realm,

398
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:58,220
we should be on our own.

399
00:29:04,922 --> 00:29:06,840
I'm afraid I can't defeat Zi Han

400
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,020
based on my spiritual power,

401
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,780
so how can I stop Demon God?

402
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,954
Devil weapon?

403
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:21,254
This devil weapon is called Refining Sky Bow.

404
00:29:21,254 --> 00:29:24,265
The devil elder, Shi Luo, used it in the war.

405
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:26,919
It's been kept in my hall.

406
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,121
It can hurt even True Gods.

407
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:32,754
I'll lend it to you.

408
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:35,754
Wu Huan, you're smart.

409
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:37,999
To be the master or a servant here in the future,

410
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,800
it's all up to you.

411
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,287
To my shame,

412
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,159
I should have lead the troops to catch Tian Qi back.

413
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,699
Up to now,

414
00:29:55,699 --> 00:29:59,920
I still refuse to believe and I can't hurt him.

415
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,980
The Swamp of Netherhill is full of dangers.

416
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:07,469
You must be careful.

417
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,243
If he still resists...

418
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:10,732
I see.

419
00:30:10,732 --> 00:30:12,165
You don't need to say too much.

420
00:30:12,165 --> 00:30:18,087
Yue Mi, whoever you meet in this world, I can be at ease... except for Tian Qi.

421
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:23,976
How can you allow yourself to be so righteous?

422
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:27,000
Am I a god who'll discard the world because of personal affairs?

423
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,865
That's not what I mean.

424
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:31,580
Come on.

425
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,318
Can't you see that it was just a joke?

426
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,359
Beware of being stubborn after staying with Bai Jue for so long.

427
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,198
Wait for me.

428
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:45,532
I'll go to catch that idiot back and beat him.

429
00:30:45,532 --> 00:30:47,260
To make you feel better.

430
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,687
Why are you here?

431
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:37,876
I heard that Her Royal Highness commanded you to go to the Lower Realm to fight against the Demon Clan.

432
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:40,876
I don't want to stay here alone. You must let me follow.

433
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:41,932
Absurd.

434
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,279
It's dangerous. Hurry and go back.

435
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,165
Do you also think I'm useless and can do nothing?

436
00:31:47,165 --> 00:31:49,487
Do you think I should stay in the hall to to deal with trifles?

437
00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:51,387
Of course not.

438
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:54,421
True God Tian Qi sets up the Array of World Destruction in the Swamp of Netherhill.

439
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:56,210
The war can't be avoided.

440
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,565
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

441
00:31:58,565 --> 00:32:00,039
You're right.

442
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,019
My power is humble.

443
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:05,469
But I also want to do something for Her Royal Highness.

444
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,643
If I stay here and do nothing, how could I be at ease?

445
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,980
How can I stay in the God Realm anymore?

446
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,958
If the war is coming, you must obey commands.

447
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:24,980
Do not act recklessly. Did you hear it?

448
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,039
Don't worry.

449
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,400
I won't bring you trouble.

450
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,338
No one can act recklessly without my permission.

451
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:48,560
Yes!

452
00:32:50,444 --> 00:32:52,000
Set off!

453
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,239
Zi Han, Chief God ordered the arrest of Demon God Tian Qi.

454
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:25,221
As long as you lead the Demon Clan back to the Demon Realm, the God Realm will never embarrass the Demon Clan.

455
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:28,043
You're dreaming! Demons will only listen to the Demon God.

456
00:33:28,043 --> 00:33:32,354
If he ruins the Lower Realm, the Demon Clan will disappear so why do you help a tyrant?

457
00:33:32,354 --> 00:33:35,187
Nonsense! Let's fight!

458
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:40,232
Today, no one will want to step into the Swamp of Netherhill unless they step over my dead body.

459
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,449
When has there been a half-god in the Demon Clan?

460
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:52,529
Tian Qi's core power is inside his body.

461
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:58,054
It seems Tian Qi has used 10 thousand years of life to expedite him.

462
00:33:58,054 --> 00:34:00,759
Tiger Demon Lord, Sen Jian, is willing to be the vanguard.

463
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,400
I will fight to the end.

464
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,789
Zi Han.

465
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:07,719
Master Bai Jue doesn't want to fight against you.

466
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:09,500
Neither do I.

467
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,500
You can't decide it!

468
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,132
The array is almost complete.

469
00:34:42,132 --> 00:34:44,139
They're delaying the time.

470
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,387
Let me go inside to persuade him.

471
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:48,029
Even Shang Gu's failed to change his mind so what else can you do?

472
00:34:48,029 --> 00:34:50,565
30 minutes. I only need 30 minutes.

473
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:54,399
Trust me. He's not a ruthless person.

474
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,300
I'm sure I can persuade him.

475
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,932
Fine. I'll give you 30 minutes.

476
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:02,700
After that, I'll go to meet him no matter what the end is.

477
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,220
Okay.

478
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,576
 She went into Swamp of Netherhill without telling the others. 

479
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:15,099
 Has she really colluded with Demon God? 

480
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:18,779
 If I can find the proof of their collusion and stop the array, 

481
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,500
 who dares to look down upon me then? 

482
00:35:31,244 --> 00:35:34,643
Oh, no! The spiritual power is starting to fade!

483
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,729
We'll have no time if we don't attack.

484
00:35:56,729 --> 00:35:58,320
Attack!

485
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,240
Go!

486
00:36:35,388 --> 00:36:36,976
Enough.

487
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:38,999
Gods and demons shouldn't be enemies.

488
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:43,579
All gods! Prevent your core power from losing anymore.

489
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,589
The seal of the Lower Realm is open.

490
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:10,279
If we can't seal it up,

491
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:15,210
the savage beasts will run from the Wasteland and scourge the Lower Realm.

492
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,629
All gods! Reinforce the seal!

493
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:41,021
Master, if Nanhai bursts its banks,

494
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:44,209
the seawater will flow backward,which will bring disaster to the Immortal Realm.

495
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:47,219
We can't let the flooding do harm to the immortals.

496
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:48,765
Let's form an array!

497
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:50,140
Yes!

498
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,619
Tian Qi.

499
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,158
How stupid you are!

500
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:28,199
How can you disregard creatures of the Lower Realm?

501
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:30,729
Shut up. I don't want to listen to it.

502
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:32,354
If you want to persuade me to surrender,

503
00:38:32,355 --> 00:38:34,478
I think you'd better go back early.

504
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,818
I've arranged the array

505
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:39,958
and I'll soon get all Chaos aura of the Lower Realm.

506
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:42,398
Even though they three come here together,

507
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:44,187
they still can't defeat me.

508
00:38:44,187 --> 00:38:47,378
Impossible! You're not that kind of person!

509
00:38:47,378 --> 00:38:49,338
I don't believe it!

510
00:38:49,338 --> 00:38:50,949
Can you understand my words?

511
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,660
Get out!

512
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,259
If so, I'll help you.

513
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:05,559
Yue Mi, what are you going to do?

514
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:09,487
Though others won't believe in you, I will.

515
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,469
There's nothing I can't complete in my whole life.

516
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,389
As if I can't bring you back,

517
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:17,480
then I'll choose to die in the array.

518
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,520
Will I care about your life?

519
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:26,280
Since you don't care, just let me die here.

520
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,932
Fine. You can go and die

521
00:39:28,932 --> 00:39:31,480
but don't stain my region!

522
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,360
Master, the power of the array seems to have weakened.

523
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:49,310
I hope they can persuade Tian Qi.

524
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:54,619
Master, shall we go to the Swamp of Netherhill to help Master Bai Jue?

525
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:56,958
The barrier here hasn't recovered yet.

526
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:59,532
We can't leave until we're sure the Lower Realm is peaceful.

527
00:39:59,532 --> 00:40:00,920
Yes!

528
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:08,319
I knew you wouldn't let me die.

529
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,143
It's enough for me to go mad

530
00:40:10,143 --> 00:40:12,565
so why would you do the same?

531
00:40:12,565 --> 00:40:14,119
Tian Qi!

532
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,438
No matter what your difficulty is,

533
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:18,276
at least I'm on your side.

534
00:40:18,276 --> 00:40:20,158
Come back with me.

535
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,040
We can tackle all the tough tasks in the world.

536
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,979
Bai Jue, Zhi Yang, and Shang Gu are also waiting for you.

537
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:34,299
Since you left, Shang Gu has never smiled again.

538
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:37,219
The other gods punish her daily.

539
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:39,820
Don't you care about her feelings anymore?

540
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:56,910


541
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,360
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

542
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:12,219
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

543
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:18,739
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

544
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:24,799
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

545
00:41:24,799 --> 00:41:31,699
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

546
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:38,159
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

547
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:45,379
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

548
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:51,820
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

549
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:10,579
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

550
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:17,059
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

551
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:24,339
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

552
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:31,220
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

553
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:39,419
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

554
00:42:39,419 --> 00:42:46,299
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

555
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:52,679
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

556
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:59,279
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

557
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:09,180
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
