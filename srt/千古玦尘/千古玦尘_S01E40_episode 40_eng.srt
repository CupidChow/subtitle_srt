1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:10,040


2
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:21,900
   

3
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,618
   

4
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:29,560
Master Shang Gu treated me with kindness,

5
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,280
I'd like to finish the plan with you.

6
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,100
But for tens of thousands of years, I've already regarded Hou Chi as my own daughter.

7
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,198
I can't bear her to be so unemotional.

8
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:44,959
Then why did you let her be exiled to Shenyin Mountain for a hundred of years?

9
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,320
You could have stopped it.

10
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,059
But you still watched as a newlywed couple was forced to be separated for decades.

11
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,659
 I won't resist a fate like this. 

12
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,608
 Just the period of 100 years has not yet arrived... 

13
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:01,569
 and Hou Chi has not returned, 

14
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,870
 I'm not reconciled to the fact. 

15
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,770
Only I know how tormented Qing Mu was,

16
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,089
not to mention Hou Chi.

17
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,049
 Give Qing Mu back to me. 

18
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,589
 He's dead. 

19
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,330
 Then his spiritual thoughts must exist, right? 

20
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,467
 Give them back to me. 

21
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,448
Forget it.

22
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:35,670
Don't mention the past.

23
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,528
I know.

24
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:43,050
I'd like to keep this secret with you.

25
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,750
However, be exiled to Shenyin Mountain for a hundred years?

26
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,349
So you can't make her give up in a few words.

27
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,349
Do you have any other methods?

28
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:56,789
I haven't thought of one yet.

29
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,128
Do you have any clue about the devil that fought with you in Wutong Forest?

30
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:04,829
It was Wu Huan.

31
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,189
I deliberately released her from the Netherworld.

32
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:13,028
But the strange thing is that I didn't find any trace of evil aura on her.

33
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:15,189
Why did Wu Huan do that?

34
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,489
She is the Heavenly Queen.

35
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,789
If we want to convict her of falling to the devils,

36
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:21,549
we must have ironclad evidence.

37
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:25,330
I don't care about the little Heavenly Queen.

38
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,128
But after awakening, I went to the Swamp of Netherhill.

39
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,188
In order to delay the outbreak of the Doom of Chaos, my divine power was damaged.

40
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,590
Now the matter of the Devil Clan is not yet clear,

41
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,009
everything should be done carefully and secretly investigated.

42
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:52,589
This time, I won't allow any accident to happen again.

43
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,570
Yes.

44
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,629
You go back and pacify Hou Chi.

45
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:06,269
When she came to me, I said some bad words.

46
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,310
She must be very sad.

47
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,989
The future is set,

48
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:13,310
I have no other choice but to be heartless.

49
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:19,030
From now on, Hou Chi and I should not see each other again.

50
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,669
Since you are sincere to her, you should pay more attention to her.

51
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,829
May your pain be shorter.

52
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:31,750
I will obey Your Master's order.

53
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,630
Your Master.

54
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,150
I just saw a divine light crossing the sky,

55
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,329
is it Upper God Gu Jun?

56
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:55,250
He was just pleading for his daughter Hou Chi.

57
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,269
You don't know that Qing Mu and I also had an engagement.

58
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:04,449
If Hou Chi hadn't stepped in, maybe we would have been married.

59
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:06,470
Had you ever been engaged with Qing Mu?

60
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,589
Yes.

61
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:10,309
My Father God had given us the engagement.

62
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,688
The reason I kept you in the Blue Dome of Heaven was that you had saved my life.

63
00:05:16,688 --> 00:05:20,228
You'd better not bring the matter of Qing Mu to me.

64
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:22,209
You misunderstood me.

65
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,550
To a True God, my slight emotions are nothing.

66
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,849
But if you want to completely break from Qingchi Palace,

67
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:34,899
you might as well accept this marriage, which can make Hou Chi completely give up.

68
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,530
I have no feelings for you.

69
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,409
Don't you worry that your reputation will be damaged?

70
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,929
I don't ask for your love,

71
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,209
only ask to marry into Abyss Hall,

72
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,549
it would be the luck of three lifetimes.

73
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:53,348
- Really? 
 - Heaven and Earth permitting.

74
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,170
Okay, I promise you.

75
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,830
Thank you, Your Master.

76
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,650
Qing Mu.

77
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,089
 Do you regret doing this for me? 

78
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,809
 Having you with me in my life, 

79
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:30,530
 I have no regrets. 

80
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,629
 Then let's be the most ordinary couple. 

81
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:39,409
 We have a long time to grow old together. 

82
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,050
Qing Mu.

83
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,630
 Shang Gu, come back. 

84
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,669
 Please, I'm begging you. 

85
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:53,850
 These three realms are entrusted to you. 

86
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,670
 May I not be a god in the next life, 

87
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,569
 and can be with you. 

88
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,190
 If the three realms are here, you will be here. 

89
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,629
 I won't allow you to die. 

90
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,970
It turns out that Master Bai Jue

91
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,390
cares about Master Shang Gu so much.

92
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,149
 Who are you? 

93
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:46,429
Master God Shang Gu, can you see me this time?

94
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:49,129
 I have been lonely in this void for tens of thousands of years, 

95
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:53,529
 it is the first time I have seen someone coming in. 

96
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,888
Then you should be very lonely, right?

97
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,870
 Why do we look so much alike? 

98
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,189
I don't want to look like you either.

99
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:07,728
Unfortunately, I was born in a body that hides your god consciousness.

100
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,769
I had no choice.

101
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,490
 Body? 

102
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,389
 What does that mean? 

103
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,528
 Since the Doom of Chaos, I've been wandering in the void, have I not? 

104
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:23,108
It turns out that you are also so pitiful that you don't know who you are.

105
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,869
 I'm not pathetic. 

106
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:27,528
 I have you now, don't I? 

107
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:30,448
 Can you chat with me more? 

108
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:32,288
What do you want to say?

109
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:36,209
 Did you see Bai Jue outside? 

110
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:38,110
Him?

111
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,910
He is fine.

112
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,569
But my Qing Mu is no longer there.

113
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,149
 Qing Mu? 

114
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,309
I am your double,

115
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,890
Qing Mu is Bai Jue's double.

116
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,529
When you wake up, we will disappear

117
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:54,829
and no one will remember us anymore.

118
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:57,370
 I don't understand what you mean. 

119
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,068
 Bai Jue has always taken the life of the three realms as his mission, 

120
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:04,650
 how could he hurt others because of his own desire? 

121
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,668
But he just hurt me.

122
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:11,188
I prayed for him to return my Qing Mu to me,

123
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:13,689
but he only regarded Qing Mu as dust,

124
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,609
using, crushing, and disdaining him.

125
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:19,829
He never asked if there was any pain in my heart.

126
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:23,990
 Fate is never biased, when it comes, 

127
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,369
 we can only bear it. 

128
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:31,669
 The only thing we can do is to ask ourselves what choice to make, 

129
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:34,869
 and what you are carrying. 

130
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,469
Superficially dignified.

131
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:41,008
If our destiny is to be a True God, then what is your destiny?

132
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:44,328
When the Doom of Chaos came, you sacrificed yourself,

133
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:46,489
were you really doing it for the sake of all living beings?

134
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:48,069
 Of course. 

135
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:50,629
 As the Chief God, if I didn't undertake it, 

136
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:56,008
 wouldn't it cause countless living beings sacrificed in vain? 

137
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:59,928
Then, why did you make the last wish not to become a god in the next life?

138
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:04,990
 As the Chief God, I'm also like a mortal. 

139
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:10,150
 I just want to fulfill a wish to be with my lover. 

140
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:14,769
 If I can't be with Qing Mu, 

141
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,549
 can I still make a wish for the next life? 

142
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,089
Qing Mu.

143
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,610
Qing Mu, if it were you,

144
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:53,209
would you forgive them?

145
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,089
Qing Mu,

146
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,549
do you know why I always beat you by half a piece?

147
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:38,389
Today, I will tell you my chess moves.

148
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:44,350
You like to attack, so you always play like this.

149
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:49,530
But I am good at defending and blocking you.

150
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,769
You do things in an open way, rampantly,

151
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:59,590
but I am careful and cautious.

152
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,849
So when we play the game of Go,

153
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:06,329
we often get into a stalemate.

154
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:11,269
But this move, have a look.

155
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:15,089
I deliberately play it wrong to lure you into it,

156
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,508
and you are eager to beat me in one fell swoop.

157
00:12:19,508 --> 00:12:24,150
I'll take your back and cut off your supply.

158
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,889
In this way, I'll just beat you by half a piece.

159
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:31,750
I see.

160
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:35,449
Just...

161
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:38,449
Just...

162
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,050
   

163
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,750
   

164
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,709
Upper God, look at these two.

165
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:29,840
Which one is more suitable?

166
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,729
If Hou Chi has a girl,

167
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,450
the pink one would be quite suitable.

168
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,290
But I do think the red one is actually good, which is festive.

169
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,189
Then take both of them.

170
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,429
Okay.

171
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:50,488
These are the toys that Hou Chi played with as a child,

172
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:52,370
put them together.

173
00:13:53,790 --> 00:14:00,330
Boys may like these, but not for girls.

174
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,749
Our Little Highness grew up like a boy.

175
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:13,829
Then put these small ducks and carts inside,

176
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:16,109
which a girl may also like.

177
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:17,608
That's okay.

178
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:20,150
Upper God, you have been picking for two hours.

179
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,909
This box is almost full.

180
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:25,129
When the child is born, you can buy them one by one.

181
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,389
Right.

182
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:28,710
I'll have plenty of chances later.

183
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,889
Take these back to the study.

184
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,250
Yes.

185
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:52,508
What is the happy event?

186
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:54,088
Your Highness,

187
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:57,630
Princess Jing Zhao is going to marry into Blue Dome of Heaven.

188
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,590
Really?

189
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,949
Heavenly King granted the marriage,

190
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,790
and True God Bai Jue also agreed to it.

191
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,569
The whole Heavenly Palace is busy with the ceremony.

192
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,309
Shut up!

193
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,648
Are you going to station yourself in the Luocha Region?

194
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:16,950
Yes.

195
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,010
I've already told you that

196
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,168
Master Bai Jue imprisoned Feng Ran

197
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:26,088
to find out the true culprit of the Devil Clan.

198
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:29,688
Therefore, you won't be punished for releasing Feng Ran.

199
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:32,770
Why do you still punish yourself so much?

200
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,728
Father God, I received news last night that

201
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:37,769
Sen Yu has been abnormal recently.

202
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,129
I feel uneasy,

203
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,249
so I want to go to the Luocha Region as soon as possible

204
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,968
to avoid danger at the border.

205
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:45,349
How dare the Demon Clan cause trouble?

206
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:47,329
But Master has come to the world,

207
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,408
so we don't have to fear the Demon Clan anymore.

208
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:53,549
Go after attending the wedding of your sister and Master.

209
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:54,689
Yes.

210
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,650
Father God, have you found out any clue about the devil auras

211
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,810
that slaughtered the Phoenix Clan?

212
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,469
No clues as of yet.

213
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:09,149
The only witness, Elder Dan Feng, is also missing now.

214
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:17,968
 This is my phoenix feather; 

215
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:20,210
 how come it's in your hands? 

216
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,629
Jian'er.

217
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,330
Jian'er.

218
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,869
Father God.

219
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,968
What's wrong?

220
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:34,269
Why do you look so worried and pale?

221
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:37,430
Maybe I haven't had a good rest recently.

222
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,009
If there is nothing else,

223
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,500
I'd like to go back to rest as soon as possible.

224
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:15,029
Jian'er.

225
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,408
What's wrong?

226
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,569
Nothing.

227
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,510
I still have military orders, I'll leave now.

228
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,049
Wait!

229
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,990
Am I an evil beast?

230
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,730
I know that because of the Halberd of Sun and Moon,

231
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,488
you have some misunderstanding about me.

232
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:48,609
But after all these years,

233
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,830
we have been finally reunited.

234
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,449
Those past events,

235
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,049
why do you still put them in mind?

236
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,870
Mother God, stop acting like a good mother.

237
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:03,269
I just feel scared when I look at you.

238
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:05,429
What are you talking about?

239
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,288
After Zhao'er's wedding,

240
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,329
I'll go and station myself in the Luocha Region.

241
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,490
This time, I won't return to the Heavenly Palace again.

242
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,330
I just hope that for my sake,

243
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,870
you don't do anything to disappoint Father God again.

244
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:23,050
Jian'er.

245
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,250
Jian'er.

246
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,510
Your Highness,

247
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:34,469
since His Highness came back from Wutong Forest,

248
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:36,309
he has been like this.

249
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,490
Is it possible that

250
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,250
he knows the secret of Wutong Forest?

251
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:46,410
Go to check.

252
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,610
Tell me what he did in Wutong Forest.

253
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,269
Yes.

254
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,870
Master, it's my fault.

255
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,528
Feng Ran returned to Qingchi Palace some days ago,

256
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:10,049
but there's been no clue of the Wutong Forest case. What do you think about it?

257
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,720
The key to the Wutong Forest case is its involvement with the Devil Clan.

258
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,348
As long as the God Realm opens as soon as possible,

259
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:19,950
even if the Devil Clan has a new Devil God, we don't have to fear.

260
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,308
Now we have gathered three of the four divine weapons,

261
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:25,129
Tai Cang Spear, Purple Moon Whip, and Halberd of Sun and Moon.

262
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,989
But there is no aura of Emperor Sword.

263
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,028
Be careful.

264
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:33,268
These are the best wines that all the clans have submitted

265
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:35,109
for my wedding with Master.

266
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:37,808
If they are spilled, I will punish you all.

267
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:40,849
You have to be careful, do not be careless.

268
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:42,309
 Yes. 

269
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:44,049
It's a happy event.

270
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,449
Why do you look so sad?

271
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,989
That's right.

272
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:56,209
It's my poor teaching that makes you laugh.

273
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:07,208
- Is that true? 
 - Of course.

274
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,849
The river deer spirit next door told me that.

275
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:11,348
I didn't believe it, so I went to the mountain to inquire about it.

276
00:20:11,348 --> 00:20:13,050
Now it has spread throughout the three realms.

277
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,188
Everyone says that Master Bai Jue is going to marry Princess Jing Zhao.

278
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:20,888
I didn't expect that Qing Mu was such a person.

279
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:24,488
Even if he forgets Her Highness, he shouldn't marry Jing Zhao.

280
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:27,429
I'm going to tell Upper God Gu Jun.

281
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:28,868
Hurry up to tell the people in the palace

282
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:31,610
to keep this from Little Goddess, okay?

283
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,529
Have you seen Hou Chi?

284
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,610
No.

285
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,788
I've been looking for you for a long time, you are here.

286
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:07,368
Why are you looking for me?

287
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:11,929
Jing Jian's letter said that Qing Mu's grave in the North Sea has been built.

288
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:14,649
I think you would like to see him.

289
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:19,748
Feng Ran, there is no longer Soul Tower at the bottom of Huajing Pond.

290
00:21:19,748 --> 00:21:21,789
Then, where is Bo Xuan?

291
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:24,989
Qing Mu's initial search for memories was related to Bo Xuan.

292
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:27,629
Now the Soul Towel guarding Bo Xuan is missing,

293
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:30,768
perhaps it has something to do with Qing Mu.

294
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:31,849
It's impossible.

295
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:36,350
Only Master, you, and I can enter that place, others can not enter.

296
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,788
- I will go to the North Sea. 
 - I'll go with you.

297
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:41,128
Let me go alone.

298
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:42,869
Hou Chi.

299
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:07,989
Your Highness, Feng Ran going to the Wutong Forest was to meet Elder Dan Feng.

300
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:15,489
Why did she meet that wild girl?

301
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:22,429
I only vaguely heard her talk about the daughter of the Phoenix Empress and Swamp of Netherhill.

302
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:24,049
It's you!

303
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,950
You killed the Phoenix Empress.

304
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,769
It's not my fault.

305
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:29,850
It's not my business.

306
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,528
I found that the Phoenix Empress's spirit was false,

307
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:36,149
so I tried to find out the whereabouts of Wu Xi and Feng Yan,

308
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:39,188
but I did not expect that Feng Yan was pregnant.

309
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:40,869
I asked you to kill them.

310
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:46,488
Unexpectedly, you released their child without telling me.

311
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:48,729
You destroyed the Phoenix Clan.

312
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,929
It's you!

313
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,189
You should have died long ago.

314
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,849
Wu Huan, when the Phoenix Empress returns,

315
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:02,249
you will be in endless purgatory.

316
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,329
Tell me.

317
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:08,849
Is Phoenix Empress's sinful child Feng Ran?

318
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:12,810
You will be punished, Wu Huan!

319
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,689
There are still many young phoenixes

320
00:23:21,689 --> 00:23:23,869
in the clan that have not yet been born.

321
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,268
When the Phoenix Clan is rebuilt,

322
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:29,289
you will be the only elder.

323
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:34,129
Thank you, Your Highness.

324
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:37,330
Feng Ran,

325
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,690
if you're really the daughter of the Phoenix Empress,

326
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:47,289
then don't blame me for killing you.

327
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,889
Master, Bai Jue is going to marry Jing Zhao.

328
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,249
Bai Jue is going to marry Jing Zhao?

329
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:10,988
Master, how could he break Hou Chi's heart like that?

330
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:12,830
Feng Ran.

331
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,229
Don't worry.

332
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:21,329
Hou Chi has gone to the North Sea,

333
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,348
where it's sparsely populated.

334
00:24:23,348 --> 00:24:26,070
I think she will not learn of the news.

335
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:38,269
Keep in mind that Master Bai Jue is no longer Qing Mu,

336
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:42,188
Heavenly Palace has nothing to do with Qingchi Palace.

337
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:48,790
No one is allowed to mess with the Blue Dome of Heaven.

338
00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:04,830
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

339
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:23,149
Master Bai Jue, is this the method you came up with

340
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:27,409
to break the love of Hou Chi?

341
00:25:28,969 --> 00:25:31,280
For her...

342
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,080
it's too cruel.

343
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:47,388
Don't you think it's weird?

344
00:25:47,388 --> 00:25:48,929
According to Upper God's temperament,

345
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:52,649
how could he endure the Heavenly Palace humiliating Hou Chi so?

346
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:56,528
Her Highness is sad, Upper God Gu Jun must be sadder.

347
00:25:56,529 --> 00:26:00,808
He endured it like this, which must be his way to protect his daughter.

348
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,990
Instruction feather of the Blue Dome of Heaven.

349
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,788
Is Master Bai Jue going to invite Qingchi Palace to the wedding?

350
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:09,789
I'll tell God.

351
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:12,290
Wait. It's not for Master, but for me.

352
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,089
You?

353
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,949
He asked me to meet in the Blue Dome of Heaven

354
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:19,068
and said he would tell me about my birth.

355
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:20,969
How does he know about your birth?

356
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,779
Master Bai Jue is going to marry Jing Zhao tomorrow,

357
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:25,429
why would he ask you to meet in the Blue Dome of Heaven?

358
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:27,589
Just in time.

359
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,888
He broke Hou Chi's heart so much,

360
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:33,150
Upper God Gu Jun can bear it, but I can't.

361
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,269
Lordess, he just said that we can't cause trouble.

362
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:39,050
I know it. Don't tell him.

363
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,888
Heavenly Queen?

364
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:12,969
Did you lure me to the Blue Dome of Heaven under the guise of Bai Jue's order?

365
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:17,469
Yes, I made that instruction feather.

366
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,908
You pretended to be Master, aren't you afraid that Bai Jue will punish you?

367
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:22,329
Punish?

368
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:26,989
As long as you die, no one in this world will know your existence.

369
00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:30,228
And who can condemn me

370
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:32,088
because of a person who disappeared?

371
00:27:32,088 --> 00:27:34,048
I'm the master of Qingchi Palace,

372
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:37,230
do you think Upper God Gu Jun will forgive you?

373
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:44,169
So what... if he doesn't forgive me?

374
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,469
You really are a fire phoenix.

375
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,588
 When Chief God was alive, 

376
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:09,149
 she wanted to choose a divine beast in our Phoenix Clan. 

377
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:10,868
 Your background is low. 

378
00:28:10,868 --> 00:28:12,969
 I didn't want to agree it, 

379
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,389
 but by chance, you still got Chief God's favor 

380
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:20,909
 to enter Pilgrim Hall of the God Realm. 

381
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,209
 In the war of the Swamp of Netherhill, 

382
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,790
 you also made a lot of achievements. 

383
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,409
 It's truly good. 

384
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:30,910
 Our Phoenix Clan is proud of you. 

385
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:36,409
 And now I want to pass the position of the Phoenix Clan patriarch to you. 

386
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:40,030
 Wu Huan, are you willing to accept it? 

387
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,010
 The patriarch of the Phoenix Clan? 

388
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,488
 Me? 

389
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:46,988
 I'm just a fifth-grade colored phoenix, 

390
00:28:46,988 --> 00:28:49,770
 can I really take such an important job? 

391
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,369
 For some reason, 

392
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:58,010
 there is no movement of the Phoenix Empress's nirvana for a long time. 

393
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,629
 All right. 

394
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:02,589
 Because of fate, each has its own origin. 

395
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:07,949
 Just remember, no matter what happens in the future, 

396
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:11,070
 you have to guard the birth of the Phoenix Empress, 

397
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:15,229
 and then return the position of patriarch to her. 

398
00:29:15,229 --> 00:29:18,469
 Do you understand? 

399
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,869
 - I… 
 - Keep in mind that 

400
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:25,790
 the Phoenix Empress will be born from the fire phoenix's nirvana. 

401
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,469
 Only the fire phoenix is the hope of our Phoenix Clan. 

402
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:39,228
You should have died when you were born,

403
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:41,788
you're lucky to live until now.

404
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:43,470
But you were not afraid of death,

405
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,949
and went back to Wutong Forest to look for your life,

406
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:48,829
and wanted to take back the position of Phoenix Empress.

407
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,829
Feng Ran, you have today's end,

408
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:54,068
all because you are not satisfied

409
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:57,090
and covet too much. You deserve it!

410
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,550
Did you see me come into this world?

411
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,349
I really belong to the Phoenix Clan of Wutong Forest.

412
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,389
Then, who are my real parents?

413
00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:12,210
Why did they abandon me?

414
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,788
You don't know?

415
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:19,150
Well, I'll let you know today.

416
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,990
Your mother was Feng Yan, a phoenix reborn in fire,

417
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,089
which was the only fire phoenix of the Phoenix Clan.

418
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:29,310
But she disregarded the mission to be Shang Gu's divine beast.

419
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:33,530
And lived in seclusion with the ancestor of Wutong Wu Xi.

420
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,089
You are their child.

421
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:39,890
So you also inherited the body of the fire phoenix,

422
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,509
with the dignity of the Phoenix Empress.

423
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,690
If I am really the Phoenix Empress,

424
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,069
then when I was born,

425
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:50,789
why did they abandon me in the Swamp of Netherhill?

426
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,429
Because of me, of course.

427
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:55,048
I couldn't accept the fact that

428
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:58,569
someone was more qualified to be the patriarch of the Phoenix Clan than I was.

429
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:02,589
So I sent someone to follow them and let Dan Feng kill them.

430
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:09,130
Unexpectedly, she left you in the Swamp of Netherhill to let you alive.

431
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,690
You killed my parents.

432
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,329
I'm going to kill you!

433
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,309
After 24 hours,

434
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:24,068
your spiritual power will be drained by this Mixed Element Formation,

435
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:26,709
and turned into an elixir of bone and blood.

436
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:28,449
As long as I swallow it,

437
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,489
I will become the real Phoenix Empress.

438
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:37,089
Feng Ran, your revenge will never be avenged.

439
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:41,130
Today, I will have double happiness.

440
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:07,549
 Something's happened to Feng Ran. 

441
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,570
So what if it was you?

442
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,750
Now it's me.

443
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,610
Zhao'er.

444
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,029
- Mother God. 
 - You are all dismissed.

445
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:04,870
 Yes. 

446
00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:14,449
What are you going to say, Mother God?

447
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:21,969
After today, you will be the most honored person in the three realms.

448
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:27,208
Have you ever thought that if the people from Qingchi Palace

449
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:30,070
come to make trouble at the wedding,

450
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,450
what you would do?

451
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,308
She is the loser.

452
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,229
What can she do?

453
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:42,269
Can she even go to Heaven?

454
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,030
You take it too simply.

455
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:53,788
Okay.

456
00:33:53,788 --> 00:33:55,689
From today on,

457
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:59,428
you just feel at ease to be the most beautiful bride in these three realms.

458
00:33:59,428 --> 00:34:05,449
I have arranged for your brother to send troops to the Blue Dome of Heaven.

459
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:08,189
If Hou Chi dares to make trouble,

460
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,289
I won't let her go.

461
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,030
Thank you, Mother God.

462
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,370
Qing Mu, until now,

463
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:48,529
I still can not accept the fact that you have left.

464
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,750
This mound is clearly an empty tomb.

465
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,070
Who can prove that you are gone,

466
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,849
just by the word of the True God?

467
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:00,710
I don't believe it.

468
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,950
   

469
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:08,250
Qing Mu, I'm pregnant.

470
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,489
You're going to be a father.

471
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:16,828
I wanted to tell you this in person,

472
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:19,169
I wanted to see how happy you would be.

473
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,790
But now...

474
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:26,208
I can only imagine how you would look when you hear this.

475
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:37,930
Hou Chi.

476
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,489
Qing Mu.

477
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:48,250
 ♫ Turned into texture and carved in the palm ♫ 

478
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:54,409
 ♫ Thousands of revolutions, how many drifts ♫ 

479
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:57,230
 ♫ Let my longings embrace your shadow ♫ 

480
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:03,270
 My wife, Hou Chi, if you see this, I think I have died. 

481
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:08,969
 But it's not what I want and I can't change it. 

482
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,188
 Since we saved Bo Xuan, 

483
00:36:13,188 --> 00:36:16,809
 a lot of memories that didn't belong to me have been opened up. 

484
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:18,928
Saved Bo Xuan.

485
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:21,910
 In front of the undersea cave of the North Sea, 

486
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:26,569
 the way that Bo Xuan used to open the cold ice cave suddenly appeared in my mind. 

487
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:30,029
 So I opened it too. 

488
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,110
 Qing Mu. 

489
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,989
 I don't know why that happened. 

490
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:40,169
 Maybe, when we find Bo Xuan, 

491
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:42,348
 then everything will be answered. 

492
00:36:42,348 --> 00:36:44,228
 When I opened the ice coffin of Bo Xuan, 

493
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:46,249
 one of his spiritual consciousnesses struck me, 

494
00:36:46,249 --> 00:36:48,970
 causing me to lose my concentration for a moment. 

495
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,570
 Qing Mu. 

496
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:57,329
I remember that when you suddenly called Jing Yuan, Tian Qi,

497
00:36:57,329 --> 00:36:59,369
I thought it was strange.

498
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:01,069
 It's Octagonal God-Trapping Trap. 

499
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:03,720
 Tian Qi, don't underestimate the enemy. 

500
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,729
 What did you call me? 

501
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:13,348
 After that, Bo Xuan's memories kept pouring into my dreams and mind, 

502
00:37:13,348 --> 00:37:16,948
 and there were actually some memories of Master Bai Jue in the God Realm. 

503
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:21,828
 Hou Chi, I think Bo Xuan, Master Bai Jue, and I 

504
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:23,909
 might be one person. 

505
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,129
Bai Jue.

506
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:31,229
 This feeling of being taken over by other people's memories is really uncomfortable. 

507
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:35,009
 But fortunately, I saw your mischievous and cute look as a child. 

508
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:37,029
It's not good.

509
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:39,449
You're turning into someone else.

510
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:41,288
Why didn't you tell me?

511
00:37:41,288 --> 00:37:43,510
 I was afraid to tell you 

512
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,540
 for fear that you would worry that I would disappear. 

513
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:51,868
 I don't know if I'll become someone else, 

514
00:37:51,868 --> 00:37:54,670
 and I don't know how much time I have. 

515
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:01,509
 Maybe I'll always be me and be able to grow old with you. 

516
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:07,470
 Maybe in a flash I will leave, 

517
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,929
 and never be able to be with you. 

518
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:14,370
 I hope we can be together forever. 

519
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:18,069
 But just in case, I still applied spiritual power 

520
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:21,449
 to these fireflies in the North Sea and left this message. 

521
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:28,089
 I want to say that you don't have to be sad about my leaving, 

522
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,990
 and don't be hurt by looking for me. 

523
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:39,250
 Hou Chi, although my life is short, 

524
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,170
 it's enough to have you. 

525
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,800
 Even if I'm not around you anymore, you should take care of yourself. 

526
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,960
 Take good care of yourself. 

527
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:01,650
 I love you. 

528
00:39:05,629 --> 00:39:07,529
 My wife. 

529
00:39:14,669 --> 00:39:18,550
 I love you forever. My wife. 

530
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,369
Qing Mu.

531
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,389
Qing Mu. Don't go.

532
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:25,230
Don't leave me.

533
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,370
Feng Ran.

534
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,209
Feng Ran.

535
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:49,850
Feng Ran.

536
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,950
Jing Jian.

537
00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:57,789
Don't worry. I'll let you out right now.

538
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,269
How could it be?

539
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:05,429
What is this spirit fire? I've never seen it.

540
00:40:05,429 --> 00:40:09,668
No use. This is Mixed Element Formation set by the Heavenly Queen,

541
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:12,650
which you can't break.

542
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,310
Is my Mother God who trapped you here?

543
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:20,969
Did she know your origin?

544
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:23,749
You already knew that?

545
00:40:23,749 --> 00:40:25,850
Feng Ran, I…

546
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:30,409
You're here to save me.

547
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:33,850
I'm glad we can be friends.

548
00:40:35,689 --> 00:40:37,570
You can go.

549
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,209
I won't leave.

550
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,309
I will get you out of here.

551
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,950
No one can hurt you.

552
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:50,489
Not even my Mother God.

553
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,969
Get out of here.

554
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:23,970


555
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:33,449
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

556
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:40,350
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

557
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:46,849
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

558
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:53,050
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

559
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:59,649
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

560
00:41:59,649 --> 00:42:06,399
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

561
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:13,624
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

562
00:42:13,624 --> 00:42:20,470
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

563
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:37,449
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

564
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:43,950
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

565
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:51,175
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

566
00:42:51,175 --> 00:42:58,400
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

567
00:42:59,775 --> 00:43:06,324
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

568
00:43:06,324 --> 00:43:13,150
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

569
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:19,649
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

570
00:43:19,649 --> 00:43:26,174
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

571
00:43:26,174 --> 00:43:36,950
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
