1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:09,960


2
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:21,180
   

3
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,213
   

4
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:31,484
Up and forward. Strive to achieve a state of unity of mind and body.

5
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,079
Stop.

6
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,479
Your Royal Highness, you are a beginner, so don't be anxious.

7
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,979
Use your legs to exert strength, do not focus on your body shape.

8
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,479
It's all about the mind.

9
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,900
Okay.

10
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:50,520
Stay.

11
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,841
She's slimmer than usual.

12
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:01,678
Master, Litter Master God has had a big appetite the past few days.

13
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:03,458
Her waist looks wider.

14
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,939
She's not slim.

15
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:10,620
Master, we should go to the training ground.

16
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,269
I ate too much today.

17
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:15,814
I want to stay for a while longer and digest the food.

18
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:22,900
You said true gods just had soup when they were on a diet.

19
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:28,080
Master, wait for me.

20
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
   

21
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:38,779
Bai Jue.

22
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,880
Bai Jue.

23
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,390
I saw that you usually liked wearing the color of white.

24
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,429
So, I wore a white dress today.

25
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,190
But you're out.

26
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,164
Your Royal Highness.

27
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:18,834
Why is it you again?

28
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:21,219
Don't you know other goddesses can't enter Abyss Hall?

29
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,206
Bai Jue did that to you. Why are you here again?

30
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:26,309
The whole God Realm knows Master Bai Jue treats you differently.

31
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,450
You must be happy about it.

32
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,578
Bai Jue and I are all True Gods who are totally connected.

33
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,320
He should treat me kindly.

34
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,050
Just lie to yourself.

35
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,969
If you weren't a Chief God of the God Realm,

36
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,329
if True God Zhi Yang didn't pick True God Bai Jue to teach you,

37
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,450
given your usual behaviors,

38
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,621
Master Bai Jue wouldn't look up to you.

39
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:50,210
You're better than us just because of your identity.

40
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,388
You broke my kite. You don't apologize but humiliate me.

41
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:57,829
It's just a kite. Why are you so angry?

42
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:01,120
Perhaps I'm right.

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,863
As the God of Chaos, you're ignorant and your divine power is low.

44
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:07,006
What qualifies you to be the Chief God of the Three Realms?

45
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:09,788
How can you enter Abyss Hall and become his apprentice?

46
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:13,409
How dare you? If I'm not qualified, then are you?

47
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:16,228
Of course, I am. You're just superior to me.

48
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:17,600
You have nothing better than me.

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,729
Fine. Since you're so arrogant, let's have a clean fight.

50
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,328
If you win, I'll forgive your insubordination.

51
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:28,310
- If you fail... 
 - If I lose, I'll accept my punishment.

52
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,790
Okay.

53
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:47,450
 Your Royal Highness. 

54
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:54,906
Your Royal Highness is noble. I can't hurt you.

55
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:56,849
Let's battle on these lotus leaves.

56
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:59,950
Whoever falls down first, fails.

57
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,229
Okay.

58
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,428
Your Royal Highness, it's insulting.

59
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:13,810
Enough to beat you.

60
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:41,049
 When did Her Royal Highness become so great? 

61
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,789
 Yeah. 

62
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:15,589
 Looks like a fair fight. 

63
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:17,970
 Yeah. 

64
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,989
Your Royal Highness, you lost.

65
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,520
You cheated.

66
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,399
Lost is lost.

67
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,834
As a Chief God, are you a bad loser?

68
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:26,690
Emperor Sword.

69
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:31,691
You said you wouldn't use it when you made the challenge.

70
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,877
 Emperor Sword can split the Heaven and the Earth. 

71
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:36,949
 If you fight me with it, I'm afraid... 

72
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,635
 Don't worry. I'll win fair and square. 

73
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:42,370
 I won't use the mighty weapon to beat you. 

74
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,449
Now you lost and you're mad at me.

75
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,106
This is outrageous.

76
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,006
Her Royal Highness is young.

77
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:53,500
They didn't say spells couldn't be used before the battle.

78
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,649
 Master Bai Jue. 

79
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,169
Master.

80
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:10,489
Master, don't blame me.

81
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:13,829
I just want to see why I'm not better than Her Royal Highness.

82
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,468
I didn't expect I'd be lucky to win.

83
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,908
But it makes Her Royal Highness angry.

84
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:21,863
Lucky to win? I think you're joking.

85
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:26,306
If you didn't cheat, Shang Gu would have won within ten moves.

86
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:29,635
You're worse than her not just with your moves and diligence,

87
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:32,160
but also because of your state of mind.

88
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,134
Do you hear it?

89
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:35,128
Thankfully, he's reasonable.

90
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:38,270
If you apologize to me, I may be happy and I...

91
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,890
Shut up!

92
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:42,770
The battle is over.

93
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,169
You shall leave!

94
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,010
 Yes. 

95
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:51,860
 We're leaving. 

96
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,034
You didn't focus on cultivation but messed around in Peach Woods.

97
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:59,220
She set you up with a spell.

98
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,769
Why are you happy?

99
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:02,034
Bai Jue.

100
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:06,435
The best thing you should learn is to govern your emotions.

101
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:09,748
A few bad words from the God of Snow and the other gods then you pull out the sword.

102
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:11,906
How will the Gods of the Three Realms trust you?

103
00:08:11,906 --> 00:08:13,968
How will you bring peace to the world?

104
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:16,329
Xue Ying destroyed our kite.

105
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,691
It's just a kite.

106
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:19,263
We can make another one.

107
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:22,149
As a Chief God, you are living in the tranquility of the gods.

108
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:24,820
Today is like this, what about tomorrow?

109
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,106
For you, the kite is a little thing.

110
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:31,060
For me, it isn't.

111
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,429
Shang Gu.

112
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:45,620
Master.

113
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,448
Master, please stay.

114
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:49,528
Don't be angry with me, Master.

115
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,863
It's all my fault.

116
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:56,610
I'll do anything to make Her Royal Highness less angry.

117
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,777
If you feel awful about that,

118
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:00,389
you should go and apologize to Shang Gu.

119
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,109
Rather than acting before me.

120
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,910
Her Royal Highness is still angry.

121
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,934
She won't forgive me easily.

122
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:13,289
Right. How about I take your millennium divine power as punishment?

123
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:15,363
- What? 
 - No?

124
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:19,500
So, you said something you didn't mean just now?

125
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,663
I can't.

126
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:22,449
I'm in charge of the seasons of the Lower Realm.

127
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:25,120
If my divine power is damaged, it may bring up lots of problems.

128
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,892
Besides, I contributed to the war between the gods and devils.

129
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:32,350
People may judge you if you punish me like that.

130
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,135
You are thinking too much.

131
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:37,390
However, you deserve the punishment.

132
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:50,991
You're weak. You didn't work hard but used crooked ways.

133
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:55,520
I remember I told you no goddesses can enter Abyss Hall.

134
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,950
Including you, of course.

135
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:19,749
Your Royal Highness, here's the apology gift from the Goddess of Snow.

136
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,763
It's only the millennium divine power. It's worse than my power of chaos.

137
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:24,590
I don't want it.

138
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,949
You're laughing at me.

139
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:30,269
You think my power of chaos isn't all that great, right?

140
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,678
I won't go to Abyss Hall tomorrow.

141
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,389
My kite is broken. He didn't comfort me.

142
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,950
It's just a battle, but he made a fuss over it.

143
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,179
He said I changed the way that the three realms viewed me.

144
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:48,378
I think his brain is upside down.

145
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:50,769
I'm so angry.

146
00:10:57,007 --> 00:11:00,430
I yelled at Bai Jue just now.

147
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:03,814
He must be mad at me.

148
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:07,135
I must not be perfect in his mind.

149
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:10,279
But it's not my fault, right?

150
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,780
He yelled at me first.

151
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,440
So, I'm still perfect in his mind.

152
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:25,150
It's so hard to pursue someone.

153
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,138
Yue Mi is right.

154
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:31,259
I can't get my hopes up, right?

155
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,220
What should I do?

156
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,284
Master, I had the divine gem sent over.

157
00:12:02,284 --> 00:12:04,839
I only said it was from the Goddess of Snow Temple like you asked.

158
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,800
I didn't give myself away.

159
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,560
Put it away. I won't need it anymore.

160
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,041
Master, you won't go to see Her Royal Highness?

161
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,299
No need.

162
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,980
Go and tell her to switch to the Imperial Mind Spell tomorrow.

163
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,171
Yes.

164
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:32,939
Master, please don't mind my saying this.

165
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:36,356
When Her Royal Highness returned from Observation Mountain, she worked hard on cultivation.

166
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:40,420
She's young. There'll be time.

167
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:49,559
Are you blaming me for being too hard on her?

168
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,356
No, I can't.

169
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:53,510
There isn't much time for her.

170
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:58,339
If I don't push her but go easy on her, I'll hurt her.

171
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,300
Go.

172
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,810
Yes.

173
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:35,441
Ice Cube, Shang Gu hasn't been to your hall for cultivation in a while.

174
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,070
I heard Hong Ri invited her several times, but he couldn't get her.

175
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,899
What? You can't teach her.

176
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:42,499
Why do you mention this?

177
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,456
Enjoy the good tea. Don't spoil our fun.

178
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:48,700
Zhi Yang, I just learned a new move. I'm sure you've never seen it.

179
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,369
Shang Gu, you came at the right moment.

180
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:54,140
Come on.

181
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,890
I heard what happened in Peach Woods.

182
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,899
Bai Jue was partial to you, wasn't he?

183
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,741
Why are you angry with him?

184
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,609
Sit down.

185
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:08,614
The three of us are intimate, aren't we?

186
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,378
He took the Goddess of Snow's millennium divine power as punishment.

187
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:14,280
He did that for you.

188
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,884
Really?

189
00:14:15,884 --> 00:14:18,239
- Big mouth. 
 - Really.

190
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:21,358
Forget it. No matter what move Xue Ying used, I lost.

191
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:23,419
Right?

192
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:26,927
Shang Gu, it's so easy to please you.

193
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:29,038
You know what they say, don't believe a word a god says.

194
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:30,378
You can't just...

195
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:33,139
Shang Gu, I have something to tell you.

196
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,684
We're talking about picking you a sacred beast in Wutong Forest.

197
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:39,660
When shall we go?

198
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,570
It can't wait.

199
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,542
Shang Gu, let me go with you.

200
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,042
Wutong Forest is a good place.

201
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:49,739
We can travel all the way and have fun.

202
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,799
You won't go?

203
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,580
I'm occupied.

204
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,110
We can leave a few days late if you're busy.

205
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,630
I'll wait for you.

206
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,728
Well, why must it be him?

207
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:05,280
Because he's my master.

208
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:16,259
Bai Jue!

209
00:15:20,957 --> 00:15:23,789
Do you want to ask me why I won't go to the Phoenix Clan with you?

210
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,227
I thought about it.

211
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:28,739
You were right about the battle between me and Xue Ying.

212
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:30,784
I was too careless.

213
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:32,478
And I should admit that I lost.

214
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:34,520
I'll find a way to win it back.

215
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,979
I don't care about it anymore.

216
00:15:35,979 --> 00:15:37,718
Then why won't you go with me?

217
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:41,256
Shang Gu, I can't help you solve everything.

218
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:43,269
This trip is about the Phoenix Clan.

219
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:45,341
It's a chance for you to control the sacred beast.

220
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:47,784
And it's the best opportunity for you to grow up.

221
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:49,542
But I've been cultivating with you.

222
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:53,660
How could you not go with me to pick a sacred beast?

223
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:56,041
Master. Your Royal Highness.

224
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,971
Elder Feng Yun wants to see you.

225
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,470
Your Royal Highness.

226
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,718
Master Bai Jue.

227
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,238
Elder Feng Yun, what brings you here?

228
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,870
Didn't you receive my instruction feather?

229
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,813
I came to see you because I received it.

230
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:19,520
What do you mean?

231
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,899
The Phoenix Clan are guilty of a great sin. Please forgive us.

232
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,980
What happened?

233
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,539
Before Ancestral God passed away,

234
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:33,441
he picked our empress to be Her Royal Highness's sacred beast.

235
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:35,041
To carry this duty,

236
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:40,613
Empress Feng Yan has been working hard on cultivation all these years.

237
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:43,980
Three days ago, Her Majesty finally reached nirvana.

238
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,119
And your instruction feather arrived.

239
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:51,770
When she was going to rise from the ashes in Wutong Forest,

240
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,914
someone stole her core spirit.

241
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:57,120
Feng Yan's core spirit was stolen.

242
00:16:57,857 --> 00:16:59,870
The Phoenix Empress will reach nirvana three times in her life.

243
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:02,119
Only to rise from the ashes and cut off seven emotions

244
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:04,799
can she become the greatest beast of all.

245
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,919
Outsiders don't know this secret.

246
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:08,419
There are a lot of talents in the Phoenix Clan.

247
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:10,099
And it's the top among all clans.

248
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,338
Who dared break into Wutong Forest and steal the core spirit?

249
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:16,313
It's Wu Xi. He's the ancestor of the Wutong trees.

250
00:17:16,313 --> 00:17:18,419
He has protected the Phoenix Clan for thousands of years.

251
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,718
He has always been loyal to Phoenix Clan.

252
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:23,884
If he's loyal, why did he steal Feng Yan's core spirit

253
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:26,114
when she was going to rise from the ashes?

254
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:27,942
Your Royal Highness, you don't know.

255
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:31,941
It's always about love.

256
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:35,399
A bad destiny.

257
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:39,370
The monarch of the Phoenix Clan will reach nirvana three times in her life.

258
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,900
Birth, promotion to god, and death.

259
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:49,218
After she's promoted to god, her body, character, and memories will dissipate with nirvana.

260
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:52,959
But her cultivation won't disappear in each nirvana.

261
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:59,019
Therefore, every death makes her become stronger.

262
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,613
I see.

263
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,727
So, each Phoenix monarch is the same one.

264
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:06,413
Well... yes and no.

265
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:10,398
Except for cultivation, each Phoenix monarch is different.

266
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:13,719
This Phoenix monarch and Wu Xi grew up together.

267
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,800
They adored each other since they were young.

268
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:40,970
I knew they were attracted to each other.

269
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,284
But Ancestral God made a decree that

270
00:18:44,284 --> 00:18:47,827
Her Royal Highness's beast would be picked from Phoenix Clan.

271
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,727
The Phoenix monarch is the greatest in the Phoenix Clan.

272
00:18:50,728 --> 00:18:55,000
So, only the Phoenix empress can be Your Royal Highness's beast.

273
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,128
However, after Empress Feng Yan fought the devils,

274
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:01,919
her divine power was greatly reduced.

275
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,157
Now she's only as good as an upper god.

276
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:08,570
So, Her Majesty decided to go on the second nirvana.

277
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:15,389
But Wu Xi stopped her from nirvana this way.

278
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:17,899
It's no different than death

279
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:19,978
if Feng Yan went on the second nirvana.

280
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:21,770
Ice Cube Bai, am I right?

281
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,484
All things in the three realms have their own survival laws.

282
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:26,099
It's not about good or evil.

283
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,299
Since Feng Yan went on nirvana,

284
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,199
I guess she made the choice.

285
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:33,520
But Wu Xi stole the core spirit to stop her.

286
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,471
According to the divine laws, he must be killed.

287
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:39,539
Bai Jue.

288
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:43,727
Rules are rules. Wu Xi went against heavenly rules.

289
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:47,419
If we ignore Ancestral God's will for him, then what are the rules for?

290
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,884
Elder Feng Yun, don't worry.

291
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:51,258
The loss of the core spirit is serious.

292
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:54,199
I'll get it back in person.

293
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,919
Didn't you ask me to go through it by myself?

294
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,140
Why do you take it on?

295
00:20:02,514 --> 00:20:05,370
Wu Xi may still be in the Immortal Realm.

296
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,110
But he holds his breath, so it's hard to find him.

297
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:15,620
I think there's a way.

298
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,079
   

299
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:28,141
How do I look?

300
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,079
Give me the Immortal Tracking Bell.

301
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,438
Why? It's a treasure I asked from Yue Mi.

302
00:20:33,438 --> 00:20:35,299
It can track an immortal's breath.

303
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:38,098
So what? You don't know Wu Xi and Feng Yan.

304
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:41,989
Way ahead of you. I asked Elder Feng Yun for their portraits before we came down here.

305
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:44,057
You've learned something.

306
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,659
 - It smells good. 
 - Yeah? 

307
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:48,900
 - Yeah. Taste it later. 
 - I'm hungry. 

308
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,684
 Why not we eat before we go? 

309
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,599
True gods can fast.

310
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,098
I can't. I'm a growing girl.

311
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:58,100
Maybe I can get taller.

312
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,098
You are what you eat. Wonton.

313
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:02,079
I have to eat what I need.

314
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,099
We have something serious to do.

315
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:07,057
I mean, I'll come back to eat it after we're done.

316
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,020
There you go.

317
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,299
They're nearby. Go.

318
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:48,084
Your Majesty, please forgive my disrespect.

319
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:51,171
I've been with you for many years. I love you so much.

320
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:54,370
The thought that you'd forget our past after you reached nirvana

321
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,099
put me through hell.

322
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:00,270
I had to bring you out before your core spirit was disconnected.

323
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:01,538
I...

324
00:22:01,538 --> 00:22:05,213
Wu Xi, I made it clear to you

325
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:07,258
before I rose from the ashes.

326
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:08,919
I owe you too much in this life.

327
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:11,271
I don't deserve you in the afterlife.

328
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:14,780
Why did you make such a big mistake?

329
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,170
No.

330
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,220
It's not you but Little Master God, Shang Gu owes me.

331
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:25,214
If she didn't choose a beast, our love wouldn't end.

332
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:31,527
But the Wu Xi that I loved is not like you.

333
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:35,560
How could you get the Phoenix Clan into trouble by saving me?

334
00:22:36,385 --> 00:22:38,270
You aren't done with me in this life.

335
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,300
I don't want the next life.

336
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:45,520
I... I regret it.

337
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:48,280
What?

338
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,984
Do you regret that I took you out without asking you

339
00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:55,060
or regret being with me?

340
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,799
I regret nirvana.

341
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,513
I saw your tears

342
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:01,470
when you stole my core spirit out of the Phoenix Clan.

343
00:23:01,471 --> 00:23:05,460
I thought I'd let go of this life,

344
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:09,630
but I can't let you go.

345
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:19,427
I decided, whether it's wandering around the world

346
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:22,200
or being chased and killed in this life,

347
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,499
I want to be with you.

348
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,028
I won't let you down.

349
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:29,428
I'll do everything for you without regret.

350
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:37,400
Now that I have brought you out of the Phoenix Clan,

351
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,771
we must have aroused the God Realm and the Phoenix Clan into investigating us.

352
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:41,957
There are too many eyes here.

353
00:23:41,957 --> 00:23:44,013
We can only stay here for a while.

354
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:46,560
This is not permanent.

355
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,899
You put my core spirit on a phoenix flower.

356
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:53,714
I could be a flower fairy.

357
00:23:53,714 --> 00:23:56,628
Maybe it can hide my identity.

358
00:23:56,628 --> 00:23:58,870
But it's not fair to you.

359
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,113
Just wait for me here. I'll go to find a paradise.

360
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,900
And we'll enjoy a free life. No one can find us.

361
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,099
- Immortal Tracking Bell. 
 - What?

362
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:14,699
Elder Feng Yun must have told the God Realm about us.

363
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:16,999
The  Immortal Tracking Bell is absorbing our breaths. They're coming.

364
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,359
I don't want to leave you.

365
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,560
Don't worry. They must think your core spirit is on me.

366
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,800
I'm going out to distract them.

367
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,119
Wu Xi, don't go.

368
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,130
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

369
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,885
Here's the phoenix leaf connected with me.

370
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:34,318
Now your spiritual power is low. You can't have a confrontation with anyone yet.

371
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:36,179
You must hide yourself.

372
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,560
After this crisis, it'll lead you to find me.

373
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,700
You must wait for me here.

374
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,218
Wu Xi must be happy.

375
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:56,739
He's drinking and having fun here.

376
00:24:56,739 --> 00:24:59,057
This place is very lively.

377
00:24:59,057 --> 00:25:01,384
I'll bring Yue Mi here next time.

378
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:03,356
Are you here for having fun or doing business?

379
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:06,379
I told you I have my own way.

380
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,370
I am very experienced in arresting and being arrested.

381
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,770
I've come down to the Lower Realm without permission before many times.

382
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,213
I don't know how many times I was caught by Zhi Yang.

383
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:17,160
You can't rush something like this.

384
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,484
What's in this suet? It smells good.

385
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,884
Your Highness, this is not suet.

386
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:30,400
This is the signature Peach Wine of Dong Feng Restaurant.

387
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,070
It smells good and tastes sweet.

388
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,250
It's smooth. It comes with an aftertaste.

389
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,498
There's such a good thing in the Immortal Realm?

390
00:25:38,498 --> 00:25:39,984
Is this real or fake?

391
00:25:39,985 --> 00:25:43,400
You will know if you order a bowl.

392
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,580
Taste it.

393
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,179
Wu Xi.

394
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:01,140
Wait for me here.

395
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:23,100
Wu Xi knew I was under the protection of Bai Jue.

396
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,200
But he dared attack me.

397
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,884
It's a diversion.

398
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:32,900
 Maybe Feng Yan's core spirit is still in this restaurant. 

399
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:11,584
Who is it?

400
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:13,899
Your Highness, I passed by here.

401
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,299
I got a little lost.

402
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,313
May you show me the way?

403
00:27:17,313 --> 00:27:19,220
I'm new here.

404
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,699
Why not ask the waiter?

405
00:27:21,699 --> 00:27:23,270
Your Highness, you're pretty and kind.

406
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,884
I've been trying to find my way and have gotten thirsty.

407
00:27:25,884 --> 00:27:28,127
Can you take me in for a while?

408
00:27:28,127 --> 00:27:32,250
I have something important to do. I can't take you in.

409
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:37,184
I think the fairy is more beautiful than a delicate flower.

410
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:41,039
I took a fancy to you, so I couldn't help but say something.

411
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,971
Your Highness, are you from Flower Clan?

412
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:44,613
Yes.

413
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:47,370
You should be careful if you want to go far.

414
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,338
It's been pretty rough in the outskirts lately.

415
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:52,099
What happened?

416
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:55,318
Recently, there's a deflowering beast occupying the Nanhai outskirts.

417
00:27:55,318 --> 00:27:58,440
He preys on beautiful fairies like you.

418
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,619
Really?

419
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:03,940
You're of the Flower Clan. How could you not know it?

420
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,600
I... I heard about it.

421
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,584
Not just that. Something confidential and big happened has happened in the Phoenix Clan lately.

422
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:15,384
I was born loving to travel and gossip.

423
00:28:15,384 --> 00:28:17,939
From a Chief God picking a beast to an elder turtle taking concubines,

424
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:22,020
I know everything about the three realms.

425
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:26,378
Forget it. This is about the Chief God's face.

426
00:28:26,378 --> 00:28:29,013
We're juniors. Don't bother worrying about it.

427
00:28:29,014 --> 00:28:33,160
Since you're going far, I'm leaving.

428
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,059
See you.

429
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,740
Your Highness.

430
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,159
You just said

431
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,369
Master Bai Jue was investigating the core spirit theft in Nanhai City.

432
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:54,156
Did he find something?

433
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:55,640
You're a flower fairy.

434
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,379
Why do you care so much about the Phoenix Clan?

435
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:05,379
I love gossip like you.

436
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,070
The Phoenix empress' core spirit isn't on you.

437
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,299
What? Do you really want to turn against the God Realm?

438
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:32,900
If you True Gods hadn't forced me, I wouldn't have done so.

439
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,820
Ridiculous!

440
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,256
 If word leaks out about the core spirit theft, 

441
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:42,170
 it will cause immortals and monsters to covet it,  

442
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:46,041
 leaders of all races will want to absorb it to enhance their spiritual power. 

443
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:48,142
 I'm afraid there'd be a mess in Nanhai City. 

444
00:29:48,142 --> 00:29:52,050
 You and Shang Gu must solve it soon and come back to the God Realm. 

445
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,028
Now, the God Realm is almost sure

446
00:30:16,028 --> 00:30:20,460
that Wu Xi put the Phoenix monarch's core spirit on a flower.

447
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,859
It was confidential. How did the God Realm know?

448
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,250
 The fish has taken the bite. 

449
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,528
 Why is Ice Cube Bai taking so long? 

450
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:37,184
Peach Wine is delicious and intoxicating.

451
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:39,130
I drank a little too much.

452
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,560
You see, the Phoenix monarch's core spirit is divine.

453
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,070
How could a flower take it?

454
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,300
When she resides on a flower,

455
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,441
her spiritual power will be too low to protect herself.

456
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:58,700
I think all realms will fight for it.

457
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,984
Little Master God thought it was Wu Xi's own decision.

458
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,742
She didn't expect the Phoenix monarch would be involved in it.

459
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:08,740
How should they end it?

460
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,013
If the Chief God knew her trip to the Phoenix Clan to pick a beast

461
00:31:13,014 --> 00:31:15,870
would make Wu Xi and Feng Yan suffer this,

462
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:18,628
she wouldn't go there.

463
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:22,230
Now it's turned into such a big thing.

464
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,557
Why do you think Feng Yan chose to walk this path

465
00:31:25,557 --> 00:31:28,090
and have so many people involved in it?

466
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:35,099
Seven emotions and memories aren't allowed in nirvana.

467
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:38,956
Miss, without seven emotions and memories,

468
00:31:38,957 --> 00:31:42,257
is Feng Yan still Feng Yan?

469
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:44,540
The Phoenix monarch carries the Phoenix Clan's blood.

470
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,399
She was born to undertake God's will.

471
00:31:48,714 --> 00:31:53,013
So, she was born to experience nirvana and leave her beloved.

472
00:31:53,014 --> 00:31:55,580
Don't you think she's pitiful?

473
00:31:56,942 --> 00:31:59,485
Even if she's the Phoenix monarch,

474
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,742
she's no better than girls in the Immortal Realm.

475
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:05,910
They're allowed to love people.

476
00:32:06,728 --> 00:32:10,899
There are so many miserable people in the world.

477
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,041
No one can disobey Ancestral God's will.

478
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:17,057
I wonder if the superior gods know

479
00:32:17,057 --> 00:32:19,356
that there are also many people in the Phoenix Clan who are of humble origins

480
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:22,585
but are able to take on the mission of a sacred animal.

481
00:32:22,585 --> 00:32:24,920
Feng Yan has neither the ability to assist the Chief God

482
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,584
nor the vision to help the three realms.

483
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:30,142
She just wants to be an ordinary girl

484
00:32:30,142 --> 00:32:33,090
and spend the rest of her life with her beloved.

485
00:32:35,928 --> 00:32:37,900
Any questions?

486
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,460
Shang Gu. Chief God.

487
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:47,859
- If... 
 - No ifs.

488
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,927
When Your Royal Highness loves someone,

489
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:53,820
you'll know the meaning of "love makes people suffer."

490
00:32:56,714 --> 00:32:58,371
I'm sober now.

491
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:00,710
Please show me the way, Your Royal Highness.

492
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:03,620
Forget it.

493
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:06,613
I didn't want to break you two up.

494
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:09,500
Now I see you are so determined.

495
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,285
What do you mean, Your Royal Highness?

496
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:18,390
Go before I change my mind.

497
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,119
Your Royal Highness.

498
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,285
Go.

499
00:33:21,285 --> 00:33:25,285
I'm afraid you can't leave when True God Bai Jue comes back.

500
00:33:27,014 --> 00:33:29,300
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

501
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:39,984
- Wu Xi. 
 - Feng Yan.

502
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,330
What took you so long?

503
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,471
I was anxious. Did you have any problems?

504
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:46,470
That's good. I wanted to meet you in the restaurant.

505
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,956
But I feared I'd blow your cover if someone followed me.

506
00:33:48,957 --> 00:33:51,157
Her Royal Highness recognized me.

507
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,139
Don't worry. She's a reasonable person.

508
00:33:55,139 --> 00:33:58,239
She let me go.

509
00:33:58,239 --> 00:34:02,090
Wu Xi, we got her wrong before.

510
00:34:03,371 --> 00:34:05,320
It's completely Shang Gu's fault.

511
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,540
You can forgive her, but I can't.

512
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,439
Outrageous!

513
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:44,619
My head hurts.

514
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,857
You still try to kill me

515
00:34:46,857 --> 00:34:49,785
When will your good tastes be changed?

516
00:34:53,114 --> 00:34:56,950
Ice Cube Bai, I'm dizzy.

517
00:35:00,671 --> 00:35:05,619
Look!  Didn't you say that you would treat me a little more tenderly?

518
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:08,360
Don't always be aggressive with me. Right?

519
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,899
I envy the relationship between Wu Xi and Feng Yan.

520
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,039
They gave it all up for their love.

521
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,939
They even defied God's will and risked their lives.

522
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:24,039
Wu Xi made a big mistake for his own selfish desire.

523
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,270
He acted without considering the consequences.

524
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:28,430
Stop your drunk talk.

525
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:30,942
I'm not drunk.

526
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:33,527
Do you think I look drunk?

527
00:35:33,528 --> 00:35:35,910
I'm not drunk.

528
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,380
Did you hear me?

529
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,500
I envy Wu Xi and Feng Yan.

530
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,841
I don't want to catch them.

531
00:35:42,842 --> 00:35:44,180
Who was drinking with you?

532
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,620
Feng Yan. Who else could it be?

533
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,300
Where are you going?

534
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,420
Zhi Yang sent me a message. The three realms know about the loss of the Phoenix monarch's core spirit.

535
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,857
As the Chief God, you're still drinking and making mistakes.

536
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:57,080
It doesn't matter.

537
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,779
Why are you still gving me a whole lecture again?

538
00:35:59,779 --> 00:36:01,439
Look. Bai Jue,

539
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:05,600
if I violate the rules of Heaven for love someday,

540
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,820
will you punish me according to the rules?

541
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:13,971
Rules and disciplines are superior to a relationship.

542
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:19,379
Relationships have nothing to do with rules.

543
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:26,379
 ♫ Time is like you, disturbing my feelings and thoughts ♫ 

544
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:27,719
Look at you.

545
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,885
Except for being good-looking, what's the big deal with you?

546
00:36:32,571 --> 00:36:35,480
You're drunk. Let me sober you up.

547
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,500
 ♫ I can never forget ♫ 

548
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,441
Shang Gu.

549
00:36:38,442 --> 00:36:41,257
 ♫ ...the memories of you ♫ 

550
00:36:41,257 --> 00:36:44,099
 ♫ I cherish the time to be with you ♫ 

551
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,160
We are at Pilgrim Hall. No one will come and save you.

552
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,900
What do you want to do?

553
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,500
Do what I've always wanted to do.

554
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,700
 ♫ When I meet you ♫ 

555
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,500
 ♫ I hope we can be together forever ♫ 

556
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,014
 ♫ When we meet again ♫ 

557
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:07,757
 ♫ I'll travel with you without hesitation ♫ 

558
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:09,927
 ♫ Feel each other ♫ 

559
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:12,259
Who else have you gotten drunk with?

560
00:37:13,928 --> 00:37:16,219
God of Flowers, God of Night, and God of Rain.

561
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,379
Tian Qi, Yue Mi, and Zhi Yang.

562
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,779
All right.

563
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,999
Don't drink with them again. Do you hear?

564
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:25,885
 ♫ Such good times and beautiful scenery ♫ 

565
00:37:25,885 --> 00:37:28,260
 ♫ May you stay by my side ♫ 

566
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,379
Why?

567
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:31,413
You're a female and I'm a male.

568
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:34,327
You can't touch wherever the clothes cover.

569
00:37:34,328 --> 00:37:37,950
There's no clothes on your face.

570
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:47,220
It's more exhausting than beating a fierce beast.

571
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:52,099
Just stay here and rest.

572
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,357
Wu Xi and Feng Yan are in danger now.

573
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:56,090
I'll be right back.

574
00:38:26,214 --> 00:38:29,199
I've set the barrier. Strangers can't walk in.

575
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:31,070
Its owner is an immortal crane.

576
00:38:31,071 --> 00:38:33,127
He flew up to the God Realm not long ago.

577
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:35,090
I don't think he'll be coming back.

578
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:37,584
It's a paradise.

579
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:39,356
Let's stay here for the moment.

580
00:38:39,357 --> 00:38:42,980
After the crisis, we can come up with a better plan.

581
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,057
The environment here is indeed a bit embarrassing.

582
00:38:59,057 --> 00:39:01,300
I didn't think about it properly.

583
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,000
Yan'er, I'm sorry.

584
00:39:07,185 --> 00:39:09,756
No matter how dangerous it is, I'm not afraid.

585
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:12,090
This is nothing.

586
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,371
Wu Xi, now we've made a big mistake.

587
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,700
There's no turning back.

588
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,519
From now on, we have to hide.

589
00:39:29,585 --> 00:39:32,339
But my spiritual power is low,

590
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:34,680
I'm afraid I'll slow you down.

591
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,041
Yan, you know I'm not good at talking.

592
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:44,384
And I can't say sweet words to you.

593
00:39:44,385 --> 00:39:47,070
But I swear to God,

594
00:39:47,071 --> 00:39:51,020
I'll make you happy even if I have to risk my life.

595
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,379
Let's...

596
00:39:57,442 --> 00:39:59,470
Let's get married, okay?

597
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:16,384
Since we're going to marry, we should clean it up.

598
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:19,900
Don't just stand there stupidly, come and clean it up.

599
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,179
Right.

600
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:28,800
I'll do all the housework.

601
00:40:38,157 --> 00:40:41,370
Oh no. Someone broke into the barrier.

602
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,819
Is it True God Bai Jue?

603
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:49,320
Go.

604
00:41:00,557 --> 00:41:03,199
Wu Xi, go if you don't want to die.

605
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,299
We want the Phoenix monarch's core spirit.

606
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:06,940
No way!

607
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,640
Why did I fall asleep?

608
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,857
I kissed him?

609
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:32,780
No.

610
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:35,410
Absolutely not.

611
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,740


612
00:41:53,740 --> 00:42:00,200
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

613
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:07,079
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

614
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:13,500
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

615
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,660
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

616
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:26,559
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

617
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,919
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

618
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:40,239
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

619
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,800
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

620
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:05,639
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

621
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:12,119
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

622
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:19,199
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

623
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,300
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

624
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:34,080
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

625
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:41,160
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

626
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:48,039
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

627
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:54,040
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

628
00:43:54,040 --> 00:44:03,860
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
