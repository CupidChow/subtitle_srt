00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:21,500
   

3
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,000
   

4
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,310
I wish in my next life

5
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,110
that I can be with you not as a god.

6
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,689
 The level of my birthday celebration is very high. 

7
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:22,679
 Gods should bring precious gifts to attend the banquet. 

8
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,149
 Bai Jue, you're a True God. 

9
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,950
 This gift is not precious at all. 

10
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,460
I don't allow you to die!

11
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,020
Your life is as long as that of the three realms.

12
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,190
You're the God of Chaos.

13
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,060
I don't allow you to die!

14
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,660
I don't allow you to die!

15
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,059
 ♫ She turned into ashes ♫ 

16
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:18,059
 ♫ Separated by life and death ♫ 

17
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:22,959
 ♫ He guards the three realms for her ♫ 

18
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,159
 ♫ The idea of living still echoes in my ears ♫ 

19
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,039
 ♫ Once again ♫ 

20
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,940
Your Royal Highness.

21
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,430
 ♫ This love will never die ♫ 

22
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,470
Master.

23
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,819
I don't want to be a god.

24
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,699
Shang Gu. Shang Gu.

25
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,879
No. No.

26
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,609
 Bai Jue, it's late in the morning. It's time to get up. 

27
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,829
 You said you would teach me magic arts. 

28
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,479
 You always say I'm lazy.  
 - No.

29
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,539
 I didn't expect you were the lazy bones. 

30
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:28,059
- If you don't wake up, I'll spread the news around the God Realm.  
 - Shang Gu.

31
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,200
 No!  Around the three realms. 

32
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,010
 What do you want to do? 

33
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,150
 I will always be with you from now on. 

34
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,280
 Accompany you to practice, read, 

35
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,450
 and drink. 

36
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,900
 When it's sunny, 

37
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,360
 we'll go out to fly kites. 

38
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,040
 In the future, I won't leave you alone. 

39
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,960
 ♫ Only to miss you and embrace the memories ♫ 

40
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,650
 Bai Jue, come here. 

41
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,360
 Why are you stunned? 

42
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,140
 Accompany me. 

43
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,370
 Come here. 

44
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,720
 Come here. 

45
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,719
 But you promised that you would swing with me today. 

46
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,169
 You taught me that I must be true in word and resolute in deed. 

47
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:50,160
 You should keep your words. 

48
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,070
 Come here. 

49
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,290
 Come here. 

50
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,720
 Come here. 

51
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,920
 ♫ Waiting for the time to meet again in your eyes ♫ 

52
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,819
 ♫ Exchange a lifetime for a second of encounter ♫ 

53
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:14,519
 ♫ It's not a pity to be able to accomplish it ♫ 

54
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:22,419
 ♫ I'm willing to search for thousands of days and nights ♫

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,510
 ♫ Exchange a lifetime for a second of encounter ♫ 

57
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,649
 I'm flying! 

58
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,019
 So high! 

59
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:37,510
 Look. 

60
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,339
 As the Chief God of Chaos, 

61
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:46,939
 I'm in charge of all living beings among the three realms. 

62
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,240
 No matter how much responsibility I have, 

63
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,120
 I'll try my best. 

64
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,730
 I will do my best to help you 

65
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,300
 take over the God Realm. 

66
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,849
 Your holy light will be spread everywhere 

67
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,510
 in the name of Chaos one day. 

68
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:10,700
 ♫ Pursuing millions of miles... for you ♫ 

69
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,380
Master.

70
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,789
Master, finally you have woken up.

71
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,149
It's windy outside. Your core is seriously depleted.

72
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:20,270
Go back and get some rest.

73
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,890
We've been looking forward to celebrating the arrival of Devil King.

74
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,619
70 thousand years have passed.

75
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:04,689
I planned everything and I finally get what I want.

76
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,159
Master, you're right.

77
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,750
If you didn't find the truth of the Doom of Chaos earlier than the gods,

78
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,550
you would have been sacrificed for the God Realm.

79
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,449
For the God Realm?

80
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:19,879
Funny.

81
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,319
I don't even care about Ancestral God.

82
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,879
Why should I die for the God Realm?

83
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,549
Though I'm trapped in the Netherworld,

84
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,400
it's also included in my plan.

85
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,720
My enemies are not them...

86
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,150
but fate.

87
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,899
As long as the Doom of Chaos doesn't disappear,

88
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,890
the one who becomes the Chief God will be cocooned.

89
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,600
I'm not sure whether my acquaintances

90
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,230
in the God Realm still remember me.

91
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,500
Zhi Yang.

92
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,690
Is Bai Jue awake?

93
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,930
He doesn't allow... anyone to enter.

94
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,910
He said he will close Abyss Hall.

95
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,369
Well. Let me talk to him.

96
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,690
It's much like Shang Gu.

97
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,410
We all feel sorry for Shang Gu's disappearance.

98
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,270
But we're True Gods.

99
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,490
We have our own responsibility.

100
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,880
I know.

101
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,589
Since you began to teach Shang Gu,

102
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,000
she's been the only person that you cared for.

103
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,250
But she disappeared in front of you.

104
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,280
I'm also very sad,

105
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,980
let alone you.

106
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,760
What I wanted most was to keep her safe.

107
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,610
But I pushed her into a hopeless situation.

108
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,630
Recently, I often think of some past events.

109
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,350
Me, you, and Tian Qi...

110
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,420
were young then.

111
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,220
We obeyed every order of Ancestral God.

112
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,130
Although we could not understand the meaning

113
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,610
and were confused, we were very happy.

114
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,780
If you insist on retiring from the world, I'll never persuade you again.

115
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,199
There's one thing that I've found out.

116
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:44,149
It's Mo Yu who gave the God Killer Pestle to Xue Ying.

117
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:47,930
The devils must have known about the Doom of Chaos.

118
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,549
Before the soldiers in the God Realm recovered from the war,

119
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:55,960
they met with the Doom of Chaos.

120
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,509
If Xuan Yi takes the chance to attack, the world will be miserable.

121
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,080
And the death of Shang Gu will be useless.

122
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,639
Xuan Yi?

123
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,820
Do you still remember my guess about Observation Mountain?

124
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,959
If Xuan Yi knew that the fate of the Chief God of Chaos was to resolve the catastrophe,

125
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,200
would he have accepted his destiny?

126
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,460
That's why Xuan Yi degenerated into a devil.

127
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,980
He was willing to endure 70,000 years of hardship

128
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,980
in order to let Shang Gu suffer the Doom for him.

129
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:41,020
 Bai Jue, you can't teach the little Chief God. 

130
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,300
 Why not let me teach her? 

131
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,480
 She'll be Chief God of Chaos within 1,000 years. 

132
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,720
 My proposal is good for you, me, 

133
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,110
and all living beings in the three realms.

134
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,799
If our guess is right,

135
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,320
the death of Shang Gu has something to do with Xuan Yi.

136
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,210
Master!

137
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,430
- Master! 
 - Why are you badly hurt?

138
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,689
Master, Xuan Yi has broken the barrier of the Netherworld.

139
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:23,230
Among the guards, I'm the only survivor.

140
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,569
It's the Bronze Barrier. The devils are coming!

141
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:43,759
Master asks us to leave the God Realm

142
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,300
for Heaven to control the situation in case of trouble.

143
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,350
In case of trouble?

144
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,010
His words are very pessimistic.

145
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:00,300
I'm afraid the battle against the devils will be quite dangerous.

146
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,879
If Tian Qi didn't destroy the world and the Demon Clan didn't attack,

147
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,540
the God Realm wouldn't have been in trouble.

148
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,299
I'll teach the Demon Clan a lesson.

149
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:14,740
Chief God sacrificed herself for the peace of the God Realm.

150
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,710
I won't allow the devils to destroy it.

151
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,400
Stop.

152
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,239
Gu Jun, Master must have considered a lot.

153
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,650
Don't be impulsive.

154
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,929
- But the God Realm... 
 - I know we are not afraid of death.

155
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:33,810
But in case of...

156
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,250
Gu Jun, we should listen to Master.

157
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,720
Xuan Yi must have known the God Realm was in trouble so he has attacked us.

158
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,009
Your core spirit is badly hurt. My strength is reduced.

159
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:02,090
So what? He'll pay the price today.

160
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,280
I've been waiting for 70,000 years until today.

161
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,569
You two are really righteous.

162
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:12,649
To keep the God Realm safe and sound, you don't even bring a god with strong spiritual power.

163
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:13,859
Shut up!

164
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:15,749
You've been planning for 70,000 years.

165
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,299
You knew about the Doom of Chaos already.

166
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,199
So you let Shang Gu die for you.

167
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,730
I won't let you go.

168
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,039
So what?

169
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,399
I practiced day and night to have such power.

170
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:30,350
Why should I die for the God Realm?

171
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,250
Is my life not as noble as other gods?

172
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,450
You are also a Chief God of Chaos.

173
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:42,480
But compared with Shang Gu, you are worthless.

174
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,550
If we lose, the God Realm will be destroyed.

175
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,909
- Soldiers. 
  - Yes. 

176
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,539
Guard the God Realm!

177
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:55,180
 Yes! 

178
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,409
No way! There must be a war in the God Realm.

179
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:02,029
The light must be Bai Jue. And the black power...

180
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,849
Upper God, you must guard at the gate of the God Realm.

181
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,640
The devils are coming.

182
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,200
Devils?

183
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,550
Terrible.

184
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,249
Thousands of years have passed, but you have made no progress.

185
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:36,740
I think you don't have to guard the God Realm.

186
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:43,180
Why not give the three realms to me?

187
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,740
I've endured it for 70,000 years.

188
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:58,930
Today, I'll show you what a god is and what a devil is.

189
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,130
Guys, leave right now!

190
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,669
The God Realm is in trouble. We won't leave it behind.

191
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,959
We've been quite sad since Shang Gu died.

192
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,369
If there's a Doom of Chaos, it's for all gods.

193
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:19,879
So we should fight together when the devils attack.

194
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,970
We won't leave this time.

195
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,140
Gods, make the array.

196
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,330
Demon King, terrible.

197
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,709
You ice me with your core power?

198
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,530
Your core spirit will be broken.

199
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:31,430
I have no regret because I will meet my master.

200
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,070
No way!

201
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,289
I survived the Doom of Chaos.

202
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:47,349
I broke the rules of Heaven and Earth.

203
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,880
I won't lose!

204
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,920
You gather the power of gods

205
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,360
but it's nothing.

206
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,820
I'll show you how it disappears bit by bit.

207
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:55,900
I'll kill all the gods!

208
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,959
Master!

209
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,960
I manage the power of lightning in the three realms.

210
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:17,380
I will never allow this rat to harm the three realms!

211
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,629
I am in charge of the disasters in the three realms.

212
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:27,060
I'll use my core spirit to help you!

213
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,779
Master Bai Jue, I'm in charge of the rainy season in the three realms.

214
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:36,040
I'm also willing to donate my core spirit!

215
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,790
I'll sacrifice myself to kill you!

216
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,329
Master, I've been your mount for more than 100,000 years.

217
00:23:56,329 --> 00:24:00,359
To eliminate the devils, you need my help.

218
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:04,270
I hope you will care about your health.

219
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,029
- Hong Ri! 
 - Take care of the living beings!

220
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,890
Hong Ri!

221
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,769
 I, God of Four Seasons, come to celebrate your succession to the throne of Chaos 

222
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:17,719
 with Gods of Wind, Rain, Thunder, and Lightning. 

223
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:21,819
 I, God of Stars, come to celebrate your succession to the throne of Chaos. 

224
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:25,819
 I thought you'd be gentle if you were to teach these little kids. 

225
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:28,810
 10,000 years have passed and you still haven't changed. 

226
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,899
 Bai Jue. 

227
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:35,020
 This is the first time you've joked with me 

228
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,450
 in more than 100,000 years. 

229
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,879
 The responsibility is too heavy. I have no choice. 

230
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:50,510
 Bai Jue, I'll entrust the three realms to you. 

231
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,960
 I promised Shang Gu to protect the God Realm. 

232
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,260
 I did it. 

233
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,959
 Master said that all the stars in the sky are gods. 

234
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:22,399
 Look. There are so many stars tonight. 

235
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:25,509
 Are the gods fighting? 

236
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:28,779
 Will you and I become stars in the future? 

237
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:34,239
 Master said that as long as we practice hard, we can become immortals. 

238
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:38,149
 Master also said he would take us to the Human Realm. 

239
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:40,790
 Has he once kept his promise? 

240
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,510
 Look how bright that star is! 

241
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,020
   

242
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:06,080
 Father God once said above the Immortal Realm is the God Realm, namely, the Ancient Realm. 

243
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,360
 But the Doom of Chaos came 60,000 years ago. 

244
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,030
 In that catastrophe, the ancient gods were almost killed. 

245
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,699
 The chaotic power left by Chief God formed the Human Realm 

246
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:24,639
 to replace the exterminated Devil Realm, 

247
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,050
 and became the new three realms with the Immortal Realm and the Demon Realm. 

248
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:32,100
 The three new realms should have co-existed well. 

249
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,809
 However, because the devils destroyed the world, 

250
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:37,449
 the disputes between the immortals and demons 

251
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:40,020
 have lasted for 60,000 years. 

252
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:47,350
 Now, we can't tell right and wrong, good and evil. 

253
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,060
 There is only one demigod in the Demon Realm, namely, Sen Jian. 

254
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,570
 But there are four gods in the Immortal Realm. 

255
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,780
 The first three are ancient gods, 

256
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:13,350
 but the fourth god comes from a famous marriage in Heaven. 

257
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,399
We should not be so extravagant.

258
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:27,349
It takes so many spiritual beads.

259
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,520
The heavenly king is Lord Mu Guang who inherited the blood of the Golden Dragon.

260
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,799
The heavenly queen is Lordess Wu Huan, leader of the Phoenix Clan.

261
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,300
Extravagance is normal.

262
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,800
Did we invite Gu Jun in Qingchi Palace?

263
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,539
When Zhi Yang handed over the Immortal Realm to the three gods,

264
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:43,690
he did not specify who would be the master.

265
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,420
Qingchi Palace and Heavenly Palace are rivals.

266
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,709
Marriage and divorce have their own fate.

267
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:55,150
But considering the temper of Gu Jun, can it be settled?

268
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,500
Let's go.

269
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,479
Will he come?

270
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:31,550
I was sincere in my words in the invitation.

271
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,780
I hope Gu Jun can let bygones be bygones.

272
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,630
I hope so.

273
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,160
Today is our wedding day.

274
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,310
Don't mention him anymore.

275
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,159
Heaven and Earth are witnesses.

276
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,919
All immortals learn from each other.

277
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,429
The king and queen are together.

278
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,510
The three realms will be peaceful.

279
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,490
Welcome, Gu Jun the Upper God.

280
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,900
Stand up.

281
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,369
Gu Jun, you came.

282
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:26,060
Ling Juan.

283
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,309
I'm here.

284
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:33,000
What can I do for you?

285
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,430
She's the daughter of the queen and me, named Hou Chi.

286
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,090
Oh my god.

287
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,969
Even an Upper God can't escape from love.

288
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:50,460
The most pitiful is the daughter in the egg.

289
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,879
You're in charge of fate.

290
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,659
Come and calculate my daughter's fate.

291
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,230
Well...

292
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,709
No need.

293
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,639
Well... My daughter is not qualified?

294
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:09,660
I don't dare.

295
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,149
Your Majesty.

296
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:40,960
Master.

297
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:47,140
The little master has the fate of an Upper God.

298
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,439
What?

299
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,879
The fate of an Upper God?

300
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:51,679
Another Upper God?

301
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,400
Well...

302
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,919
Ling Juan, as we all know, after the God Realm was closed,

303
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,930
there were only three upper gods in the world.

304
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,120
Be careful with your words.

305
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,179
Majesty, I dare not cheat you.

306
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,340
She really has the fate of an upper god.

307
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,330
Queen, do you agree?

308
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,940
I...

309
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,020
King, what do you think?

310
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,170
Okay.

311
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,479
All of you witness it.

312
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:40,199
My daughter, Hou Chi, is on the throne of an Upper God.

313
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:42,099
The sun and moon know.

314
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:44,680
Heaven and Earth witness it.

315
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,860
Congratulations to Upper God Hou Chi.

316
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,760
   

317
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,149
It took me 40,000 years to break the eggshell.

318
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:16,959
I've built the foundation for 20,000 years.

319
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:18,839
I've practiced for 60,000 years.

320
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,670
Why am I still a lower-class immortal?

321
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,619
It's the Little Highness who has come back from practice.

322
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,530
You have practiced really hard.

323
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,620
Bo Xuan often says practice needs patience.

324
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,019
You should be happy.

325
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:48,500
Everything depends on fate.

326
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:52,759
Today is no better than yesterday.

327
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:55,960
When will my luck come?

328
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,359
Hey, you! Don't speak of her weak points.

329
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:06,330
Shall I ask Feng Ran not to test your spiritual power today?

330
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,780
No, thanks. It's me who asked Feng Ran to supervise me.

331
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,539
Punishment doesn't matter. I'm used to it.

332
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:14,279
I must shoulder it myself.

333
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,029
I'll ask Feng Ran to test me.

334
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:17,759
The earlier it ends, the earlier I'm scolded.

335
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:19,730
So I can go to bed earlier.

336
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,590
Wu Xu, look.

337
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,099
The barrier of Qilian Mountain has opened.

338
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:42,739
What a fragrant spiritual spring!

339
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:48,250
It's true. The Spiritual Spring of Qingchi Palace is precious among the three realms.

340
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,940
It's late in the afternoon.

341
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,799
Let's go back. Let's not delay His Lordship's appointment.

342
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:57,189
Don't push me too hard.

343
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,940
We still have a few days to prepare for Donghua's birthday banquet.

344
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,519
If we have the chance to drink from such a strong spiritual spring, our power will definitely increase by a thousand years.

345
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,170
Aren't you interested?

346
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,500
Don't be afraid. Qingchi Palace has long been dilapidated.

347
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,709
We sneak in and take it out.

348
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,050
No one will know.

349
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,459
But now Feng Ran is in charge of Qingchi Palace.

350
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:21,100
She has an old feud with Zijin Mansion.

351
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:25,920
So what? Zi Yuan is the proudest person in Heavenly Palace.

352
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,430
Feng Ran should take a detour when meeting us.

353
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:46,500
Hou Chi, I have to tell you in advance.

354
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,460
You should have finished the test days before.

355
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,700
But you said you haven't practiced enough, so it was delayed for three days.

356
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,959
If you fail again, I'll teach you a lesson. 
    

357
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:58,980
Yes. Perhaps you'll scold me.

358
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,969
I'm used to it.

359
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:01,560
Hou Chi.

360
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,490
Still-life spell.

361
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,999
She mastered it!

362
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,840
Great!

363
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,599
You finally mastered it!

364
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,000
Your Royal Highness, you mastered it!

365
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,999
Your Royal Highness, you mastered it!

366
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,760
Good. Another one.

367
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,999
- The spell of moving. 
 - No. I have never tried it.

368
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:30,380
You'll know whether you can.

369
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,010
Gather your power to use it.

370
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,369
- You're great! 
 - Great!

371
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,340
Good. Your Royal Highness, you mastered it.

372
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,599
Yes.

373
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,810
Your thousands of years' effort finally pays off.

374
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,769
I'll teach you better spells tomorrow.

375
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:06,499
Your Royal Highness, have you heard it?

376
00:38:06,499 --> 00:38:08,089
Feng Ran never tells lies.

377
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:09,739
Even she has praised you.

378
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:12,469
So you really made big progress.

379
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,320
Yes.

380
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,370
I mastered it.

381
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,319
I've practiced for years.

382
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:26,190
Why did I master it this time?

383
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:45,040


384
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,379
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

385
00:38:54,380 --> 00:39:01,259
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

386
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:07,680
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

387
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,940
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

388
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:20,740
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

389
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:27,199
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

390
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:34,519
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

391
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:41,280
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

392
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:58,400
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

393
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,879
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

394
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:12,059
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

395
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:19,375
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

396
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:27,139
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

397
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:33,999
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

398
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:40,474
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

399
00:40:40,474 --> 00:40:46,999
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

400
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:57,220
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
