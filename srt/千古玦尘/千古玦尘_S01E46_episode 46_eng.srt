1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,010


2
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:21,600
   

3
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,000
   

4
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,079
 What a True God you are, Bai Jue. 

5
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,999
 Good job, master of the three realms. 

6
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:47,400
 I'll tell Yuan Qi. 

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,278
 His father is the Lord of the North Sea, Qing Mu. 

8
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:54,578
 But you don't deserve it. 

9
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,600
 You and I don't need to meet or miss each other. 

10
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,440
Spit it out.

11
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:24,578
That day, it was me who took the Emperor Sword to meet Bai Jue at the Blue Dome of Heaven.

12
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,239
But we did it to reopen the God Realm.

13
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,159
There was no conspiracy!

14
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,260
What's your proof?

15
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,838
I know I've been willful.

16
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:35,038
But I don't have anything to do with that guy.

17
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,398
That's more like it.

18
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,038
And?

19
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,159
What do you mean?

20
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,500
What else are you hiding from me?

21
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,939
There's nothing else.

22
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:45,819
- For real? 
 - For real!

23
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:51,599
Yuan Qi, what did I say to you?

24
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,460
Follow the natural law and be honest.

25
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,060
Where is Gu Jun now?

26
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,500
He...

27
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,200
He's supporting the God Realm.

28
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,818
Tian Qi, stop lying to me.

29
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:15,280
Do you think an immortal's life is indifferent, too?

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,739
No, Shang Gu. It's...

31
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,079
Even now,

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,919
I don't know if I can believe you about Yue Mi and Zhi Yang staying in the God Realm.

33
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:27,219
Is that a lie, too?

34
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:28,838
Stop crying, Auntie.

35
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:31,980
I can't see you cry.

36
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,520
Uncle will correct it.

37
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:39,119
Yuan Qi, tell me.

38
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:42,639
Who named you?

39
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,539
The Qi in my name

40
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:50,559
meant "abandoned" at first.

41
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,079
Mom was gone.

42
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,379
Father God abandoned me.

43
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,880
That was how I got my name.

44
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:04,100
Yuan Qi, listen to me.

45
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,220
All parents love their children.

46
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,879
Your dad and mom must love you so much.

47
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,678
They love you so much

48
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,960
that they'd rather give up their life.

49
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,860
 If he asks about his parents, 

50
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,740
 please tell him that 

51
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,639
 his father is Qing Mu, Lord of North Sea. 

52
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,419
He's a hero.

53
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,619
He curbed the violent and helped the weak.

54
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:33,759
He devoted his life to love and justice.

55
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,039
Your mother...

56
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,660
She had a happy life.

57
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,600
She had close friends.

58
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,479
 And she was deeply loved by Father God and her husband. 

59
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,740
 She lived a free life. 

60
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,678
And she was deeply loved by her Father God and her husband.

61
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,679
She lived a free life.

62
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,059
Shang Gu, do you remember everything?

63
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:02,159
Are you afraid I remembered everything?

64
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,659
Uncle told me that

65
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:08,260
my Father God is Qing Mu, and he is Bai Jue.

66
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,779
They are the same.

67
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,499
Bai Jue told me about you yesterday.

68
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,238
What did he say?

69
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:26,098
He said... he wanted to stand out like your father.

70
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:28,118
He still loves you.

71
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,678
But he feels ashamed.

72
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,199
He can't forgive himself.

73
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,118
He said that... he thinks he doesn't deserve to be your Father God.

74
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,398
But I never despised him.

75
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,860
Blood is thicker than water.

76
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,958
One day, he will forgive himself and let it go.

77
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,759
Then he will come to you.

78
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,459
For real?

79
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,779
I have never lied to you.

80
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:53,919
Third Uncle?

81
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,840
A'Qi, this is too complicated.

82
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,459
I wanted to tell you when you grew up.

83
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,340
A'Qi, when your natural mother, Hou Chi, gave birth to you,

84
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,379
my consciousness was inside her.

85
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,079
A'Qi,

86
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:19,679
will you take me as your mom?

87
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:24,920
Mom?

88
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,279
Mom...

89
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:31,479
Mom!

90
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,720
Mom!

91
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,239
I miss you.

92
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,160
Mom!

93
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:49,059
Mom!

94
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,140
I miss you so much.

95
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,720
Mom!

96
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,918
Congratulations, Heavenly Queen. You've reached the ultimate level.

97
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:42,578
Once you pass the tribulation, you'll be Devil Queen.

98
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:44,838
The day has finally come.

99
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,659
All those years of living in fear.

100
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:50,419
All those sleepless nights.

101
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:53,100
Now it's finally over.

102
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,999
60,000 years ago, in the war between the gods and devils,

103
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:16,118
Xuan Yi was outnumbered.

104
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:19,299
The gods defeated him.

105
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,958
This time,

106
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,439
I will take the three True Gods one by one.

107
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,300
Everything in the three realms will be mine.

108
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:48,019
From now on,

109
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,459
I will be the only one in charge!

110
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,098
What did you say? Movements in the Netherworld?

111
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:40,339
Your Majesty, I wonder if it has ever occurred to you about why that devil was able to disappear for a hundred years?

112
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,538
And why did she become much more powerful as a Devil God?

113
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:49,620
What are you suggesting?

114
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,740
I was browsing through the books from the ancient God Realm.

115
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,079
If one's divine power reaches the summit of an Upper God,

116
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,840
the devil aura can be hidden.

117
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,459
 I killed Goddess Yue Mi. 

118
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:21,259
 What? 

119
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:23,839
 I've been hiding it for 60,000 years. 

120
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,860
After all these years,

121
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,579
you've never cleaned up your act.

122
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,440
Killing,

123
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:47,440
envy,

124
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:50,359
fear,

125
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,220
lust for power...

126
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:03,020
All these temptations have caused you to travel the path to becoming a devil.

127
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,680
In the war 100 years ago,

128
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,079
caused many demon casualties.

129
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,959
All these years, you stayed by my side.

130
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,139
Thanks to you, the demons can survive.

131
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,819
It's not my credit.

132
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:37,459
You should be thankful for Master Bai Jue.

133
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:40,980
Your Majesty, you've worked hard all these years.

134
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,058
Your Majesty.

135
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,300
A'Qin.

136
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,900
I know I've done a lot of ridiculous things,

137
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,540
and made you sad and disappointed.

138
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,799
After my father's death, you've been the only one by my side.

139
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,158
If it weren't for you for the past hundred years,

140
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,699
I really don't know how I could've held on.

141
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:11,938
A'Qin, once we return to Xuanjing Palace,

142
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:14,540
I want to send betrothal gifts to your clan.

143
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,699
I want to make you Demon Empress.

144
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:18,038
Wait a minute.

145
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,158
Don't turn me down so soon.

146
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,439
I've been planning this for a long time.

147
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,540
As long as you give me this chance,

148
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,780
I'll prove it to you.

149
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,159
I'm not who I used to be.

150
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,879
From now on to eternity,

151
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,880
I, Sen Yu, belong to you.

152
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,440
All right?

153
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,820
About that... give me some time, okay?

154
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:47,879
Okay.

155
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,460
I'll wait.

156
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:51,980
 Report! 

157
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,660
 Prince Jing Jian is here. 

158
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:00,138
I knew Heavenly King would send him here to persuade me.

159
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,139
Second Highness. Feng Ran.

160
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,300
Hey, Second Highness.

161
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,740
You'd better not act like your Father God.

162
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,579
We just made peace for a hundred years.

163
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:18,759
It's far from stable.

164
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,019
You have no idea what he was like in the Blue Dome of Heaven.

165
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:22,999
Sanctimonious!

166
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,798
Let's not quibble over right and wrong.

167
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,598
Now that you've promised Master Bai Jue,

168
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,759
you should keep your promise and retreat.

169
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,258
The longer the stalemate right now, the more dangerous it becomes.

170
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:35,459
Immortals and demons ought to make peace.

171
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,740
Sen Yu lost his face in the Blue Dome of Heaven.

172
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,358
Don't mind him.

173
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:45,720
I know about his temper.

174
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,499
The immortals are so deceptive,

175
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:49,619
that I can't even breathe.

176
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,798
I, Jing Jian, on behalf of the immortals and Father God, will apologize to you.

177
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:56,840
Hold on.

178
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,059
I can't stand to see you act this way.

179
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,699
Well, the demons are at fault for this.

180
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,220
We shouldn't interfere with the Human Realm.

181
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,400
But you...  But...

182
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,660
But this fruit tastes great.

183
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,740
Take a bite.

184
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,358
Sen Yu knew you'd like it.

185
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,279
He fetched them himself for you.

186
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,359
He also mentioned sending some to the Heavenly Palace.

187
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,358
Thanks for that, Brother Sen Yu.

188
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,478
Don't mention it.

189
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:30,520
You saved my life.

190
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,998
Jing Jian, shall we talk in private?

191
00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:41,359
This way.

192
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,459
Come here. Take a seat.

193
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,398
Brother Jing Jian, I'm confused.

194
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,640
There's something I'm suspicious of.

195
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,999
Go ahead.

196
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:07,978
There is a rumor in the three realms that Heavenly Queen hates Feng Ran.

197
00:15:07,978 --> 00:15:09,639
Is it real?

198
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,340
It is.

199
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,258
For the past 100 years,

200
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:16,439
Feng Ran and you seem to be overly affectionate.

201
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,320
Doesn't she mind it?

202
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,199
Mother God has gone too far.

203
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,618
Feng Ran is tolerant and open-minded.

204
00:15:21,618 --> 00:15:23,660
She won't seek trouble with Mother God.

205
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,819
Sounds like you cherish your wife

206
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:29,779
more than your parents.

207
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,798
There's more to it.

208
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,500
I cannot disclose it to you.

209
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,719
How about this? Let me ask you a few questions.

210
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,079
Sure.

211
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,319
Can anyone choose their family background?

212
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,699
Of course not.

213
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,800
Can people in this world restrain their emotions and stop being trapped by them?

214
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,539
No.

215
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:51,658
If you were me, could you find a way

216
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:54,258
to solve the grievance between my wife and Mother God?

217
00:15:54,258 --> 00:15:55,798
I'm afraid not.

218
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,018
If that is so, just let it go with the wind.

219
00:15:59,018 --> 00:16:03,079
I must say that I used to be bothered by them.

220
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:05,819
Feng Ran is better than me on this.

221
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:08,300
She hates evil as her enemy. She expresses her emotions directly.

222
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,420
She taught me to face difficulties.

223
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,219
With her by my side, I am satisfied.

224
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,819
Of course, I want to kill Wu Huan myself.

225
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,219
But I have to let it go for Jing Jian.

226
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:31,399
Chief God Shang Gu has woken up now.

227
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,798
She hates evil as her enemy.

228
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,279
I'm sure she'll seek justice for my parents

229
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,159
and bring peace to the three realms.

230
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,280
That's so good.

231
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,039
What do you mean?

232
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,679
The lovers finally get together.

233
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,660
What about Sen Yu and you?

234
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,599
He just proposed to me.

235
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,220
I didn't promise him.

236
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,439
Not making that promise is fine.

237
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,180
Have him wait for another eight or nine hundred years.

238
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,438
Feng Ran.

239
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,720
We must go. Something has happened.

240
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,700
I've inspected it.

241
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,999
They died after their spiritual veins were drained.

242
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,259
I've seen the victims of devil auras in Wutong Forest.

243
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,139
Their deaths are similar.

244
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,519
Could it be that this is what the devil in Wutong Forest did?

245
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,240
Did anyone see how they died?

246
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,838
No.

247
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,519
It's only one kilometer from your camp.

248
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,199
That's right. So what?

249
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:51,358
Why did the immortal soldiers die here tragically?

250
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,579
Jing Jian, we are an upright clan. We would have admitted it, if it was done by us.

251
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:57,238
Even if Heavenly King suspects us,

252
00:17:57,239 --> 00:18:00,139
but even now you suspect us.

253
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,739
Then it must have been done by the immortals.

254
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Do you think it's her?

255
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
A conflict right before retreat.

256
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,078
The murderer must be doing it

257
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,780
to provoke conflicts in the Luocha Region.

258
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,460
I'll go back to the Heavenly Palace now and tell Father God the truth.

259
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:29,099
Jian'er, do you think there's another explanation?

260
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,499
What do you mean?

261
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:39,500
The one who killed the three soldiers was not an immortal, nor demon...

262
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,559
but a devil.

263
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:48,598
Today, news comes from the Lower Realm.

264
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,759
Many areas are being invaded by devil auras.

265
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,059
I am afraid that the Netherworld has given birth to a new Devil God.

266
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,739
Devil God?

267
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,559
Then this person may have something to do with the annihilation of the Phoenix Clan a hundred years ago.

268
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,559
Although there is no evidence,

269
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,580
but I think so.

270
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,560
Who could the murderer be?

271
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:17,280
What are you talking about?

272
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,580
You didn't even notice when I walked in.

273
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,159
Why are you here?

274
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,339
I've prepared a feast in Fuyao Hall.

275
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:32,438
Zhao'er and Yang'er have arrived.

276
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,940
It's a family dinner.

277
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,159
It's been a long time since the last time

278
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:39,138
we sat around and talked freely.

279
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,279
I made this soup myself.

280
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:52,958
Yang'er, when you were young,

281
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:55,700
you used to take others' food.

282
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,340
You could never have enough fish soup.

283
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,218
I was young and thoughtless.

284
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:06,478
I always thought the stolen food tasted better.

285
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,679
Speaking of,

286
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,478
it's been 60,000 years since the last time I cooked.

287
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:15,699
Does it still taste the same?

288
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:23,479
Father God, I need to check on the Luocha Region.

289
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:24,919
I should get going.

290
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,260
Goodbye.

291
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,199
Second Brother, it's just a family dinner. How much time can it take?

292
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,859
What's so urgent?

293
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:35,179
It's been a long time since the last family dinner.

294
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:39,438
Even if you have something urgent, you have to finish this bowl of fish soup from Mother God.

295
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,159
I'm not hungry.

296
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,159
- Second Brother! 
 - Are you leaving the family behind

297
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,700
for a woman?

298
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,679
Please, enjoy your dinner.

299
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:55,900
Second Brother!

300
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,580
He's getting more and more unruly.

301
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,059
It's okay. Let him be.

302
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,599
Have you finished the soup?

303
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,078
Three more soldiers were murdered in the Luocha Region.

304
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,180
The cause is unknown.

305
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,080
I suspect that...

306
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,259
someone has ulterior motives.

307
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:31,720
Yang'er, do you know why these three soldiers were killed?

308
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:36,199
From my perspective,

309
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:37,979
maybe...

310
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,358
maybe the demons.

311
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,499
The demons again.

312
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,979
Do you hate them so much?

313
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:48,819
Who are you still making excuses for?

314
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:54,478
Zhao'er, there was a weird scene in the Netherworld.

315
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:56,838
The Blue Dome of Heaven would have seen it all.

316
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:59,539
Why didn't you report it to me?

317
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:05,419
Father God, I didn't notice it.

318
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:08,619
You spent a hundred years with Master Bai Jue.

319
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,139
You didn't learn anything.

320
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:15,839
Everyone in the three realms knows that you only care about prestige.

321
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:20,598
Wu Huan.

322
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:25,920
Killing only three immortals. That's far too less for you.

323
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,980
If you want to provoke a war,

324
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,759
you could be tougher.

325
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,839
What are you talking about?

326
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,379
I have never killed anyone.

327
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:39,900
Apart from the three soldiers,

328
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:43,179
you killed Feng Ran's parents,

329
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:45,559
Bi Xi, the guardian of Soul Tower,

330
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,999
Elder Dan Feng,

331
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,139
and my master, Goddess Yue Mi.

332
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:57,110
If this king protects you today,

333
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,610
he is not worthy of the king's throne.

334
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:06,099
Nor am I qualified to be their Father God!

335
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,219
Right.

336
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:16,739
I did kill them.

337
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Now you admit it.

338
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,039
I can't sense the devil aura inside you.

339
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,760
We'll go to Master Shang Gu.

340
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,718
Let her check you!

341
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:34,219
See if you're a corrupted devil!

342
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:39,979
I'm not afraid of you at all.

343
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,118
Even if Shang Gu shows up herself,

344
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:47,139
I won't be bothered.

345
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,639
It's you...

346
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,079
who deserted me and expelled me to the Netherworld.

347
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:58,259
I made mistakes while rushing to survive in danger.

348
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:00,238
You are the reason...

349
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,379
I became a devil.

350
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:04,319
Mother God.

351
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,538
Yang'er, you have always been on my side.

352
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:08,879
Out of the way.

353
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:11,719
I could support you for what you've done. But now...

354
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:14,680
I'm doing this for our family!

355
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:17,358
Your Father God is too tired.

356
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,460
Let him rest.

357
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,798
Yang'er! Yang'er!

358
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:30,440
You're a god!

359
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,400
You're entrusted by True Gods,

360
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,238
and were born to guard the three realms.

361
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:38,300
So what?

362
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,039
The Devil God used to be a True God, too.

363
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,458
Upon creating this world, Qing Tian said all the clans were united.

364
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,840
There was no distinction between gods and devils.

365
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,179
But there are rights and wrongs.

366
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:57,499
If it weren't for the devils, four True Gods wouldn't have perished.

367
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:59,460
The God Realm wouldn't be covered in dust.

368
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,499
We and the Devil Clan can not live under the same sky!

369
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,840
You are a fool!

370
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,180
Mu Guang, are you and I not good enough to govern the three realms?

371
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,240
We have been the supreme for 60,000 years.

372
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,198
Once the God Realm is reopened,

373
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:17,740
Shang Gu will take the throne,

374
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,920
then we'll have to return to our most humble days.

375
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:29,159
But if it's sealed forever, without any True God,

376
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:35,219
we can master the three realms forever.

377
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,479
Why?

378
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:44,439
Why did you turn into this?

379
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:50,820
It's my turn to run this family.

380
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:57,219
Father God! Father God!

381
00:25:57,219 --> 00:26:00,220
You will understand it one day

382
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,139
that everything I'm doing is right.

383
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:10,199
In the three realms, the rule is set by the powerful one.

384
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:12,550
Corrupted or not...

385
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,790
does not matter.

386
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,919
My devil power now can rival any True God.

387
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,879
Zhao'er, just carry out my will.

388
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,959
Once Bai Jue is dead,

389
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,180
the three realms will be ours for sure.

390
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,399
It's getting cold. Why don't you rest inside the camp?

391
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:08,619
I can't sleep.

392
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:10,159
The retreat was within reach.

393
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,878
But the leaders of our troop insist it was the demons who killed our soldiers.

394
00:27:14,878 --> 00:27:17,660
It has become tense again.

395
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,118
The two clans have been fighting for tens of thousands of years.

396
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,700
Hatred is as deep as the sea.

397
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,420
How can it be resolved right away?

398
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:31,739
Prince Jing Jian.

399
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:39,318
Our Demon Clan had already planned to retreat,

400
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,300
but your Immortal Clan is eyeing us.

401
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,739
Your troops show no intention of retreating.

402
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:45,438
What's your suggestion?

403
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:48,599
I've reported to Father God about the death of the three soldiers.

404
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:51,639
Please give me more time.

405
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,958
It's hard to remove overnight all the grievances accumulated over the years.

406
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,399
I get it.

407
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,118
I must warn you.

408
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:04,018
If war breaks out, we will fight you to the end.

409
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:05,039
No hurry.

410
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,538
Only by finding out the cause of death of the three soldiers as soon as possible can the crisis be quelled.

411
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:11,759
Sen Yu, you have my word.

412
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,258
I will try my best to stop the war.

413
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:19,798
After all, neither of us wants to see suffering.

414
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,118
All right.

415
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,679
As long as the immortals don't act first, we will not attack.

416
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,780
Take a look.

417
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,679
After being beaten many times, the stone drum is cracked.

418
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,559
This drum has divine power.

419
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,198
It will take tens of hundreds of years for it to repair itself.

420
00:28:39,198 --> 00:28:41,718
If only there weren't so many cracks.

421
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:44,339
It's okay. It takes time.

422
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:46,700
It will be mended one day.

423
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,199
Yue Mi.

424
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:06,259
I keep telling Shang Gu that you're in the God Realm.

425
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:09,019
I almost believe it myself.

426
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,318
I ignored your feelings.

427
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,199
After all these years,

428
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,520
I'm still alone.

429
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,680
Maybe this is retribution.

430
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,100
Just as I expected.

431
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,039
Shang Gu has taken Yuan Qi as her child.

432
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,640
Bai Jue has almost completely become the villain.

433
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,438
This drama is about as much as we expected.

434
00:29:36,438 --> 00:29:40,419
But... Shang Gu will remember it in the end.

435
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:42,318
By that time,

436
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,880
what will she think of Bai Jue's plan?

437
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,800
I won't comment on their personal affairs.

438
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,520
Let's drink.

439
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,039
If you had known earlier,

440
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,060
why stay with her in the first place?

441
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,880
Yue Mi?

442
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,239
Is it you for real?

443
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:15,438
Look at the night.

444
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,479
The starry night.

445
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:20,339
Tian Qi, I'm here.

446
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:27,118
You're back! Yue Mi.

447
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:31,579
Yue Mi, it's my fault. I got you killed.

448
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,579
Tian Qi.

449
00:30:33,579 --> 00:30:35,899
It's not your fault.

450
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:38,780
If you want to blame something, blame it on destiny.

451
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,198
Don't worry.

452
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:44,399
From now on, I will never leave you.

453
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,180
You...

454
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,000
You're not Yue Mi!

455
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,019
I should have killed you long before.

456
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,239
Why did he die so easily?

457
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,500
Tian Qi is the God of Water.

458
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,399
Upon his death, there will be a strange sight in the sky.

459
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,959
That means my devil power has reached the summit!

460
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,040
It's time for the Three Realms to change.

461
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:05,478
Master.

462
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:07,979
Tian Qi hasn't come back, has he?

463
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:09,520
No, he hasn't.

464
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,478
I'm feeling rather uneasy.

465
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:13,718
You are overthinking.

466
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:15,919
If you think this wind and rain is too much,

467
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,618
I can cast a spell to disperse the cloud.

468
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:21,820
It's just autumn.

469
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,019
Why is it suddenly so cold?

470
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:31,000
Greetings, Master.

471
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,879
What is it that you have summoned me here?

472
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,138
Devil God has shown up today. Devil auras have invaded the three realms.

473
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:41,919
You just came back from the palace.

474
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,619
I bet you know something about it.

475
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:47,339
Father God is bothered, too.

476
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:50,900
He also said that he will come to discuss with you on another day.

477
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,000
I've discovered that this Devil God is as powerful as Xuan Yi was back then.

478
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:57,179
All gods must be united to seal the Devil God.

479
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,538
No one in the three realms can match this devil on their own.

480
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:04,018
I will use the divine power of the Blue Dome of Heaven against the Devil God.

481
00:33:04,018 --> 00:33:07,239
You should leave. There isn't a place for you here.

482
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:11,638
Master, I am aware that no connection lasts forever.

483
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:17,418
But over the past 100 years, I've done everything I can to serve you.

484
00:33:17,418 --> 00:33:20,559
Before I go, I would like to ask you

485
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,139
if you have ever even been half sincere to me?

486
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,639
Jing Zhao,

487
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,438
you're still young.

488
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:35,438
It's not a sin to seek vanity.

489
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:38,559
But desires can hardly be fulfilled, and they will burden you.

490
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,679
I wish that you could forget about your obsession.

491
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,440
Find your own way through it.

492
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,879
Of all my life, the only thing I regret

493
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:50,219
is that I didn't drink the cross-cupped wine

494
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:53,640
with you a hundred years ago.

495
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,800
I'm afraid this will be the last time I see you.

496
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,039
Living together for a hundred years, was also like a marriage.

497
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:05,079
I only ask before I leave,

498
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:09,380
can I drink with you

499
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,730
as a farewell?

500
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:16,840
Please fulfill my wish.

501
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,539
What did you put in my drink?

502
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:42,059
How dare you poison me?

503
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,119
Inside the wine are the seeds of God Slayer Flower.

504
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,958
With the devil power of Mother God,

505
00:34:55,959 --> 00:35:00,599
in less than half a stick of incense, you will lose your soul.

506
00:35:05,779 --> 00:35:07,858
Why is it snowing so hard all of a sudden?

507
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:09,759
What on earth has happened?

508
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,238
When the land turns into ice,

509
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,700
the power of true fire must have dissipated.

510
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,239
Bai Jue's power originates from fire.

511
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:19,479
Did something happen to him?

512
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,899
Heaven has a purpose.

513
00:35:22,899 --> 00:35:25,999
True God Bai Jue became a devil and unfortunately died.

514
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,338
The Blue Dome of Heaven has been entrusted to Princess Jing Zhao.

515
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:36,998
Master, what do you think of this edict from me?

516
00:35:36,998 --> 00:35:38,959
Presumptuous!

517
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,040
I'm no longer a servant at the Pilgrim Hall.

518
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,599
You're the presumptuous one!

519
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,420
Tian Qi has already perished before you.

520
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,759
After your death, I'll go after Shang Gu.

521
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,238
From now on, I will be the master of the three realms.

522
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,599
Master, look over there!

523
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,458
It's the Blue Dome of Heaven. Why is it shrouded by devil aura?

524
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:27,339
Chang Que, be sure to protect Qingchi Palace and Yuan Qi.

525
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:29,738
Close the gate. No entrance is allowed.

526
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:31,339
Yes, Master.

527
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:39,859
Give out my order.

528
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:44,760
Mourn over True God Bai Jue's death for three years.

529
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:48,740
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

530
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,999
Are you blind? Can't you see she's clearly a devil?

531
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:56,519
Traitors,

532
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,079
liars,

533
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,800
and the disrespectful...

534
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,879
will be executed on sight!

535
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:26,158
Look!

536
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,539
Why is the Demon Gathering Flag in the devil's hand?

537
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:42,500
We can't stop her at all with our spiritual power.

538
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,818
If we don't take the flag back, the demons will keep marching until death.

539
00:37:46,818 --> 00:37:49,619
It would be a disaster for both the demons and the immortals.

540
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,280
Hang in there.

541
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:18,080


542
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:30,139
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

543
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:37,149
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

544
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:43,700
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

545
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:49,675
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

546
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:56,500
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

547
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:03,099
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

548
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:10,399
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

549
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,540
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

550
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:34,100
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

551
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:40,680
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

552
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:47,859
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

553
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:55,060
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

554
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:03,040
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

555
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:09,920
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

556
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,324
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

557
00:40:16,325 --> 00:40:22,849
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

558
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:32,400
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
