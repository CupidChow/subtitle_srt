1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,900


2
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:21,580
   

3
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,000
   

4
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,299
He looks exactly like you.

5
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:33,656
How could you leave him in Qingchi Palace?

6
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:35,399
You want to raise him, you raise him.

7
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,040
If you don't want to raise him, you can send him to learn from someone.

8
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,170
Send him somewhere?

9
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,284
It seems you are ready to be despised by him when he grows up.

10
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:50,170
I can tell you now that you are leaving a very bad image in his eyes.

11
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,356
Are you done?

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,800
- It has only been sixty thousand years, why... 
 - I want to live a different life, can't I?

13
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,550
Anything else?

14
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,030
There was, but not anymore.

15
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,856
Why are you laughing?

16
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:14,600
I'm glad I wasn't with you for these 60,000 years.

17
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,799
Don't come to the Blue Dome of Heaven again.

18
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,738
I'm doing well.

19
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:30,000
Let the past stay in the past.

20
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,259
You finished it so fast?

21
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:49,956
Where did you go?

22
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:53,041
It's my first time here. I just walked around.

23
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,513
Why did Ice Cube Bai change so much?

24
00:02:56,513 --> 00:02:59,098
I told you we had nothing in common with him.

25
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:01,219
- I regret it. 
 - Regret what?

26
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,900
I regret I didn't set this place on fire.

27
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,799
How many is this for you?

28
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,199
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,527
I'm here to give the mother and son some sugar figures.

30
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:26,556
You slip into Qingchi Palace once in a while and played those tricks.

31
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:28,441
Do you think I don't know?

32
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,449
Ice Cube, you're so impatient.

33
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:34,570
Don't you fear Wu Huan will figure it out over time?

34
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,519
Shang Gu came to the Blue Dome of Heaven tonight.

35
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,656
I'm not confused.

36
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:41,278
Then, why didn't you stop her?

37
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:43,627
One always wanted to see you.

38
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:45,327
The other is your son.

39
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,620
How could I stop her?

40
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,810
I can't sleep.

41
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,956
All right.

42
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:57,018
I'll let you see them again. Hurry back. I'll watch for you.

43
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:58,559
Okay.

44
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,458
You know what?

45
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:44,158
I heard some super invincible gossip today.

46
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,330
What gossip?

47
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,127
Come on. Stop it. Listen to me.

48
00:04:49,127 --> 00:04:50,719
You all know the three True Gods, right?

49
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:55,739
During ancient times, Master Tian Qi's Purple Moon Whip directly...

50
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,420
Really?

51
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,619
Don't you have something better to do?

52
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:07,939
Master Shang Gu's core spirit is unstable. She needs some rest.

53
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:10,598
- Get with your business. Go. 
 - Yes. Okay.

54
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:12,739
You stop right there.

55
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,909
Jia Ye, do you want a lesson?

56
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:18,956
You're the one who likes gossiping on Qilian Mountain.

57
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:21,018
Why is your tongue longer than your ears?

58
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:22,439
I'm sorry. I got it.

59
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,449
You said you got it but you haven't learned.

60
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,939
You should be punished.

61
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:30,299
I won't do it again! It hurts.

62
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,370
I just heard some gossip.

63
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,720
Can you punch me instead if I tell you about it?

64
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,999
You just talked about this?

65
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:42,341
No. It's about the three True Gods.

66
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,178
Is it true?

67
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,449
In vivid detail.

68
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,999
Especially Master Tian Qi's embarrassing incidents.

69
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:49,913
It's ridiculous.

70
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:51,899
I don't want to hear about him.

71
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,084
However, the God Realm has been already closed.

72
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:56,819
Very few stories were passed down.

73
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,930
Where did you get them?

74
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,199
Just for fun.

75
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,480
If it's not funny, then you can punish me.

76
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,799
Fine.

77
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:11,619
Tell me all the gossip of the three True Gods.

78
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:12,813
Don't hide anything.

79
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:14,660
I dare not.

80
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,110
Master Tian Qi.

81
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,641
Feng Ran. Perfect timing.

82
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:40,970
These are all Shang Gu's favorite. Please help me choose.

83
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,550
I didn't expect you to be so attentive.

84
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,160
Why are you laughing?

85
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,659
I heard some gossip about the God Realm.

86
00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:01,559
About the love triangle between you, True God Bai Jue and Master Shang Gu.

87
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,059
A lot of gossip about the God Realm was passed down to the Immortal Realm.

88
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,013
It's not strange.

89
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:09,978
But the gossip is all about your embarrassing incidents.

90
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:12,760
It's not just nice.

91
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,959
My embarrassing incidents?

92
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,719
For example, the fire in Everlasting Hall.

93
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,598
It sounds really funny.

94
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:24,619
Look at how dignified your bedroom is. How did it happen?

95
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:27,658
What's more, courting by pretending to be sick.

96
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:31,279
Being jealous. And something funnier.

97
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,556
Funnier?

98
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:38,138
I don't know why the lower immortals started the rumor about you.

99
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:41,059
They are clearly trying to smear you on purpose.

100
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,984
What about Bai Jue?

101
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:45,756
What did they say about Bai Jue?

102
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,059
They said True God Bai Jue was gallant.

103
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:53,314
He and Master Shang Gu were a great couple.

104
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:57,200
I can't go into detail, or you'd be angry.

105
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,013
Rumors. They are not true.

106
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,499
Don't believe them.

107
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:05,920
If you say they are fake, then they must be fake.

108
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,910
- Where did you hear them? 
 - From Jia Ye.

109
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,638
This rabbit's tongue is really long.

110
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:18,759
I'll tape his mouth so he can't speak nonsense.

111
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,559
Why are you so nervous since you said it wasn't true?

112
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,413
Rumors. Don't spread fake news.

113
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:30,213
It's okay that they made me look bad.

114
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:33,340
I fear it'd ruin the honor of the God Realm.

115
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:38,099
You know what? I'll ask Jia Ye to check with Master Shang Gu.

116
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,299
She's involved. She can clarify it for you.

117
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,698
Absolutely not.  Impossible.

118
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:45,659
Well... This doesn't need to be clarified or verified.

119
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,498
All right, I'm just joking.

120
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:53,480
I promise you I won't tell anyone about your stories.

121
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,999
I just didn't expect you to be cute 60,000 years ago,

122
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:01,199
even if you were a little bit awkward.

123
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:04,258
I think we can stop the rumors as long as we tape Jia Ye's mouth.

124
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm going to bring him here right now.

125
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,939
Rumors. No surprise there.

126
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:11,410
- Don't trust. 
 - I got it.

127
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,720
It's fake.  All fake!

128
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,199
You are so brave.

129
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:25,339
Disrespecting a True God is a serious sin.

130
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,119
I'm confused.

131
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,299
I heard the gossip about you.

132
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:34,870
I'm sorry about that. Please forgive me.

133
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,598
Master Tian Qi is forgiving. He only taped your mouth.

134
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:42,019
If I were him, I'd have pulled your ears out.

135
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,739
Do you think Bai Jue of legend

136
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:51,899
is different from that of the Blue Dome of Heaven?

137
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,300
They're quite different.

138
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,200
I really hate the one of the Blue Dome of Heaven.

139
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,960
What do you think of me, compared to Bai Jue?

140
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,860
Of course, you're much better than Master Bai Jue.

141
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,899
Yes.

142
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,341
You're wise, martial, affectionate, and righteous.

143
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:16,879
You're not as ridiculous as the rumors said. Right!

144
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,219
You're highly respected in the Heavenly Realm; a person of good moral standing and reputation.

145
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:25,560
- Don't you think so? 
  - Yes. 

146
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,010
So you're saying, Ice Cube Bai is more ridiculous than me.

147
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,510
Get up. I won't punish you.

148
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,439
Thank you. I'll keep my mouth shut.

149
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:41,780
I will never believe such absurd rumors again.

150
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,799
About my absurd past,

151
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,420
I'm afraid I'd have forgotten it, if you didn't mention it.

152
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,060
It's been 60,000 years.

153
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,899
Now that I think about it,

154
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,341
it's very funny.

155
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:05,513
Are the rumors...

156
00:11:05,513 --> 00:11:08,079
Master Tian Qi, I remember Jing Jian asked me to travel the Human Realm.

157
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,840
It's almost time. I have to go.

158
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,879
Come on. Go.

159
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,379
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

160
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,556
Your Majesty hasn't come to the bedroom for days, being busy with political affairs.

161
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:48,840
So, I came to see you.

162
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,236
There are still no leads about the murder in the Wutong Forest 100 years ago.

163
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:58,640
I'm really having trouble sleeping and eating.

164
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,439
That man massacred the Phoenix Clan and hurt Zhao'er.

165
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:04,956
I also hope that Your Majesty will investigate thoroughly.

166
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:07,570
You can't be easy on him.

167
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,784
Of course, it's about the Devil Clan.

168
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:15,500
It's going to be Lord Dong Hua's birthday in a few days.

169
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,038
I'll take my millennium spiritual power to nourish Observation Mountain

170
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:24,039
as the birthday gift for Immortal Dong Hua.

171
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,356
Don't damage your cultivation anymore.

172
00:12:49,356 --> 00:12:51,585
I don't want you to do that.

173
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,118
The thought of the mistake I made makes me feel uncomfortable.

174
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:02,840
What is the problem with damaging some cultivation?

175
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,699
Come on.

176
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,056
You've been in the Heavenly Palace.

177
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:14,030
You must be bored.

178
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,157
I can spend all my time with Your Majesty.

179
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,200
How could I feel bored?

180
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:32,179
For the past 100 years, Master Bai Jue has troubled you.

181
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:35,478
And Demon God is hiding in Qingchi Palace without coming out.

182
00:13:35,478 --> 00:13:37,413
I can't get away these days.

183
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:41,798
I should bother you to attend Dong Hua's birthday party for me.

184
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:43,378
Your Majesty, you're busy.

185
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:47,100
I'm willing to go to Observation Mountain for you.

186
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,459
Thank you for the trouble.

187
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,279
Mother God.

188
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,699
Yang'er, your spiritual veins are damaged.

189
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,900
Don't work so hard.

190
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,180
Mother God, I'm fine.

191
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,109
100 years ago,

192
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:46,270
I asked you to slaughter the Demon Clan with the God Slayer Flower,

193
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,356
which got you punished by your Father God with twenty thunderbolts of Sky Thunder.

194
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:54,458
Why do you mention it again? It's the past.

195
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,356
Mother God, don't blame yourself.

196
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:59,130
At the thought of it,

197
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,770
your screams at Blue Dragon Pavilion made me heartbroken.

198
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:09,080
It will make me feel bad if you mention it again.

199
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,039
Forget it.

200
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,127
Yang'er, how is it going in the Luocha Region?

201
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:19,009
I and Jing Jian take turns commanding there.

202
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:22,258
And with Master Bai Jue's divine protection, everything is under control.

203
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:26,339
The Demon Clan is cunning. You must be careful.

204
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,519
Mother God, are you going to start a war between immortals and demons again?

205
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,379
I fear for you and Jian'er's safety.

206
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:39,019
I have absolutely no intention to provoke a dispute between the immortals and demons.

207
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,518
I've misspoken.

208
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:44,699
Please punish me.

209
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,799
Fine. It's nothing.

210
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,799
After I recovered from my injury, I have practiced more diligently.

211
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,199
I've been serious about it,

212
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,710
in case there'll be an emergency.

213
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,180
I hope I'll never use the weapon that I have.

214
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,428
Master Bai Jue is right.

215
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,740
Only by stopping the war can the world be peaceful.

216
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,758
I heard the theater of the Human Realm was rehearsing a new script these days.

217
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:10,439
- Why don't we... 
 - Shang Gu is awake. I have to run Qingchi Palace more.

218
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,920
I might have less time to see you.

219
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,770
Right. Master Shang Gu is awake.

220
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,313
I'm supposed to visit her. Why not now?

221
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,956
Yuan Qi.

222
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:27,819
Why do you pester Sister Feng Ran again?

223
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,720
She's busy.

224
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,060
Come on.

225
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,713
Tian Qi, when will the God Realm reopen?

226
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:44,214
I want to go back there. I miss Zhi Yang and Yue Mi.

227
00:17:44,214 --> 00:17:48,980
Plus, I want to take Yuan Qi there.

228
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,258
I miss them, too.

229
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:54,456
Shang Gu, trust me.

230
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:55,913
Now that you're awake,

231
00:17:55,913 --> 00:17:59,741
the day of reopening the God Realm is close.

232
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:02,513
Yuan Qi is pitiful.

233
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:06,359
Although he's naughty, he's not bad in nature.

234
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:12,260
I just don't know why Bai Jue would become like this.

235
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,690
Why are you still confused?

236
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,990
Not just Bai Jue. Many people have changed.

237
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,399
For example, Wu Huan.

238
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,618
She has changed beyond recognition.

239
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:27,800
What do you mean?

240
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,819
You have seen that child, Feng Ran.

241
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:36,419
Don't you wonder why you don't see Wu Xi and Feng Yan?

242
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,941
Don't they still live in seclusion?

243
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:41,100
Live in seclusion?

244
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,160
Wu Huan already killed...

245
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,470
So, Feng Ran grew up like an orphan since she was a kid.

246
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,479
For the throne of the Phoenix Empress?

247
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,199
Yes.

248
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,299
In the end, something still went wrong.

249
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:06,130
I didn't expect Wu Huan to be so cruel.

250
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,398
I misunderstood her back then.

251
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:12,299
I'll let Wu Huan pay for all this.

252
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,730
Master Shang Gu, let me introduce you to someone.

253
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,941
Master God, I'm Jing Jian.

254
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:22,956
This is my immortal boyfriend, Jing Jian.

255
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:24,699
The younger prince of the Heavenly Palace?

256
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,839
Is he Wu Huan's son?

257
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,398
Why are you with him?

258
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:33,660
He's good and kind.

259
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,218
I'm curious, didn't Wu Huan want to keep you two apart?

260
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:43,699
Naturally, she is angry with that, but there is nothing she can do.

261
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,620
The angrier she is, the happier I am.

262
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,900
I always indulge her.

263
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,000
He's good.

264
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,914
You've overstayed your welcome.  You can go now!

265
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:06,180
I'll visit True God Shang Gu another day.

266
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:11,800
Sister Feng Ran needs to be around my aunt these days.

267
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,690
You don't have to come here again anytime soon. Goodbye.

268
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:19,639
Did any of you show him how to greet a guest?

269
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:21,080
Master Shang Gu,

270
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,339
Master Tian Qi and I don't have a way with him.

271
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:29,739
Yuan Qi, do you have a grudge against Brother Jing Jian?

272
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:30,900
Of course.

273
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,099
I'll marry Sister Feng Ran when I grow up.

274
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,619
But now he has taken her.

275
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:36,728
Thank you.

276
00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:39,979
With a little romantic rival like you, Brother Jing Jian will feel threatened.

277
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:42,219
You don't have to thank me.

278
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,390
Yuan Qi, you're a child.

279
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,039
You don't know how important marriage is yet.

280
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,700
Don't mention this again in the future.

281
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,919
Then, why is Bai Jue not serious about marriage?

282
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:58,179
He can marry many people. Why can't I?

283
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:00,610
I have to marry Sister Feng Ran.

284
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:03,242
Why do you like her?

285
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:05,320
Because she always takes me to the Human Realm.

286
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,499
She teaches me to play poker and treats me to dinner.

287
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,460
She flies kites with me. And when we see injustice, we fight together.

288
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,000
- I don't have to mention how happy I am to be with Sister Feng Ran. 
 - Don't talk nonsense.

289
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,199
Master Shang Gu, I didn't.

290
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,271
I won't blame you.

291
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:22,485
I used to have a good friend like you who traveled the Lower Realm with me.

292
00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:27,110
Please treat Yuan Qi like this in the future and play with him.

293
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:31,357
Master Shang Gu, it's Dong Hua's birthday.

294
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:34,660
They sent us an invitation and asked us to go to Observation Mountain.

295
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,600
Let's go there.

296
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,379
Who's Dong Hua?

297
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:41,285
He's a kind upper immortal.

298
00:21:41,285 --> 00:21:44,499
I heard he has cultivated in the Immortal Realm since ancient times.

299
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:47,279
Aunt, I want to go to Observation Mountain. I like it most.

300
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,919
Let's go there later.

301
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:51,800
Tell Dong Hua we won't go there.

302
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,010
Yes.

303
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,385
It's a birthday party. There must be many ladies and good wine.

304
00:21:57,385 --> 00:21:59,057
Are you sure you won't go?

305
00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:01,300
I'm used to staying in Qingchi Palace.

306
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,619
I'm not into having fun.

307
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:05,414
Master Tian Qi doesn't like to be around people?

308
00:22:05,414 --> 00:22:09,490
Gods of the God Realm will laugh when they hear about this.

309
00:22:10,614 --> 00:22:12,700
Why won't you go? What makes you not go?

310
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,780
I won't go.

311
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:18,520
Sister Feng Ran, Third Uncle is being arbitrary.

312
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,439
He's a master. I can't win him.

313
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,180
Aunt, people say I'm a child without a father or mother.

314
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,680
I won't be able to marry anyone in the future.

315
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,080
I think they're right. Even Sister Feng Ran is not on my side.

316
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,019
Aunt, you must take me to Observation Mountain.

317
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,200
I invented the tricks you are playing.

318
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,780
Then show me what you can.

319
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:47,680
Look at this kid.  He can turn his face faster than a page in a book.

320
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:52,428
Your Father God enlightened me with patience.

321
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:54,557
He helped me gain the Power of Chaos.

322
00:22:54,557 --> 00:22:59,159
I'll devote myself to training you to repay the debt that I owe him.

323
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,299
In this way, I'll be even with Bai Jue.

324
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,399
Come on, how could Bai Jue teach you?

325
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,042
Your Father God was handsome and educated.

326
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:13,279
There were countless admirers of his in the God Realm.

327
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:16,114
I was one of them.

328
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:17,814
But he didn't care about me.

329
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,571
I don't believe it.

330
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:21,870
Your third uncle didn't tell you about it?

331
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:24,460
I don't want to hear about Bai Jue.

332
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,358
Bai Jue is bad and cold now.

333
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,828
His behavior is disgusting.

334
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:34,070
Why did he become like that?

335
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,810
I also want to know.

336
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,700
I've had so much tea, but why am I still sleepy?

337
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,399
Maybe this tea has been sitting for too long.

338
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:49,142
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

339
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,940
Aunt, Third Uncle just woke up.

340
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:04,000
You're drinking alone.

341
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,114
Why didn't you ask me to join you?

342
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:08,239
Third Uncle.

343
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:12,759
A person who has undergone earth-shaking changes must have suffered an unprecedented blow.

344
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,940
The wine is strong.  I feel a bit dizzy.

345
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,610
I saw there's an old wound on Bai Jue's chest. It must have been caused by a sword.

346
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,514
What trouble has he encountered over the years?

347
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,142
I really don't know.

348
00:24:26,142 --> 00:24:28,919
Over the years, I have rarely met Bai Jue. We're not close.

349
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,042
Uncle, why did you never tell me about this?

350
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:34,618
I thought you didn't like to hear about this. What are you up to?

351
00:24:34,618 --> 00:24:38,113
Why are you more impatient than me every time you mentioned him?

352
00:24:38,114 --> 00:24:40,871
Does Bai Jue have some deep, dark secret?

353
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:42,728
Third Uncle, you're hiding something from us.

354
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:44,399
Do you often see Bai Jue secretly?

355
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,700
Third Uncle, you're nervous.

356
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,850
- Tian Qi. 
 - Third Uncle.

357
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,139
- Tian Qi. Tian Qi. 
 - Third Uncle.

358
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:50,371
- Tian Qi. 
 - Enough!

359
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:52,509
I know nothing about Bai Jue.

360
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,000
Leave me alone. I'm going into seclusion.

361
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:02,460
See?

362
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,979
Aunt, you're awesome.

363
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:05,118
Your small tricks...

364
00:25:05,118 --> 00:25:06,728
You invented them.

365
00:25:06,728 --> 00:25:08,038
As long as you know.

366
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:10,379
Let's go before it's late.

367
00:25:18,157 --> 00:25:20,814
Why were you fooled by them so easily?

368
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:22,970
What are you doing here again?

369
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:26,710
I brought a treasure for Yuan Qi.

370
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:34,240
You're not going to come here every day after Shang Gu is awake, are you?

371
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,627
Don't be fooled by them again.

372
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:39,499
Don't let them go out in public anymore.

373
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:42,157
I'll be really angry if you dare to come again next time.

374
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:44,942
You pretend to be the villain and you can't let them go.

375
00:25:44,942 --> 00:25:47,080
What exactly do you what?

376
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:52,928
Self-inflicted pain.

377
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:10,480
Okay.

378
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,919
Junior Brother.

379
00:26:17,985 --> 00:26:21,060
Shouldn't you be serving the Heavenly Queen and Princess Jing Zhao inside?

380
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,379
Why are you here?

381
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:24,242
Forget it.

382
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:26,000
It's our master's birthday party every 100 years.

383
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,780
They're eulogizing Princess Jing Zhao in there,

384
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,414
as if it's her birthday.

385
00:26:31,414 --> 00:26:34,285
It was suffocating so I came out for some air.

386
00:26:34,285 --> 00:26:36,585
Her Highness married into the Blue Dome of Heaven.

387
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:38,139
She isn't the one she used to be.

388
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,079
Come on. Junior Brother,

389
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,357
the wedding wasn't finished.

390
00:26:42,357 --> 00:26:46,142
Besides, Qingchi Palace ended up like that.

391
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:49,785
What Heavenly Queen and her daughter did is no different from robbery.

392
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:53,680
Heavenly Queen did many good things for the past 100 years.

393
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,339
Maybe she's changed,

394
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:57,739
or His Majesty wouldn't have let her out.

395
00:26:57,739 --> 00:27:00,814
Oh, please. She's arrogant.

396
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:04,670
His Majesty has always tried to run the realms well. He'd be scolded for being partial to his wife.

397
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:09,010
Immortal Xian Zhu,

398
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,400
Her Highness and Heavenly Queen went to enjoy the flowers in the back garden. She's thirsty.

399
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,419
Go and get some Jade Dew for Her Highness.

400
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,580
Well. Lordess Shao Yao,

401
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,840
it takes 100 years to get a pool of Jade Spring.

402
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,799
It's used by the apprentices to build their base. It's not for drinking.

403
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,499
What are you talking about?

404
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:29,239
Her Highness wants to drink that.

405
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,960
It means she values you.

406
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,780
Immortal Xian Zhu, Her Highness is here on behalf of Master Bai Jue.

407
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,399
If you snub her, it means you snub Master Bai Jue.

408
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
No. Well...

409
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,800
Lordess Shao Yao, I'm going to get it right now.

410
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,780
Please come with me.

411
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:56,919
Is that kid... really Bai Jue's son?

412
00:27:57,757 --> 00:28:00,640
Master Bai Jue never mentioned it,

413
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,010
but everyone can see

414
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,430
by looking at that kid's appearance.

415
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,139
After all, it's his son.

416
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:09,971
Why would he be so heartless?

417
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:11,940
I tested that kid's spiritual power.

418
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,585
It's normal.

419
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:15,514
Maybe he took after Hou Chi.

420
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:18,671
Perhaps Master Bai Jue felt embarrassed about that.

421
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,680
Besides...

422
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,257
Besides what?

423
00:28:25,257 --> 00:28:29,542
I gave lessons to him many times, but Master Bai Jue stays out of it.

424
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,840
Does he still miss Shang Gu?

425
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,385
It's been 100 years.

426
00:28:43,385 --> 00:28:46,299
Hou Chi failed to awaken and become Shang Gu.

427
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:51,400
Did he tell you about... the awakening of Shang Gu?

428
00:28:52,171 --> 00:28:53,500
He hasn't.

429
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,885
He owes Qingchi Palace a big favor.

430
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:58,250
And he was stabbed by Hou Chi.

431
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,820
I guess they're completely over.

432
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,000
Are they really over?

433
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,471
He never went back to Qingchi Palace again?

434
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:10,442
Mother God, I haven't noticed anything different.

435
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:12,614
Master Bai Jue isn't very good at words.

436
00:29:12,614 --> 00:29:17,040
Isn't his treatment of that kid the best evidence?

437
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,714
Zhao'er,

438
00:29:22,714 --> 00:29:25,019
you serve Master Bai Jue.

439
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:27,560
You must be more careful.

440
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,700
He's so cold to his son.

441
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,179
How could he always continue to indulge you?

442
00:29:36,885 --> 00:29:38,739
Mother God, don't worry.

443
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:41,139
Something happened to our wedding.

444
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:44,420
Now Master Bai Jue and I have an understanding.

445
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,399
He'll show me some respect before immortals.

446
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,142
Looks like the unfinished wedding... was good for you.

447
00:29:56,142 --> 00:30:01,199
Nowadays, I live happily instead of being cautious.

448
00:30:03,942 --> 00:30:07,857
Mother God, if you have any doubt, just tell me.

449
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,840
Zhao'er.

450
00:30:11,957 --> 00:30:13,680
It's been 100 years.

451
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:19,099
Do you still have feelings for Bai Jue or Qing Mu?

452
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:22,679
It wasn't meant to be between me and Qing Mu.

453
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:25,478
And Master Bai Jue doesn't love me.

454
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,900
Wouldn't it be humiliating if I still had affection for them?

455
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,539
I'm glad that you think that way.

456
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,556
Mother God, my Father God has forgiven you now.

457
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:49,210
From now on, we're the most respected lordesses within the three realms.

458
00:30:55,528 --> 00:31:00,180
We must depend on ourselves if we want to be the most respected lordesses

459
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:03,379
in the three realms.

460
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:12,779
Aunt, what's so fun about this place?

461
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,740
I've already been here. It's just a shabby house.

462
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,460
It's the place where I opened my spiritual veins.

463
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,119
 Relax. 

464
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:37,919
No matter how shabby it is, it's memorable.

465
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,140
A place of interest.

466
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,758
Forget it.

467
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:44,998
Your Father God always scolded me.

468
00:31:44,998 --> 00:31:47,357
He scolded you, but you still liked him.

469
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:48,999
I was young and ignorant.

470
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:51,440
I was obsessed with his appearance.

471
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,839
Oh, please.

472
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,398
It was 60,000 years ago.

473
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:59,599
What about him now?

474
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,278
Although a True God's face looks like that forever,

475
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,379
but the more I look at the way Bai Jue was in the Blue Dome of Heaven,

476
00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:10,227
the uglier I think he is.

477
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,950
I want to give him a good beating.

478
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,238
Yuan Qi, do you like being with me?

479
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,858
Of course, I like it.

480
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:26,099
Then promise me that you won't lie to me anymore in the future.

481
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:30,479
I haven't lied.

482
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:32,079
I've asked Feng Ran many times.

483
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:34,078
She said she didn't teach you to play poker.

484
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,560
She didn't fly a kite with you and fight for justice with you.

485
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,998
She just didn't admit it.

486
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,460
Anyway, I didn't lie.

487
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:43,800
Aunt.

488
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:49,271
Actually, I always go to the Blue Dome of Heaven alone.

489
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,638
Yuan Qi.

490
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,439
I didn't go there to see Bai Jue.

491
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:57,900
I wanted to mess with him

492
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,660
and make him feel uncomfortable with it.

493
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,959
Even if your father is a bastard,

494
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:05,460
you still have his blood flowing through you.

495
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,290
Then why doesn't he want you or me?

496
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,540
Why should I return good for evil?

497
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,513
Fine. Say no more.

498
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:16,410
The candied haws are melting. Eat them.

499
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,319
I'll treat Bai Jue the way he treats me now.

500
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:24,899
Yuan Qi,

501
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,978
you're a man. You should be generous.

502
00:33:28,978 --> 00:33:33,259
You can't throw your temper tantrum as you like. Understand?

503
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,679
I was wrong.

504
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,519
The more generous you are, the more despicable he will appear.

505
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,218
This will make him the laughing stock of the three realms.

506
00:33:42,218 --> 00:33:44,020
Really?

507
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,299
I'm always on your side.

508
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:50,839
Well, for your sake, I'll consider it.

509
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:53,778
As long as you're not naughty, I'll give you whatever you like.

510
00:33:53,778 --> 00:33:55,630
Then I want to listen to songs.

511
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,760
And a big meal.

512
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:02,359
Aunt, I'm going to go relieve myself.

513
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,942
Go ahead.

514
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:14,439
 ♫ Let me be the shadows and light in your eyes ♫ 

515
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:22,270
 ♫ I'm willing to search for thousands of days and nights ♫ 

516
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:28,250
 ♫ Waiting for the time to meet again in your eyes ♫ 

517
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,827
 ♫ Exchange a lifetime for a second of encounter ♫ 

518
00:34:33,827 --> 00:34:38,239
 ♫ It's not a pity to be able to accomplish it ♫ 

519
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:45,984
 ♫ I'm willing to indulge in the long passing years ♫ 

520
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:51,579
 ♫ Waiting for the teardrops to shed a smile ♫ 

521
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:58,579
 ♫ How lucky do I have to be to be allowed ♫ 

522
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:04,657
 ♫ to be trapped in your heart forever ♫ 

523
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:13,000
 ♫ Pursuing millions of miles for you ♫ 

524
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,456
This spiritual water is sweet and it comes with an aftertaste.

525
00:35:38,456 --> 00:35:42,300
It's used to build a foundation. Of course, it's full of spiritual power.

526
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,739
Don't tell Her Highness of what I just did.

527
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:47,760
Otherwise...

528
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,739
What... What are you doing?

529
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:58,939
What's wrong?

530
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:03,859
You can't drink much of it, and you can't pee in it.

531
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:09,650
I'm sorry. I thought it was a wild spring.

532
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,110
Where are you from?  How dare you pee in the spiritual spring?

533
00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:15,013
And where are you from?

534
00:36:15,013 --> 00:36:16,570
How dare you drink this spiritual water?

535
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:18,478
I'll give you a good lesson.

536
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:20,160
You're so mean.

537
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,660
Did it hurt you?

538
00:36:29,528 --> 00:36:32,080
I just got some spring water for my master.

539
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,718
Now I failed to do it. I'll be punished.

540
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:40,438
I'm sorry. I apologize.

541
00:36:40,438 --> 00:36:42,058
What's the use of you apologizing to me?

542
00:36:42,058 --> 00:36:44,978
It's all because of you. How could I not be angry?

543
00:36:44,978 --> 00:36:49,639
Then I'll go to ask your master to punish me. Okay?

544
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:50,878
Really?

545
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:53,079
My aunt said a man should be generous.

546
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,640
Show me the way.

547
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,813
Lordess Shao Yao, after all, he's a kid.

548
00:36:57,813 --> 00:36:59,784
What if Her Highness blames him?

549
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,200
I'll accept the consequence of my doing.

550
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:18,718
Your Highness, this kid peed in the spiritual spring, which ruined your refined and elegant interests.

551
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:22,238
He's just a kid, please punish him lightly.

552
00:37:22,238 --> 00:37:26,129
It's you. You're the bad woman who seduced my father.

553
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:32,660
Mother God, he's the son of that respected man.

554
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:39,739
How dare you undermine Her Highness?

555
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:43,439
You dare slap me. There will be hell to pay!

556
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,140
You're so arrogant at such a young age.

557
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,470
Aunt.

558
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,430
Don't worry. I'll defend you.

559
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,658
Wu Huan, it's been a while.

560
00:38:08,658 --> 00:38:10,613
There are so many people here with you.

561
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:15,900
I don't know how I should greet you in order to pay my respects to the Heavenly Queen.

562
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,879
 Too many eyes here. It's not the right time. 

563
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,819
 Wu Huan, you must calm down. 

564
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:26,570
Master Shang Gu, I'm Wu Huan.

565
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:30,119
- Master Shang Gu. 
  - Master Shang Gu. 

566
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,770
You have changed a lot.

567
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:34,910
I can hardly recognize you.

568
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:39,260
Wu Huan can stay here. The others may leave.

569
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,759
Mother God.

570
00:38:50,379 --> 00:38:53,099
Aunt, I don't want to go.

571
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,958
I just heard you dirtied the spiritual spring from Xian Shan.

572
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,560
It's your fault.

573
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,040
Go and apologize to Lord Dong Hua in person.

574
00:39:02,128 --> 00:39:03,679
Fine.

575
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,220
Go ahead.

576
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,740
Come on.

577
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,259
 Why is she still not talking? 

578
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:29,999
 Isn't she against me? 

579
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:35,300
Wu Huan, don't you have anything to tell me?

580
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:42,156
Master Shang Gu, I didn't know you slept in Hou Chi's body.

581
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:44,799
So, I said something inappropriate several times.

582
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,459
I'm willing to accept punishment.

583
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:50,956
Hou Chi? Who is that?

584
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:53,641
The three realms all changed when I woke up.

585
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,530
My memories are still from the Netherworld.

586
00:39:58,942 --> 00:40:00,884
The Netherworld?

587
00:40:00,884 --> 00:40:02,949
We haven't seen each other for years.

588
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,785
But you didn't greet me when you saw me.

589
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:11,013
I dare not. Master Shang Gu, you just woke up.

590
00:40:11,013 --> 00:40:14,984
Are you... all right?

591
00:40:14,984 --> 00:40:18,885
I'm full of spiritual power and the Power of Chaos.

592
00:40:20,914 --> 00:40:22,671
Forget it.

593
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:25,627
The friendship between us no longer exists.

594
00:40:25,627 --> 00:40:27,928
I'll talk about something else.

595
00:40:28,985 --> 00:40:33,613
For the past 60,000 years, were you the patriarch of the Phoenix Clan?

596
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,284
Master Shang Gu, there's something you don't know.

597
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:38,014
The God Realm was in chaos.

598
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:39,819
And the Phoenix Clan was in a panic.

599
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:42,627
Elder Feng Yun ordered me to be the patriarch.

600
00:40:42,627 --> 00:40:44,813
I couldn't hardly refuse it.

601
00:40:44,813 --> 00:40:46,485
I had to take it at a difficult moment.

602
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,779
The three realms all knew it.

603
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:51,760
If you don't believe it, you can ask other immortals.

604
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,399
Since you were the patriarch of the Phoenix Clan,

605
00:40:57,399 --> 00:41:00,320
why did you kill Wu Xi and Feng Yan in secret?

606
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:14,050


607
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:24,669
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

608
00:41:24,669 --> 00:41:31,579
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫

 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫
