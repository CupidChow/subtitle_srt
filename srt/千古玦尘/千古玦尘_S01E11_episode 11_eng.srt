1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:08,990


2
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,400
   

3
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,100
   

4
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,320
Master!

5
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,599
How dare you flee from the Netherworld

6
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,499
and incite the Qiong Qi to trespass into the God Realm?

7
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,179
You're courting your death.

8
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,639
Gu Jun welcomes Your Royal Highness back to the God Realm.

9
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,679
 Welcome, Master Shang Gu, back to the God Realm. 

10
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,499
I haven't seen you for 1,000 years,

11
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,399
how are you doing?

12
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:19,118
Today you acted heroically and commendably.

13
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:23,138
But I'm confused.  You were only guarding the gates of the Netherworld,

14
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:25,699
how did you learn of the news of the Qiong Qi rebellion?

15
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,839
Master, today, Her Royal Highness came out of the barrier,

16
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,099
I wanted to show my respect to her.

17
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,898
I just happened to see a demon sneaking out of the Netherworld.

18
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:37,138
I was worried that he had evil intentions, so I followed him.

19
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:38,979
Then I found the rebellion of the Qiong Qi.

20
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,399
After being exiled for 1,000 years,

21
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,259
it seems that you've learned a lot.

22
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,539
You should be rewarded today.

23
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,778
I shouldn't.

24
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:50,198
1,000 years ago, I was trapped by love and made the big mistake,

25
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:52,318
so what I have done today is to redeem my sins.

26
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:53,679
If you have mercy on me,

27
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,600
please let Xue Ying return to the God Realm.

28
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,370
I won't cause any trouble in the future.

29
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:00,849
Fine. The rewards and punishments should be separated clearly in the God Realm.

30
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,999
From now on, you can regain control of the four seasons

31
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:04,749
and resume your original position.

32
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:06,530
Thank you, Master.

33
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,228
That day I was cultivating in the God Slayer Flower field,

34
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:14,629
suddenly I was attacked by a group of demons.

35
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,689
A lot of swords attacked me,

36
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,809
giving me no chance to react.

37
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:22,469
During the fight, a demon general tried to sneak up on me

38
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,768
as I was knocked away by the demonic energy.

39
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,088
Fortunately, I quickly grabbed a branch.

40
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,968
Just as I was stabilizing myself, the branch broke.

41
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,549
Broke?

42
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,430
Did you get hurt?

43
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,250
It was strange that...

44
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,570
I was caught by an inexplicable power.

45
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,629
An inexplicable power?

46
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,579
More than that. A familiar voice has been ringing in my ears

47
00:08:56,698 --> 00:08:59,739
from time to time during the past 1,000 years.

48
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,075
 Shang Gu. 

49
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,878
He always gave me strength when I was most helpless.

50
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:21,599
I guess it was one of you

51
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:24,540
who secretly came to the Netherworld to help me cultivate.

52
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:29,699
Then, which one of us do you think it was?

53
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:37,400
It was you, Ice Cube Bai, right?

54
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,959
- Bai Jue. 
 - Maybe it was Heaven's will to get you out of danger.

55
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,338
Yes, Shang Gu.

56
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:47,759
Even the three of us can't break in through

57
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,539
the barrier you and the Demon King set outside the Netherworld.

58
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,939
But I saw the figure of that man.

59
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,440
Did you see Bai Jue?

60
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,658
Not only did I see Bai Jue,

61
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:06,739
but I also saw Zhi Yang, Wu Huan, Gu Jun, and Yue Mi.

62
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,580
That must be because you missed us so much.

63
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,919
Shang Gu, you have suffered a lot in the Netherworld for 1,000 years.

64
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:18,499
Although the Netherworld was torture, it was truly a blessing for me.

65
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,299
If without the 1,000 years of hard cultivation,

66
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:22,818
I'm afraid it would have been difficult for me to achieve my divine power.

67
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:27,878
Come on, let's drink together to congratulate Shang Gu's great success.

68
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,539
Why is it that not having seen you these years,

69
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,658
your drinking ability is worse than before?

70
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:39,338
I'm not good at drinking.

71
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,958
Ice Cube Bai, you are really disappointing.

72
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,879
Knowing that Shang Gu was coming back soon,

73
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,159
how could you injure your core spirit?

74
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:48,818
Did you injure your core spirit?

75
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:52,099
It's okay. I just cultivated too hard.

76
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,219
Shang Gu, now that you have refined the Power of Chaos,

77
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:58,980
you should take over as Chief God as soon as possible.

78
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,519
You just care about whether I can take over the Chief God.

79
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,058
Bai Jue, you're too eager.

80
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:08,499
We've been waiting for thousands of years,

81
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,158
not to mention these few days.

82
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:12,118
Shang Gu, you just get some rest.

83
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:13,818
Let's talk about that later.

84
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:14,898
Right.

85
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:17,538
Ice Cube, if you are not good at drinking,

86
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:19,379
just go back early to get some rest.

87
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:23,319
I know that the divine power of the Lower Realm is collapsing,

88
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:27,199
so you have been waiting for me for a long time.

89
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,199
I also have compassion for all beings.

90
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,898
Then I will follow the wishes of True God Bai Jue,

91
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,179
in half a month, I will take over as Chief God,

92
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:38,279
making that day to carry on the past and forge ahead into the future.

93
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,199
I have something to do. I'll leave now.

94
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:47,479
Bai Jue.

95
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,339
Fine. It's cold with him around.

96
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,439
Luckily, I have you two.

97
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:57,818
Tonight, we must enjoy ourselves.

98
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,378
- Cheers. 
 - Come on, cheers.

99
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,080
Master!

100
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,859
I'm fine.

101
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:31,999
Our Wu Huan makes the most comfortable bed.

102
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,939
And there is my favorite goddess incense.

103
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,640
I can finally have a good sleep tonight.

104
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:41,478
Your Royal Highness, you suffered so much in the Netherworld,

105
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:43,138
you have to have a good rest for a few days.

106
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,139
Let me take good care of you.

107
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,579
I'm not as hard as you.

108
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,859
These gods are used to praising the superior and trampling on the inferior.

109
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,599
I left in a hurry and your qualifications were shallow.

110
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:58,099
So you must have suffered a lot as taking charge of Pilgrim Hall these years.

111
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,039
No matter how hard it was, I didn't feel wronged.

112
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,258
Now that Your Royal Highness has refined the Power of Chaos and will take over as Chief God,

113
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:10,478
so our Pilgrim Hall will finally be the rightful first hall.

114
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:12,199
Don't say that.

115
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:14,059
Those are all my false words before.

116
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,798
Don't worry, since I'm back,

117
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:17,480
I'll definitely stand by you in the future.

118
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,379
In the future, you take a good rest and focus on your cultivation.

119
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,639
I see that your divine power is not as good as Mu Guang and Gu Jun.

120
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:31,619
Do you think that my divine power is too low

121
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,778
to be in charge of Pilgrim Hall for you?

122
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,739
Fool, what are you thinking?

123
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,539
Our God Realm always respects the stronger.

124
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,238
I see the descendants who have recently been promoted to the gods;

125
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,059
all of them are very powerful.

126
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,258
You take charge of the hall for me.

127
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,959
They respect you on the surface.

128
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,158
But if you don't improve your divine power,

129
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:52,379
you won't be able to convince them in the long run.

130
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,138
Besides Yue Mi and Gu Jun,

131
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,300
you are the closest to me.

132
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,318
I hope that even if you leave Pilgrim Hall in the future,

133
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:04,180
you can still become the ruler of one realm.

134
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,859
It's my fault.

135
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,558
You value me so much that

136
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:15,199
I will definitely live up to your expectations.

137
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,619
Okay.

138
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:19,839
You have been busy all day today, go back to rest.

139
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,380
Wu Huan's temperament should still be tempered in the future.

140
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,680
I've been missing you for 1,000 years,

141
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,220
but you?

142
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,759
Wu Huan, what are you thinking about?

143
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,520
Chief God has not returned for 1,000 years,

144
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,538
do you really think that you can stay in Pilgrim Hall forever?

145
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,399
False is false,

146
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,819
which can't be true forever.

147
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,400
   

148
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,839
Can you help me report to Master that Xue Ying wants to see him?

149
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,300
Master Bai Jue is no longer your master.

150
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,688
I had a master-disciple relationship with Master Bai Jue,

151
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,769
so I should visit him as I have returned to the God Realm.

152
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,799
Go back.

153
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,818
It's late at night, our master god has already gone to bed.

154
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:32,379
You'd better go back.

155
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:33,999
Hong Ri.

156
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,690
- Master. 
 - Master.

157
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,900
Nice to meet you.

158
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,848
I haven't seen you for many years,

159
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:47,149
you still have the same demeanor.

160
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,109
Since you have the ability to return to the God Realm,

161
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,369
you should work hard and never make trouble again.

162
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,408
Don't come here again.

163
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:58,669
I don't want to see you again.

164
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,169
Master! Master!

165
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,248
- Don't break in! 
 - Master!

166
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:09,149
You have no idea how hard I worked to get back to the God Realm.

167
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:10,709
Master!

168
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:13,089
Why are you still reluctant to look at me?

169
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,489
Master!

170
00:17:15,489 --> 00:17:17,248
- Master! 
 - Forget it. Forget it.

171
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:18,830
Master!

172
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,028
No matter how much you do,

173
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:26,229
Master just doesn't like you;

174
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:27,888
you are not the person in his heart.

175
00:17:27,888 --> 00:17:29,668
Don't do these things anymore.

176
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:32,928
If you keep doing this, even I will look down on you.

177
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:11,750
Cheers.

178
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:13,309
How about it?

179
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,150
Are you satisfied with this?

180
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,368
The Chief God of the three realms personally held the birthday banquet for me.

181
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:28,549
I have not lived in vain for tens of thousands of years.

182
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,508
This is your 100,000-year birthday.

183
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,079
If I don't make it a big one, I'm afraid that you'll be disappointed.

184
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,029
I can't be happier.

185
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,888
But when did you like such a big scene?

186
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:40,388
It's to give you face.

187
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:42,468
 So beautiful. Refined again. 

188
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:43,929
 Yes. 

189
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:47,570
Happy Birthday to the Goddess of Star and Moon.

190
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,649
You two are not slow,

191
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:52,549
even the baby is about to be born.

192
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:56,429
If it wasn't for the grace asked by Goddess Yue Mi,

193
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,628
we would not have been married.

194
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:01,029
- Thank you, Goddess. 
 - Your love is stronger than gold,

195
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:03,168
I just did it for a good reason.

196
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:05,329
Today is the birthday of the Goddess of Star and Moon,

197
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:08,810
so don't be formal and have fun.

198
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:13,909
I've brought you a birthday present from the Netherworld.

199
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,868
When they are gone, I will show you.

200
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:19,648
- What is it? 
 - I prepared it for three days.

201
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:23,768
Your birthday present must be the most precious thing in the world.

202
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:28,588
Shang Gu, thank you for holding my birthday banquet.

203
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:30,428
I also have a gift for you.

204
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:33,748
- What? 
 - Let's go, I'll take you to a place.

205
00:19:33,748 --> 00:19:38,328
Wu Huan, serve the guests well for your master and me.

206
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:40,670
Yes, Lordess Yue Mi.

207
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:42,690
Let's go.

208
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,749
It's so beautiful.

209
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:06,288
It's worthy of the name of the greatest Peach Woods in the God Realm.

210
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:11,768
So is this your gift for me?

211
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:13,108
If so?

212
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:15,548
I'm very happy with the gift you have given me,

213
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,429
and I like it very much.

214
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:21,728
When I saw the Goddess of Sun and Night,

215
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:26,319
it reminded me of the time when Pu Hua held a matchmaking event in my woods,

216
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:28,029
as if it just happened yesterday.

217
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,408
I can't believe it's been 1,000 years ago.

218
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:31,628
Do you remember that?

219
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:34,288
Why do you suddenly think of the matchmaking event?

220
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:35,628
Do you want to have a lover?

221
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:37,729
Pu Hua has gone to the Lower Realm for his ordeal,

222
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:41,668
when he returns, I will let him help you find your love.

223
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:45,768
I guess I can't wait for love to happen in my life.

224
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:49,349
You've only lived for tens of thousands of years, while a God's life is boundless,

225
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,288
so it's too early for you to say this.

226
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:54,309
What about you? Where is your love?

227
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,228
After 1,000 years of cultivation,

228
00:20:57,229 --> 00:21:00,589
do you still keep that Ice Cube in your heart?

229
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:05,089
In his heart, perhaps the beings of the three realms are far greater than personal feelings.

230
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:07,508
Rather than obsessing over him,

231
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:10,768
I'd rather look at the handsome men in this world.

232
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:12,549
Are you serious?

233
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,588
Of course not..

234
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:20,789
For 1,000 years, I've been cultivating so hard, just to become a person who can match him.

235
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:24,609
But I no longer want to worry about gains and losses all day long like before.

236
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:31,369
Shang Gu, I pulled you out because I have something to tell you.

237
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:35,149
What has made you become so serious?

238
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,100
In fact, in the past 1,000 years since you left,

239
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,309
I seldom saw Bai Jue in the God Realm.

240
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,508
He only appeared on some serious occasions.

241
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,528
But every time I saw him, I always felt that he looked bad,

242
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:47,209
as if he was weak.

243
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:48,549
Weak?

244
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,229
Did you see anything else?

245
00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:51,468
I didn't.

246
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:52,988
You also know his temperament.

247
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:56,030
He doesn't like to be close to people and likes being alone.

248
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,049
I don't dare to inquire.

249
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:02,629
But I think there must have been something strange about this.

250
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,009
 A familiar voice has been ringing in my earsfrom time to time for the past 1,000 years. 

251
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:12,408
 He always gave me strength when I was most helpless. 

252
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:14,930
 Return the origin to one, combine the force to break the three purifying states. 

253
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,809
 I guess it was one of you 

254
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:21,789
 who secretly came to the Netherworld to help me cultivate. 

255
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:26,629
 Maybe it was Heaven's will to get you out of danger. 

256
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,550
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

257
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,548
 If he helped me with the primordial spirit leaving the body and entering the Netherworld, 

258
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:40,509
 the source of his divine power will be extremely depleted. 

259
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,269
 Could it be… 

260
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,890
What are you thinking?

261
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,689

 these are the gadgets that everyone plays with as a child.

 Shang Gu. 

292
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:57,530
 Wasn't this kite broken? 

293
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,870
 Why is there another one? 

294
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:03,650
Your Royal Highness.

295
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,188
Hong Ri, tell me everything

296
00:25:08,188 --> 00:25:12,649
that has happened to your master over the past 1,000 years.

297
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,289
Okay.

298
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:52,189
Shang Gu,

299
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,850
how's it going?

300
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,369
Tell me.

301
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:01,508
I have an important thing to do.

302
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:03,309
What's the thing?

303
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,909
Punish him.

304
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:07,910
And...

305
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,049
marry him.

306
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:14,730
M-M-Marry him?

307
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,150
You mean that you're going to marry Bai Jue.

308
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,570
Is a betrothal gift generally required to marry someone?

309
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,520
Yes.

310
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:27,348
Even marrying an ordinary immortal requires many betrothal gifts.

311
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:30,448
He is a true god, then marrying him into Pilgrim Hall,

312
00:26:30,448 --> 00:26:33,689
of course, I should give all the treasures of the world to him.

313
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:37,029
Otherwise, how can I deserve his 1,000 years of waiting for me?

314
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,450
She hasn't changed after 1,000 years.

315
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,569
Wu Huan? Why are you here?

316
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:10,008
Where is Shang Gu?

317
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:13,948
Upper God Yue Mi, Her Royal Highness went to the Lower Realm a few days ago.

318
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:19,109
She told me to give this instruction feather to you in three days.

319
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,008
She has a lot of spooky ideas.

320
00:27:28,008 --> 00:27:32,670
Master, what's the matter with my master?

321
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,709
Nothing.

322
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:36,710
Don't worry. Your Royal Highness has a lot of ideas.

323
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,450
You take good care of Pilgrim Hall for her.

324
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,349
Is it that no matter what I do,

325
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:54,889
I can't keep up with you?

326
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,648
Master Bai Jue.

327
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:02,569
Master.

328
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:03,849
What happened?

329
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,649
Today, I was ordered to patrol the Lower Realm.

330
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:08,068
I didn't expect that there would be Qiong Qi in Nanhai City.

331
00:28:08,068 --> 00:28:10,869
I have fought with them, but I couldn't beat them at all.

332
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:12,168
Now it's in chaos.

333
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:15,108
Hong Ri, go ring the divine bell to summon the gods.

334
00:28:15,108 --> 00:28:16,208
Yes.

335
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:18,729
No, it's too late.

336
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:21,028
Shang Gu got the news and went down to the Lower Realm.

337
00:28:21,028 --> 00:28:24,509
How about this? I'll gather the gods. You go and help her.

338
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,808
Stop. With your poor power, you'll make trouble if you go.

339
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,829
Just keep guard at Abyss Hall.

340
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:35,328
Then I'll go to Chaos Hall and tell True God Zhi Yang.

341
00:28:35,328 --> 00:28:37,970
Don't go. I'll go.

342
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,269
Just several Qiong Qi, with Your Highness's divine power today,

343
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,450
you could crush them with a single sword.

344
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,849
Although my master has been a true god for more than hundreds of thousands of years,

345
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:55,750
he hasn't gotten smarter at all.

346
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,150
   

347
00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:17,788
 Strange, there is no aura of Qiong Qi here. 

348
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:19,509
 Have the beasts gone? 

349
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:25,428
 Heavenly wonders, wood carvings. Heavenly wonders, wood carvings. 

350
00:29:25,428 --> 00:29:28,028
Don't miss it.

351
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:30,489
Heavenly wonders, wood carvings.

352
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:31,689
Come and have a look.

353
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:33,868
Our shop is superb in craftsmanship.

354
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:36,070
The immortal that runs to the moon, and the dragon that holds the sea.

355
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,529
We have all of them here.

356
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:41,688
If anyone's wood carving is better than ours,

357
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:44,189
I'm willing to buy it out at three times the price.

358
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,648
I never break my promise.

359
00:29:45,648 --> 00:29:48,809
Immortal, you've been shouting in our Nanhai City for three days,

360
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:51,309
and have searched all the good things in this city.

361
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,509
Why don't you leave yet?

362
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:55,448
This god, I've only won a few treasures here.

363
00:29:55,488 --> 00:29:58,288
Nanhai City is the most famous territory in our God Realm,

364
00:29:58,288 --> 00:30:00,029
so I think the heritage players

365
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,008
won't be reluctant to give up a few wood carvings, right?

366
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,648
You're really good at talking.

367
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:08,249
Today, I brought my family's ancestral wood carving,

368
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:10,508
- Family's ancestral wood carving. 
 - Can it compare to yours?

369
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,268
It is good.

370
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,288
This craft.

371
00:30:13,288 --> 00:30:15,569
It looks good. It's truly great.

372
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:17,028
Why did you lie to bring me to the Lower Realm?

373
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:18,449
Why are you here, Ice Cube Bai?

374
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,288
The turmoil of Qiong Qi mentioned by Yue Mi is not true.

375
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:22,108
The turmoil of Qiong Qi?

376
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:23,788
What are you talking about?

377
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:27,528
I'm about to be a Chief God, so I'm here for fun for a few days.

378
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:30,408
Did you also find an excuse to play in the Lower Realm?

379
00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:32,849
What a coincidence that we met in such a place.

380
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:35,188
It's fate. Let's play together.

381
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:37,369
Nonsense. Let's go.

382
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,829
Don't do that.

383
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:40,248
Not leaving yet?

384
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:41,488
Do you know each other or not?

385
00:30:41,488 --> 00:30:42,408
- Yes. 
  - Right. 

386
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:44,508
Do you know each other?

387
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:47,469
Everyone, 1,000 years ago,

388
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:50,089
I studied with him and unexpectedly fell in love with him.

389
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,148
But I didn't know how to confess,

390
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:55,508
so I threw my whole heart to him.

391
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:59,328
As a result, he pushed me away decisively for various reasons.

392
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,649
I was so hurt that I decided to forget him and traveled for 1,000 years.

393
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:05,808
Guess what!  Now he regrets, and comes to me,

394
00:31:05,808 --> 00:31:07,509
pestering me all the time.

395
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:11,248
But I don't know if I should forgive him.

396
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:12,629
What should I do?

397
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:15,268
Immortal, a good horse doesn't eat grass, so ignore him.

398
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:17,788
 Right, ignore him! 

399
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:21,989
But I see that this god still loves this immortal.

400
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:26,028
I had vowed countless times

401
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:27,949
to decide not to reconcile with him.

402
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,488
But as soon as I saw him,

403
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:32,469
the feelings in my heart were aroused by him again.

404
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:34,428
He likes wood carvings,

405
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:38,049
so I want to collect all the works in the three realms for him.

406
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:41,868
Why am I so devoted to him?

407
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,700
He's gone too far and doesn't cherish sweet love.

408
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,788
It's a pity to miss it.

409
00:31:47,788 --> 00:31:49,790
Right!

410
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,829
- Be together. 
 - Right.

411
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:55,730
 - Be together. 
 - Be together. 

412
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,780
   

413
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,128
I didn't expect that True God Bai Jue would be so embarrassed one day.

414
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:11,709
How about it? It's uncomfortable to be misunderstood, right?

415
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:15,428
It's so uncomfortable, but someone is willing to endure it for 1,000 years.

416
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:18,190
Do you think this person deserves it?

417
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:23,050
I didn't push you away mercilessly, let alone pester you.

418
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,588
It's from a new story script I read, did you put yourself into it?

419
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,088
This is the relief of East Wilderness, and these are root carvings of Qing Qiu.

420
00:32:32,088 --> 00:32:37,009
Shang Gu, you will soon take over the position of Chief God, so you should not be so idle.

421
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:38,188
Idle?

422
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:40,650
1,000 years ago, there was a man who was even more idle than me.

423
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,088
His whereabouts were mysterious and unpredictable.

424
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,668
There's no one else here,

425
00:32:47,668 --> 00:32:50,890
you can say whatever you want.

426
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,569
He just doesn't like to socialize.

427
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:55,949
Doesn't like socializing, or being close to people?

428
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:59,408
Then, what do you think the man should do?

429
00:32:59,408 --> 00:33:01,830
I think...

430
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,349
 ♫ Time is like you ♫ 

431
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:08,750
 ♫ Disturbing my feelings and thoughts ♫ 

432
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,449
 ♫ I hold your warm hands tightly ♫ 

433
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:16,949
 ♫ The meteor is shining in the sky ♫ 

434
00:33:16,949 --> 00:33:22,689
 ♫ I can never forget the memories of you ♫ 

435
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:24,429
 ♫ I cherish the time to be with you ♫ 

436
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,710
...he should behave like this.

437
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:33,549
 ♫ It's still vivid for me ♫ 

438
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,709
Does this Qilin look like Hong Ri?

439
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:38,168
Yes.

440
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:40,210
Not only this one,

441
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,388
but also the root carvings all over the room are for you.

442
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:46,870
Would you like to be my man?

443
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,689
 ♫ Listen ♫ 

444
00:33:51,689 --> 00:33:54,010
What did you say?

445
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,919
I used to think that what you valued more than your feelings for me

446
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:59,049
was my position as the Chief God

447
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:01,368
and my ability to assume the responsibilities of the three realms.

448
00:34:01,368 --> 00:34:03,408
It seems that every day you used to accompany me

449
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,729
was to let me take over as Chief God.

450
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:06,888
Shang Gu.

451
00:34:06,888 --> 00:34:11,248
For example, you opened the divine veins for me to increase my strength.

452
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:14,449
And attributed the credit of sealing the demon, Xuan Yi.

453
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:17,348
You also helped me subdue the Phoenix Clan and accept Gu Jun

454
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:19,688
to quell the god's doubts about me.

455
00:34:19,688 --> 00:34:24,308
You wanting me to go to the Netherworld for 1,000 years was to let me advance

456
00:34:24,308 --> 00:34:27,208
to deal with the collapsing of the power of chaos in the three realms.

457
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:32,469
Shang Gu, as Chief God of Chaos, it's your duty to succeed the throne.

458
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:36,059
One day late in your succession, there will be one more day of danger in the Lower Realm.

459
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:38,868
I know that the three realms are my duty,

460
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,959
but I am afraid that after I become Chief God,

461
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:43,769
it'll be more difficult for you to say how you feel about me.

462
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,008
You will put the duties of Chief God first,

463
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:48,909
and nothing else matters.

464
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:52,990
In fact, in my heart, I just want you to be safe.

465
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:57,389
I don't want to hear that. Do you still remember that set of actions just now?

466
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,349
 ♫ When I meet you ♫ 

467
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:08,500
 ♫ I hope we can be together forever ♫ 

468
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,740
 ♫ When we meet again ♫ 

469
00:35:10,749 --> 00:35:17,149
 ♫ I'll travel with you without hesitation ♫ 

470
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,400
 ♫ Feel each other ♫ 

471
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:26,850
 ♫ Approach and chat ♫ 

472
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:33,909
Tonight is the Magpie Festival, it should be quite lively outside.

473
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:36,050
Would you like to go out with me?

474
00:35:41,249 --> 00:35:44,849
It's uncomfortable being tugged back and forth, right?

475
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:48,208
But how can you know the joy of fish if you are not the fish?

476
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:08,689
 Yes. 

477
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:11,349
 - So beautiful. 
 - Yes. 

478
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:15,469
Didn't you like peach wine best?

479
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,828
I'm used to eating ordinary food in the Netherworld,

480
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:20,969
and I don't like these sweet things anymore.

481
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:26,409
Come on, let's go over there.

482
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:35,089
Would you like to buy your sister the latest rabbit lamp?

483
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:37,780
How do you do business?

484
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,529
You should say that we are perfect for each other

485
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:41,609
and we should buy a pair of mandarin duck lamps.

486
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:44,349
Don't lie to me, little immortal.

487
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:46,609
I've seen all kinds of immortals.

488
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:49,108
You two don't look like lovers.

489
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:50,868
Why?

490
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:55,109
You don't look like a pair of lovers from such a distance.

491
00:37:00,029 --> 00:37:02,170
- I'll buy them all. 
 - Okay.

492
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,390
Which one do you like?

493
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,649
I don't like these.

494
00:37:06,649 --> 00:37:10,408
You don't like these, but you must like this.

495
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,010
Why do you have this kite?

496
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,750
Take a guess.

497
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:30,388
What's this?

498
00:37:30,388 --> 00:37:31,549
You don't even know this.

499
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:36,428
Immortals write the name of their beloved on the lanterns, and put the lanterns into the water,

500
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:40,229
and then sincerely pray to the gods, to give them a lifetime of love,

501
00:37:40,229 --> 00:37:42,470
so they will get what they want.

502
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,288
But Pu Hua is still on the path of reincarnation, what is the use of writing these?

503
00:37:47,288 --> 00:37:50,249
If you keep talking nonsense, I'll throw your kite into the water.

504
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,588
How did you get this kite?

505
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:55,069
More than the kite,

506
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:58,208
I don't know who hid all my favorite toys and letters

507
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:01,209
in his study for 1,000 years.

508
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:03,528
Why does this person keep my things in such a way

509
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:05,729
and treat them as treasures?

510
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,609
What are you trying to say?

511
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:15,208
I want to say what I wanted to say 1,000 years ago.

512
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:20,090
In Peach Woods and Observation Mountain, I just wanted to say...

513
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,369
Bai Jue, I…

514
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,009
Who's there? You've ruined my good thing.

515
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,869
Your Royal Highness.

516
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:42,228
I didn't know you and True God Bai Jue were coming to the Lower Realm,

517
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:44,309
sorry for the delay in welcoming you.

518
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:47,528
I am the God of Water.

519
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:49,810
I didn't call you out.

520
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:54,048
Just now, I received a lantern from you,

521
00:38:54,048 --> 00:38:56,728
and on it was written…

522
00:38:56,728 --> 00:38:59,109
- Bai… 
 - Shut up!

523
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:05,270
I must have written it too quickly and didn't write it clearly.

524
00:39:06,729 --> 00:39:09,710
You didn't see it clearly in the dark, right?

525
00:39:15,149 --> 00:39:17,479
What did he want to say? And what was written on the lantern?

526
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:19,628
It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter.

527
00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:22,310
I arranged a lot of things to play.

528
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:26,789
 Qiong Qi! The Qiong Qi are here. 

529
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:28,710
 Qiong Qi! 

530
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,249
 Let's go, hurry up! 

531
00:39:32,249 --> 00:39:33,828
There is really a Qiong Qi commotion.

532
00:39:33,828 --> 00:39:36,049
It seems that the seal of the Demon Realm has been broken,

533
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,388
so that the Qiong Qi can come out to cause troubles from time to time.

534
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:41,149
Mu Guang and Gu Jun just came back from the wilderness,

535
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:43,269
how can it happen again?

536
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:46,070
Everything will be clear when we find out the truth.

537
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,949
You quickly go and report to Master Zhi Yang,

538
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:50,568
telling him that we are here to suppress the Qiong Qi turmoil.

539
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:53,629
Ask Tian Qi and Master Zhi Yang to check the seal of the Demon Realm

540
00:39:53,629 --> 00:39:56,188
and find out what is going on in the Demon Realm.

541
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:57,750
Yes.

542
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,289
Your body hasn't recovered yet. Let me do it.

543
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:06,189
It doesn't matter. We must kill the Qiong Qi here.

544
00:40:06,189 --> 00:40:09,749
If we let one go, there will be a great disaster in the God Realm.

545
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:13,619
The natural chaotic aura is already thin,

546
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,029
so it is not suitable to use divine power.

547
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:17,829
If you and I take action now, this place will become ruins.

548
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:19,149
Then, what should we do?

549
00:40:19,149 --> 00:40:21,069
Do you remember the sword skill I taught you on Observation Mountain?

550
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:22,668
You mean use the power of the Emperor Sword.

551
00:40:22,668 --> 00:40:27,789
Yes. The Emperor Sword is one of the four divine weapons, plus your origin power.

552
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:31,769
I think the Aura of Chaos within it is enough to kill the Qiong Qi.

553
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:33,270
Okay.

554
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:20,050


555
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:28,789
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

556
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:35,569
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

557
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:42,089
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

558
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:48,249
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

559
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:55,049
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

560
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:01,410
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

561
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:08,829
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

562
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:15,290
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

563
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:34,029
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

564
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:40,409
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

565
00:42:40,409 --> 00:42:47,689
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

566
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:54,890
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

567
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:02,769
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

568
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:09,649
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

569
00:43:09,649 --> 00:43:16,129
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

570
00:43:16,129 --> 00:43:22,629
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

571
00:43:22,629 --> 00:43:32,450
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
