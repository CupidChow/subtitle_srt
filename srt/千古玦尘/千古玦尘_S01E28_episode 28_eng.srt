1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,100


2
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:21,400
   

3
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,200
   

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,180
It's impossible.

5
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,380
Absolutely impossible!

6
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:37,108
Hou Chi.

7
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,519
How is she?

8
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,918
Don't worry.

9
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,248
Pilgrim Hall has taken Hou Chi as its master.

10
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:50,048
All spiritual power has been passed on to her.

11
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:53,958
Refining these spiritual powers can be as short as a few days or more than a few years.

12
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,340
You may take her down to rest.

13
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:02,134
Pilgrim Hall has taken her as master?

14
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:03,708
That's impossible.

15
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,230
We've all seen it.

16
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,549
Hou Chi cultivated the spiritual power of Pilgrim Hall.

17
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,549
It can't be faked.

18
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,509
Pilgrim Hall is the treasure of the immortals.

19
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:14,709
I can't have others take it!

20
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,249
Gu Jun is Master Shang Gu's disciple.

21
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:28,009
Pilgrim Hall should have been hers if it hadn't fallen accidentally into the Heavenly Palace.

22
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:33,348
Wu Huan, tens of thousands of years ago, we were embarrassed of Gu Jun.

23
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:35,248
And Hou Chi, too.

24
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,508
Let's compensate them with Pilgrim Hall.

25
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,869
For old-time sake.

26
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,729
Where is Qing Mu?

27
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:49,768
Father God, Qing Mu is in Purple Pine Hall.

28
00:03:49,768 --> 00:03:52,329
Shall we head there?

29
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,229
Your Highness,

30
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,309
if His Majesty knows that you let Lord of the North Sea die...

31
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,389
And today the light is bright.

32
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,869
No matter what ability Qing Mu has, he's already dead and gone.

33
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:13,869
What's done is done.

34
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,490
What could His Majesty do?

35
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,090
Yes, Your Highness.

36
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,110
Father God, this way.

37
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:31,250
What...

38
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:34,728
Strange.

39
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:37,789
The last time I checked on him, he still had low spiritual power and his muscles and veins were in a disarray.

40
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:39,909
Why has he recovered so soon?

41
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,909
Zhao'er? Nonsense!

42
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,149
Mother God.

43
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,608
I am in love with Qing Mu.

44
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:09,110
I couldn't let him die.

45
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,009
Mother God, please talk to Father God.

46
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:19,109
Don't blame me, please.

47
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,549
Zhao'er, don't you know that the Dragon Elixir contains all your cultivation?

48
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:26,909
Without it, you're just an ordinary mortal.

49
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,149
You are always so proud.

50
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,849
Don't you know that you can't make such decisions on your own for such a big matter?

51
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:36,989
Do you have any idea that it could kill you easily?

52
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:39,809
Zhao'er, this is serious.

53
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:44,229
Dragon Elixir is your internal alchemy. It stores your lifelong cultivation.

54
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,509
Without it, you can't be an Upper God.

55
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,628
It is a cure for all poisons.

56
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,000
But you shouldn't have given it out so easily like this.

57
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,468
Yang'er, help your younger sister up.

58
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,349
She's weak.

59
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:01,228
Zhao'er.

60
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:02,909
Don't.

61
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:07,128
Zhao'er, there are thousands of men in this world.

62
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:08,888
Why does it have to be him?

63
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:12,710
I've loved him for so many years.

64
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,028
I can't extricate myself.

65
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:17,588
But you could have waited for Father God to save him.

66
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,489
Why did you do this?

67
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,689
It's more than love.

68
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:23,789
You're forcing him...

69
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:27,650
He'd rather die...

70
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,688
than marry me.

71
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:33,669
I'm lighter than a feather in his heart.

72
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:37,509
I'm not qualified to force him.

73
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:40,428
Zhao'er, it's just a man.

74
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,508
Someone who doesn't cherish you.

75
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,468
No matter how you like him,

76
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:47,188
you shouldn't save him at the risk of your life!

77
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:52,289
This is the only way I can make him remember me forever.

78
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,830
I can't let him go.

79
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,169
Even if he chooses Hou Chi over me,

80
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,989
with my Dragon Elixir in him,

81
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,808
he will never forget me, he can't escape me.

82
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:09,368
Zhao'er, that's not what love is.

83
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:12,128
Just listen to me. Let him go and move on.

84
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:14,849
It's for your own good.

85
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:16,909
Let go?

86
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:23,190
If I can't have him,

87
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,430
no one else is allowed to have him.

88
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:33,429
Jing Yang, put your third sister in the Lock Immortal Tower for me.

89
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:35,908
Don't release her without my permission!

90
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:38,909
Your Majesty, she's too weak now.

91
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,189
How can she stand it?

92
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:43,710
It's all her own doing!

93
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,389
Father God, she wasn't thinking correctly.

94
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:50,349
With her body this weak,

95
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,770
it might take her life.

96
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,809
Life?

97
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,669
How much effort did I and your mother god spend on her?

98
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:04,460
The outcome today is her own fault.

99
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:09,069
Father God.

100
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:13,249
I only love Qing Mu.

101
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:15,489
If Father God still disagrees,

102
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:19,549
I'd rather have you take my life.

103
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,390
Jing Zhao!

104
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:27,188
Get out.

105
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:29,869
I don't want to see you.

106
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,489
Get out!

107
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:33,390
Father God...

108
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,909
- Zhao'er. 
 - Father God.

109
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,130
Father God!

110
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,069
Zhao'er used to be so obedient.

111
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,350
Why did she end up like this?

112
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:10,449
She's grown up. She has her own thoughts now.

113
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,668
Still, as parents, we ought to make plans for them.

114
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:19,850
The priority now is her health.

115
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,969
Without the Dragon Elixir, she cannot cultivate.

116
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:29,748
How can the body of a mortal bear the spiritual power of immortals?

117
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:32,809
Of course, I know.

118
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:35,669
What else can we do?

119
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,769
A'Huan, you could have saved Qing Mu.

120
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:49,149
Why didn't you help?

121
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:53,829
If you had saved him, Zhao'er wouldn't have ended up this way.

122
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:02,708
About Qing Mu, he rejected the marriage in front of the immortals.

123
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,169
I wanted to teach him a lesson.

124
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,790
How could I really leave him alone?

125
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:13,408
But I didn't expect that Zhao'er would be so deeply in love with him.

126
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:17,049
She even gave up her Dragon Elixir.

127
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,208
If True God were still with us,

128
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,568
my girl might be saved.

129
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:24,290
It's a pity...

130
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:29,848
Your Majesty, however hard it is, we must try.

131
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:32,428
We can't let Qing Mu leave the Heavenly Palace now.

132
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:38,189
It's not too late to let him go when we think of a way to save Jing Zhao.

133
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,230
That's the only option.

134
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,909
Qing Mu...

135
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,108
Hou Chi, are you okay?

136
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:57,129
You're awake.

137
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:08,469
I thought I'd never see you again.

138
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,628
Don't cry. I'm fine, aren't I?

139
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:13,108
I'm right in front of you.

140
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:16,268
Take a look. Not one hair is missing.

141
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,990
Now in Qingchi Palace, you're Upper God Hou Chi.

142
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,450
Resounding the Heavenly Palace.

143
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,850
It makes people cry and laugh when they see you.

144
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,189
Don't let others see you like this.

145
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:35,089
How's the wound on your chest?

146
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,528
It doesn't hurt.

147
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:40,768
I've recovered. You're the cure to everything.

148
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,289
There doesn't seems to be any Dragon's Breath residing in your body.

149
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:53,070
Besides that, your spiritual power is stronger.

150
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,629
I know. A blessing in disguise.

151
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:57,308
Thankfully, the king arrived just in time.

152
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:59,770
He saved my life.

153
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,030
There's more.

154
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,930
Jing Jian and Feng Ran also helped.

155
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,209
Be sure to pick some high-quality spiritual materials from Chang Que

156
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,970
and you must send them to Heavenly Palace in person.

157
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,330
I have to thank them.

158
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,110
It's just that I have to stay here for a few days.

159
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,110
There's a birthday banquet.

160
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,930
Birthday banquet?

161
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,090
I owe it to the Heavenly Palace for saving me from the Dragon's Breath.

162
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,008
I promised Jing Jian that I'd leave after the banquet.

163
00:12:28,109 --> 00:12:29,548
First, you rejected the marriage in public.

164
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,589
Then, you broke into Fu Yao Hall at night.

165
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,668
Now, there's the incident with Pilgrim Hall.

166
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,988
His Majesty was still willing to help you out.

167
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,589
We should attend the banquet to express our gratitude.

168
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,529
You can't go there.

169
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,029
Why? His Majesty invited me when I was on Observation Mountain.

170
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,290
Why can't I go there?

171
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,790
I don't want you to do things that make you unhappy.

172
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,449
- But... 
 - All right. No "buts".

173
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:55,009
You just absorbed the Spiritual Power of Pilgrim Hall.

174
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,949
The priority now is for you to rest.

175
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,088
Once your power is stable, wait for me at Qingchi Palace.

176
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,909
I'll make you some herb soup.

177
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:19,849
 Mother God. 

178
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:22,150
 Qing Mu is my close friend. 

179
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,549
 Feng Ran... 

180
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:31,169
 Feng Ran is the girl I love. 

181
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:34,288
 Today, I cannot give in. 

182
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:52,290
- Your Highness. 
 - Lordess Feng Ran.

183
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,269
We need to talk.

184
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,750
Sit down, please.

185
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,889
- Yester... 
 - Yesterday...

186
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:10,730
After you.

187
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,229
Well...

188
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,990
Yesterday...

189
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,490
I know you said that to deal with the problem.

190
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,409
You said that to save me.

191
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:22,670
Don't worry. I will not bother you.

192
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,568
Your Highness is young and promising; the pride of the Heavenly Palace.

193
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:28,290
Your reputation matters the most.

194
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,589
Once Hou Chi and I return to Qingchi Palace,

195
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,308
I will not bother you anymore.

196
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:34,768
- But... 
 - Don't worry.

197
00:14:34,768 --> 00:14:38,549
The crowd may talk about us. But as time goes by, they'll forget.

198
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:41,649
You can still pursue whoever you love.

199
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,690
I was thinking too much then.

200
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,308
But... from now on,

201
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:01,130
I will never anger you again because of Jing Yang.

202
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:21,609
This is lucid ganoderma from Buzhou Mountain.

203
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:23,469
Also, these gifts.

204
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,050
I'll send them to the princess now.

205
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,969
It's my fault.

206
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,449
I spoiled Zhao'er too much.

207
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:35,929
This time, she will learn the hard way.

208
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,428
His Majesty has given the order.

209
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:43,529
Qing Mu must not leave the palace.

210
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:45,949
He will definitely deal with him.

211
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,349
I know you must be worried about Third Princess.

212
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,389
But your health matters.

213
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,029
If only it was that easy.

214
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,409
It might be easy to reforge the Dragon Elixir.

215
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:57,729
But she'll start over as a mortal.

216
00:15:57,729 --> 00:16:02,749
It will take tens of thousands of years.

217
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:05,309
After what they've done,

218
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:07,490
they must not be spared.

219
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,949
Feng Nv.

220
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:15,150
Do you think Hou Chi and Gu Jun look alike?

221
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:20,649
Your Highness, Upper God Hou Chi is willful and righteous.

222
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:23,370
She is quite similar to Upper God Gu Jun.

223
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,389
But Gu Jun is charming and elegant.

224
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,350
It's hard to forget.

225
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,570
Judging from his appearance,

226
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,050
Upper God Hou Chi seems ordinary.

227
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:41,729
 Hou Chi, at your service. 

228
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:43,470
 Shang Gu? 

229
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,670
 No way. She may look like Shang Gu, 

230
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,889
 but her character is very different from her. 

231
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:57,450
This fact is too coincidental.

232
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,430
Maybe Upper God Hou Chi resembles her biological mother.

233
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,690
With such low power, her mom might be a mortal.

234
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,470
Who knows who her real mom is?

235
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:14,209
 The queen and I have a daughter named Hou Chi. 

236
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,809
 What... 

237
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,489
 Even Upper Gods are bothered by love. 

238
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,589
It's not that the King of Heaven is ashamed of him, he just couldn't take him.

239
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:33,068
So he asked me to be the mother of that egg in front of the immortals.

240
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:36,089
That way, she could have a noble status.

241
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,310
Gu Jun is a Flood Dragon.

242
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,110
If Hou Chi is his daughter,

243
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:50,389
then we can retrieve Zhao'er's Dragon Elixir.

244
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:53,089
Are you saying...

245
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,300
Feng Nv, do you remember that

246
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,989
the forbidden area in Qingchi Palace, Huajing Pond?

247
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,568
No one except for Gu Jun is allowed to enter.

248
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:05,908
I do.

249
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:08,188
I remember one time when I accompanied you to enjoy the flowers in the garden.

250
00:18:08,189 --> 00:18:09,850
When we accidentally approached the pond,

251
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,890
Upper God Gu Jun got mad at us.

252
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:18,310
I'm guessing that palace is hiding the secret of Houchi's biological mother.

253
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:22,009
Otherwise, why would Gu Jun make it a forbidden area?

254
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:26,188
Maybe, it wasn't me who cheated in that relationship.

255
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,489
Feng Nv.

256
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:31,610
Before Gu Jun returns,

257
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,450
go check it out for me.

258
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,929
Yes, Your Highness.

259
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,289
Why are you looking at me that way?

260
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:57,430
Of course, because you're beautiful.

261
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,310
But this is not the first time we have met.

262
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,989
Why haven't you praised me like that before?

263
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:11,249
I must apologize for not having praised you earlier.

264
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:15,109
From now on, I'll praise you three times a day.

265
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:16,709
20,000 years in a row.

266
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,809
Will that make it even?

267
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:23,029
From now on, I'll beat you three times every day.

268
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,009
That way, we're even.

269
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,210
Are you faking it or not?

270
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,209
When you hit me in the past, I had the power and strength of a king.

271
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,148
But now, we're on the same level.

272
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:39,150
Of course, it's different.

273
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:42,750
Let me take a look.

274
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,490
Take a look.

275
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:52,289
How dare you deceive me with such tricks!

276
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:54,009
That's because you have me in your heart,

277
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,730
that is how I succeeded.

278
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,469
Don't speak.

279
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:07,890
Just let me hold you like this for a while.

280
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:13,569
I thought I couldn't save you.

281
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,629
Am I not fine right now?

282
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:23,400
I didn't realize until then that in my heart I love you very much.

283
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:28,570
We weren't born at the same time.

284
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,409
But I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

285
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:36,209
Just like the mortals in the storybooks.

286
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:38,850
Hou Chi,

287
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,189
if I were to become a mortal, what would happen then?

288
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:45,369
I'd abandon all my cultivation and become a mortal with you.

289
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,669
Even if we could only live a hundred years.

290
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:49,828
What hundred years?

291
00:20:49,828 --> 00:20:55,010
If there is no you in this world, even if I live for thousands of years,

292
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:59,090
becoming a god is meaningless.

293
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,529
In this vast world,

294
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:05,028
time is meaningless without you by my side.

295
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,610
 ♫ ...The small talk ♫ 

296
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,420
 ♫ Such good times and beautiful scenery ♫ 

297
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,730
 ♫ May you stay by my side ♫ 

298
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,710
I promise.

299
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,449
Life and death will depend upon us, you and I will never be separated.

300
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,109
Spit it out. When will you return the Dragon Elixir to Zhao'er?

301
00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:00,429
If you don't tell me, I'll kill you now and take it out.

302
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:04,750
Brother, you can't solve the problem by doing this.

303
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,428
Why are you helping an outsider?

304
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:12,469
He ruined Zhao'er's entire life!

305
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,610
Your Highness, the queen's birthday is approaching.

306
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,268
I promise I will have an explanation for the Heavenly Palace by then.

307
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,109
This is what you said.

308
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:21,090
If I can't give it back to you that day,

309
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,869
I will pay for it with my lifelong cultivation.

310
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,550
There is no need for Your Highness (to kill me).

311
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,869
If you take back your words, don't think I wouldn't dare kill you!

312
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:35,849
It's all my fault that I could only think of the Upper God's power to cure the Dragon's Breath.

313
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:39,230
I forgot that the Dragon Elixir could cure the poison.

314
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,349
Before Zhao'er entered your room,

315
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:43,509
she told me Mother God had gone to Pilgrim Hall.

316
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,568
I thought Mother God would give Feng Ran a hard time,

317
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:46,908
so I panicked and rushed away.

318
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:49,929
However, what I did hurt her.

319
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,129
And you, too.

320
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:54,889
Jing Jian, it's not your fault.

321
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:57,410
I asked you here to ask about Lord Dong Hua.

322
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,169
Maybe he'll know of another way.

323
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,969
Hou Chi,

324
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:14,129
you've been staring at the checkerboard for a long time.

325
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:16,330
What are you thinking about?

326
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,370
I can't hide anything from you.

327
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,988
Feng Ran, from what I read, the layout of Fu Yao Hall

328
00:23:22,988 --> 00:23:25,188
is similar to Pilgrim Hall.

329
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:28,570
Does the queen and Pilgrim Hall have any connection?

330
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,509
The thing is the queen is from Pilgrim Hall.

331
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:34,169
So, she runs the Heavenly Palace the same way as she did in the God Realm.

332
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:36,009
That's to say,

333
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:38,548
the queen knows True God Shang Gu.

334
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:41,929
True God Shang Gu? Why do you care about her?

335
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:45,009
When absorbing the power of Pilgrim Hall, I saw True God Shang Gu.

336
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:47,129
She looks just like me.

337
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:50,889
How is that possible? So, where did you see her?

338
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,450
No idea. I haven't been there.

339
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,710
It's not in the Immortal Realm, nor the Demon Realm.

340
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,308
Not in the Human Realm, either.

341
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:01,249
The God Realm?

342
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:02,690
Maybe.

343
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,909
But it's been sealed for 60,000 years.

344
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,589
Maybe it was just a dream.

345
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,009
I don't know what is wrong,

346
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:16,889
I've been a mess lately.

347
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,709
Maybe it's because there is excess spiritual energy in your body.

348
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,369
You need some rest.

349
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:24,030
Lord Demon Zi Yue says, there's a seal in me.

350
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:29,289
Once it's broken, I'll no longer be me.

351
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:31,090
What? I didn't get it.

352
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,769
You are who you are.

353
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:36,050
What is Jing Yuan talking about?

354
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,209
When I was a child, every time I asked Father God about the queen,

355
00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:43,789
he always kept silent. And he looked sad.

356
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,090
So I couldn't bear to ask him anymore.

357
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,509
From what we know now,

358
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:51,509
it's much more complicated than I thought.

359
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:55,390
Hou Chi, stop overthinking. Okay?

360
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,968
Fine. You should go back and pack up.

361
00:24:57,968 --> 00:24:59,709
We'll leave the Heavenly Palace tonight.

362
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,590
Tonight?  What about Qing Mu?

363
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,068
He will attend the queen's birthday banquet.

364
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,469
He insists on doing so.

365
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,788
I think he's hiding something from me.

366
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:11,849
Whatever. I'm tired of this place. It's better to leave sooner than later.

367
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,629
Aren't you reluctant to leave?

368
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,649
Why would I be reluctant?

369
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,510
What about Jing Jian?

370
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,348
Hou Chi! Qing Mu was a bad influence on you.

371
00:25:22,348 --> 00:25:23,830
I must teach you a lesson.

372
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,269
Or you'd forget that I'm the master of Qingchi Palace.

373
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:29,470
- Cut it off. 
 - Come over.

374
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,068
Fine, forgive me!

375
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:32,650
Hou Chi.

376
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:35,709
Why are you here?

377
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,068
Jing Jian hasn't come back.

378
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,489
If Your Highness is here for him, you should go somewhere else.

379
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:40,849
No.

380
00:25:42,189 --> 00:25:43,708
I'm here for you.

381
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,129
I want to talk to you in private.

382
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,610
Hou Chi.

383
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,589
Don't worry.

384
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,090
We're in the Heavenly Palace.

385
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,850
Nothing bad can happen.

386
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,468
I got held up by some trifles. Sorry for being late.

387
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:04,089
It's okay. The scenery in this garden is great.

388
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,469
I killed time by enjoying it here.

389
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,289
Sorry for asking you here abruptly.

390
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:10,650
I have a problem I want to ask you.

391
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,268
Golden Dragon Clan used to thrive during ancient times.

392
00:26:15,268 --> 00:26:16,889
Now, it's gone.

393
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:19,489
Many stories are long forgotten.

394
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:21,570
You are a predecessor of ancient times.

395
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,109
Do you know anything about Dragon Elixir?

396
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:25,849
You are in the Heavenly Palace.

397
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:28,750
Yet you asked me instead of His Majesty.

398
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,210
I'm afraid it's about Third Princess.

399
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,429
That's right. This is about her.

400
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:38,790
I was poisoned by the Dragon Breath of the three-headed dragon.

401
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,970
To save my life, she sent her Dragon Elixir to me.

402
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,449
I owe her my life.

403
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:45,969
It's too precious a gift. I don't deserve it.

404
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:50,308
I'm wondering if there's any way to extract the elixir from my body.

405
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,869
Once it enters, it disperses into your body.

406
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:54,949
No one else can take it out,

407
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,530
except for a True God.

408
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:04,828
Of course, I have a way. It's just a little more dangerous.

409
00:27:04,828 --> 00:27:08,109
I don't know if you have the guts to give it a try.

410
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,490
Please enlighten me, Lord.

411
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,269
Everyone in the world knows that immortals are perfect in their cultivation.

412
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:17,188
Immortals can be a god after suffering 49 thunder ordeals.

413
00:27:17,189 --> 00:27:18,930
Sky Thunder will forge the internal alchemy.

414
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,729
That way, you have a circulatory cycle in your body, coordinating the five elements.

415
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:24,890
That way your life is prolonged.

416
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,989
There's the Blue Dragon Pavilion in this palace.

417
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,589
It is the place where all immortals ascend to gods.

418
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,800
It's a pity that it hasn't been opened for 60,000 years.

419
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,100
If Lord Qing Mu has completed his cultivation, a self-made pill will form.

420
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Using this to replace the Dragon Elixir would solve the difficulties for the Third Princess.

421
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:42,090
Although Qing Mu has great cultivation,

422
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,050
he's far from becoming a god.

423
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,349
For the past 60,000 years,

424
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,690
there has never been an immortal to successfully ascend to the gods.

425
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,769
If you rashly go to Blue Dragon Pavilion,

426
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:55,268
it might be the end of your soul.

427
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:57,710
I don't think it will work.

428
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:00,869
Isn't there any other way?

429
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:14,470
Do you know why I am looking for you today?

430
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,809
Spit it out if you want to. Or you can leave.

431
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,409
I'm not interested in guessing your riddles.

432
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:20,850
As an Upper God,

433
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:25,169
can't you see how different I am from the past?

434
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:32,809
I can't.

435
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:36,169
Hou Chi.

436
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:38,369
Now I'm a person who has lost all my spiritual power and cultivation.

437
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:40,388
I'm a wasted person.

438
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:43,729
I'm worse than what you used to be.

439
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:45,589
Are you happy now?

440
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,749
You should talk to the king and queen about it.

441
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,509
Why are you here for me?

442
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:55,888
But what if I told you that my spiritual power was lost because of Qing Mu?

443
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,109
Thank you, My Lord.

444
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,289
I've disturbed you.  I'll take my leave.

445
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:04,870
Wait.

446
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:08,370
Where's this yellow puppy from?

447
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,388
I found it on Observation Mountain.

448
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:12,709
It's very intelligent.

449
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,250
However, even if I carry it with me every day,

450
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,949
it's not close to me.

451
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,488
If you fancy it, why not take it in?

452
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,629
I'm sure within a hundred years,

453
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,349
it will be your spirit beast.

454
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,110
Spirit beast?

455
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:26,908
That's too precious.

456
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:28,849
How could I rob the love of Lord Dong Hua?

457
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:30,629
Lord Qing Mu is a promising talent.

458
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,768
I found the Tai Cang Spear of yours on Observation Mountain, too.

459
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:35,409
There is a relationship between you and me.

460
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:37,890
Please don't turn me down.

461
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:40,148
All right.

462
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:42,849
Well, Lord Dong Hua.

463
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:45,469
If I perish on Blue Dragon Pavilion,

464
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,569
is it possible to entrust this puppy to my partner, Hou Chi?

465
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,949
Heaven helps a good man.

466
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,309
I'm sure you'll make it.

467
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:57,069
Second Prince!

468
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,030
Second Prince!

469
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,350
Please go to Purple Pine Hall, now!

470
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:08,188
Upper God and Qing Mu are what I seek.

471
00:30:08,189 --> 00:30:12,369
Everything I'm eager for is at your fingertips.

472
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:15,428
Now I've figured it out.

473
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:18,808
There's more than one way to beat you.

474
00:30:18,808 --> 00:30:23,749
I don't mind being a thorn in your heart.

475
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:25,709
What did you do to Qing Mu?

476
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:31,749
I saved him from the Dragon's Breath poison.

477
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,629
His life is mine.

478
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,548
I have given him my Dragon Elixir.

479
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:39,589
We will never separate.

480
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,828
Jing Zhao, why did you have to do it?

481
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:45,230
Isn't there anything else for you other than entangling with Qing Mu?

482
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:48,429
I want to ask you the same question.

483
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,369
Useless as you are, the trash that couldn't even break her egg.

484
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:51,568
You're an abandoned daughter of Mother God.

485
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:54,089
Why do you always have to fight with me?

486
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,310
Hou Chi, this time,

487
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:04,109
he will marry me, not you.

488
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:11,069
The princess is joking.

489
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,028
I have already stated that in this life and this world,

490
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:19,308
I will only marry her.

491
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:20,848
And I won't regret it.

492
00:31:20,848 --> 00:31:22,590
Qing Mu.

493
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,430
Zhao'er. Zhao'er.

494
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:31,149
Shouldn't you be resting at Xiuyang Hall?

495
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:32,869
What are you doing here?

496
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,349
Come back with me.

497
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,049
I won't.

498
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:43,508
- Be obedient. 
 - I'm not leaving.

499
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:49,730
Hou Chi.

500
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,770
When was that?

501
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,210
The day before, at midnight.

502
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,150
Why didn't you tell me?

503
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,530
I...

504
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:20,469
Your Highness,

505
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,050
beneath Huajing Pond is a chamber.

506
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,329
Apparently, someone used to live there.

507
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:53,489
 Nothing suspicious at all. 

508
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:58,350
There are many scrolls stored in it, and records of the God Realm.

509
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,809
Apart from a painting, everything seems normal.

510
00:33:03,369 --> 00:33:06,029
I guess this portrait is related to the one

511
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,809
who is the owner of this room.

512
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,629
Why is Gu Jun hiding his identity?

513
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:26,210
Related to the God Realm?

514
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,949
Who is that guy?

515
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,929
Hou Chi and Qing Mu?

516
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:34,610
Shang Gu and Bai Jue?

517
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,189
They look too similar.

518
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:43,450
Is this really a coincidence?

519
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,289
Don't tell anyone about today's events.

520
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,889
You're dismissed.

521
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,430
Yes, Your Highness.

522
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,789
I don't believe it.

523
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:12,750
Hou Chi has taken Pilgrim Hall into her hands.

524
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:20,230
I would rather kill by mistake this time than let it go.

525
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,268
Three-head, you can reach cultivation so quickly.

526
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:33,989
It was all thanks to Master's demon power.

527
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,989
Now, there's a big problem at the Swamp of Netherhill.

528
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,628
But you did not report it.

529
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:41,069
You only report to Sen Jian now.

530
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:44,429
Have you forgotten who your master is?

531
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,710
This old dragon dares not.

532
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:51,269
It was all ordered by His Majesty the Demon Emperor.

533
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,309
His Majesty is too powerful.

534
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,589
This old dragon is no match.

535
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:00,868
Making up stories,

536
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:03,750
not admitting your mistakes.  Nonsense!

537
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:08,310
Please spare me.

538
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:16,969
It's my fault. Please punish me.

539
00:35:18,669 --> 00:35:21,248
You know I cherish Hou Chi the most.

540
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:24,209
But you also deliberately concealed things about her.

541
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:27,328
Sen Jian, are you disobeying me?

542
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:32,888
Master, everything I did was to keep you safe.

543
00:35:32,888 --> 00:35:35,488
You had been exposed to Wu Huan.

544
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:39,228
If the Heavenly Palace finds you because of Hou Chi,

545
00:35:39,228 --> 00:35:41,749
I was afraid they'd harm you.

546
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,450
Presumptuous!

547
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:48,928
60,000 years have passed.

548
00:35:48,928 --> 00:35:52,488
It seems you've forgotten my temper.

549
00:35:52,488 --> 00:35:54,688
My power might be undermined,

550
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:58,388
I can still control the Demon Clan.

551
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:03,728
Master, I dare not betray you.

552
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,589
Everything I do is for her.

553
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:13,749
Even sentient beings in the Three Realms can be destroyed,

554
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,850
not to mention a mere Heavenly Palace.

555
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,709
Sen Jian,

556
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:22,589
if you dare to go beyond the boundary again,

557
00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:28,589
I might as well give everything you've gotten to someone else.

558
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:07,030
Is your meridian hurt after taking his attack?

559
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:12,529
I can handle it.

560
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:15,129
Alas. You should learn.

561
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:17,449
Remember to report everything

562
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:20,470
about Upper God Hou Chi to Master.

563
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:24,928
Three-Head only told me

564
00:37:24,928 --> 00:37:27,968
that he hurt Qing Mu in the swamp.

565
00:37:27,968 --> 00:37:29,768
He didn't mention Hou Chi.

566
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:31,588
It's my fault.

567
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:32,989
Report about Qing Mu, too.

568
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:37,109
In short, you have to be careful with the news of these two in the future.

569
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:39,728
Do you blame Master?

570
00:37:39,728 --> 00:37:42,130
I dare not.

571
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:47,509
It's just... he's too obsessed with Hou Chi.

572
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:51,130
I'm afraid it will do him harm.

573
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,588
It's not like that.

574
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:55,609
It seems that Upper God Hou Chi

575
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:57,989
is related to Chief God Shang Gu.

576
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:00,428
I can't give you any more details about it.

577
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:04,728
Just bear this in mind. If the Demon Clan loses Demon God, we will have no protection.

578
00:38:04,728 --> 00:38:07,589
He's the root of our clan.

579
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:11,270
It is my fault, I'm sorry.

580
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:15,388
Master is benevolent and righteous to the Demon Clan.

581
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:17,989
Even disregarding the recovery of their own strength,

582
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:22,009
he is using the divine power of the Purple Moon to sustain the Demon Clan for many years.

583
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:23,989
I don't know about others.

584
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,489
But as long as I'm alive,

585
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:28,850
I will be loyal to Master.

586
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,349
Master knows you're loyal and respects you.

587
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:35,549
Take it, and you'll recover in less than month.

588
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,949
Recovery Pill.

589
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,108
Master still cares about you.

590
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:41,070
Don't let him down.

591
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:44,750
I understand.

592
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:57,448
Hou Chi, don't be angry.

593
00:38:57,448 --> 00:39:00,809
Even if Qing Mu did something wrong, he still had good intentions.

594
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,588
You've been through so much.

595
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:05,549
Don't let Jing Zhao interfere with your relationship.

596
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,169
I'm not mad at him.

597
00:39:07,169 --> 00:39:09,308
Why don't you meet him then?

598
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:14,149
I'm thinking about Dragon Elixir. How should I solve it?

599
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:17,149
- Have you figured it out? 
 - More or less.

600
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:19,908
If you ask me, Jing Zhao is really rude.

601
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:21,469
Even if she saved Qing Mu,

602
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,369
what she did is shameless.

603
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:26,989
Anyway, she saved Qing Mu.

604
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,688
We must thank her.

605
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:30,749
How about this? Let's go back to Qingchi Palace.

606
00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:32,428
Close the mountain protection barrier there.

607
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:35,448
Hide for tens of thousand years and everything will be fine.

608
00:39:35,448 --> 00:39:38,288
One cannot retreat from everything in life.

609
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:40,509
If we run away tonight,

610
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:45,788
how would Qingchi Palace walk in the three realms in an upright manner in the future?

611
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:48,229
Listen to yourself.

612
00:39:48,229 --> 00:39:49,949
Just like a god.

613
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,650
I like it.

614
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:32,590
Hou Chi.

615
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,068
Look at you, sitting on pins and needles.

616
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:39,089
Are you thinking about how to please me?

617
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:40,208
Would you like fish soup?

618
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,069
I just learned a new dish.

619
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,868
When did I become a glutton in your eyes?

620
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:46,908
No, no. It's not like that.

621
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:49,428
It's just... I want to cook something delicious for you.

622
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:53,149
Now that you've carefully studied the cookbook,

623
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:54,849
I'll forgive you.

624
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:56,410
Hou Chi.

625
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,909
I heard that there's the Milky Way in the Heavenly Realm.

626
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:03,749
The colorful rivers are the stars in the world.

627
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,348
Will you enjoy the scenery with me?

628
00:41:06,348 --> 00:41:08,770
Of course!

629
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,190
I'm willing to stay with you for as long as you want.

630
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,689
Come.

631
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:39,850


632
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:50,049
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

633
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:56,929
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

634
00:41:56,929 --> 00:42:03,349
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

635
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:09,609
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

636
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:16,409
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

637
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:22,969
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

638
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:30,189
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

639
00:42:30,189 --> 00:42:36,950
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

640
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:54,129
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

641
00:42:54,130 --> 00:43:00,609
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

642
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:07,789
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

643
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:14,890

644
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:22,869
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

645
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:29,749
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫
