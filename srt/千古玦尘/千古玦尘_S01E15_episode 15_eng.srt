1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:12,050


2
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:21,780
   

3
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,020
   

4
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,800
 The Doom of Chaos has appeared. The God Realm will be destroyed. 

5
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,660
 Only if the Chief God of Chaos faces the disaster by sacrificing her life will the suffering end. 

6
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,480
 Nonsense. 

7
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,400
 You old fellow! 

8
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,119
 You asked Shang Gu to take painstaking efforts to gain the Power of Chaos and become the Chief God, 

9
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,440
 just to make her take your place and sacrifice herself for all the beings in the world? 

10
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,680
 Is she just a sacrifice to you? 

11
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,979
 Master, watch your words! 

12
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,820
 Purple Jade Whip! 

13
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,300
 Master! 

14
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,040
 Master. 

15
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,440
 Master! 

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,880
 I am not afraid. 

17
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,900
 Qing Tian, you have the ability to send down divine punishment and kill me! 

18
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,780
 Get away! 

19
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,559
 Master. Master! 

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,760
 Master. 

21
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,340
 I must stop it. 

22
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,739
 I must stop it, no matter the price I must pa. 

23
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,599
 I'll never let Shang Gu inherit the position of Chief God. 

24
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,300
 I failed to protect her thousands of years ago. 

25
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,720
 This time, no matter what, 

26
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,100
 I won't let her get hurt in any way. 

27
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,580
 Even if it is you, 

28
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,460
 I won't let it happen. 

29
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,640
 After inheriting the position of Chief God, she will die for the world. 

30
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,680
 Tian Qi, so this is your pain. 

31
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,660
 So, this is why you'd rather let all living beings die than tell the secret. 

32
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,879
- Tian Qi. 
 - I said that one day when you knew the truth,

33
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,140
you would definitely regret it.

34
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,739
If you hadn't let her become the Chief God so soon，

35
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,900
how could she have become a chess piece to save the common people with such great Power of Chaos?

36
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,960
How could I be forced to destroy the world?

37
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,180
You thought you saved her.

38
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,779
But you know what?

39
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:42,500
The truth is that you pushed her step by step into her destiny and made her go to hell.

40
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,079
It is you. It's you who killed her!

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,040
No.

42
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,580
There must be another solution for the Doom of Chaos.

43
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,000
To sacrifice her life can't be the only way to solve it.

44
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,640
The solution?

45
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,039
I had already found it, didn't I?

46
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,380
Kill all living beings from the three realms.

47
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,339
This way we can solve the Doom of Chaos. But look at you!

48
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:13,680
You just destroyed it by yourself!

49
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,600
That's not the right way.

50
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,259
To kill millions of living beings to save her, that's not what Shang Gu would want.

51
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,880
Then what other solutions do you have?

52
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,600
There must be another way out.

53
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,830
Give me some time. A hundred years?

54
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,110
No. Ten years.

55
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:32,879
I will find a new way. I will definitely find a way to save her.

56
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,680
It's too late.

57
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,120
There are only two days left until the Doom of Chaos.

58
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,200
Everything has been settled.

59
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,360
When the Doom of Chaos comes,

60
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,939
all the spiritual power will be gone and all the gods will vanish.

61
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:50,360
There is no other way but for her death.

62
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,860
So I am the one who killed her.

63
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,180
What's up?

64
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,980
Just now I was watching stars at Abyss Hall.

65
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,680
Suddenly it reminded me of your unfinished promise.

66
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,090
What promise?

67
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,750
First, let me finish cultivating the Chief God's instruction feather.

68
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,500
Chief God, did you forget your promise when we were at Peach Woods?

69
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,560
 After you inherit Chief God's instruction feather, 

70
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,480
 would you like to go to Peach Woods with me? 

71
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,880
 I have a thing in my heart that has been hidden for a long, long time. 

72
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,000
 I want to tell you there. 

73
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,620
Chief God, have you forgotten it?

74
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,740
I could never forget...

75
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,040
my promise to you.

76
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,580
But that deal is long overdue.

77
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,660
I've come to the temple today to invite the Chief God to that day's appointment.

78
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,120
I can't.

79
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,080
Tomorrow, I must become the Chief God of Chaos. I need to give an account to the gods.

80
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,640
Just because you'll be the Chief God of the God Realm tomorrow,

81
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,580
I come here today.

82
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,920
I have never asked for anything in my life.

83
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,800
But I only have one wish.

84
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,459
I want Shang Gu who cultivated with me at Abyss Hall before to come to our appointment today,

85
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,720
not the Chief God of Chaos tomorrow.

86
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,460
Okay?

87
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,780
No.

88
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,220
No.

89
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,240
What's wrong with you today?

90
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,080
The gods know about today's cultivation.

91
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,820
If I just stop here, it won't be proper at all.

92
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,800
Just wait until I finish it.

93
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,600
Wait until I finish it.

94
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,580
I never asked anyone in my life.

95
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,720
This is the only wish I have.

96
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,180
Only this wish.

97
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,600
Shang Gu, please leave with me.

98
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,160
All right?

99
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,179
   

100
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,260
   

101
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,619
The Doom of Chaos has come. Tell Master! Quick!

102
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:13,080
Yes!

103
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,799
Master, it's well known that every 180,000 years there will be Doom.

104
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,419
Only Chief God can solve it.

105
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,359
Now, what the stele means is that Master Shang Gu needs to sacrifice her core spirit to save the world.

106
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:37,759
Nonsense! It's impossible.

107
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,899
Close the Universe Pavilion right now! Don't let anyone enter here.

108
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:44,219
Master,  even if you close the Universe Pavilion, you can't mute all the gods in the God Realm.

109
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:45,819
The instructions from the Ancestral God are always the truth.

110
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,579
As it tells there will be Doom, there must be one.

111
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,520
If Master Shang Gu does not appear at this time, is she waiting until the God Realm collapses?

112
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,899
Even if the God Realm is going to collapse, my master and the two True Gods are here ready to help.

113
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,300
Since when was it your turn to give a speech?

114
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,699
Funny enough. God Realm is the God Realm of all gods.

115
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:02,280
How come it's your Pilgrim Hall that can have the final say!

116
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,799
Master Zhi Yang, with respect to all the gods,

117
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,019
I think that since Doom is not here yet,

118
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,419
every god needs to perform their duties and be responsible for the moment.

119
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,059
As for the solution to Doom, the True Gods will decide.

120
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,540
We must not stump ourselves up here just by this warning.

121
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,660
Report!

122
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,280
Report, Master Zhi Yang.

123
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,040
The Doom of Chaos is spreading to the gate of the Bronze Barrier.

124
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,520
The Bronze Bridge is collapsing.

125
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,700
I'm afraid within 24 hours the entire God Realm will be destroyed!

126
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,899
The Power of Chaos is collapsing.

127
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,200
Is it...

128
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,400
This is the Doom of Chaos!

129
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,699
The Doom of Chaos?

130
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,419
My master is Chief God of Chaos.

131
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,419
If she loses her core spirit, who can protect the world?

132
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,259
The Doom of Chaos is coming.

133
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,380
The God Realm is about to encounter a great disaster.

134
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,299
Master Zhi Yang, please ask the Chief God to come out of the hall

135
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,580
and make a decision for the common people.

136
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,260
 Please ask the Chief God to come out of the hall. 

137
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,860
 Make a decision for the common people! 

138
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,300
You...

139
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,059
Look at it. The God light is gone.

140
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,180
Master Shang Gu didn't cultivate the Chief God's instruction feather.

141
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,220
How could it be?

142
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,740
 How? 

143
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
What do we do?

144
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,340
The Goddess of Storm, what can we do now?

145
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,760
Master Shang Gu must have learned that she'd sacrifice herself to resolve the Doom of Chaos, so she has run away from the God Realm.

146
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,740
Nonsense!

147
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,299
My master can't be the one you described.

148
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,979
Then where is she? She accepted the Imperial Order and took the position.

149
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:44,679
But she stopped cultivating the Chief God's instruction feather at this moment. If not for escape...

150
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,220
Shut up!

151
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,800
I promise I will bring Shang Gu back and give an explanation to the gods.

152
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,660
However, before everything is sorted out clearly,

153
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,920
I don't want to hear anyone defaming Chief God of Chaos.

154
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,620
Otherwise, remove your title of god and expel yourself out of the God Realm.

155
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,900
I beg Master Zhi Yang to forgive me.

156
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,399
I was too anxious. So I said something wrong.

157
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,140
Mu Guang.

158
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,120
Yes, Master.

159
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,640
Take my Sun Moon Spear and fight against the Doom of Chaos with all the gods.

160
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,300
If anyone betrays us, they will be punished for treason.

161
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,580
I will give an account to all gods in 24 hours.

162
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,160
 Yes, Master. 

163
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,260
I thought you would take me to Peach Woods.

164
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,200
Since it's a late appointment, I'll decide where to go.

165
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,200
 Be serious. 

166
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,339
 Why do I need to learn such a primer for babies? 

167
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,680
 Bai Jue, come here! 

168
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,859
Today, let's have fun for the entire day.

169
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,780
What do you want to do?

170
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,780
I'm listening to you.

171
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,480
Master, please.

172
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,760
I remember I scolded you when you were at Abyss Hall.

173
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,620
When I was little, Zhi Yang burned so many gadgets of mine.

174
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,800
Thanks to Yue Mi and Tian Qi, they prepared a warehouse of them for me.

175
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,840
Now they can be relieved.

176
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,360
From now on, they don't have to worry about me being a drag.

177
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,819
Anyway, forget about it.

178
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:56,860
If Master Bai Jue loses, will there be any reward?

179
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,960
I'll do whatever I can.

180
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,620
I have played in the God Realm for years.

181
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,880
But it's my first time to see someone talk with such great assurance.

182
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,360
All right.

183
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,640
Whoever has more points wins.

184
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,639
One deal first. Do not cheat with divine power.

185
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,960
Come on.

186
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,660
Open!

187
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,820
In this world, there really is something Master Bai Jue is bad at!

188
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,580
Master Bai Jue, you just lost. Right?

189
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,179
I admit it. What rewards do you want?

190
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:38,379
It's not difficult.

191
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,640
Do you still remember three things you asked me to do when I entered the Abyss Hall?

192
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,879
Yes, I remember.

193
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:46,739
Today, if you make me laugh three times,

194
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,340
I will be very satisfied with this appointment at Observation Mountain.

195
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,140
What's wrong?

196
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,940
I said I'll do whatever I can.

197
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,420
You silly.

198
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,900
How could you use a mountain of pears to make girls laugh?

199
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,740
How about this?

200
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,920
Let's come back here next year.

201
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,540
Sure.

202
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,240
 ♫ My dream is incomplete ♫ 

203
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,660
 ♫ But I still miss you so much ♫ 

204
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:50,760
 ♫ What's in my mind is what I can't get over ♫ 

205
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,000
 ♫ Time goes by, how many chances can tie us together ♫ 

206
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,320
 ♫ This trip takes a thousand years ♫ 

207
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,960
 ♫ I can summon clouds and mist ♫ 

208
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,840
 ♫ But I can't pray for an endless love ♫ 

209
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,180
 ♫ It's dreamlike and aimless ♫ 

210
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,480
 ♫ For one single glance at you ♫ 

211
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,099
 ♫ I don't regret cultivating myself ♫ 

212
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:17,660
 ♫ Even if I have to live alone ♫ 

213
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,480
You knew that Shang Gu had to sacrifice her life.

214
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,100
Yes.

215
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,840
How about Tian Qi?

216
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,240
Tian Qi was the first one to learn of the warning from the Doom of Chaos.

217
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,280
Everything he did was for Shang Gu.

218
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,099
Just now, there was a warning from the Ancestor Stele at Universe Pavilion.

219
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,320
All gods know that only Shang Gu is the only one who can resolve the Doom of Chaos.

220
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,820
Bai Jue, she must come back.

221
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,800
Come back?

222
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,120
To sacrifice her life?

223
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,360
Zhi Yang, it shouldn't be her.

224
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,219
No one knows that the destiny of Chief God of Chaos is to save the world by sacrificing her life.

225
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,320
But no matter how this calamity is resolved,

226
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,919
now the God Realm is in chaos.

227
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,080
As Chief God of Chaos, she needs to go back and resove this situation.

228
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,920
What are you doing?

229
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,540
Even if it's God's will, I have to go against it.

230
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,040
Zhi Yang,

231
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,640
I have never begged you for anything before.

232
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:34,160
But today I'm begging with my life to not let Shang Gu return to the God Realm.

233
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,080
Once she knows the truth of the Doom of Chaos,

234
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,340
she will definitely inherit the Chief God position and sacrifice her life.

235
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,500
I don't want her sacrifice.

236
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,740
So what's in your mind?

237
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,380
- I can be the one to take the Doom of Chaos. 
 - Chaos Cataclysm.

238
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,660
Only the divine power of Chaos can resolve the Doom.

239
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,900
Even if you sacrifice all your core spirit,

240
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,800
it will only block Doom for the time being.

241
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,140
You manage stars every day in the God Realm.

242
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,180
Even here in the Heavenly Realm, you bring me to see stars too.

243
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,859
Don't you get bored?

244
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:33,199
I thought as long as seeing the stars with me,

245
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,460
no matter where we are, you would enjoy it.

246
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,460
Do you still remember these stars?

247
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,920
Are these...

248
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,160
They're the same stars as when we were at Universe Pavilion.

249
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,180
But why are we watching these stars today?

250
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,280
I thought you would miss that night.

251
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,599
 ♫ I hold your warm hands tightly ♫ 

252
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,200
What happened?

253
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:15,999
Why are you so sweet today?

254
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,440
Are you an illusion created by others?

255
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,179
It could be possible.

256
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,779
You can give me a test to check to see if I'm real.

257
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,339
How?

258
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:29,020
Observation Mountain. Nanhai City Tower.

259
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,399
You never mentioned them before and I didn't ask.

260
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:39,320
 ♫ I hope we can be together forever ♫ 

261
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,539
 ♫ When we meet again ♫ 

262
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:46,659
 ♫ I'll travel with you without hesitation ♫ 

263
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,199
 It's how you do it. 

264
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:50,339
 Do you still remember that set of moves? 

265
00:20:50,339 --> 00:21:01,460
 ♫ The feels. That distance. The small talk ♫ 

266
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,539
 ♫ Such good times and beautiful scenery ♫ 

267
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:12,960
 ♫ May you stay by my side ♫ 

268
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,500
What are you doing?

269
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,700
 There must be something I don't know. 

270
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,320
 I can't lose anyone inexplicably anymore. 

271
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,980
 The Doom of Chaos has appeared. The God Realm will be destroyed. 

272
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:52,700
 Only if the Chief God of Chaos faces the disaster by sacrificing her life will the Doom be solved. 

273
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:03,920
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

274
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:10,399
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

275
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:11,940
No.

276
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,340
Shang Gu, I'm begging you.

277
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,340
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

278
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,779
 I have never begged for anything in my life. 

279
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:25,899
 I only have one wish. 

280
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:31,140
 Shang Gu who cultivated with me at Abyss Hall before can come to our appointment today, 

281
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,900
 not tomorrow's Chief God of Chaos. 

282
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,940
This is my responsibility as the Chief God.

283
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,260
I need to protect the world and living beings.

284
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,140
It's what you taught me.

285
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't want you to do this.

286
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,700
Please, do not go.

287
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:18,379
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

288
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:25,040
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

289
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,439
 As long as the three realms and this world are here, 

290
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,900
 I'll be with you, all right? 

291
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,259
 You should say we are a perfect match. 

292
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:36,700
 We should buy a pair of mandarin duck lamps. 

293
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,819
 Shang Gu, what are you doing? 

294
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:45,440
 Do what I wanted to do. 

295
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:54,200
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

296

 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

297
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:08,040
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

298
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,659
It's been half a day.

299
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,000
Why is Master Zhi Yang still not back?

300
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,579
Just now I went to Abyss Hall to invite Master Bai Jue.

301
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,359
But he wasn't there, either.

302
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,599
Perhaps seeing such a bad situation, did these masters just leave us and run away?

303
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,599
Nonsense!

304
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,819
Our God Realm was almost destroyed during the war between gods and devils.

305
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,419
Master Zhi Yang and Master Bai Jue took the lead.

306
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,979
When did they abandon the God Realm?

307
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,820
Goddess of Disaster, watch your words; otherwise, I'll punish you.

308
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,720
I'm just chatting.

309
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,619
The Doom has just begun but it already has such great power.

310
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:54,699
The God Realm is about to be destroyed!

311
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,499
What to do? The masters aren't back yet.

312
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:59,540
What can we do now?

313
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,280
Set up the barrier!

314
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,660
Let's unite and fight against it together!

315
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,699
Master!

316
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,900
Mu Guang, great job.

317
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,920
Master Zhi Yang, did you find Chief God and Master Bai Jue?

318
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,659
Don't worry. They'll be back soon.

319
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,119
Master Zhi Yang, when will Her Royal Highness and Master Bai Jue be back?

320
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,059
The God Realm will collapse if they don't come back now.

321
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,540
Shut up.

322
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,980
Shang Gu.

323
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,660
Why are you here, where is Bai Jue?

324
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,679
You protected me a thousand years ago.

325
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,500
A thousand years later, you still did it.

326
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,939
Zhi Yang, I'm no longer that Shang Gu back then.

327
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:31,399
Since the Ancestral God created the world, the God Realm has gone through numerous years.

328
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,739
The dooms are more than one Doom of Chaos.

329
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,540
I wasn't with you in the past.

330
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,860
This time, we're going to face it together.

331
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,700
Just take it as God's first trial for me after inheriting the position of Chief God of Chaos.

332
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,500
Master is going to cultivate Chief God's instruction feather.

333
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,980
Shang Gu. Shang Gu!

334
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,979
Master, we always fought together when the God Realm had dooms.

335
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:21,759
The responsibility never fell upon one god.

336
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,379
Please do not sacrifice your life just because of one warning from the Ancestral God.

337
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,659
Gu Jun has a point!

338
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,099
Since the God Realm is suffering from such a severe doom,

339
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,360
we should unite as one and fight against Doom.

340
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,980
Thank you, all gods.

341
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,859
I have a life.

342
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,180
So do all living beings.

343
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,320
It's my fate.

344
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,660
Though I don't agree with it.

345
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,000
If today someone must sacrifice her life in exchange for peace in the world,

346
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,040
then I'm the best match than anyone else.

347
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,439
I'm going to cultivate the Chief God's instruction feather again

348
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,259
to eliminate this Doom of Chaos.

349
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,499
Master, no!

350
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,239
Didn't you just say we're going to face it together?

351
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:08,419
I am Chief God of Chaos.

352
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,760
My responsibility is to devote myself to the world.

353
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,160
If today you were in my position, how would you decide?

354
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,840
Shang Gu, you've really grown up.

355
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,979
All gods, follow the order!

356
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,140
Protect the Chief God.

357
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,679
The position of Heaven. Go with Four Seasons.

358
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,240
The position of Earth. Weather Move.

359
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,539
Demon King,

360
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,339
Shang Gu is cultivating the Chief God's instruction feather at Universe Pavilion.

361
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:40,060
I believe it'll be completed soon.

362
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,579
I have been waiting for over 70,000 years.

363
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,040
Finally, today is the day!

364
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,860
Back then Qing Tian told me about the Doom of Chaos.

365
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,299
He even asked me to sacrifice my life to protect the God Realm.

366
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:01,360
But look at this God Realm, why should I die for them?

367
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,580
Then Qing Tian thought I wasn't suitable to be the Chief God of three Realms just because of it.

368
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,750
I'm going to have a careful look at

369
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:17,500
how those hypocrites make the choice.

370
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,560
 No. 

371
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,880
 Shang Gu, I'm begging you, please don't! 

372
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,480
 This is my responsibility as the Chief God. 

373
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,140
 I have to protect the world. 

374
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,239
Bai Jue, don't worry.

375
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:39,420
I will become a qualified Chief God to protect the God Realm safe and sound.

376
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,780
Master!

377
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,740
Master!

378
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,320
Shang Gu!

379
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,000
Master Bai Jue.

380
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,759
- Bai Jue. 
 - Master Bai Jue, you can't die for her!

381
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,620
No.

382
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,220
Destruction Pestle?

383
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,179
How dare you collude with devils.

384
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:42,980
I'll punish you later!

385
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,060
Master!

386
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,579
Shang Gu. No.

387
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:21,760
Bai Jue, please leave here.

388
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,230
I don't want to see every one of you

389
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:32,200
losing lives for my destiny.

390
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,300
I know. I understand you better than anyone else.

391
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,260
You're able to protect the world and be responsible for all gods.

392
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,960
I have never done anything wrong in this life.

393
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,220
But I always feel more regretful for one thing.

394
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,680
That is to force you to become the Chief God.

395
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,560
It is me who pushed you to this hell.

396
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,160
In fact, I just want to ask you.

397
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,439
Yesterday, when we were at Observation Mountain,

398
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:10,870
you sent me a mountain of pear blossoms

399
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,570
and stars as gifts.

400
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,500
Were you sincere?

401
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,380
Yes, with my whole heart.

402
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,999
You also said before

403
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:32,679
that you'd keep me company when listening to music, reading, and traveling.

404
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:36,139
You said you'd be with me every day until the end of life.

405
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,160
Did you lie to me?

406
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,539
They're all true.

407
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,160
Come back now.

408
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,000
If I was born a few years earlier, that would be all good.

409
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:49,200
If I met you 70,000 years before and grew up with you,

410
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,900
then we could have spent 70,000 years together.

411
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,160
I...

412
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:06,640
Unfortunately, I didn't realize to cherish it as a god's life is too long.

413
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,780
No.

414
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,240
The world is very important to me. I have no choice.

415
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,480
Shang Gu. Shang Gu.

416
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,290
Bai Jue,

417
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:25,950
I'll leave the three realms to you.

418
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,580
No.

419
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,320
No way!

420
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,960
Shang Gu.

421
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,760
Shang Gu! No.

422
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,440
Shang Gu, come back! Please, I'm begging you.
