1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:10,960


2
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:21,380
   

3
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,250
   

4
00:01:26,844 --> 00:01:30,939
No matter why Qing Mu was there in the first place,

5
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:34,671
he did help the demons.

6
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,900
I won't have faith in his loyalty until I see the Halberd returned to Heavenly Palace.

7
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,859
You have three days.

8
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,899
Okay. Three days it is.

9
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:50,199
 No wonder you always let Qing Mu get away. 

10
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:53,400
 You're still planning to restore the God Realm. 

11
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,457
Leave.

12
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,870
Your Highness, are you upset with something?

13
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,814
I'm surprised...

14
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:33,360
I was married to him for tens of thousands of years,

15
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,289
but he would join forces with outsiders without telling me.

16
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,714
Your Highness, do you want to...

17
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:45,752
It's just starting.

18
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:48,821
As long as the Immortal and Demon Clans don't stop fighting,

19
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:54,101
relying on my cultivation method, sooner or later,

20
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:58,111
the gods will be trampled under my feet.

21
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,570
Mercy, Your Highness. Your Highness, please.

22
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,930
You killed many immortals, why should I spare you?

23
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,499
As long as Your Highness spares this old dragon's life,

24
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,940
I'll work like a dog for the Heavenly Queen.

25
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,899
Work for me?

26
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,415
Are you willing to betray the Demon Clan?

27
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,291
This old dragon has lived for thousands of years.

28
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:39,519
I've been cultivating in the Swamp of Netherhill.

29
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,749
I don't care about the war of immortals and demons.

30
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,929
If it wasn't for that demon god who came off of the mountain, how could I have gotten into this muddy water?

31
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:49,764
You're wise.

32
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,970
Divine... Divine Seal.

33
00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:02,639
It's my divine seal.

34
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,959
If you devote yourself to working for me, I'll break the seal for you.

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,400
Otherwise, I'll change my mind, then I'll grind your bones into dust.

36
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,150
Three-Head will follow Your Highness's instructions.

37
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,330
I'll be absolutely loyal to you.

38
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,609
Thank you, Your Highness.

39
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,259
Fine. Do something for me.

40
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,042
You'll have your rewards if you do it well.

41
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,185
Yes, Your Highness.

42
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,714
Master. Lordess.

43
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:57,667
Did Hou Chi and Qing Mu come back?

44
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:02,029
Master, Her Royal Highness and Lord Qing Mu haven't come back yet.

45
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:08,979
Master, Qing Mu tried very hard to get your permission.

46
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,230
Just let them be happy for a couple of days.

47
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,335
Anyway, you're back in Qingchi Palace, the Heavenly Palace can't do anything to us.

48
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,981
This matter, after all, was our fault.

49
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:23,496
If Qing Mu can't return Halberd of Sun and Moon in three days,

50
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,529
it's not going to be easy.

51
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:31,178
I'll go to find them now.

52
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,998
Your spiritual power was unstable just now.

53
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:46,871
but it seems it's back to normal now.

54
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:50,700
Not only is it back to normal, I feel like I'm full of spiritual power.

55
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,484
Maybe it has to do with the two divine weapons you carry.

56
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:56,357
I'm glad that you're fine.

57
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,014
The North Sea... is where Bo Xuan resides.

58
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,370
We've been here before.

59
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,359
Why didn't we notice it?

60
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,499
The four seas are mixed together.

61
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,213
There are lots of secret paths thousands of miles under the North Sea.

62
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:18,739
I cultivated here for 1,000 years, but I hadn't been to any of them.

63
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:20,020
Maybe this is the reason.

64
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:25,113
Don't be fooled by him.

65
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:26,870
Bo Xuan was hidden in his place,

66
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,839
how could he not know all the time?

67
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,820
Jing Yuan, why are you here?

68
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,170
I was afraid you'd be fooled by this lying bastard.

69
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,976
So, I came to protect you.

70
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:41,169
You're the Demon God, but you couldn't beat the Heavenly Queen in the Luocha Region.

71
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,742
Looks like you're the one who's always lying.

72
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:48,550
Let's go.

73
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:52,930
Small tricks.

74
00:06:58,455 --> 00:07:00,163
What?

75
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:03,449
They went to the North Sea?

76
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,250
Now the Heavenly Palace is pressuring Qingchi Palace.

77
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,649
The two of them did not rush to discuss countermeasures. Why did they go to the North Sea?

78
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:16,663
This old dragon doesn't know.

79
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:22,890
Your Highness, please tell me what I should do now.

80
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,699
His Majesty has a deal with Gu Jun.

81
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,400
If the Halberd of Sun and Moon can't return to the Heavenly Palace in three days,

82
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:34,830
we can get their guilt of conspiring with Demon God,

83
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:37,790
and the crime of betraying the immortals will be confirmed.

84
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:43,591
By then, nothing Gu Jun says will be able to prove their innocence.

85
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,969
Do you know what you should do?

86
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:52,020
This old dragon is willing to serve the Heavenly Queen.

87
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:56,277
But my spiritual power is not what it used to be.

88
00:07:56,278 --> 00:08:00,509
Although the spiritual aura under the North Sea is thin, the spiritual power is not sustainable,

89
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:06,906
the Demon God is still with them, and Qing Mu has two divine weapons.

90
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:10,090
I'm afraid I can't win them.

91
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:20,439
This Upper God's Power can last a few hours in you.

92
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:23,664
It can help you seize the Halberd of Sun and Moon.

93
00:08:23,664 --> 00:08:25,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

94
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:30,677
Although I now have divine power, I'm weak.

95
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,920
I'm afraid I'll fail if I don't have some good weapons with me.

96
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,390
I'm afraid this fight will be one-sided.

97
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,300
You old dragon.

98
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,486
If you weren't greedy, you wouldn't have ended up like that.

99
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:55,727
This is the Divine Dart of the Eagle Clan. It's made for sneak attacks.

100
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:58,999
In order to ensure that nothing is lost, I'll give it to you.

101
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,669
- Remember. The purpose of this mission is to take back Halberd of Sun and Moon. 
 - Yes.

102
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,063
You can't let anyone recognize you.

103
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:08,373
If you fail...

104
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,707
Don't worry, Your Highness.

105
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,468
This old dragon understands.

106
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:28,500
How could Bo Xuan be here?

107
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,523
There's a secret door over there.

108
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:48,370
It's made of ice.

109
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:52,856
This is not just any ice. It's the ice of 10,000 years left since ancient times.

110
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:55,985
I don't think ordinary spells can break it.

111
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:58,070
Indeed.

112
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:01,784
Bo Xuan used to use spells of ancient times.

113
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:04,279
I think there must be a clue of him in there.

114
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,542
Let's figure out a way to open it.

115
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,019
Qing Mu.

116
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,791
I don't know why I can open it.

117
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:27,021
Maybe we'll figure out everything when we find Bo Xuan.

118
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,019
It's Bo Xuan.

119
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,159
Hou Chi.

120
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,420
Which immortal is so capable of sealing Bo Xuan here?

121
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:03,477
You are working together but you can't break it.

122
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:04,848
Not in the Heavenly Realm.

123
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:07,690
The God Realm might not.

124
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,869
What do you mean?

125
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:14,292
Try it with your Tai Cang Spear.

126
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,150
Bo Xuan.

127
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:39,750
Qing Mu.

128
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,191
Oh no, it's going to collapse. Let's go!

129
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,729
Let's go.

130
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,763
How cowardly! Who is doing such a foolish thing? Who dares to rush this god? Come out!

131
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,559
Octagonal God-Trapping Formation.

132
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,134
Tian Qi, don't underestimate the enemy.

133
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:09,392
What did you call me?

134
00:12:11,702 --> 00:12:14,231
We should find a way out of here.

135
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:19,129
There's an Upper God's power in this trap.

136
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,277
Who's it?

137
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,699
I knew it the moment I set eyes on it. You just noticed?

138
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:26,163
Although I don't like you,

139
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:30,163
if we're killed by this unknown coward, people will laugh at us.

140
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:31,820
Why don't we defeat this enemy together?

141
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:34,378
I wonder if you're willing to do it.

142
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,220
You don't like me?

143
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:39,691
I hate you. You're still the way you were.

144
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:43,250
You want me to help you, but you just won't admit it.

145
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,878
Three-head, you bastard.

146
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,268
 It's not me. Master, you made a mistake. 

147
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:17,039
Let's go.

148
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:24,056
Who's trespassing the barracks of the Immortal Clan?

149
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:25,940
Step aside.

150
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,449
Stop!

151
00:13:29,137 --> 00:13:31,885
Feng Ran, why are you here?

152
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:33,563
Your Second Highness.

153
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:36,718
Lordess Feng Ran came for me.

154
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:39,340
- You're dismissed. 
  - Yes. 

155
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:45,909
Jing Jian, this place is densely covered in evil aura. What happened?

156
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,884
There are casualties every time immortals fight against the demons.

157
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:51,704
And there are evil auras every time there are casualties.

158
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,964
I don't know why it's so thick this time.

159
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:57,806
Maybe the Human Realm has been implicated in the war.

160
00:13:57,807 --> 00:14:02,959
I garrisoned here to bring to regenerate the undead and purify evil auras.

161
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,034
I see. It'd hurt your base most if evil auras were all over you.

162
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:08,522
Remember, you must be careful.

163
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:09,781
You're worrying about me?

164
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,932
You wish. You spoke for Hou Chi in the Heavenly Palace.

165
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,591
I'm just returning the favor.

166
00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:19,715
Don't worry. I'll take care of myself. You don't have to worry about me.

167
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:21,384
Keep a safe distance from me.

168
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:25,270
Or they'd say you were colluding with Qingchi Palace and the Demon Clan.

169
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:27,932
Feng Ran, I'm not afraid of that.

170
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:33,149
All right. I... I'm here... here to ask you if you know the whereabouts of Hou Chi.

171
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:35,319
Hou Chi?

172
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:36,739
Didn't she go back to Qingchi Palace?

173
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,167
I heard she and Qing Mu had already gotten back when I toured Dibei City in the Human Realm.

174
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:45,426
They said they were going to the North Sea, then they would go back to Qingchi Palace.

175
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,116
They're supposed to be in Qingchi Palace by now.

176
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:49,375
The North Sea?

177
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:56,791
The figure that just ran away was the three-headed fire dragon.

178
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,120
Why did he ambush us here?

179
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:01,014
He's shameless.

180
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:04,799
Immediately after being kidnapped by Wu Huan, his spiritual power increased greatly to rob the Halberd of Sun and Moon.

181
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,056
He must have become the lackey of the Heavenly Palace.

182
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:10,950
Jing Yuan, why do you look so pale?

183
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:13,799
The spiritual power under the sea is thin.

184
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,639
My spiritual veins were damaged when I tried to improve my spiritual power.

185
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,928
I just need some rest.

186
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:22,963
Hou Chi, let's get back to Qingchi Palace,

187
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,177
and tell Upper God Gu Jun we met Bo Xuan and the three-headed fire dragon.

188
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:28,321
Let's leave it up to Upper God Gu Jun.

189
00:15:29,614 --> 00:15:31,813
My naughty girl, I finally found you.

190
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:32,899
What are you doing here?

191
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,979
You don't even know the Heavenly Palace is against us

192
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,041
because you stopped the war in the Luocha Region.

193
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,420
What are you doing in the North Sea?

194
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,507
Feng Ran, we've found Bo Xuan.

195
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:51,877
Congratulations, Your Highness.

196
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:56,507
With the Halberd of Sun and Moon, you can take over Qingchi Palace.

197
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:04,891
You did a good job.

198
00:16:04,892 --> 00:16:07,063
You didn't let me down.

199
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:09,670
Your Highness, I'm flattered.

200
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,234
If Qing Mu and Hou Chi can't return Halberd of Sun and Moon in three days,

201
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:15,840
you can spin the guilt of conspiring with the Demon God on them.

202
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,727
Gu Jun is partial to them. He'll defend them.

203
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,640
Qingchi Palace lacks support. It's hard to restore it to its original glory.

204
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,099
Your Highness removed Qingchi Palace with a little trick.

205
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,449
Many for the price of one.

206
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,140
Enough.

207
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:36,569
I'll give you the eagle dart.

208
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,314
This old dragon thanks Your Highness.

209
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:51,111
Lord Zi Han.

210
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:54,350
His Majesty sent more troops to the Luocha Region. It's huge.

211
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,770
I want to talk about it with Master face-to-face.

212
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:01,470
No need. Master said it's all up to  Demon Emperor unless he summons someone.

213
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:04,439
Hasn't Master come back yet?

214
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,042
He's been cultivating in Purple Moon Spring.

215
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,910
I don't believe it. Why do you hide it?

216
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,241
Master hasn't come back to Triple Heaven after the war in the Luocha Region.

217
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,413
The situation about immortals and demons has changed a lot.

218
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:17,813
We need Master to make decisions about everything.

219
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:19,470
Where did he go?

220
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,830
Sen Jian, how dare you ask about the whereabouts of Master?

221
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,600
This is arrogance.

222
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:31,699
What? I was just out for a few days.

223
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,813
And you were not able to be the Demon Emperor.

224
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:35,408
Master, please forgive my sins.

225
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:38,069
Zi Han, come with me.

226
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,549
- Master. 
 - Master!

227
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:47,364
Your spiritual veins are hurt. Let me get you inside.

228
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:53,364
   

229
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,507
Master.

230
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,080
Little Goddess is back with Lord Bo Xuan.

231
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,580
- Where are they? 
 - In Huajing Pond.

232
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:08,728
 Hou Chi found him. 

233
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:15,624
Upper God.

234
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:20,478
- Master. 
 - Father God.

235
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:22,520
You're not angry with me?

236
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,570
Nurturing kindness is greater than giving birth to kindness.

237
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,585
You're the only Father God in my life.

238
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:29,700
I misunderstood you before.

239
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,720
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

240
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:40,100
I'm glad that you're back.

241
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:44,570
Hou Chi, Master was not able to eat or drink when you were in the Human Realm these past days.

242
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,313
He told me about you every day.

243
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:48,090
He said he regretted it.

244
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:51,148
He should have told you the story of your birth earlier.

245
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:58,837
By the way, how did you find Bo Xuan?

246
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,823
You said it was because of Qing Mu's dream. It's too strange.

247
00:19:01,823 --> 00:19:05,173
Upper God, please check Bo Xuan.

248
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,479
 You endured the tearing of the core power... 

249
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:40,678
 for Master Shang Gu. 

250
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:44,512
Father God.

251
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:47,736
Bo Xuan was injured by Sky Thunder when he experienced the ordeal.

252
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,973
Now his spiritual consciousness has been sealed. He's fallen into a deep sleep.

253
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:52,319
Then when will he wake up?

254
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,627
Don't worry. Bo Xuan's spiritual power is strong.

255
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,719
He'll wake up when his spiritual consciousness has been repaired.

256
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:01,013
Take good care of him.

257
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:04,200
Don't worry, Father God. I'll take care of him.

258
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,278
Qing Mu, come with me.

259
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:26,439
It has been uninhabited for many years and has become deserted.

260
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:30,114
Feng Ran, go to fetch some decorations from my study.

261
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,914
Oh yeah, light Eaglewood of the South Sea.

262
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:36,679
Bo Xuan likes to read with eaglewood.

263
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,456
And ask the kitchen to reheat some Peach Wine. Bo Xuan likes drinking.

264
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:44,056
He used to drink a pot of wine every day.

265
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:46,910
Okay, I'll go now.

266
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:18,600
Did anyone know you found Bo Xuan, except for you two and Feng Ran?

267
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,499
Thanks to Demon God, we got Bo Xuan out of the frozen cave of the North Sea and brought him back.

268
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:27,199
So, he knows.

269
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,014
Upper God, what's wrong?

270
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,920
Demon God is treacherous.

271
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,610
He's guilty of a big sin of killing gods and destroying the world.

272
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:41,330
He helped you because he has his own purpose.

273
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,541
He disregarded the parley and provoked the war in the Luocha Region.

274
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,358
Of course, Qingchi Palace was inevitably blamed.

275
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:51,719
Don't have anything more to do with him.

276
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:54,149
I see.

277
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,710
Upper God,

278
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,235
I felt strange... when I first saw Bo Xuan.

279
00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:05,470
What was strange?

280
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,910
It seemed a god consciousness...

281
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,610
entered my body.

282
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:15,930
Is Bo Xuan...

283
00:22:19,344 --> 00:22:24,514
Your relationship with Hou Chi can be regarded as making up for the regrets of the two of them.

284
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,729
Upper God, do you mean...

285
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:34,301
True God Bai Jue loved True God Shang Gu very much?

286
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,490
The second half of what I just said to Hou Chi is true.

287
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,472
Bo Xuan will wake up when his god consciousness has recovered.

288
00:22:48,473 --> 00:22:51,925
When he wakes up, you'll...

289
00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:02,453
If you can live another year, it is one more year.

290
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,446
I'll love her more every day.

291
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:07,177
Don't worry, Upper God.

292
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:11,150
I'll stick with it all the way.

293
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:17,182
However... will True God Bai Jue treat Hou Chi nicely?

294
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:26,150
I can't even see through...

295
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:30,050
all kinds of predestined fate in this world.

296
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:35,343
Anyway, I have no regrets.

297
00:23:38,157 --> 00:23:39,527
All right.

298
00:23:39,528 --> 00:23:42,799
The personal matter is over. Now, to business.

299
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,127
Give the Halberd of Sun and Moon to me. I need it to deal with the Heavenly Palace.

300
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:48,809
Oh no.

301
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,200
As we expected.

302
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,042
What happened?

303
00:23:57,585 --> 00:24:02,213
Hou Chi, are you not curious as to what it is under this mask?

304
00:24:02,214 --> 00:24:03,870
Yes, I wonder.

305
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:05,584
Then why don't you remove it and look?

306
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:09,370
Anyway, Bo Xuan is lying here. He has no strength to fight back.

307
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:13,356
Bo Xuan once told me, unless he opened it by himself,

308
00:24:13,357 --> 00:24:15,699
no one could see his face.

309
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,400
Is there such a powerful spell?

310
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,827
Feng Ran, do you think Qing Mu looked strange just now?

311
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:27,584
Is he jealous because you care so much about Bo Xuan?

312
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:29,184
Not at all.

313
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:33,241
He called Jing Yuan "Tian Qi" in the North Sea.

314
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:34,441
Tian Qi?

315
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:37,500
Isn't it the name of Demon God in ancient times?

316
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,456
- Three-headed fire dragon? 
 - Now, Halberd of Sun and Moon has been stolen.

317
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:46,850
Heavenly Queen will pin the guilt of conspiring with Demon God on Qingchi Palace.

318
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:53,184
That is correct. Many immortals saw Hou Chi fight Jing Yang in the Luocha Region.

319
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:55,428
You helped Demon God beat back Wu Huan.

320
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:58,441
If we can't return the Halberd of Sun and Moon in three days,

321
00:24:58,442 --> 00:25:02,099
the whole Immortal Clan will fight against Qingchi Palace.

322
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,929
I'll find a way to get back the Halberd of Sun and Moon now.

323
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:11,084
It's too late. I'm afraid Wu Huan has got it now.

324
00:25:12,957 --> 00:25:14,542
It's all my fault.

325
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:18,000
If not for me, the Heavenly Palace wouldn't have targeted Qingchi Palace.

326
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:21,139
Wrong.

327
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:24,290
It's not all on you.

328
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,042
Although Wu Huan is domineering,

329
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:33,984
she wouldn't have such a big grudge against Qingchi Palace for this.

330
00:25:33,985 --> 00:25:38,330
What the hell is she doing this for?

331
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,384
 You instructed them to collude with Demon God. 

332
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:52,857
 Upper God Gu Jun, do you mean... 

333
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:58,171
 you want to declare yourself an enemy of the Heavenly Palace and betray the Immortal Clan? 

334
00:25:58,171 --> 00:26:00,142
 Hou Chi absorbed Pilgrim Hall. 

335
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,714
 Mu Guang even suspected Hou Chi's identity. 

336
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:07,739
 Wu Huan wanted to kill Hou Chi, instead of noticing it. Why? 

337
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:09,457
 Wu Huan. 

338
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:13,527
 How much of your loyalty to Master Shang Gu was true? 

339
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:15,660
 It's Demon God. 

340
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:19,927
 He killed my master. 

341
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:22,859
 Wu Huan saw it. 

342
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,327
 Sorry. 

343
00:26:24,328 --> 00:26:26,727
 Demon God killed Goddess Yue Mi. 

344
00:26:26,728 --> 00:26:29,180
 Only Wu Huan saw it. 

345
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,299
 Master Bai Jue listened to Wu Huan, then he... 

346
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,060
Upper God.  Upper God.

347
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,985
Are you okay?

348
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:46,601
I'm fine. Don't worry.

349
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:52,156
No matter what Wu Huan is going to do, I won't let her succeed again.

350
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:27,979
Hou Chi, are you okay?

351
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,413
Why is this happening?

352
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:33,619
Didn't my Father God say his spiritual consciousness was hurt when he experienced the ordeal?

353
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,869
I see that he is clearly in a state of losing his spiritual power.

354
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,185
I'm afraid he won't be able to return when the cold air spreads all over his body.

355
00:27:39,814 --> 00:27:42,714
Is there any way to save him?

356
00:27:42,714 --> 00:27:46,441
The only way is so difficult. Heaven and Earth gather spiritual energy to create treasures.

357
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:51,013
I heard only the Soul Tower, Spirit Gathering Pearl and Demon Gathering Flag should be gathered.

358
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:55,449
These three treasures can be brought together in order to reunite his spiritual power, nurture his body, and restore him.

359
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,528
Where are the three treasures?

360
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:01,160
Feng Ran.

361
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:05,527
Upper God Gu Jun has gone to the Heavenly Palace to do something.

362
00:28:05,528 --> 00:28:07,230
Gathering the Three Treasures is of great importance.

363
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,299
It is important to wait for Upper God to come back before making a decision.

364
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,320
Did my Father God say when he'd be back?

365
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,479
I don't think... Bo Xuan is going to make it that long.

366
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:23,269
Spirit Gathering Pearl is the Heavenly Palace's spiritual item. Demon Gathering Flag controls evil beasts.

367
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:26,499
Soul Tower suppresses evil auras and protects the Human Realm.

368
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,513
Not to mention how dangerous our trip would be, even if we got the three treasures,

369
00:28:30,513 --> 00:28:33,299
Qingchi Palace will instantly become the enemy of the three realms.

370
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,557
By then, how could your Father God protect Qilian Mountain on his own?

371
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,857
Hou Chi, Qing Mu is right.

372
00:28:41,857 --> 00:28:45,260
Let's ask Upper God Gu Jun's opinion when he comes back.

373
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:59,079
Your Highness, immortals and demons sent troops to Luocha Region without fighting. Why?

374
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:01,127
The Human Realm was implicated in the war.

375
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:04,014
My Father God is too merciful to see the Human Realm meet with misfortune.

376
00:29:04,014 --> 00:29:06,830
That's why the Demon Clan got a bargain.

377
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,985
If it were up to me in wartime,

378
00:29:08,985 --> 00:29:13,079
my heavenly soldiers and cavalries would have already destroyed Xuanjing Palace by now.

379
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,619
Your Highness, watch your words.

380
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,913
Gu Jun. Why is he here?

381
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:49,520
I heard you were here right after my tour of the four seas.

382
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,956
Three days haven't come.

383
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:54,099
What are you doing in the Heavenly Palace?

384
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,800
Mu Guang.

385
00:29:57,014 --> 00:30:04,328
Do you remember the deal between us when we left the God Realm 60,000 years ago?

386
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:11,428
We agreed to reopen the God Realm sooner or later.

387
00:30:11,428 --> 00:30:15,627
Get all gods back and restore it to its original glory.

388
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:21,079
For these thousands of years, I've never forgotten our promise.

389
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:26,400
Otherwise, I wouldn't have asked you to get back the divine weapons.

390
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:32,914
Are you sure you really didn't ask me to retrieve the artifacts for yourself?

391
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,228
Immortals fought against demons for the past 60,000 years.

392
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:38,113
Even if you didn't do that to unify the three realms,

393
00:30:38,113 --> 00:30:42,057
they're chaotic because of you.

394
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:45,042
The Demon Clan helped Demon God destroy the world,

395
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,299
which got my master killed.

396
00:30:48,878 --> 00:30:50,699
I can't let it go.

397
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,870
But now Demon God is still alive.

398
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:58,503
Did you ever think... there maybe another reason...

399
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,756
for Goddess Yue Mi's death?

400
00:31:01,757 --> 00:31:05,230
Goddess Yue Mi was very close to the four True Gods.

401
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,670
If Demon God killed Goddess Yue Mi,

402
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:12,800
why did True God Bai Jue spare Demon God's life?

403
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,958
Besides, who saw Demon God kill Goddess Yue Mi?

404
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:21,013
Wu Huan saw it.

405
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:24,239
You said it was Wu Huan.

406
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:26,618
You didn't see it.

407
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,938
Gu Jun, what do you mean?

408
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:32,242
You suspect Wu Huan of lying?

409
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,200
Back then, there were too many turbulent things in the God Realm to investigate.

410
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,310
Wu Huan has been with you for 60,000 years.

411
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:43,314
You know who she is better than me.

412
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:47,047
You have no doubts of...

413
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,620
what happened in the Swamp of Netherhill.

414
00:31:52,471 --> 00:31:56,900
Now, Demon God and the four divine weapons have shown up.

415
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,319
We'll reopen the God Realm sooner or later.

416
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:04,359
But before that, I want you to find out the truth.

417
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:10,284
To give Goddess Yue Mi and all gods who died in the Swamp of Netherhill an explanation.

418
00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:14,085
I have to go to the Luocha Region to purify evil auras created by the war.

419
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:16,070
Think about it.

420
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,380
What?

421
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,213
Gu Jun came to see your Father God?

422
00:32:38,214 --> 00:32:41,280
It's true, Mother God.

423
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,470
I saw with my own eyes Gu Jun came to the Heavenly Palace alone.

424
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,471
I found out Gu Jun had been waiting for my Father God

425
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:50,030
all night on Cloud Platform after I asked my man to check it.

426
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,600
Did you find out why he came here?

427
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,213
It's quiet on Cloud Platform.

428
00:32:56,214 --> 00:33:00,828
The attendant heard Gu Jun argue with my Father God.

429
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:04,960
They mentioned the name of "Yue Mi."

430
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,379
Your Highness, you don't have to worry.

431
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,420
Qingchi Palace can't return the Halberd of Sun and Moon,

432
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,785
Upper God Gu Jun must be here to ask for mercy from His Majesty.

433
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,160
They can't return the Halberd of Sun and Moon?

434
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,436
Did Qing Mu give it to Demon God?

435
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:24,384
If they can give it back,

436
00:33:24,385 --> 00:33:27,400
why did Gu Jun argue with your Father God?

437
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,219
I know about Qingchi Palace.

438
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:35,619
You just do what your Father God told you to do.

439
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,071
Yes, Mother God.

440
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:41,038
You just came back from the battlefield. You must be tired.

441
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:43,219
Go back to get some sleep.

442
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,899
I misspoke. Forgive me, Your Highness.

443
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,538
Go bring Three-head here.

444
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:57,040
Yes.

445
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,660
 Why did Gu Jun mention Yue Mi to Mu Guang suddenly? 

446
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,179
 Did he find out something? 

447
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,098
Before I found Bo Xuan, I always thought there was hope that he was not in danger.

448
00:34:15,098 --> 00:34:17,059
Now I found him.

449
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:19,520
But he's like this.

450
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,339
I didn't expect... the way to save him would get so many involved.

451
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,139
Qing Mu.

452
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,840
I don't want to make it hard on you and Feng Ran.

453
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,939
And I don't want Qingchi Palace to be a target.

454
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,719
But I really want to help Bo Xuan.

455
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,780
Hou Chi, can you tell me about Bo Xuan?

456
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,659
How did he treat you?

457
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,639
He was nice to me.

458
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:51,442
He left Qingchi Palace to experience the thunder ordeal the last time I saw him.

459
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,258
 It's so beautiful. I like it so much. 

460
00:34:55,258 --> 00:34:59,800
 If you like it, I'll bring you here when I'm free. 

461
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:04,020
 10,000 years. This is the deal between us. 

462
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,239
 I'll be back in 10,000 years. 

463
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,339
 I'll find you no matter where you are. 

464
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,000
 Bo Xuan will wake up when his god consciousness is fixed. 

465
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,499
 But when he wakes up, you'll... 

466
00:35:27,779 --> 00:35:29,271
Qing Mu.

467
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:33,030
Will you hate me if I insist on getting the three treasures?

468
00:35:36,328 --> 00:35:38,460
Did you think it through?

469
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,127
I can ignore anyone.

470
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:47,570
But I can't watch Bo Xuan die for nothing without doing anything.

471
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,560
Fine.

472
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,013
Now that you've decided, I'll help you get the three treasures.

473
00:35:58,013 --> 00:36:00,498
But you should agree to my terms.

474
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:05,080
All the crimes of this adventure will be borne by me alone.

475
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,879
Okay.

476
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,490
It's up to you.

477
00:36:29,485 --> 00:36:31,560
What are you doing?

478
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,819
I want to protect you and Qingchi Palace.

479
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:41,560
Please allow me to be willful one last time.

480
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,442
This is my Father God's God-Sealing Spell.

481
00:36:45,442 --> 00:36:47,940
There's his Upper God's power on it.

482
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,398
You can't break it. It'll expire in a day.

483
00:36:51,398 --> 00:36:53,927
Hou Chi, you can't go alone.

484
00:36:53,928 --> 00:36:57,278
What should I do if you're in danger? Break it for me.

485
00:36:57,278 --> 00:37:00,327
I'll return to Qingchi Palace when I have gotten the three treasures.

486
00:37:00,328 --> 00:37:03,379
I'm wrong this time. Take care.

487
00:37:03,379 --> 00:37:05,100
Hou Chi!

488
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:22,784
Three-head, did something change in the North Sea that day?

489
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:26,627
Your Highness, forgive me. Demon God's spiritual power was strong.

490
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:29,280
I'm afraid he recognized me.

491
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,578
What? How dare you not deliberately tell me this!

492
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,358
Damn you! This old dragon, if I have to tolerate you, I'm a worm!

493
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,541
I know you're cunning. You're courting death!

494
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:53,678
Your Highness, I found other news.

495
00:37:53,678 --> 00:37:56,000
Please spare this old dragon.

496
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,760
When I surrounded them,

497
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,379
I heard the Lord of the North Sea mention the name of "Bo Xuan" to Hou Chi.

498
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,498
Although I don't know who Bo Xuan is,

499
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:13,800
Qing Mu asked Hou Chi to take Bo Xuan and go.

500
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,719
Bo Xuan?

501
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,360
Did they go to the North Sea for Bo Xuan?

502
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,320
If you dare play tricks with me again...

503
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:31,779
This old dragon will never dare to deceive the queen!

504
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:33,927
I dare not.

505
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:35,500
Absolutely not.

506
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,784
- Leave. 
 - Thank you, Your Highness.

507
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,080
Bo Xuan?

508
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,600
Is he related to the portrait on the stone chamber at the bottom of Huajing Pond?

509
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,199
No way.

510
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:02,841
I have to send someone to watch Qingchi Palace.

511
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:05,240
Or I'll be at a disadvantage.

512
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:12,179
The book says Soul Tower was handed down since ancient times.

513
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,750
It can suppress any evil aura in the Human Realm.

514
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:18,314
It's said it's in the Underground Palace of the imperial mausoleum in the Human Realm.

515
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,180
That's Soul Tower.

516
00:40:07,414 --> 00:40:10,299
No one of the three realms goes near Soul Tower.

517
00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:12,913
Who are you? How dare you come to steal the tower?

518
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:15,498
Lord, are you Immortal Bi Xi who watches the tower?

519
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:18,498
How dare you come to steal the tower since you know me?

520
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,200
Lord, you have me wrong.

521
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,198
I just want to borrow it to save someone.

522
00:40:22,198 --> 00:40:24,499
I'll bring it back.

523
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,370
Greedy villains come here with the same excuse as you.

524
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,490
Soul Tower can be a help to cultivation.

525
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,559
How will you return it after you borrow it?

526
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,818
You could break into the Underground Palace, which proves your cultivation is not weak.

527
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:42,778
It's hard to gain the millennial cultivation and your spiritual aura is pure,

528
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:44,399
I won't kill you.

529
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:46,180
Leave at once.

530
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,828
I must get Soul Tower today.

531
00:40:48,828 --> 00:40:53,038
If you're determined not to lend it to me, I can only offend you.

532
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:21,980


533
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:33,400
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

534
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:40,321
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

535
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:46,755
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

536
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:52,777
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

537
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:59,711
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

538
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:06,288
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

539
00:42:06,288 --> 00:42:13,600
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

540
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:19,666
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

541
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:37,380
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

542
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:43,860
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

543
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:51,088
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

544
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:57,933
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

545
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:06,220
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

546
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:12,999
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

547
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:19,555
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

548
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:26,080
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

549
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:36,788
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
