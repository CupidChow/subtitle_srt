1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,990


2
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:21,380
   

3
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,000
   

4
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:42,871
 Unite the origin and break the three purifying states. 

5
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:32,240
 Who has been helping me when I was in danger all these years? 

6
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:06,284
Bai Jue even said the most horrible thing of the evil aura was

7
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:10,456
it'd attach itself to the wound and consume the divine power gradually.

8
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:12,827
I must pull it out immediately.

9
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:15,170
Or it'll destabilize the origin.

10
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:20,413
However, the Netherworld is so big.

11
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:24,480
I haven't seen any herbs he told me about.

12
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,384
This ganoderma is so huge.

13
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:36,613
They look older than the God Realm.

14
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:39,170
I think they probably work.

15
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,039
Emperor Sword, I didn't expect you were capable of this.

16
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,341
You were being underutilized in the God Realm.

17
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:57,671
You're here with me, so I have nothing to worry about.

18
00:05:07,178 --> 00:05:09,163
 This is Devil Ganoderma. 

19
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:13,349
 If you take them, you'll suffer from cold to a coma. 

20
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,349
 Look at you. 

21
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,935
 You've forgotten everything I taught you. 

22
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:21,291
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

23
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:25,291
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

24
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:30,263
I wonder what they're doing now.

25
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:34,206
Yue Mi must have hired a god to tell stories.

26
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:36,760
What's the story today?

27
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:40,230
I wonder if I would know it.

28
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:44,549
Emperor Sword, it must be the orchid.

29
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:50,770
After I took it, I seem to be groggy, instead of better.

30
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,207
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

31
00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:00,450
I'm the chief god of the three realms.

32
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,691
If I were killed by an immortal herb,

33
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:05,970
people would laugh at me.

34
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:11,250
Shang Gu, you can't fall asleep.

35
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,850
This is a den of wolves.

36
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:28,028
 You must be tired. 

37
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:29,120
 Get some sleep. 

38
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,820
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

39
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:42,449
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

40
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,734
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

41
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:49,690
Ice Cube Bai, I'm trying so hard to be someone that deserves you.

42
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,248
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

43
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:58,134
In this millennium, you must be cold to all the goddesses as usual.

44
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:04,549
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

45
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:11,449
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

46
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:17,999
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

47
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:24,534
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

48
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:27,591
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫ 

49
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:32,206
 Shang Gu, when you inherit the chief god's feather instruction, 

50
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:36,383
 I'll tell you everything in my heart. 

51
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:49,900
Yue Mi, come out.

52
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:54,556
You followed me all the way.

53
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,770
I didn't mean to do so.

54
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,241
I wanted to do the same thing as you in the Netherworld.

55
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:02,340
After I listened to Zhi Yang, I could only come back.

56
00:08:03,242 --> 00:08:05,199
The way back to the God Realm is the same.

57
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,128
You can't say I followed you on purpose.

58
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:08,418
The way back to the God Realm?

59
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:11,370
Come on. Here's Everlasting Hall.

60
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,119
All right. Don't follow me.

61
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,820
I'm not that upset.

62
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,899
Lies.

63
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:18,470
You can't look in the other person's eyes when you're lying.

64
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,614
- You. 
 - All right. Fine.

65
00:08:20,614 --> 00:08:23,299
I do want Shang Gu to inherit the throne of the chief god soon.

66
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,178
But I don't want her to go to the Netherworld.

67
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:29,013
Yeah. We don't want her to leave.

68
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:30,609
Look, she went to the Netherworld.

69
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,870
- What if she's injured or something happened to her again? 
 - You.

70
00:08:36,157 --> 00:08:38,458
She's bolder than us.

71
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,884
Maybe she's already mature.

72
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:43,299
But we can't let her go.

73
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,698
It's all my incompetence.

74
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,240
Tian Qi.

75
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:51,299
Master.

76
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,456
Master Tian Qi.

77
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:53,899
What are you so happy about?

78
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:58,059
Master, I've figured out the fourth state of Tai Yin Six Forms.

79
00:08:58,728 --> 00:09:01,378
For just the fourth state and you're happy.

80
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,184
Gu Jun is already a god.

81
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:05,856
Master, since I entered the God Realm,

82
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,540
I've been working on the cultivation every day.

83
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:13,413
Why do you take it out on my apprentice?

84
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:15,127
Just a move and you can't take it.

85
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:17,120
Loser.

86
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,241
I'm okay.

87
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:23,598
His Highness is enlightening me.

88
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:26,059
You're wise.

89
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:28,441
Go.

90
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,850
Yes.

91
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,358
You.

92
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:37,841
You're a thick master.

93
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:39,498
That's why his cultivation is stagnant.

94
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:42,139
I saw bruises on his meridians, so I helped him clear them.

95
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,741
- I... 
 - What?

96
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:45,410
Come in and drink.

97
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,240
Wait for me.

98
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:55,127
Her Royal Highness left for cultivation.

99
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,027
She'll be gone for a millennium.

100
00:09:57,027 --> 00:10:00,299
God attendants always like to gossip.

101
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,227
They envy me.  They think Her Royal Highness values me.

102
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:07,728
What should I do if they don't listen to me?

103
00:10:09,728 --> 00:10:12,913
I was used to being alone when I was in the abyss and marsh.

104
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:17,610
I don't have much experience with people.

105
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,013
Gu Jun. Wu Huan.

106
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:22,498
My spiritual power is better.

107
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:23,799
Why not we compare it?

108
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,870
Perfect timing.

109
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:28,578
Wu Huan, Mu Guang has a big family and he ran the army.

110
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:30,199
He'll figure it out.

111
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,680
What is it?

112
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,999
After our master left,

113
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:39,760
Wu Huan is afraid that she can't deal with those god attendants.

114
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:44,413
They didn't like me.

115
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:46,827
However, Her Royal Highness is partial to me.

116
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:48,759
They can't show hatred for me before her.

117
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,540
Now...

118
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,370
Her Royal Highness is gone.

119
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,784
It's time to assert your authority.

120
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:58,390
Assert my authority?

121
00:10:59,514 --> 00:11:01,458
I'm lucky if they're not mean to me.

122
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,084
Although you're the sacred beast of a chief god,

123
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:05,713
while Her Royal Highness was here,

124
00:11:05,713 --> 00:11:08,427
you were a god attendant like them.

125
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:10,484
Now Her Royal Highness has left,

126
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:13,699
you're in charge of Pilgrim Hall.

127
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,641
Target kind people and make them work for you.

128
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:19,284
As for people who disobey you,

129
00:11:19,284 --> 00:11:20,713
don't be afraid of them.

130
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,184
Punish them severely if you catch their mistakes.

131
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:25,527
Then grant them favors.

132
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:28,380
Over time, they'll obey you.

133
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,600
Use both hard and soft tactics.

134
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,184
Yes.

135
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:36,541
The key to leading an army is just about empathy.

136
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,339
Show both authority and favors.

137
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,384
It's not that easy.

138
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:44,879
What if people who disobey me become worse and bully me?

139
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,170
Don't worry about it.

140
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,140
I'm here with you. I'll thump anyone who bullies you.

141
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,979
Okay. I'll try.

142
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:59,399
I'll manage Pilgrim Hall well in this millennium.

143
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,850
Not to embarrass Her Royal Highness.

144
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,156
You can do it.

145
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,927
Oh yeah, you just said your spiritual power is better.

146
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:10,730
It is thanks to Master Tian Qi.

147
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:13,470
Let's practice.

148
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:16,299
Okay, go on. You make each other better.

149
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm going to get you some tea.

150
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,279
- Thank you. 
 - Thanks.

151
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:33,884
The God Realm ordered you to watch the Netherworld.

152
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:35,527
But you're negligent.

153
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:37,084
What should be the punishment?

154
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:38,219
Oh, it's you.

155
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:40,598
You're in this way. Don't pull rank on us.

156
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:41,499
How dare you?

157
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:43,618
I'm the upper god who controls the seasons of the Lower Realm.

158
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:46,018
If you keep being impudent, I'll tell the God Realm.

159
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:47,179
Bring it on.

160
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:49,370
Everyone knows you were sent here.

161
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,384
Whoever was demoted to watch the Netherworld

162
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:53,156
never got a chance to go back to the God Realm.

163
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:57,630
Don't waste time talking to me and get out of here.

164
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,213
 Shang Gu. 

165
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:03,656
 I'll go back there fair and square someday. 

166
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:05,950
 And I'll make you pay. 

167
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:36,269
 ♫ Listen to the monologue of everything under the ger ♫ 

168
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:43,185
 ♫ See the waves come and go with the mountains ♫ 

169
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:49,900
 ♫ Watch the road be covered with heavy mist ♫ 

170
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:59,227
 ♫ I'm always standing here on the clouds outside the universe ♫ 

171
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:04,169
 ♫ Time loaned me the eternal galaxy ♫ 

172
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:07,209
 ♫ But where's the old friend ♫ 

173
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:13,370
 ♫ Leaving a shadow and haunting dreams ♫ 

174
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:21,127
 ♫ How many years have been reincarnated 
 after thousands of tribulations? ♫ 

175
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:27,580
 ♫ Looks like you're before me 
 and there are mountains and oceans between us ♫ 

176
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:49,310
 ♫ Who's standing on the cloud alone a millennium ago? ♫ 

177
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:56,071
 ♫ The snow on the top of the mountains hasn't melted in years ♫ 

178
00:14:56,071 --> 00:15:02,899
 ♫ Like the moon without dust ♫ 

179
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,999
 ♫ Risking your life to save the world ♫ 

180
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:12,000
 ♫ By swinging the sword and breaking the clouds ♫ 

181
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:33,639
Look!  Who is it?

182
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:36,256
What great divine power.

183
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,741
It's God Gu Jun.

184
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:44,659
He was selected into Pilgrim Hall by True God Shang Gu a millennium ago.

185
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:46,970
He's handsome.

186
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,384
I wish I could be picked to cultivate in Pilgrim Hall in this Selection Event.

187
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,659
Come on, you're lazy in cultivation.

188
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:56,338
How could you be in Pilgrim Hall?

189
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:58,480
Maybe the next life.

190
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,714
Thank you, Master.

191
00:18:28,385 --> 00:18:30,900
Good, you have gotten better.

192
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:33,484
Mu Guang has been a god for many years.

193
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:35,684
I just promoted him to one of the Twelve Star Envoys

194
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:38,400
to share my duty of managing the three realms.

195
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:42,041
Keep calm and focus on cultivation.

196
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:44,018
Don't let your master down.

197
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:45,756
I won't.

198
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,359
Mu Guang is much firmer than me.

199
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,518
All these years,

200
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:53,984
I never once successfully convinced him to play Pai Guo Poker and Madiao Card with me.

201
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:56,271
He never indulged in having fun.

202
00:18:57,642 --> 00:19:00,484
Oh, yeah! What are you doing here?

203
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:03,620
You're not here just to guide Mu Guang.

204
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,942
Here's the gift for your 100,000th birthday.

205
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:12,399
It's a few days away.

206
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:14,240
I can't hide it.

207
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:16,027
Thank you.

208
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:18,056
By the way, there's good news.

209
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,039
What?

210
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,956
The Power of Chaos in the Lower Realm is growing.

211
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:24,639
So, Zhi Yang and I guess that Shang Gu will be coming back soon.

212
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:27,013
That's great.

213
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:31,440
Master, I want to tell Gu Jun about this good news.

214
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,270
Only Gu Jun?

215
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,100
Not Wu Huan?

216
00:19:36,957 --> 00:19:39,614
Master, I'm leaving.

217
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:46,784
When did he and Wu Huan get together?

218
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,570
He's like me in that way.

219
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,900
It's not even a possibility.

220
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:54,327
Come on. Let me take you to the storeroom.

221
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:58,019
I'll show Shang Gu all the good things I collected these years.

222
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:00,809
No way. You have to go to Everlasting Hall with me.

223
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,784
There's something for you to handle.

224
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,390
Yeah.

225
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:17,299
Master, the Dragon King of the East Sea sent over a pair of Sea Pearls yesterday.

226
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,618
He said it's a gift for your birthday in a month.

227
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,556
Master, you're in charge of Pilgrim Hall now.

228
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,719
You have True God Zhi Yang and True God Tian Qi's favor.

229
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:26,518
People in the God Realm all want to please you,

230
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,241
let alone immortals and devils.

231
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:30,978
Yeah. Now, you're the head of Pilgrim Hall.

232
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:34,580
Your birthday party should be larger than that of Moonlight Pavilion.

233
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,740
Nonsense!

234
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:44,910
My birthday party can't compare to that of Goddess Yue Mi.

235
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:04,150
Who broke this Red River Jade just now?

236
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:11,200
You won't say?

237
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,727
I'm in charge of Pilgrim Hall under Her Royal Highness's order.

238
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:20,841
Everything here is Her Royal Highness's treasures.

239
00:21:20,842 --> 00:21:23,000
You know my rules.

240
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,157
If you cover each other and dare hide it,

241
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:32,270
I'll kick you out of the God Realm.

242
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:35,340
 Master, please calm down. 

243
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:38,557
What is it? What's happened?

244
00:21:38,557 --> 00:21:40,799
Someone broke Her Royal Highness's Red River Jade.

245
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,327
I'm disciplining them.

246
00:21:42,328 --> 00:21:43,927
It's a jade.

247
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,813
Just give them a lecture.

248
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:47,927
You don't have to be that angry.

249
00:21:47,928 --> 00:21:51,356
Pilgrim Hall is the noblest place of the three realms.

250
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:54,741
If we don't have strict rules, outsiders will laugh at us.

251
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:57,184
It's nothing serious.

252
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:58,784
It's just a jade.

253
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:02,327
Since it's our master's favorite, ask them to be careful.

254
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:04,784
Her Royal Highness loves it.

255
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:06,899
I must be serious about it.

256
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,213
Fine, forget it.

257
00:22:08,214 --> 00:22:09,919
Leave.

258
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,257
 Master, Your Highness. 

259
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:17,319
Wu Huan, you keep punishing the god attendants.

260
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,827
It'll ruin Pilgrim Hall's honor.

261
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:22,520
After our master left, you have become overly anxious.

262
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,670
Her Royal Highness isn't here.

263
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:27,299
So, I don't know what I should do.

264
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,270
I'm always thinking about how to manage Pilgrim Hall well.

265
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:34,213
Not to let Her Royal Highness down.

266
00:22:34,214 --> 00:22:36,100
I understand you.

267
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,518
However, don't be too hard on yourself.

268
00:22:38,518 --> 00:22:42,756
I got it. Didn't God Zhi Yang ask you to check the three realms?

269
00:22:42,756 --> 00:22:45,820
Why are you back in less than a month?

270
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:48,913
There's something good in the God Realm.

271
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:51,510
I have to ask him to go back early.

272
00:22:53,357 --> 00:22:55,127
Right.

273
00:22:55,128 --> 00:22:59,641
Goddess Yue Mi's 100,000th birthday party will be in a few days.

274
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:03,027
You should be back to celebrate her birthday.

275
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:05,420
Our master is coming back.

276
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,141
Pardon me?

277
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:11,584
Seas and mountains of the Lower Realm started moving frequently a month ago.

278
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:15,849
Master Zhi Yang guessed our master must have gained the Power of Chaos.

279
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:17,470
She's coming back to the God Realm.

280
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:19,184
That's why it happened.

281
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:21,927
Right. I went to check it with Gu Jun.

282
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:25,441
The Power of Chaos comes out of all barriers of the Lower Realm.

283
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:29,839
The masters all assume True God Shang Gu will be back soon.

284
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,839
Wu Huan.

285
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,630
Are you okay?

286
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:38,684
Her Royal Highness is finally coming back.

287
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:42,319
I'm...  I'm too happy for the moment.

288
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,413
Thank you for your care to Pilgrim Hall all these years.

289
00:23:44,413 --> 00:23:48,600
When our master comes back, I'll help you practice your divine power.

290
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:57,538
"Shang Gu, it's been years. I have missed you so much."

291
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:00,218
No. It's too casual.

292
00:24:00,218 --> 00:24:01,840
Not formal enough.

293
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,380
Rewrite it.

294
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,970
No way. This is boring.

295
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,556
Shang Gu won't understand our expectations and longings for her.

296
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,540
Why don't you do it yourself?

297
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,641
I can't.

298
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:25,813
Come on, sit.

299
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:30,270
Goddess Yue Mi is a wordsmith. She's much better than others.

300
00:24:31,857 --> 00:24:36,280
I don't know why that silly girl would bear the loneliness in the Netherworld.

301
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:47,427
Luckily, her days there are going to end.

302
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:49,299
When she's back,

303
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,900
no matter what happens,

304
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,610
I'll never let her leave.

305
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:07,620
 The Source of the Guardian, I must get you. 

306
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,070
Your Royal Highness,

307
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:15,427
Over the past millennium, you've been exposed to cold and gotten injuries.

308
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:17,370
Don't you feel tired?

309
00:25:18,057 --> 00:25:21,699
We can't see Your Royal Highness be that miserable.

310
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,070
Why not return to the God Realm?

311
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:27,427
And we'll get along fine.

312
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:28,980
Go.

313
00:26:55,985 --> 00:26:57,656
 Why is this happening? 

314
00:26:57,656 --> 00:26:59,527
 Is it... 

315
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:01,278
 The Source of the Guardian is the greatest treasure. 

316
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:03,119
 It'll choose its owner. 

317
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,580
 What's war and what's killing? 

318
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,156
 Did Ancestral God create everything for killing? 

319
00:27:24,157 --> 00:27:25,999
 What is cause and what is effect? 

320
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:28,399
 There are so many people and you can never kill them all. 

321
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,680
 It can't be a good thing to end a war with war. 

322
00:27:56,114 --> 00:27:58,340
 The Source of Guardian. 

323
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:53,420
 I finally figured out the mystery 

324
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,018
 that the Power of Chaos can create everything 

325
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:58,680
 and swallow everything. 

326
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,270
 I've gained the Power of Chaos. 

327
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:06,041
 It's my choice to upturn the seas and mountains or to bring them peace. 

328
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:10,042
 From now on, the three realms are beneath my feet. 

329
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:13,580
 Everything is in my hands. 

330
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,579
Turns out the Power of Chaos is like that.

331
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,870
 Her Royal Highness is successful. 

332
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:33,459
My master finally got the Power of Chaos.

333
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:36,900
 Yeah, that's great. 

334
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:42,899
- Did you feel any movement just now? 
 - Movement?

335
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,441
I've never seen a devil for this millennium.

336
00:29:45,441 --> 00:29:47,360
Where's the movement?

337
00:29:48,142 --> 00:29:51,018
It's not about devils. It's most like...

338
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:53,238
 Most like the core spirit. 

339
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:55,539
 It's such a refined Power of Fire. 

340
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:59,219
 It must be Master Bai Jue. 

341
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:01,339
Stay here and watch. I'll be right back.

342
00:30:04,657 --> 00:30:05,841
Master Zhi Yang.

343
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:07,671
Master.

344
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,639
Master Zhi Yang, you can't go in.

345
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:11,459
My master is taking a bath.

346
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:12,679
Master Zhi Yang.

347
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:16,256
Master... I don't think it's right to do that.

348
00:30:16,256 --> 00:30:18,699
You said he was taking a bath an hour ago.

349
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:20,498
I don't believe it takes so long.

350
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:22,770
Go away. I want to go in.

351
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,190
What's up?

352
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:28,642
Bai Jue, I'm here to tell you.

353
00:30:28,642 --> 00:30:31,520
Shang Gu already got the Source of Guardian.

354
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,039
I know.

355
00:30:38,314 --> 00:30:40,613
Why is he so cool?

356
00:30:40,614 --> 00:30:42,990
Did he know before I did?

357
00:30:43,985 --> 00:30:45,970
What? Say it.

358
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:50,770
Master Zhi Yang, when will Her Royal Highness come back?

359
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,656
The Power of Chaos in the Lower Realm is unusual.

360
00:30:56,656 --> 00:30:59,610
 Shang Gu will return to the God Realm tomorrow. 

361
00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:06,200
Why are you laughing?

362
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,400
Demon King, I didn't let you down.

363
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:51,360
You did a good job.

364
00:31:53,642 --> 00:31:58,120
Demon King, we planned it for a millennium and sacrificed many of our men's lives.

365
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,279
That's why the Chief God of Chaos received great divine power.

366
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:03,284
Everything in the future will be what you want.

367
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:06,384
I've just learned the Goddess of Snow entered the Netherworld with her core spirit.

368
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:07,927
What do I have to do?

369
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:11,498
Everyone knows that the Devil Clan live in the land of purgatory.

370
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:14,779
But the people of the God Realm stepped into our place one by one.

371
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:16,541
Interesting.

372
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:18,584
I heard Xue Ying envied Shang Gu.

373
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:21,518
So, Bai Jue kicked her out of the God Realm.

374
00:32:21,518 --> 00:32:23,199
Why don't...

375
00:32:25,414 --> 00:32:27,810
we do her a favor?

376
00:32:50,242 --> 00:32:52,927
It caused damage when the core spirit was disconnected.

377
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:56,800
Master Bai Jue performed a spell with the core spirit for her.

378
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,379
Doesn't he know it'll destroy his Source of True God?

379
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,213
Good girl.

380
00:33:21,213 --> 00:33:23,158
You just took a millennium to gain the Power of Chaos.

381
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:25,241
But you look terrible.

382
00:33:25,242 --> 00:33:30,142
Thanks to you, or I wouldn't have been this bad this whole millennium.

383
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:33,339
But not for my methods,

384
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:35,770
you wouldn't have gained the Power of Chaos so quickly.

385
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:40,727
Right. I'll never forget that.

386
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,290
What?

387
00:33:43,128 --> 00:33:44,813
You're leaving?

388
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:46,656
I've got the Power of Chaos.

389
00:33:46,656 --> 00:33:49,256
And the barriers you set were broken.

390
00:33:49,256 --> 00:33:51,250
I should go back to the God Realm.

391
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,656
You got the Power of Chaos in a millennium.

392
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:57,627
The ancestor god Qing Tian was nothing more than that.

393
00:33:57,627 --> 00:33:59,641
You could be a god in a millennium

394
00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:02,527
because there's someone you have missed in the God Realm.

395
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:06,327
The four True Gods are like brothers.

396
00:34:06,328 --> 00:34:08,660
Don't say this nonsense.

397
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:15,130
I didn't say the one that you missed was a True God.

398
00:34:15,957 --> 00:34:18,459
You were sealed for so many years,

399
00:34:18,459 --> 00:34:20,438
so I'll let that pass.

400
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:22,020
I'm leaving.

401
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:24,619
Girl.

402
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,440
Take care.

403
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,570
Don't worry.

404
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,699
The God Realm will go easy on the Devil Clan

405
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,179
as long as you keep to your path.

406
00:34:39,971 --> 00:34:41,428
I'm going.

407
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:50,478
Those from the God Realm are always stupid.

408
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:53,398
All they know is to warn me.

409
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:59,056
They never knew the greatest enemy within the three realms

410
00:34:59,985 --> 00:35:02,120
was called destiny.

411
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:09,860
Mo Yu.

412
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,500
Yes, I'm here.

413
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,113
I've known about the God Realm from Shang Gu for this millennium.

414
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:24,913
Take my divine power and go to Blood Forest right now.

415
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:27,770
Break the Qiong Qi Barrier completely.

416
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,041
Remember, I've put evil aura into the Goddess of Snow.

417
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:35,478
She's the best pawn when you act in the God Realm.

418
00:35:35,478 --> 00:35:37,099
Yes.

419
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,650
It's been peace in the God Realm for so long.

420
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:46,279
Time for something to happen.

421
00:35:48,728 --> 00:35:53,400
Shang Gu, it's been a millennium. I miss you so much.

422
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,484
No.

423
00:35:56,484 --> 00:35:59,170
I come across too cold.

424
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,510
Shang Gu.

425
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,960
Ice Cube.

426
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,613
I've prepared it for a millennium.

427
00:36:06,614 --> 00:36:09,020
I can't let you see Shang Gu first.

428
00:36:18,321 --> 00:36:20,529
Why is your divine power so weak?

429
00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:22,307
None of your business.

430
00:36:25,335 --> 00:36:27,677
Your core spirit is disconnected.

431
00:36:27,677 --> 00:36:29,291
All these years, have you been...

432
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:31,668
It's normal to damage the core spirit during cultivation.

433
00:36:31,668 --> 00:36:33,690
Don't overreact.

434
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:38,149
Don't think I'll tell Shang Gu about it.

435
00:36:38,149 --> 00:36:41,620
Not a chance to engender sympathy. Got it?

436
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:46,591
Goddess of Snow, why are you here?

437
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:48,169
The fierce beasts, the Qiong Qi, broke out of the barrier.

438
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:51,030
Let me in. I want to see Master Zhi Yang.

439
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,688
Thank you, Your Highness.

440
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:28,689
Hold the barrier.

441
00:38:33,235 --> 00:38:34,489
Look at the time.

442
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,977
Why hasn't Shang Gu come out yet?

443
00:38:35,978 --> 00:38:37,179
Masters,

444
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:40,650
Master Shang Gu left the Netherworld half an hour ago.

445
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,889
Gods, I don't know why the Qiong Qi invaded our territory.

446
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:23,478
Weren't they sealed in the devil wilderness by Ancestral God?

447
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,229
It's not simple.

448
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,769
The Qiong Qi are fierce and horrible.

449
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,120
The people are no match for them.

450
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,299
We must guard the gate and wait for the true gods to come.

451
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,834
Qiong Qi's eyes can't see things.

452
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:37,019
For their numbers, they must be led by someone.

453
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,907
It'll make Qiong Qi panicky if we kill their leader.

454
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:18,210


455
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,899
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

456
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:33,680
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

457
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:40,099
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

458
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:46,259
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

459
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:53,059
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

460
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:59,419
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

461
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:06,840
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

462
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:13,300
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

463
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:32,139
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

464
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:38,619
