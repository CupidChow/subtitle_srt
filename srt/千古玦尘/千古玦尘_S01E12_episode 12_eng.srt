1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:09,960


2
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:21,120
   

3
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,992
   

4
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,220
The Qiong Qi appeared in the Lower Realm?

5
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,679
Yes. I saw it with my own eyes.

6
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,399
Now Nanhai City is in a mess now.

7
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,399
If True God Shang Gu and Bai Jue were not there,

8
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,799
I'm afraid something wrong might have happened.

9
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,779
- Bai Jue went to the Immortal Realm with Shang Gu? 
 - Tian Qi.

10
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:53,459
True God Shang Gu asked me to go back to the God Realm and tell you.

11
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,719
Please investigate the thing about the Qiong Qi.

12
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,100
You shall leave now.

13
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,459
Okay.

14
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,558
Don't pull a long face.

15
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:06,558
Although the Qiong Qi are fierce beasts from ancient times,

16
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,198
Shang Gu and Bai Jue are there.

17
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,380
There should be nothing wrong.

18
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,399
I'm afraid this thing is not that simple.

19
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:16,800
Don't forget, when the Qiong Qi attacked the God Realm last time,

20
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,520
we thought it was because of the devils.

21
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,327
But now the Qiong Qi appeared in the Lower Realm.

22
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:23,279
There must be something wrong in the Demon Realm.

23
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:24,699
Okay.

24
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,799
I'll go and check it.

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,980
I own the Demon Realm.

26
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,879
If anyone dares to create problems for me,

27
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,279
I'll let him feel regret.

28
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,779
I'll give you some divine power.

29
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:47,018
No need. It's just some old wounds.

30
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:48,519
I'll be fine after some rest.

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,239
Save your divine power to be in charge of the Chief God's instruction feather.

32
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,278
Something wrong is in Immortal Realm. We need to go back to the God Realm.

33
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,359
You still think I'm useless as I was a thousand years ago?

34
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,999
The war we had today was so fierce.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,478
I really enjoyed it.

36
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,900
We're more tacit than we were on Observation Mountain.

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,359
Now your divine power is high.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,899
You look like the Chief God of the three realms now.

39
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:25,079
The clan of Qiong Qi live in the desert of the Demon Realm sealed by Ancestral God.

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,398
I felt strange when the devils led them to the God Realm.

41
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:31,198
But they broke the barrier and came here today.

42
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,758
I guess Zhi Yang and Tian Qi have gone to the Demon Realm to investigate.

43
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,538
Don't worry. Let's go back to the God Realm first.

44
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:59,220
Shang Gu, you'll be in charge of Chief God's instruction feather tomorrow.

45
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,839
At that time, the gods in the God Realm and powerful people in the Lower Realm will come.

46
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:04,578
The inheriting ceremony will be complicated.

47
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,419
Relax. I've recited the sets of etiquette a few days ago.

48
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,379
There will be nothing wrong.

49
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,660
Okay.

50
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,478
Well, Chief God's instruction feather involves the Power of Laws and the Power of Chaos.

51
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:17,219
Be careful when taking it.

52
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:20,638
The Power of Chaos in my body has combined with the Power of Laws.

53
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:22,620
Chief God's instruction feather won't hurt me.

54
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,140
That's good.

55
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:29,259
True God Bai Jue. Don't worry.

56
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,199
I'll be the Chief God smoothly and inherit the God Realm.

57
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,659
I know, I was just reminding you.

58
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
If the goddesses who like you were here,

59
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,018
if they saw True God Bai Jue become a wordy old lady,

60
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,519
would they like someone else?

61
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:51,119
I don't care what they think.

62
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:53,620
I'll get some rest, goodbye.

63
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,039
Wait.

64
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,418
When you are in charge of the instruction feather, can you go to Peach Woods with me?

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,279
There is something on my mind.

66
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,940
I've been hiding it for a long time.

67
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,840
I want to tell you there.

68
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:27,500
It's a deal.

69
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,700
I'll definitely go.

70
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,599
Master, you really...

71
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,680
Enough. I've made up my mind.

72
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,719
This is the only solution.

73
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,600
But we can tell Master Zhi Yang and Bai Jue.

74
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,940
Zhi Yang and Bai Jue,

75
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,830
their destiny is to protect the world, Shang Gu, and millions of creatures.

76
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,140
Who do you think they will support?

77
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,319
What? You just made use of me.

78
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,219
Now you are turning against me?

79
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:43,399
Don't panic. You are becoming a devil now.

80
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,000
So,

81
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,159
we are the same to some extent.

82
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,278
Nonsense.

83
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,078
I'm the Goddess of Snow.

84
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,079
How could I be the same as you?

85
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,038
Whether you're a devil or not, you have plenty of time to think.

86
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,119
But don't forget the thing you promised me.

87
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,639
At the inheritance ceremony tomorrow, you'll be the spy for the devils.

88
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,299
We've helped you go back to the God Realm.

89
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:17,160
I think such a little request is not too much.

90
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,219
Wu Huan.

91
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:44,859
Elder.

92
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,398
It's been a long time.

93
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,939
How are you, Elder?

94
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,858
I'm fine.

95
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:54,039
Please come in.

96
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,440
Okay.

97
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,040
Wu Huan.

98
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,960
Wu Huan has some power now.

99
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,080
She is different from what she was a thousand years ago.

100
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,840
She is arrogant with little power now.

101
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,339
When the Phoenix monarch is reborn, she can't stay in Pilgrim Hall anymore.

102
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:17,920
You're right.

103
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,460
Wu Huan, change clothes for me.

104
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,299
Wu Huan.

105
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,979
Why are you here?

106
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:46,379
It's not early now.

107
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,239
I couldn't find you, so I came here.

108
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:52,200
Wu Huan said you didn't want to get up and let me wake you up.

109
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,699
 Your Royal Highness. 

110
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,640
 Your Royal Highness. 

111
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,200
 It's not early now. You should wake up 

112
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,779
 and welcome the gods from the Lower Realm at the Realm Gate. 

113
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,180
 I'm the Chief God. 

114
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,100
 Why should I welcome them? You can go. 

115
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,339
 Go there for me. 

116
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:13,300
 Even if you don't welcome them at the Realm Gate, 

117
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,938
 you should wake up now. 

118
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:19,579
 All gods in Pilgrim Hall will go to prepare the ceremony at Universe Pavilion. 

119
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:24,059
 At that time, no one will help you change clothes. 

120
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:26,138
 I've learned about it in the Netherworld. 

121
00:09:26,138 --> 00:09:27,718
 Just go to work. 

122
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:30,860
 I want to nap for a while. 

123
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,619
 Then, remember to wake up later. 

124
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:36,918
 You can nap for fifteen minutes at most. 

125
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,900
 Don't be late. 

126
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,439
You overslept?

127
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,120
Impossible. I'm going to be the Chief God.

128
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,579
How could I oversleep on the inheritance day?

129
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:49,618
I just napped for a while.

130
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:50,798
Okay.

131
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,118
You're so busy. You should nap for a while.

132
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:58,860
Why were you looking for me?

133
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,019
It's Zhitian brocade.

134
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,679
I found some and made clothes for you.

135
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,718
You can wear it after you became the Chief God.

136
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,599
Only this can match the Chief God of Chaos.

137
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:14,079
It takes ten thousand years for the goddess on Buzhou Mountain to weave a bolt of cloth.

138
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,619
Where did you find it?

139
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:19,678
I heard there are no clothes made of Zhitian brocade in the God Realm.

140
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,660
In early times, I knew you would be Chief God someday, so I prepared it for you.

141
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,099
In early times?

142
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,118
Many years ago, I saw the notebook of a young girl.

143
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,599
Her sacred meridian was blocked,

144
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:37,439
but she wanted to cultivate.

145
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,718
She didn't have the divine power to protect the world,

146
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,759
but she remembered all the sufferings in the world.

147
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,719
Before she owned the Power of Chaos,

148
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:48,220
she wanted to protect the world.

149
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:02,639
Going through many difficulties, she hid everything in her heart.

150
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,139
But I saw her diligence and effort.

151
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,379
What she sacrificed to get these,

152
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,839
I knew better than anyone else.

153
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,659
From that day, I believed,

154
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:23,359
that she could be the Chief God of Chaos who would protect the world.

155
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,920
I've been waiting for this day for a thousand years.

156
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,679
Change clothes. I'll go to Universe Pavilion with you.

157
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,201
   

158
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:05,079
God Zi Han.

159
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,399
Why do you come to the Secret Pavilion today?

160
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,520
Does Master Tian Qi need any treasure to make a weapon?

161
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,398
You are smart. You're right.

162
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:15,420
Master got an obsidian recently.

163
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,940
He wants to make a sword, so he asked me to fetch some Tiansheng Grass.

164
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,819
God Zi Han, you didn't give us True God Zhi Yang's permission card.

165
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:28,340
You're right.

166
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,840
I came here in a hurry just now, so I left it in Everlasting Hall.

167
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,218
Well, I can give it to you later.

168
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:38,180
No, you can't go in. If you want to go in,

169
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,619
you need to give us the permission card from True God Zhi Yang.

170
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:43,740
There are too many treasures and evil things here.

171
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,059
We can't afford the responsibility.

172
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:48,980
Okay. I'll go back and take it here.

173
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,980
Okay, God Zi Han.

174
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,880
Who is it?

175
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,139
God Zi Han.

176
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:09,819
I, Goddess of Seasons, on behalf of the Gods of Wind, Rain, Thunder, and Lightning,

177
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:12,860
congratulate you on being the Chief God of Chaos.

178
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,400
I, Goddess of the Stars and Moon, congratulate you on inheriting the Chief God of Chaos.

179
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,420
 Congratulation on inheriting the Chief God of Chaos. 

180
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,499
May the Chief God live with the heavens and the three realms.

181
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:29,980
 May the Chief God live with the heavens and the three realms. 

182
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:32,039
Please stand up.

183
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,559
 Thank you, Chief God. 

184
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,039
Thank you for teaching me for ten thousand years, brothers.

185
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,259
I shall never forget it.

186
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:53,180
The time has come, take out the Chaos Stone.

187
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,499
Please open the Chaos Stone,

188
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:23,939
and take Chief God's instruction feather.

189
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:14,080
- Tian Qi. 
 - Tian Qi.

190
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:20,759
Tian Qi, what are you doing?

191
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,819
Tian Qi.

192
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:28,440
I've been planning this for thousands years, and you ruined it.

193
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:43,178
Tian Qi, you can't play jokes here.

194
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:45,379
Give the instruction feather back to me.

195
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,420
 Don't come closer. 

196
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,940
What if I don't?

197
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,379
Tian Qi, don't play jokes today.

198
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:19,660
Why is Chief God's instruction feather hers?

199
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,259
Why am I not qualified to be in charge of the God Realm?

200
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:25,059
Tian Qi, the instruction feather is the seal of the God Realm.

201
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:26,999
Only the Chief God of Chaos can take it.

202
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,339
It's a crime if you grab the feather.

203
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:30,879
So what?

204
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,698
You also said that the instruction feather is the seal of the God Realm.

205
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:39,060
Now the instruction feather is mine.

206
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,399
After some time, I'll be the most powerful God in the God Realm.

207
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:48,019
And I'll be Chief God in the God Realm.

208
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:49,939
Tian Qi.

209
00:18:56,619 --> 00:18:59,800
You can stay here. I'll chase him back.

210
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:04,338
True God, God Zi Han broke into Secret Pavilion and killed the guard.

211
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:06,060
He is heading to the Realm Gate now.

212
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,559
Listen to my order, knock the Chaos Bell.

213
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,918
- We can't let the instruction feather leave the God Realm. 
 - Yes, Master.

214
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,950
Bai Jue, lead the soldiers and catch Zi Han.

215
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:35,260
You went too far today. Have you played enough?

216
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,499
Go away. I don't want to fight with you.

217
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:41,078
Neither do I.

218
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,798
But every god saw it, I have to explain to them.

219
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:46,478
Explain?

220
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:50,478
Do you know what I'll become if they catch me?

221
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:53,999
You know how they treated Xuan Yi seventy thousand years ago.

222
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,540
But you're not Xuan Yi.

223
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,900
In their eyes, a god that is not loyal to the God Realm

224
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,078
is the second Xuan Yi.

225
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:05,979
Shang Gu, if you still regard me as your friend, let me go.

226
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:09,358
I promise you I just want to borrow the Chief God's instruction feather.

227
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,999
When the matter has ended, I'll return it to you.

228
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,159
Tian Qi, what trouble did you meet?

229
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,139
Can't you tell us?

230
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,099
My problem is too huge.

231
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:23,819
If the people in the Lower Realm meet problems, they can ask for help from the gods.

232
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:27,279
But what if a True God meets a problem?

233
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:31,819
Let me think.

234
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:33,539
I don't have time, Shang Gu.

235
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:38,800
Do you really want to see me be punished and be doomed eternally?

236
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:47,279
Zi Han, what happened in Secret Pavilion?

237
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,259
Did you really kill the guard?

238
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:52,500
What? The guard died?

239
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,859
I didn't!

240
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:56,286
That's good. If you didn't kill the guard, come back with me

241
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:58,780
and tell us the matter that happened in Secret Pavilion.

242
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,760
No. I can't go back.

243
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,260
Zi Han, Tian Qi has betrayed the God Realm.

244
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,800
If you make any more trouble, it's harming him.

245
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,738
True God Bai Jue, my master gave me an important mission.

246
00:21:08,738 --> 00:21:10,379
I can't go back.

247
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:13,979
I'm sorry.

248
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:16,439
Why do you have the Purple Jade Whip?

249
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:30,460
Zi Han, how can you incite the Demon Clan to revolt? Are you crazy?

250
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,820
What is Tian Qi's plan?

251
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,800
If you really want to help him, go back with me.

252
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,718
True God Bai Jue, I have no choice.

253
00:21:41,738 --> 00:21:44,619
You'll understand later.

254
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,038
You silly. I let you monitor the God Realm

255
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,639
and let Shang Gu be Chief God smoothly.

256
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,999
But you let Tian Qi ruin my plan.

257
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,559
Calm down, Demon King. I didn't notice it.

258
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,460
What should we do now?

259
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,678
If Shang Gu dies, it will be troublesome to handle the three of them.

260
00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:39,480
But if Tian Qi betrayed the God Realm,

261
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:46,139
we can take this chance to let them fight with each other. This is a good solution.

262
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:47,700
Okay, Demon King.

263
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,560
Tian Qi.

264
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,958
You broke the rules in the God Realm.

265
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:57,860
You will be killed by the gods.

266
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,920
Master Tian Qi grabbed the instruction feather and ran away. He is very arrogant.

267
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,159
Please give the order to punish Tian Qi, Master.

268
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,998
Master Zhi Yang, how could Tian Qi betray the God Realm?

269
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:15,279
You know him well. He didn't want to settle the affairs you gave him.

270
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,159
How could he want to be the Chief God?

271
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,879
Shang Gu and Bai Jue have gone to catch him.

272
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,579
I believe they can't escape the God Realm.

273
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,378
The tribunal of the three halls has not yet come out with a result,

274
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:25,438
and the truth about the matter of the Secret Pavilion has not yet been found out.

275
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:28,180
We can't declare Tian Qi guilty.

276
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:33,920
Master Zhi Yang, are you trying to cover up Master Tian Qi?

277
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,138
Goddess of Snow, don't say nonsense.

278
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,039
Master Zhi Yang, I'm just worried about the God Realm.

279
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:44,459
If Tian Qi didn't ask Zi Han to betray the God Realm,

280
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:46,858
how could he kill a guard?

281
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,639
That's right, Master Zhi Yang.

282
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,740
We still have the witness of Zi Han's murdering case.

283
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,279
If you don't make a decision now,

284
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,780
I'm afraid the disaster that happened seventy thousand years ago will happen again.

285
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,439
Master Tian Qi fought for the God Realm many times. He made many contributions.

286
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,460
If he didn't meet a huge problem, he wouldn't do so.

287
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,700
Even if you don't trust him,

288
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,319
I trust him. Even if you don't support him, I support him.

289
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,399
Enough!

290
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,020
Don't talk nonsense in Chaos Hall.

291
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,479
God of Wind, you mean, I should kill Tian Qi?

292
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,318
I didn't mean that.

293
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,078
I know what you're worried about.

294
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,139
I don't believe Tian Qi will be like Xuan Yi.

295
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:36,980
Before he received punishment from Heaven,

296
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,300
he is still the owner of Everlasting Hall, a True God in the God Realm.

297
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,799
I'll investigate the truth with two True Gods,

298
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,239
and give you a satisfactory explanation.

299
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:50,139
 Yes, Master. 

300
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,958
Tell a True God that Tian Qi has escaped the God Realm.

301
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,778
Bai Jue, why are you so seriously injured?

302
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,700
In order to resist Purple Jade Whip at Realm Gate,

303
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,439
I used my core power, so my core spirit's old wound aches again.

304
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:33,200
It seems I can't use my core power within a short time.

305
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,919
Tian Qi escaped the God Realm.

306
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:45,759
You let him go?

307
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,459
Yes.

308
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:51,018
Have you thought that other gods won't respect you anymore by doing so?

309
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:53,498
Even if he returns Chief God's instruction feather,

310
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:55,378
you might not be able to take charge of the God Realm.

311
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:59,018
But I can't let you and Zhi Yang scrape his divine bone

312
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:00,939
and lock him in the Netherworld.

313
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:03,400
Zhi Yang and I won't do so.

314
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,678
Even if he won't die, he will be punished.

315
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:10,878
Bai Jue, ten thousand years ago, I was born in Universe Pavilion.

316
00:26:10,878 --> 00:26:13,118
The first one I saw was Tian Qi.

317
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:15,999
Yue Mi and he accompanied me and saw me grow up.

318
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,198
He is my dearest brother and the one I trust most in the three realms.

319
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:23,199
Shang Gu, we don't know what Tian Qi wants to do now.

320
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:25,838
We can save him if he stays in the God Realm.

321
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,238
I only know, if he wants to be the Chief God, in ten thousand years,

322
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:32,540
he had many chances to kill me and betray the God Realm.

323
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,899
He wouldn't have chosen today.

324
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:35,759
Yes, I know.

325
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,940
Tian Qi is disobedient.

326
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,199
Even if we let him be Chief God, he wouldn't agree.

327
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:45,159
Today...

328
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:47,000
Master.

329
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,939
there must be something wrong.

330
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,550
Your Royal Highness, what happened to Master?

331
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,179
His core spirit is seriously injured.

332
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:02,298
It needs to be cured by medicine made of the pith of Ancestral Wutong in Phoenix Clan and the chaos core power.

333
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:03,380
I'll go to Phoenix Clan later.

334
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,060
Stay in the Abyss Hall. No one shall come in before I come back.

335
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,239
Okay, Your Royal Highness.

336
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:27,299
 Hong Ri, tell me what happened to your master in these thousand years. 

337
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,259
 As long as she is safe, it's just ten thousand years' lifetime core, 

338
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:34,959
 even if it's a hundred thousand years' core, I don't care. 

339
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:44,380
You got so seriously injured in the Netherworld in order to protect me.

340
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,460
You have been accompanying me.

341
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:51,140
You got injured because of me.

342
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,020
But during these years, I've been hesitating and thinking too much.

343
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:59,560
You love me,

344
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,900
but why didn't you tell me earlier?

345
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,719
When you wake up,

346
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,390
let's not miss each other. Okay?

347
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,200
 ♫ Time loaned me the eternal galaxy ♫ 

348
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:17,220
 ♫ But where's the old friend ♫ 

349
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:23,200
 ♫ Leaving a shadow and haunting dreams ♫ 

350
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:31,100
 ♫ How many years have been reincarnated 
 after thousands of tribulations? ♫ 

351
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:37,020
 ♫ Looks like you're before me 
 and there are mountains and oceans between us ♫ 

352
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:50,059
Shameless devil!

353
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:52,159
I brought you to the inheritance ceremony.

354
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,039
What else do you want to do?

355
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,438
 A beauty like the Goddess of Snow, 

356
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:59,738
 how could you be so unromantic? 

357
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,338
 You are also a devil like me. 

358
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:04,098
 You're so noisy. 

359
00:29:04,098 --> 00:29:08,039
 Do you want all the gods in the God Realm to know you're a devil now? 

360
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,979
Nonsense! It's because of you.

361
00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:12,100
You did something to me in the Netherworld,

362
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,539
so I became a devil now.

363
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:21,960
What a pity.

364
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,939
Even if you returned to the God Realm,

365
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:29,279
True God Bai Jue doesn't like you.

366
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:36,459
Even if your life is luxurious, so what?

367
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,039
As long as you cooperate with me,

368
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,699
Demon King will help you get what you want.

369
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:08,939
Wu Huan.

370
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,299
I didn't know you were here, Goddess of Snow.

371
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:19,919
What do you want, Goddess of Snow?

372
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,299
You're loyal to her.

373
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:24,679
No wonder you came from the Lower Realm.

374
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:27,079
So silly.

375
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,699
I heard she asked you to cultivate in Kun Lun when she came back.

376
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:38,858
Does she know how tiring it is to manage True God's Hall?

377
00:30:38,858 --> 00:30:43,759
You need to balance the elegance of Chief God and a relationship with the other gods.

378
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,719
This is harder than cultivation.

379
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:51,960
Did you come to Pilgrim Hall to care about me?

380
00:30:58,199 --> 00:31:01,259
Wu Huan, I want to say I understand you.

381
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,978
She is superior.

382
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:04,779
She has many important matters to deal with.

383
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:08,659
She just said thank you, and let you work in Pilgrim Hall.

384
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,799
Does she know how tiring it is to manage Pilgrim Hall?

385
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,700
Does she care about you and know what you did for her?

386
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,880
I have no time now, goodbye.

387
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:32,439
According to the schedule, I want to say I understand you.

388
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:39,579
At that time, will Shang Gu still let you serve her?

389
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:42,019
Without the protection from Pilgrim Hall,

390
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:45,539
you'll live harder than a thousand years ago.

391
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,940
Her Royal Highness won't treat me like this.

392
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,560
Don't try to make mischief between us.

393
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,218
We're both pitiful gods, so I'm just reminding you.

394
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,380
Do you know Shang Gu went to the Phoenix Clan?

395
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,358
Whether it's true or not, you can go back and ask.

396
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,400
You don't need to worry about my business, Goddess of Snow.

397
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,999
Shang Gu.

398
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:26,338
Yue Mi.

399
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:29,259
Shang Gu, did you really let Tian Qi go?

400
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:32,200
I did it myself. But I have something important to deal with.

401
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,180
I'll explain to everyone when I come back.

402
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,199
Where are you going at this crucial moment?

403
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,319
What?

404
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,900
Why would he fall into a coma because of an injury to his core spirit?

405
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,899
I met many difficulties in the Netherworld. He saved me with his core spirit.

406
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:51,659
I didn't expect this Bai Jue to be more affectionate than you were back then.

407
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:54,738
But the situation in the God Realm is tense now.

408
00:32:54,738 --> 00:32:57,258
We can't let others know Bai Jue is injured,

409
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:59,459
or every god in the God Realm will feel insecure.

410
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:01,858
He has been hiding his injury because of this.

411
00:33:01,858 --> 00:33:05,519
Four True Gods are being doubted now, so there can't be any problem.

412
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,780
Luckily, the pith of Ancestral Wutong in the Phoenix Clan can cure his injury.

413
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,139
I'll fetch it now.

414
00:33:09,139 --> 00:33:12,978
Before this, I hope you can stay in Pilgrim Hall and help Wu Huan manage here.

415
00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:14,358
I'm afraid she might be bullied.

416
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,900
No problem. I'll stay here for you.

417
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,238
I won't let the other gods embarrass Wu Huan.

418
00:33:19,238 --> 00:33:20,699
Now we don't know what has happened in the Demon Realm.

419
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,199
Be careful when you go to the Phoenix Clan.

420
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:25,179
There is one more thing I need to remind you.

421
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:27,199
Feng Yan is going to be reborn.

422
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:30,919
You can take her back when you go to the Phoenix Clan.

423
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:34,258
 The Phoenix monarch's core spirit is fake. 

424
00:33:34,258 --> 00:33:37,118
 Even after a thousand years, she won't be reborn. 

425
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:41,519
What? Anything wrong?

426
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,358
I know you care about Wu Huan.

427
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,660
But the God Realm is in a mess now.

428
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,778
With her identity, she can't make Xue Ying and other gods satisfied.

429
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:53,758
It's no good for her to let her manage Pilgrim Hall.

430
00:33:53,758 --> 00:33:57,758
And I think her personality is too surly and flamboyant.

431
00:33:57,758 --> 00:33:59,479
She needs more cultivation.

432
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:02,599
And the Phoenix Clan is the head of all beast clans.

433
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,559
With the Phoenix monarch assisting you,

434
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,960
the authority of the Pilgrim Hall will be stable.

435
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,599
I understand, Yue Mi.

436
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:13,379
Let's talk about it after I come back.

437
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:14,939
Okay.

438
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,520
Phoenix Clan.

439
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:33,239
Phoenix Monarch.

440
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:39,619
Yue Mi.

441
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:48,358
I've told you, we shouldn't let Her Royal Highness catch Tian Qi.

442
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:51,138
We don't know the relationship between them.

443
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:55,119
No wonder. She let the traitor escape the God Realm so easily.

444
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,189
I heard there is a barrier around the Demon Realm.

445
00:34:58,189 --> 00:35:00,269
And the Demon Clan has betrayed us.

446
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:04,000
Where do you think this is? How dare you say so here!

447
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,819
Yue Mi, although you're the Chief Goddess of the Stars and Moon, this is Chaos Hall.

448
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:10,959
It's not your turn to order us.

449
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,599
Where is Her Royal Highness?

450
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,559
Tian Qi escaped under Her Royal Highness.

451
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,520
Why doesn't Her Royal Highness explain it to us?

452
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:22,198
 Master. 

453
00:35:22,198 --> 00:35:26,060
Like you said, I asked Shang Gu to catch Tian Qi.

454
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,998
So you mean I also let Tian Qi escape?

455
00:35:28,998 --> 00:35:30,979
I didn't mean that.

456
00:35:30,979 --> 00:35:34,198
Shang Gu went to the Lower Realm to find Tian Qi.

457
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,120
She is not in Pilgrim Hall.

458
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,019
If you dare to talk nonsense here, I'll definitely punish you.

459
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:42,979
I think this is not suitable, Master.

460
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:45,019
The case about Tian Qi is serious.

461
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:46,759
If we don't catch him now, he'll make trouble to us.

462
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,920
Enough!

463
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,579
When is it your turn to be in charge of the God Realm?

464
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,259
I didn't mean that.

465
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:55,518
I said so for the God Realm.

466
00:35:55,518 --> 00:35:58,559
The Chief God is young. Her relationship with Tian Qi is good.

467
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,359
We understand that she doesn't want to punish Everlasting Hall.

468
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,778
Master Bai Jue and you

469
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:06,998
all experienced the rebellion of the Demon King seventy thousand years ago.

470
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:11,459
Do you want this huge catastrophe to happen in the God Realm again?

471
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:14,159
At that time, what would the God Realm and the world be?

472
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,739
Goddess of Snow is right.

473
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:18,998
Please consider the interest of the world, Master.

474
00:36:18,998 --> 00:36:23,219
 Please consider the interest of the world, Master. 

475
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:27,339
Goddess of Snow, how do you think I should punish Tian Qi?

476
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:29,278
According to the rules, remove him from being a god,

477
00:36:29,278 --> 00:36:31,538
receive punishment from Heaven, scrape his divine bone,

478
00:36:31,538 --> 00:36:34,979
imprison him in the Netherworld, and never let him come out.

479
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,638
Don't worry.

480
00:36:43,638 --> 00:36:46,699
The disaster that happened seventy thousand years ago won't happen again.

481
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:50,219
If what Tian Qi did harmed the God Realm,

482
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:53,460
I'll atone this with my life.

483
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,499
Master Zhi Yang is just.

484
00:36:57,499 --> 00:36:58,979
Since Master said so,

485
00:36:58,979 --> 00:37:03,220
we'll wait until Her Royal Highness comes back and then decide this.

486
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,760
 I finally came from the Phoenix Clan to the God Realm. 

487
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,660
 No one can let me go back. 

488
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,159
 No one. 

489
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,258
Wu Huan, the outside is in a mess now.

490
00:37:34,258 --> 00:37:36,919
Why didn't you explain for Master?

491
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,018
Her Royal Highness let Master Tian Qi go.

492
00:37:41,018 --> 00:37:44,179
I'm afraid the other gods would embarrass me and I didn't know how to react.

493
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,339
Then they might suspect us.

494
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:49,100
Even if they embarrass us, Master will defend us.

495
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,500
What are you afraid of?

496
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,980
I...

497
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,940
Her Royal Highness is a Chief God.

498
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,539
Even if she made a mistake, no one dares to judge her.

499
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:57,900
But we are different.

500
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,618
We are just servants in the God Realm.

501
00:38:00,618 --> 00:38:04,219
If the gods try to blame us, there is nothing we can do.

502
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:07,750
Master treats us well and trusts us.

503
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,599
If there is anything wrong, she will surely protect us.

504
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,979
You should trust her.

505
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:16,180
Of course, I trust Her Royal Highness.

506
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:25,299
But just now, I was in a panic and didn't know what to do.

507
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,819
I shouldn't have blamed you, but we have our backs against the wall now.

508
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:36,919
We need to guard the Pilgrim Hall for Master.

509
00:39:13,379 --> 00:39:18,639
Your Royal Highness, this is the pith of Wutong Forest.

510
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,439
Thank you, Elder.

511
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:23,618
This pith is very hard.

512
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:27,859
You need to refine it with fig wine and Chaos fire,

513
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:31,040
then it can be effective.

514
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,698
Elder, is Feng Yan's core spirit in the crown of the tree?

515
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,660
Yes.

516
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,499
According to the schedule,

517
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:48,980
the Phoenix monarch will be reborn after a few months.

518
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:54,138
Although you are kind and don't mind our nature as beasts,

519
00:39:54,138 --> 00:39:59,439
after the Phoenix monarch is reborn, she should go to the God Realm and be your sacred beast.

520
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:03,818
Elder, I want Wu Huan to follow me forever.

521
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,000
Well...

522
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,599
Your Royal Highness, Wu Huan is just a five-colored phoenix.

523
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,219
Her divine power is limited.

524
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:17,739
I'm afraid she won't be powerful in the future.

525
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,259
I knew her talent was not high.

526
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:24,519
But since I chose her, I'm willing to wait for her.

527
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,780
As the Chief God in the God Realm,

528
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,539
if I abandon her and choose the Phoenix monarch because of her low divine power,

529
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:35,479
in the future, if there is a beast stronger than the Phoenix monarch, what should I choose?

530
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,779
You're right, Your Royal Highness.

531
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:44,258
Okay. I hope she can cultivate hard

532
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:47,199
and not lose face for the Phoenix Clan.

533
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:49,579
Thank you, Elder.

534
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:54,760
When Feng Yan is reborn, she...

535
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:01,360
Just let her grow up happily and lightheartedly.

536
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:35,080


537
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:43,299
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

538
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:50,280
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

539
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,700
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

540
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,860
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

541
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:09,760
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

542
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:16,019
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

543
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:23,440
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

544
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:30,000
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

545
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:48,640
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

546
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,119
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

547
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:02,200
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

548
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:09,500
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

549
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:17,480
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

550
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:24,359
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

551
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:30,939
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

552
00:43:30,939 --> 00:43:37,239
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

553
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:46,960
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
