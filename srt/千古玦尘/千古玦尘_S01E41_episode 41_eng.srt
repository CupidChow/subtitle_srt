1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:09,930


2
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:21,380
   

3
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,079
   

4
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,657
You're here to save me.

5
00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:31,530
I'm glad we can be friends.

6
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,242
Go.

7
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,714
I won't leave.

8
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:43,171
I'll get you out of here.

9
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,700
No one can hurt you.

10
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,099
Not even my Mother God.

11
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,599
Get out of here.

12
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:13,600
I have no regrets because I get to see you before my death.

13
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,040
Feng Ran, I already learned the story of your birth in Wutong Forest.

14
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:24,198
I thought if I kept away from you,

15
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:26,639
my Mother God wouldn't hurt you.

16
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,228
I was wrong.

17
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:32,556
I should have told my Father God about all this.

18
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:37,280
In this way, my Mother God wouldn't hurt you.

19
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,014
I was wrong.

20
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:41,737
Feng Ran.

21
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:43,396
Go.

22
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,138
Feng Ran.

23
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:51,700
Feng Ran.

24
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:56,689
Feng Ran.

25
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:01,730
Feng Ran. Feng Ran.

26
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,035
I lied to you in Dibei City.

27
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,240
I only have you in my heart.

28
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,589
Only you.

29
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,135
I already knew... that you lied to me.

30
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,249
Feng Ran.

31
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:33,600
Are you willing to give me a second chance?

32
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,670
Feng Ran.

33
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,163
This is the wedding of a True God.

34
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:31,149
No sight is more magnificent than this.

35
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:36,021
On June 5th of Year 63,421 of the Hou Gu Calendar,

36
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:38,821
it's True God Bai Jue and Princess Jing Zhao's wedding day.

37
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,710
Welcome the new couple.

38
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,850
Master Bai Jue, it's our wedding day.

39
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,250
Shouldn't you feel happy?

40
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,507
We all know that.

41
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:13,535
Why bother acting?

42
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,264
- Look. So beautiful. 
 - They make a great couple.

43
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,128
 Take Hou Chi. 

44
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:06,469
You finally went there.

45
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,535
Hou Chi.

46
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,521
 Upper God Hou Chi. 

47
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:19,390
Qing Mu.

48
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,092
How could you marry someone else?

49
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:25,835
Have you forgotten the oath we made?

50
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,160
I'll say it again.

51
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,468
I'm not Qing Mu.

52
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:34,729
You're lying.

53
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,335
These fireflies know Qing Mu's scent.

54
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,677
His spiritual mind must be in your body.

55
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:44,449
I know you haven't forgotten me at all.

56
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,719
I know everything.

57
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,320
You and Bo Xuan...

58
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,850
Shut up!

59
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,335
You won't admit it, that's fine.

60
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:57,769
I just want to know that you're him.

61
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:03,278
I said no one of the three realms are allowed to mention my former identity.

62
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:06,980
I have nothing to do with the past.

63
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,963
I'm afraid it's not up to you.

64
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:15,130
I want to tell you something.

65
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,030
- I'm pregâ€” 
 - Immortal Hou Chi.

66
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,929
In my mind,

67
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,220
the relationship between you and Qing Mu

68
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,907
is like the glow of these fireflies.

69
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,910
It's ephemeral.

70
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,649
This is fate.

71
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,635
You can't change anything.

72
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,209
Just answer my question.

73
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,064
Qing Mu is still alive.

74
00:07:51,064 --> 00:07:54,064
He's not dead. Right?

75
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:56,578
He just became a different person

76
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:59,850
who doesn't love me.

77
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:04,350
- He loves... 
 - The divine mind of a True God wouldn't take in others.

78
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,650
Stop pestering me.

79
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,350
You're so anxious to let me give up.

80
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,529
You are desperate to crush the history between me and Qing Mu.

81
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,635
Does Master Shang Gu know what you have done?

82
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,235
So this is a True God.

83
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,589
Superior and stern.

84
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,264
No matter what you think,

85
00:08:31,264 --> 00:08:35,130
in short, I married Jing Zhao today.

86
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,964
You should leave at once if you have any self-respect.

87
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:41,763
He doesn't love you.

88
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:44,300
He's just using you.

89
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,749
Are you sure you want to marry such a True God?

90
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:55,064
Hou Chi, you're unwilling to accept it. Right?

91
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:58,428
You finally know my pain.

92
00:08:58,428 --> 00:09:03,550
Now I'm married to my beloved.

93
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,478
And it's you who is being thrown out like garbage.

94
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:09,150
Your beloved?

95
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,950
Do you like his face which is just like Qing Mu's,

96
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,550
or his supreme power?

97
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,878
Or you don't like either.

98
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:18,821
You just don't want to lose to me.

99
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:22,421
You don't want to lose to the one you'll never win.

100
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:23,907
How dare you?

101
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,009
 Why did she do that? 

102
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,968
 Looks like you lack something. 

103
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:46,609
 What? 

104
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:50,464
 Here. 

105
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,529
Qing Mu.

106
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:36,078
Enough.

107
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:38,959
Master Bai Jue.

108
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,049
Hou Chi is insubordinate and impudent.

109
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,607
Shouldn't she be punished for the crime of disrespect?

110
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:48,100
Don't try to test my bottom line anymore.

111
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,192
Master Bai Jue, why are you so angry?

112
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:55,392
Did I commit any horrible crimes?

113
00:10:55,392 --> 00:11:00,009
Once in the God Realm, you were the most unselfish.

114
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,010
Father God.

115
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,289
I'm late.

116
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:23,392
I've made you feel wronged.

117
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,569
My daughter is so precious.

118
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,620
What horrible crimes did she commit

119
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:34,689
that makes you torture her like this?

120
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:36,391
The punishment is mild.

121
00:11:36,392 --> 00:11:39,307
Disrespect to a True God deserves death.

122
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,929
Don't move your lips when I'm talking.

123
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:46,135
How dare you, Gu Jun?

124
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:47,449
It's the wedding day of Master Bai Jue.

125
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:49,807
You're too outrageous!

126
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,700
Qing Mu had a marriage with Hou Chi 100 years ago.

127
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,192
Now it looks like the awakening of me...

128
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:09,121
did make them suffer.

129
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:14,721
Therefore, what Hou Chi said is understandable.

130
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:17,929
Take her back. And placate her.

131
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,435
Don't let her pester me for Qing Mu anymore.

132
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,500
Daughter.

133
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,910
Come home with me.

134
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:40,707
Since Qing Mu is a part of you,

135
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:44,270
you should finish what he started before he died.

136
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,750
What is it?

137
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:51,892
All immortals are gathered here today.

138
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:55,390
I want you to declare your divorce from me.

139
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,421
In the name of Qing Mu?

140
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,160
If you don't do it,

141
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:13,300
I won't leave.

142
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,489
Then your and Jing Zhao's wedding can't be done.

143
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,450
Hou Chi, now that Master Bai Jue has forgiven you,

144
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,892
don't be aggressive anymore.

145
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,407
60,000 years ago, I learned something from True God Shang Gu.

146
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:50,110
That is... that everything... deserves justice.

147
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:53,934
Master Bai Jue,

148
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:56,029
my daughter is right.

149
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:01,609
There must be an end between you and her.

150
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:10,721
If I write a letter of divorce before them,

151
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:13,420
will you leave me alone?

152
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,710
Yes.

153
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:24,620
As all the immortals are my witnesses,

154
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:36,660
I hereby declare my divorce from Hou Chi.

155
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,639
 â™« Write down a whisper â™« 

156
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,321
Within the three realms,

157
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:44,307
under the God Realm,

158
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:50,129
we'll never meet again... forever.

159
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:56,230
 â™« Let me be the shadows and light in your eyes â™« 

160
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:04,035
 â™« I'm willing to search for thousands of days and nights â™« 

161
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:09,940
 â™« Waiting for the time to meet again in your eyes â™« 

162
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:15,790
That's all for today.

163
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,792
Anyone who dares hurt or insult her again,

164
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:22,207
whoever it is,

165
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:24,580
even if it's a True God,

166
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,720
I'll risk my life to give her justice.

167
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,249
 â™« Waiting for the teardrops to shed a smile â™« 

168
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:40,300
 â™« How lucky do I have to be to be allowed â™« 

169
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:46,390
 â™« to be trapped in your heart forever â™« 

170
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:55,400
 â™« Pursuing millions of miles for you â™« 

171
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,770
Wu Huan,

172
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,809
Master Bai Jue let us go.

173
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,670
How dare you stop us?

174
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:19,492
Hou Chi offended not only Master Bai Jue but also the Heavenly Palace.

175
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:22,306
Master Bai Jue is forgiving. He can let it go.

176
00:16:22,306 --> 00:16:24,809
But the Heavenly Palace is strict and impartial.

177
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,392
There is no room for provocation.

178
00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:30,150
Hou Chi must be severely punished for what she did.

179
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,734
If this gets out and others do the same,

180
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:36,590
how can the Heavenly Palace run the Immortal Clan and manage the Lower Realm?

181
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,010
I don't give a shit about the Heavenly Palace.

182
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,550
I saw shameless people.

183
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,035
But I've never seen people as shameless as you all.

184
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:57,220
Tian Qi.

185
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,790
What are you doing here, instead of staying in the Demon Realm?

186
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,907
Bai Jue, we've known each other for hundreds of thousands of years.

187
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:06,250
How can I not attend your wedding?

188
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,510
Besides, don't call me Tian Qi anymore.

189
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,378
Now here, my name is Jing Yuan.

190
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:13,390
Your spiritual power hasn't been restored to that of a True God.

191
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,821
You're no match for me.

192
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:17,050
I don't want to kill you today.

193
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,421
Go.

194
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:20,940
I haven't stopped your wedding yet.

195
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,239
How could I leave?

196
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,769
You want to stop me?

197
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,329
Yes.

198
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,849
As long as you cancel the wedding,

199
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,678
I'll never interfere in your business again.

200
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:38,435
What if I say no?

201
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:40,378
If you say no,

202
00:17:40,378 --> 00:17:44,710
then you're a base man of no honor and no sense of right and wrong.

203
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,078
Demon God.

204
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:50,460
You saved Hou Chi and Qingchi Palace many times.

205
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,978
It proves Qingchi Palace is conspiring with the Demon Clan.

206
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:57,250
What's wrong with the Demon Clan?

207
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,670
An immortal with a rotten heart is just a pile of mud.

208
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:07,492
Wu Huan, don't forget how Yue Mi died.

209
00:18:10,235 --> 00:18:14,110
I'll get even with you sooner or later.

210
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:18,140
Demon God, don't talk nonsense here.

211
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,329
What did he mean?

212
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,309
You don't know?

213
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,550
Mu Guang, don't listen to him.

214
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,007
Bai Jue, you married Jing Zhao and insulted Hou Chi.

215
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,319
Shang Gu would never forgive you all this life if she knew.

216
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,550
What are you talking about?

217
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,068
Shang Gu disintegrated while saving the three realms 60,000 years ago.

218
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:44,449
- You know Shang Gu... 
 - Tian Qi.

219
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,850
I won't be easy on you if you go on talking nonsense.

220
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,869
Come on. I'm not afraid of you.

221
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:14,788
Forget it. Stop.

222
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:16,320
I've dissolved the marriage with him.

223
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,964
It's all I wanted.

224
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,530
Hou Chi, you're the supreme one in the three realms.

225
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,850
You can't lose to that.

226
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:35,435
The Purple Moon.

227
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,850
He turned half of his core power into the Purple Moon to provide for the Demon Realm.

228
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,435
Tian Qi, don't you know if you take back the Purple Moon,

229
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:22,488
those demons who cultivate with it will be damaged?

230
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,050
Tian Qi.

231
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,070
   

232
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,149
Hou Chi.

233
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,239
For the sake of the Heavenly Palace,

234
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,670
my Mother God won't let them go.

235
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,149
But it won't help if I go in there now.

236
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,090
To resolve the situation...

237
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,035
I have to do that.

238
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,859
Now that the Immortal Clan is so rotten,

239
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:51,021
today I'll rule for Shang Gu

240
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:53,110
and ruin the Immortal Clan.

241
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,249
I'm here. I won't allow you to be reckless.

242
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,909
Tian Qi, go back.

243
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:54,707
Bai Jue, do you know what Hou Chi told me

244
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:59,229
when she knew you had woken up from Qing Mu's body on Shenyin Mountain?

245
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:05,800
She said it be can't someone else's turn to call the shots to ruin Qing Mu's love and loathing, life and death for him.

246
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,948
Bai Jue, if you were Qing Mu,

247
00:23:08,948 --> 00:23:13,464
how could you see Hou Chi's 100 years of waiting finally came to nothing?

248
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:18,100
If you stop me today, you'll regret it.

249
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,929
I won't.

250
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,270
If you stop me today, you'll regret it.

251
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:35,189
 Bai Jue, you'll regret it. 

252
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:39,929
 You'll regret it some day. 

253
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:00,538
Stop. Don't fight.

254
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,209
- Hou Chi. 
 - Hou Chi.

255
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,149
- Hou Chi. 
 -  Hou Chi.

256
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:30,180
Why are you so silly? Why are you so silly?

257
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,991
My baby.

258
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:33,850
My child.

259
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,410
My child... My child...

260
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,134
 â™« Year after year time goes by â™« 

261
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:47,192
It won't help.

262
00:24:47,192 --> 00:24:49,330
My spiritual veins are broken.

263
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,378
You damned phoenix.

264
00:24:54,378 --> 00:24:55,960
What evil spell did you use?

265
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,364
Why was Hou Chi hurt so bad?

266
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:01,000
 â™« memories last â™« 

267
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,929
 â™« My longing for you won't change â™« 

268
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,092
Master,

269
00:25:06,092 --> 00:25:08,391
do you have any ways to save my daughter?

270
00:25:08,392 --> 00:25:09,507
It's useless.

271
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,650
Hou Chi's spiritual veins are all broken.

272
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,064
Even if Ancestral God were still alive,

273
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,707
he can't save her.

274
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:21,950
Don't worry.

275
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:27,390
I'll put all my power into saving her.

276
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,477
 â™« I'll wait through my lifetime â™« 

277
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:35,388
Wu Huan, if anything happens to Hou Chi,

278
00:25:35,392 --> 00:25:41,364
I'll beat the shit out of the Heavenly Palace and destroy Heaven to avenge Hou Chi.

279
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,878
Girl.

280
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,289
I was wrong.

281
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:04,219
For the past 60,000 years,

282
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,035
I only showed you the honor to stand in the three realms.

283
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:11,590
But I forgot,

284
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,392
without the power matching it,

285
00:26:14,392 --> 00:26:17,850
people would bully you.

286
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:25,592
Father God, I don't want anything.

287
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:30,660
Please beg Master Bai Jue to let us go home, okay?

288
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:35,890
I won't let you die.

289
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,335
No one can make you die.

290
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:39,119
Father God.

291
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,490
 â™« Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future â™« 

292
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:52,521
 â™« Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart â™« 

293
00:26:52,521 --> 00:26:56,479
Girl, I'm not your Father God.

294
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,592
I'm a flood dragon.

295
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,764
How could I be your father?

296
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:11,060
It's not because your name is not on the Heavenly Pillar,

297
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:16,064
but because you haven't woken up yet.

298
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,450
Master Shang Gu.

299
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,189
I'm your disciple, Gu Jun.

300
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:59,950
 I'm your disciple, Gu Jun. 

301
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,929
On the day of the Doom of Chaos,

302
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,578
I was lucky enough

303
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:14,750
to get a sliver of your core power.

304
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,459
 Master!  Master! 

305
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:39,910
I spent 10,000 years... nourishing it till now.

306
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:42,950
 Shang Gu's core power. 

307
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,178
 You hid it from me for so many years. 

308
00:28:45,978 --> 00:28:49,134
 Gu Jun got Chaos core power. 

309
00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:50,634
 She's Shang Gu. 

310
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:57,407
Today, I'll give the core power and all the honor...

311
00:28:57,407 --> 00:29:00,560
back to Master Shang Gu.

312
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:06,780
I only hope you can treat my daughter fairly...

313
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:11,620
and be good to her unborn baby when you wake up.

314
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,669
Father God, what are you thinking of doing?

315
00:29:30,821 --> 00:29:32,300
Father God.

316
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,507
Father God.

317
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,878
No.

318
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:48,878
Father God.

319
00:29:48,878 --> 00:29:51,635
I've lost Qing Mu.

320
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:53,750
I can't lose you, too.

321
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:22,963
 â™« She turned to ashes â™« 

322
00:30:22,964 --> 00:30:26,210
 â™« Separated by life and death â™« 

323
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,770
Gu Jun!

324
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:30,770
 â™« He guards the three realms for her â™« 

325
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:36,049
 â™« The idea of living still echoes in my ears â™« 

326
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,729
 â™« Once again â™« 

327
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:44,450
 â™« This love will never die â™« 

328
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,392
No way. Hou Chi.

329
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,759
Hou Chi, your body can't take Shang Gu's Chaos core power.

330
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,791
Come on. Pull it out of you.

331
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:24,360
Quick.

332
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,435
Hou Chi, force it out.

333
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:28,835
Now!

334
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,564
Bai Jue, for your own selfish reasons,

335
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:50,292
you killed Qing Mu and Bo Xuan,

336
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:53,121
you allowed the Heavenly Palace to break my spiritual veins,

337
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:55,678
which had my father killed.

338
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:04,760
All this hatred... I'll avenge everything on you myself.

339
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:11,989
I wanted... to be a daughter for life...

340
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:14,488
and live a carefree life.

341
00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:20,610
I wanted... to be a wife for life...

342
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:27,070
and spend the rest of my life with my husband.

343
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:37,450
I wanted... to be a mother for life...

344
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,035
and bring up my child.

345
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,592
However,

346
00:33:46,064 --> 00:33:48,764
someone treated me like dirt.

347
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,090
Someone thought nothing of me.

348
00:33:57,189 --> 00:34:01,249
Someone treated me like a crafty and evil person.

349
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,078
Since Heaven is unfair,

350
00:34:05,078 --> 00:34:07,610
the three realms all turned against me,

351
00:34:09,331 --> 00:34:12,022
I'll be who I need to be.

352
00:34:12,022 --> 00:34:14,421
I won't be weak anymore.

353
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,850
Shang Gu.

354
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,264
Hou Chi.

355
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,369
- Bai Jue. 
 - Master Bai Jue.

356
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:56,334
 â™« I'm willing to search for thousands of days and nights â™« 

357
00:34:56,335 --> 00:35:01,419
 â™« Waiting for the time to meet again in your eyes â™« 

358
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:08,464
 â™« Exchange a lifetime for a second of encounter â™« 

359
00:35:08,464 --> 00:35:13,130
 â™« It's not a pity to be able to accomplish it â™« 

360
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:21,221
 â™« I'm willing to indulge in the long passing years â™« 

361
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:27,077
 â™« Waiting for the teardrops to shed a smile â™« 

362
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:34,300
 â™« How lucky do I have to be to be allowed â™« 

363
00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:39,821
 â™« to be trapped in your heart forever â™« 

364
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:50,664
Go.

365
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:55,100
I don't want to see you anymore.

366
00:35:56,964 --> 00:36:02,706
Bai Jue, I'll wipe out what happened today.

367
00:36:02,706 --> 00:36:04,750
From now on,

368
00:36:05,878 --> 00:36:07,469
I have nothing to do with you.

369
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,734
 â™« Protect a heart in the name of the world â™« 

370
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:18,849
 â™« If our love turns into ashes in the end â™« â€‹

371
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:23,469
 â™« Let me be the shadows and light in your eyes â™« 

372
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:29,889
 â™« I'm willing to search for thousands of days and nights â™« 

373
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,249
Master Bai Jue.

374
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:36,690
 â™« Waiting for the teardrops to shed a smile â™« 

375
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:43,700
 â™« How lucky do I have to be to be allowed â™« 

376
00:36:43,764 --> 00:36:48,978
 â™« to be trapped in your heart forever â™« 

377
00:36:48,978 --> 00:36:49,929
Hou Chi!

378
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,600
 â™« Pursuing millions of miles for you â™« 

379
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,479
Hou Chi, I won't let anything happen to you.

380
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,250
I'll take you away now.

381
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:10,807
As soon as this drum sounds

382
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:14,064
it means the Immortal Clan lost the boundary of the Luocha Region.

383
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:21,580
Father God.

384
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,679
All immortal soldiers. This is my last resort.

385
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:34,164
Please forgive my crime of passing a fake military order.

386
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,768
This wicked girl killed True God Bai Jue.

387
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,219
Go. Kill her.

388
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:56,164
Stop right there!

389
00:37:59,729 --> 00:38:02,409
Wu Huan, you're crazy.

390
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,470
She's Master Shang Gu.

391
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,820
Master Shang Gu already died in the Doom of Chaos.

392
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,540
It must be a plot of Qingchi Palace and Demon God.

393
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,092
We can't let them get out of here alive.

394
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:16,279
You put soldiers to attack Demon God just now.

395
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,435
Do you want to put the world in danger?

396
00:38:27,492 --> 00:38:28,930
The drumbeats of war in Luocha.

397
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,335
Demon God must have sent demons to attack the immortals

398
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:34,790
while Heaven is in chaos.

399
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:53,592
Demon God took back the Purple Moon.

400
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:56,049
The Demon Clan's power has been greatly weakened.

401
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,035
How could they attack the Luocha Region at this point?

402
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:02,750
Then tell me what it is.

403
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,810
No matter what, we can't lose Luocha Region.

404
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,550
Yang'er, I'll punish you for your mistake later.

405
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,809
Now I'm ordering you to take the troops to the Luocha Region.

406
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,563
Hold the boundary of the Immortal Clan.

407
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:17,609
Yes, Father God.

408
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,990
Yang'er, come back.

409
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,448
You leave.

410
00:39:22,449 --> 00:39:23,850
 Yes. 

411
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,500
Demon God hastily restored his divine power.

412
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,264
His divine power might not be above yours or mine.

413
00:39:36,264 --> 00:39:40,290
If we don't kill him today, he'll be a great threat to us.

414
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,292
Wu Huan.

415
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:50,120
How did you become like this now?

416
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:55,107
Do you think you can hide what you did

417
00:39:55,107 --> 00:39:58,978
after you kill Demon God and Hou Chi?

418
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,849
What do you mean?

419
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,334
I'm not that muddle-headed.

420
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:09,664
Three-Head Fire Dragon told me about the Halberd of Sun and Moon in the secret chamber.

421
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:11,928
And Bi Xi.

422
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:13,935
Tell me.

423
00:40:13,935 --> 00:40:17,569
Demon God just mentioned my master Yue Mi to you.

424
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,550
What happened back then?

425
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,990
Demon God destroyed the world.

426
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,629
You don't trust me but him.

427
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:26,149
We're a couple.

428
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:28,589
You must tell me the truth.

429
00:40:31,821 --> 00:40:34,907
I'm tired of talking to you.

430
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,177
 Gu Jun, have I been wrong about her for so many years? 

431
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,292
Master, you're finally back.

432
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:53,950
The Demon Realm has been in chaos when the Purple Moon disappeared.

433
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,664
Demon Emperor was hurt very badly.

434
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:58,764
What happened to Her Royal Highness?

435
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,277
Is Master Shang Gu going to wake up?

436
00:41:02,278 --> 00:41:04,778
Go and find Feng Ran. Ask her to come to Xuanjing Palace quickly.

437
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:06,189
Yes.

438
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:34,260


439
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:44,070
 â™« Year after year time goes by â™« 

440
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:51,079
 â™« Don't be afraid if our fate comes back â™« 

441
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:57,700
 â™« Rains flood and memories last â™« 

442
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:03,580
 â™« My longing for you won't change no matter what â™« 

443
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:10,449
 â™« I have been waiting for so many years â™« 

444
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:17,079
 â™« I never leave despite endless sorrow â™« 

445
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:24,279
 â™« Love is like a faraway bright moon â™« 

446
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:30,630
 â™« I'll wait through my lifetime â™« 

447
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:48,174
 â™« I spend years waiting for returning birds â™« 

448
00:42:48,175 --> 00:42:54,700
 â™« I never regret it and no one can replace you â™« 

449
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:01,949
 â™« I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up â™« 

450
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:07,850
 â™« I'll finally bare my heart to you â™« 

451
00:43:10,475 --> 00:43:17,000
 â™« Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither â™« 

452
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,850
 â™« Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future â™« 

453
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:30,300
 â™« Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart â™« 

454
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:36,824
 â™« When the clouds break, our future will be clear â™« 

455
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:46,675
 â™« I'll enjoy a free life with you forever â™«
