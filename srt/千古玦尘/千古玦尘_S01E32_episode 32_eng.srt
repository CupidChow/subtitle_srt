1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,030


2
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:21,680
   

3
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,479
   

4
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,439
Today, the reason I asked you to come here is that

5
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,099
I want you to help the Heavenly Palace to restart the God Realm and protect the peace of the three realms.

6
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,700
Don't worry, Upper God Gu Jun.

7
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,958
Now that I have Tai Cang Spear with me,

8
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,719
even if you didn't instruct me to do so, I won't let the Immortal and Demon Clans go to war.

9
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,060
All right.

10
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,039
In this case, get some rest for one day.

11
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,859
Tomorrow, go with me to Heavenly Pillar to take back the Halberd of Sun and Moon.

12
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,219
Yes, Upper God.

13
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,300
Go and get ready.

14
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,939
Come out.

15
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,060
Why are you here?

16
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:23,009
I was just resting and then I saw you.

17
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,159
Another coincidence? Did you think I wouldn't notice?

18
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,600
Was that you in Dibei City?

19
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,731
Yes.

20
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:33,892
Why are you acting furtively?

21
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,618
- I... 
 - Tell me.

22
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:41,579
I'm here to make amends.

23
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,479
When did you ever offend me?

24
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,700
On many occasions.

25
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,278
My Mother God, my elder brother... and even at the Blue Dragon Pavilion...

26
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:52,620
That was them, you are you.

27
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,279
How have you been doing lately?

28
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,719
Not bad.

29
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,678
I don't have a lot to do recently at Heavenly Palace.

30
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:05,198
If you are busy and need help, you can call me over.

31
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,819
No need.

32
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,640
Nothing left to say?

33
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,040
In that case, I'll return to Qingchi Palace.

34
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,460
Why are you following me?

35
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,678
It's on my way.

36
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:28,880
Heavenly Palace isn't on the way for you.

37
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,850
My Father God is at Qingchi Palace.

38
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,910
I'll meet him and return to Heavenly Palace together.

39
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,199
His Majesty has returned to Heavenly Palace.

40
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,539
Has he?

41
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:40,400
What do you want exactly?

42
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,299
Nothing.

43
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:45,260
Weird.

44
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,919
I miss you.

45
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,780
Keep up with me.

46
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:24,919
Zi Han, I need to go to the Human Realm.

47
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,999
Tell Sen Jian it's up to him in the battle in Luocha Region.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,919
Yes, Master.

49
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,399
Master, you're going to...

50
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,000
Hou Chi asked me to meet her in the Human Realm.

51
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,798
Now you're famous in the three realms.

52
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,439
I guess she's learned about your identity.

53
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,039
She wanted to see you... maybe she's remembered something?

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,219
I hope so.

55
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,859
How is it?

56
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:56,900
Fabulous.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,599
Remember Sen Yun was no match for me.

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,859
If you surrender now, perhaps I'll spare you.

59
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,039
Such babble.

60
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,840
I'll take your life with my sword to commemorate my late third brother!

61
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,060
 Run! 

62
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,159
 Run! 

63
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:58,400
 Run now! Run! 

64
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,470
 Mom... 

65
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,758
 Run! Run now! 

66
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,518
 Water! 

67
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,658
 Come on! This way. 

68
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,919
 Such fierce spiritual fire! 

69
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,340
Are the Immortals and Demons fighting a war in the Luocha Region?

70
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:42,280
My goddess, now the disaster has come to Dibei City.

71
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,999
We need your help!

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,199
Lord Bai, my spirit barrier won't be able to sustain for long to protect the city.

73
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,900
Leave with everyone as far as you can!

74
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,798
My Lord.

75
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,518
Take care of the child.

76
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,060
I will.

77
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,219
- Guards! 
  - Yes, My Lord. 

78
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,238
Evacuate everyone out of the city.

79
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:04,800
 Yes, My Lord! 

80
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,560
Go.

81
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,439
Congratulations, Your Highness, for reaching the top level of Upper God.

82
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,399
Refining Sky Bow is indeed a treasure of Heaven and Earth for collecting evil spirits.

83
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,340
It did so much good to my cultivation.

84
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:08,479
But I've heard that His Majesty has ordered the prince to defend, not to wage wars.

85
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,060
I guess peace will soon be resumed between immortals and demons.

86
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,320
How can there be evil spirits to help you cultivate if there aren't innocent soldiers dying in vain?

87
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:32,070
I only sent you to kidnap an immortal general.

88
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,960
It seems that it is not enough to provoke a war between immortals and demons.

89
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,879
Upper God, aren't we going to take the Halberd of Sun and Moon?

90
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,399
Why are we here?

91
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,599
When disaster struck the God Realm,

92
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:09,520
Master Zhi Yang threw the Halberd here and turned it into the Heavenly Pillar,

93
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,459
marking the boundary between the Immortal and Demon Realm.

94
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:15,780
You mean the Halberd is hidden in the pillar?

95
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,300
But why haven't you or Heavenly King come to take it in all these years?

96
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,598
Isn't a divine weapon in there an easy target for the demons?

97
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:27,598
Even the Demon God, Tian Qi, can't take it.

98
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,660
What other demon could?

99
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,280
Now you're the only one besides Master Zhi Yang

100
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,800
that can take this Halberd.

101
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,599
Go ahead.

102
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,420
Do it now!

103
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,699
Master Bai Jue.

104
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:36,280
Upper God, when at Blue Dragon Pavilion, the Heavenly Queen was right.

105
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,879
There is indeed demon power in my body.

106
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,219
Sometimes it makes me lose control.

107
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:47,080
Just now when I was taking the halberd, the power again...

108
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,639
What happened?

109
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,400
I have no idea.

110
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,380
You were born to stand out.

111
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,559
As long as this demonic power helps you cultivate, you don't need to investigate into it.

112
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,690
This Halberd of Sun and Moon has guarded the immortal and demon border for tens of thousands of years.

113
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,340
Naturally, there's residual immortal or demon power.

114
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,300
Perhaps it entered your body and affected you.

115
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,619
Upper God, I have a favor to ask of you.

116
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,959
Put away the Halberd. It'll be of great use.

117
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,780
Go back to the North Sea.

118
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:39,718
Qing Mu, you were chosen by the Tai Cang Spear,

119
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:43,180
also the only one that can take the Halberd.

120
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,798
Listen to me.

121
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:50,100
Between you and Hou Chi, there's nothing but a fling.

122
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,839
Upper God,

123
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,659
I've guessed my background since I took the Halberd.

124
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:05,319
I've been thinking these days and I'm afraid I have to act against your will.

125
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,260
Now that you've guessed your background, why are you choosing your love life?

126
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,320
Maybe the positions of me and Hou Chi will eventually be replaced by True God.

127
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,060
But there are true feelings between us.

128
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,799
It matters more than my life.

129
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,300
I'll regret it if I gave it up now.

130
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,699
I beg for your permission.

131
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,918
Now rise.

132
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,080
If I don't get your permission, I'll continue to kneel.

133
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,860
Don't play that.

134
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,320
I have no other choice.

135
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,110
I've tried to advise you, to stop you, and I've even scolded you.

136
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,080
I have no other choice now, either.

137
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,279
Thank you, Upper God.

138
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,959
That wasn't a yes.

139
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,019
Since you insisted, don't blame me if it doesn't work.

140
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,038
Don't you worry, Upper God.

141
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,379
I'll protect Hou Chi.

142
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,100
Treat her well.

143
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:29,180
Every single day,

144
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,579
you have to treat her well.

145
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,719
All right. That's it.

146
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,639
- Bad news, Upper God. 
 - What is it?

147
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,100
Demons and immortals are fighting in the Luocha Region.

148
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,860
Humans are suffering and Hou Chi went alone to stop it.

149
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:58,238
With two divine weapons, he can easily settle the fight and keep her safe.

150
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:00,118
Come with me to another place.

151
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,619
To where?

152
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,939
Heavenly Palace.

153
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,980
Such fierce fire.

154
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,718
Upper God Hou Chi,

155
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:58,960
what are you trying to do by coming here?

156
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,199
The fight between the immortals and demons has brought a disaster to the Human Realm.

157
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,678
Beneath the Luocha Region, the city of Dibei has become a living hell.

158
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,880
Stop it now, or don't blame me for kill all of you.

159
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:16,320
Their lives are nothing compared to the peace of the Immortal Realm.

160
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,780
Heavenly Palace is obliged to guard the Human Realm.

161
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,979
How can you, its prince, show such a disregard for human life?

162
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:26,998
For many years, we've sacrificed numerous immortal soldiers and generals to protect the humans.

163
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:31,959
Qingchi Palace hid in its cozy corner doing nothing to help.

164
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,079
You?

165
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,879
What qualifications do you have to lecture me?

166
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,980
Now, I'll give you a lesson for His Majesty!

167
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,020
Hou Chi, are you really picking the side of the demons?

168
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,279
I don't take sides.

169
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,839
If you stop fighting, I'll leave at once.

170
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,400
Don't even think about it!

171
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,858
- Hou Chi. 
 - Mother God.

172
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:04,718
 Your Highness! 

173
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,820
It's true that you are colluding with the demons.

174
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,478
No wonder the Demon God made a scene at Heavenly Palace for your sake.

175
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:13,180
I should've taken you down at Blue Dragon Pavilion.

176
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,438
 Greetings, Master! 

177
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,100
Master?

178
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,840
Isn't that the way to address a True God?

179
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,399
I went all the way to Dibei City just to see you.

180
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,759
But you came to the Luocha Region.

181
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,399
 Jing Yuan hasn't recovered his power of True God. 

182
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,438
 But I'm at the top level of Upper God. 

183
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:42,100
 Why not seize the chance to kill him, justifiably, 

184
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,139
 and leaving nothing to worry about. 

185
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,379
Wu Huan, I've warned you.

186
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:54,639
If you ever hurt Hou Chi, your palace will be pulled off its foundation.

187
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,999
Demon God, you're a scourge to three realms, filled with evil.

188
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,879
Anyone would like to kill you.

189
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,680
How can I be threatened by you?

190
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,680
You're the Demon God.

191
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,338
Hou Chi, stop pretending you were unaware.

192
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,819
The Demon God has protected you many times.

193
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:14,118
How come you don't know who he is?

194
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Today, I'm going to take all of you down so that you can no longer do harm to the three realms.

195
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:22,718
You keep telling lies even until this moment.

196
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:25,680
Sixty thousand years ago, it was you...

197
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,238
 Run, just run! 

198
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:47,958
 Come on! Run! 

199
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:50,498
Come on! Run!

200
00:18:50,498 --> 00:18:52,059
Leave it! Run!

201
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:54,039
Leave here! Go!

202
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,238
Go!

203
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:57,238
Let me go over there.

204
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:59,259
It's too late. Just leave!

205
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,859
Come back!

206
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:06,099
My child.

207
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,820
Whose child is this?

208
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,338
Come here. Thank you.

209
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:12,918
- Don't be afraid. 
 - My Lord.

210
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,959
- Thank you. 
 - My Lord.

211
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:15,838
- My Dear. 
 - Dad...

212
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:16,679
My Lord...

213
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,759
Leave with her.

214
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,579
No. We'll leave together.

215
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:20,399
Just go!

216
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,198
- Go! 
 - No!

217
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,900
We'll go together!

218
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,859
- Shuo'er. 
 - Dad.

219
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:30,279
Shuo'er.

220
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,519
My Lord!  My Lord!

221
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,599
Dad!

222
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,298
 - My Lord! 
 - Dad! 

223
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,219
 Dad! 

224
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,718
You Highness!

225
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:12,118
There are residents beneath the Luocha Region.

226
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,759
The spiritual fire is bringing misery to the humans.

227
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,198
So what?

228
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:19,759
We need to make a small sacrifice to kill your demons.

229
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,419
We're demons?

230
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,318
As the head of the Heavenly Realm, you sacrifice human lives.

231
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,219
Aren't you the biggest demon?

232
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,919
You're so sharp-tongued.

233
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:35,019
Why? You're so reckless with the protection of Demon God.

234
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:37,800
You really think he can keep you safe?

235
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:44,478
She is my person. Surely I'll protect her.

236
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,838
Tian Qi, you've been the master between Heaven and Earth for many years.

237
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,379
Now you should know what it's like to be under someone's control.

238
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,539
You nasty phoenix.

239
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:08,580
What shortcuts did you take to reach such a high level of immortal power?

240
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,060
Now rate again your odds against us.

241
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,100
 Fine. 

242
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,260
 I'll find another time. 

243
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,500
Qing Mu, you stole the treasures of the Immortal Clan and colluded with Demon God.

244
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,920
You can't get away with that.

245
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,060
Are you all right?  Are you hurt?

246
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,679
From three to five this afternoon, meet me outside Dibei City.

247
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,019
I will.

248
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,620
Master, I felt the Purple Moon tremor when in Triple Heaven.

249
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,718
Is everything all right?

250
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,019
Yes.

251
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,740
Did Qing Mu use his power and disturb the Purple Moon?

252
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,919
It wasn't him. It was Wu Huan.

253
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,380
Her?

254
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,179
How was her power so strong?

255
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:09,679
You're not hurt, are you?

256
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,639
A nasty phoenix can never hurt me.

257
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:17,559
But her power has improved a lot in such a short time.

258
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,060
There must be something else going on.

259
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,519
Sen Yu, you go back to Triple Heaven

260
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,838
and ask Sen Jian to guard the Luocha Region in person.

261
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,739
Yes, Master.

262
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:35,019
- And Three-Head... 
 - I've deprived him of some of his spiritual power.

263
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:37,219
He tried to use evil methods to cultivate.

264
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,838
I might never find it out if I hadn't gone to Dibei City myself.

265
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:46,438
He deserves a good lesson.

266
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,718
Guards!

267
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,679
I'll leave for Dibei City,

268
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,999
and you shall take orders from Demon Emperor while I'm away.

269
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,099
 Yes, Master! 

270
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,219
Dad...

271
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,958
My Lord.

272
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,859
Dad!

273
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,840
My Lord!

274
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,590
My Lord!

275
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,090
Dad!

276
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:30,060
Dad!

277
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,958
Immortal sister!

278
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,799
You're an immortal.

279
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,400
Please! Save my dad!

280
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:42,318
The spiritual fire hit my dad while he was protecting me.

281
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,358
Please! Save him!

282
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,760
Immortal Sister!

283
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,799
Shuo'er,

284
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,839
even an immortal can't raise the dead.

285
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,198
I-I can't save your dad.

286
00:23:56,199 --> 00:24:00,060
Goddess, please save my dad.

287
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,879
Dad, please open your eyes and look at me!

288
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,899
My Lord...

289
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:10,180
Dad.

290
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,750
Shuo'er! Shuo'er!

291
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,640
Shuo'er!

292
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:40,759
Move away.

293
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,680
Hou Chi, even Demon God can't beat her.

294
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,198
It's a suicide mission if you go to Heavenly Palace now.

295
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:49,759
She's a Heavenly Queen, so she can go unpunished for killing people?

296
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,198
Humans are just ants to her.

297
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,419
Ants?

298
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:56,160
There were human lives!

299
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,260
I don't believe justice can't be served among the three realms.

300
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,519
Calm down.

301
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,539
Think of Upper God Gu Jun.

302
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:06,300
Do you want him to lose a loved one like Bai Shuo did?

303
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,280
I'm useless.

304
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,219
I couldn't protect them.

305
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:00,679
You're really the Demon God?

306
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,760
I am who you say I am.

307
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,399
If you want me to be Demon God, then I'm Tian Qi.

308
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,820
If you want me to be Demon Lord Zi Yue, then you can call me Jing Yuan.

309
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,879
What is it? You're afraid of me?

310
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:20,519
Do you even think Demon God is filled with evil?

311
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,460
You saved me many times and I've never thought of you in that way.

312
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,219
But you shouldn't have started a fight with the immortals.

313
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,198
This is the fault of the immortals.

314
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,559
Jing Yuan,

315
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,799
a war between immortals and demons brought misery to not only the two clans,

316
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,238
but also the Human Realm.

317
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,358
Why did you have to do that?

318
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:42,639
I just wanted to give them a taste of their own medicine.

319
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,198
A continuing war will bring nothing but more hatred.

320
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:49,398
Jing Yuan, there have been already too many deaths.

321
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:50,980
You're the Demon God.

322
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,099
Stop the fight, will you?

323
00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:03,399
Fine.

324
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:09,339
I promise you to stop the violence so long as the immortals don't provoke it.

325
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:22,700
And I have another favor to ask from you.

326
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Please remove the seal from my body.

327
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,198
Why do you ask so suddenly?

328
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,899
Back to the day when at Qingchi Palace, didn't you say...

329
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,838
I'd like to have my seal removed for them.

330
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,459
I want strong power.

331
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:38,199
For whom? Who are they?

332
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:41,078
For the people in the city,

333
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:44,579
the Human Realm, and even the three realms.

334
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:49,439
When I said I wanted to guard the three realms, did you think it was just talking grandiose?

335
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:52,940
Before that, I didn't know the meaning of being an immortal.

336
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,140
I spent all my time having fun at Qingchi Palace and now 60,000 years have passed.

337
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,580
If I hadn't accidentally gone to the Human Realm,

338
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,559
I wouldn't know that there is another way of living for immortals.

339
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,119
In what way?

340
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,799
Born as an immortal, it's my duty to protect lives in the three realms.

341
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,819
But I couldn't do it.

342
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:14,958
I'm too weak to do it.

343
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:20,759
With the friction going on between the two clans, neither side can rest and recuperate.

344
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,598
It even causes suffering to the Human Realm

345
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:25,560
which has been developing for only 60,000 years so far.

346
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:30,358
I want to protect the lives in the three realms with my own power.

347
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,719
I need strong power.

348
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,540
But back then you refused me so decisively.

349
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:44,159
Why? Did you quarrel with Qing Mu?

350
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,860
You don't want to live with him at Qingchi Palace as a happy couple?

351
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,838
He has nothing to do with it.

352
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:56,200
But you are not afraid that the awakening of the consciousness in your body will devour you?

353
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,718
I'm not afraid.

354
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:01,940
Nobody can wipe away my trace of existence for 60,000 years.

355
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,958
Okay.

356
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,559
I can promise you.

357
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,318
But today, I can't.

358
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,759
Why?

359
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:17,279
I haven't recovered my power of True God.

360
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,559
Besides, I need my weapon, the Purple Moon Whip, to remove the seal.

361
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,679
But it has turned into the Purple Moon supporting the Demon Realm.

362
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:30,819
Now it's not a good time to take it back as the two clans are still fighting.

363
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:33,260
Okay, I'll wait.

364
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,100
Let's go.

365
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,880
Lord of the North Sea, what are you doing?

366
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,280
We shouldn't have bothered you with her business.

367
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,958
Since when are you in charge of her business?

368
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:45,538
We're getting married. Of course, I can have a say.

369
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:46,519
Qing Mu...

370
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,820
You're getting married?

371
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,519
Did Gu Jun agree to that?

372
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,438
Sure.

373
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:54,099
He agreed to our marriage.

374
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,359
How come Father God...

375
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,358
Do you know who you're going to marry?

376
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:03,860
Of course I do.

377
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,840
Between Heaven and Earth and across the three realms,

378
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,559
she's the only one.

379
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,438
Gu Jun agreed and so what?

380
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:12,379
I won't agree!

381
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,158
Lord of the North Sea, thank you for your help.

382
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:18,820
Please leave us.

383
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,399
Demon Lord Zi Yue, please don't forget the promise you made today.

384
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,099
I'll be back.

385
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,420
Master, if Master Shang Gu and Master Bai Jue made peace...

386
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,539
It won't be that easy.

387
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:49,279
Qing Mu helped me with everyone watching in the Luocha Region.

388
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,838
Suspicious as Wu Huan is,

389
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:54,519
Heavenly Palace will no longer trust Qingchi Palace or the North Sea.

390
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,838
And they will definitely go against them in every possible way.

391
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,100
But with the seal, the power of Upper God Hou Chi will still be limited.

392
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,979
That's dangerous for her.

393
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:08,159
Let her stay in the Human Realm.

394
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,979
I'll remove her seal after dealing with Wu Huan.

395
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,318
Your Majesty,

396
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:23,039
Lord of the North Sea and Hou Chi betrayed our Immortal Clan

397
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,940
by colluding with Demon God.

398
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,579
Please give the order to capture them!

399
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:31,519
Mother God, Qing Mu is our first Upper Immortal

400
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,478
and Hou Chi is the daughter of Upper God Gu Jun.

401
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:38,140
- Could there be... some misunderstanding? 
 - Misunderstanding?

402
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,910
When we were fighting in the Luocha Region,

403
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,550
they helped the Demon God right in front of both armies.

404
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,498
Everyone saw that. What misunderstanding could it be?

405
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,718
Father God, I saw it with my own eyes.

406
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,879
I might have been killed by Hou Chi were it not for Mother God coming to my rescue.

407
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,139
I beg for justice, Father God.

408
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,170
Your Majesty,

409
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:08,190
besides Tai Cang Spear, Qing Mu has the Halberd of Sun and Moon.

410
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,359
If we don't bring him to our palace before he turns into an Upper God,

411
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,039
he'll become a troublemaker to us.

412
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,279
Your Majesty.

413
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,418
Guards, I order you...

414
00:32:18,418 --> 00:32:21,400
 Upper God Gu Jun is here to see Your Majesty. 

415
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,300
 Greetings, Upper God Gu Jun. 

416
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,839
Gu Jun, what brought you to Heavenly Palace?

417
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:48,999
I was afraid if I didn't show up in time, you'd convict Qingchi Palace

418
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,099
for colluding with demons and harming the three realms.

419
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:55,839
Gu Jun, we haven't figured it out.

420
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,519
I was just trying to summon them here to talk about that.

421
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,838
You don't have to.

422
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,550
I sent them to the Luocha Region.

423
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,120
All right.

424
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,420
Did you ask them to collude with Demon God, too?

425
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:18,358
Why should I wait until today if I need to collude with Demon God?

426
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:22,399
I could have worked with the demons to eliminate Immortal Clan 60,000 years ago.

427
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,860
Are you declaring yourself an enemy to Heavenly Palace,

428
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,939
betraying the Immortal Clan?

429
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,798
Wu Huan, you're going too far.

430
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,239
Gu Jun, I've never doubted your intentions.

431
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:43,318
But why did you send them to help Demon God?

432
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:47,139
That wasn't their purpose in the Luocha Region.

433
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,780
They were trying to stop the fight.

434
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:10,140
The war between the immortals and demons mustn't involve the humans.

435
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,999
Three realms were informed of this rule set by Heavenly King and Demon Emperor.

436
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,100
Were it not for Qing Mu and Hou Chi showing up in time,

437
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:21,520
the clans might have destroyed more cities.

438
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,100
But if we lost and the demons took control,

439
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,639
would there still be peace in the Human Realm?

440
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,100
Immortals have to protect humans. This is the rule set by True God Zhi Yang.

441
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:38,379
A ceasefire between two clans will bring peace to all.

442
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,398
Earlier I sent Jing Jian to make peace with the demons,

443
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,238
Demon God went back on his word and provoked a war.

444
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:50,478
If we hadn't taken on the fight, there would have been more death.

445
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:51,799
Gu Jun,

446
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,100
I asked you to take back the Halberd of Sun and Moon with Qing Mu,

447
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:01,099
to beat Demon God and restore the God Realm with all the four Divine Weapons of True God.

448
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:05,398
No matter why Qing Mu was there in the first place,

449
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:07,939
he did help the demons.

450
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:14,179
I won't have faith in his loyalty until I see the Halberd returned to Heavenly Palace.

451
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,999
You have three days.

452
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,220
Okay.

453
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,020
Three days it is.

454
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:23,398
 No wonder you always let Qing Mu get away. 

455
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:26,579
 You're still planning to restore the God Realm. 

456
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,479
Hou Chi.

457
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:34,279
Hou Chi!

458
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:37,460
Hou Chi.

459
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,700
Why did you stop Jing Yuan from removing my seal?

460
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,999
I don't want to lose you.

461
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,799
- But the one you like... 
 - It's you.

462
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,100
You once asked me, when we first met on Observation Mountain...

463
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:59,799
 If you didn't see my bracelet when we first met on Observation Mountain 

464
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,198
 and you didn't think of me as the one you were destined for, 

465
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,398
 would you still risk your life escorting me to the Demon Clan? 

466
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:08,999
 Would you protect me with your life and love me? 

467
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,379
My answer is yes.

468
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,279
I don't care who you are,

469
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,398
or who it is inside your body.

470
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:21,719
For me, you're just Hou Chi, the only one of you between Heaven and Earth.

471
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,819
You're the one I love with my life.

472
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:28,600
I don't want you to be anyone else.

473
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:31,339
If you are lying to me...

474
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:32,860
If I lie even half a sentence,

475
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,630
I'm willing to suffer by being struck with 49 claps of thunder to death!

476
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,679
Thunder can't kill you.

477
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:39,999
Your oath doesn't count.

478
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,180
Or... if I lied, I'd be turned into charcoal by it.

479
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,020
Hou Chi, I dare not lie to you.

480
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,238
Losing you is scarier than losing my life.

481
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:53,478
I know you're suffering anguish without having anyone to talk to.

482
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:55,260
And you don't know what to do.

483
00:36:56,479 --> 00:37:00,559
But don't worry. I'll always be with you no matter what happens.

484
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:06,478
I failed to save Shuo'er's father.

485
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:09,100
If only I were stronger,

486
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,878
then she wouldn't have lost her dad.

487
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:13,040
It's not your fault.

488
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,119
Don't worry.

489
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,250
Someday we'll go back to Triple Heaven

490
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,139
and take justice into our hands.

491
00:37:33,379 --> 00:37:35,478
- Shuo'er. 
 - You like her.

492
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:40,660
If I hadn't met this family, I might still be blaming my Father God.

493
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:46,138
You're not a child of his blood.

494
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:49,900
Yet he treats you as you were one.

495
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,080
I was in it and didn't realize that.

496
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,999
Legend has it that the death of mortals will be sent to the Immortal River by a sky lantern.

497
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,839
They hope to enter the Heavenly Realm in the next life

498
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,940
far from the bondage of the Human Realm.

499
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,559
Yet they have no idea that

500
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:09,438
sometimes even an Upper God would feel powerless and hopeless.

501
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:13,000
Hou Chi, it wasn't your fault.

502
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,599
Don't blame yourself.

503
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,459
Qing Mu, I said I want the seal removed,

504
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:19,180
it's not something spur of the moment.

505
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,119
The war between the two clans brings pain to the humans.

506
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,718
The world is no longer at peace.

507
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,478
And Father God is old with many wounds.

508
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:29,559
I can't leave him alone to deal with the three realms.

509
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,039
I'm here.

510
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,319
I'll keep both the Human Realm and Qingchi Palace safe.

511
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,879
When we were at Blue Dragon Pavilion,

512
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:40,359
I told you that I would never let you face danger and difficulty alone again.

513
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,799
I want to fight with you,

514
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,678
not to hide behind you, seeking your protection.

515
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:48,660
Don't worry.

516
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,280
I'll remember you even with the seal removed.

517
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,599
I'll remember everything we did.

518
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:59,660
No matter what you will do, just promise that you won't leave me.

519
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:04,859
At this moment, the fighting has stopped...

520
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:09,799
and Dibei City is no longer in danger.

521
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,398
Let's go back to Qingchi Palace.

522
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:13,260
Upper God Gu Jun is waiting for you.

523
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,039
What's wrong?

524
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,199
I've been feeling a disturbance in my spiritual power ever since I took the Halberd.

525
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:45,079
I see him!

526
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,040
Who?

527
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,519
Bo Xuan.

528
00:39:54,050 --> 00:40:03,950


529
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:13,670
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

530
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:20,710
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

531
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:27,124
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

532
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:33,199
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

533
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:40,124
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

534
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:46,699
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

535
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:54,024
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

536
00:40:54,025 --> 00:41:00,470
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

537
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,719
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

538
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:24,299
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

539
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:31,379
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

540
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:38,580
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

541
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:46,560
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

542
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,439
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

543
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:59,875
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

544
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:06,519
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

545
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:17,025
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
