1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,030


2
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:21,300
   

3
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,020
   

4
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,479
 The spiritual power here is thin. 

5
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,559
  The barrier should be damaged. 

6
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:45,619
 But the God Tying Chain hasn't been weakened. 

7
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:47,800
 It's Aura of Chaos. 

8
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,599
 Is it the God Slayer Flower? 

9
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,079
When it blooms, it produces the Aura of Chaos.

10
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,659
Only the Chief God can absorb it.

11
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,179
It boosts the cultivation of the Power of Chaos.

12
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,199
Bai Jue, the little Chief God is beyond your skill.

13
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,399
Why not entrust her to me?

14
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:23,259
Within 1,000 years, she'd be Chief God of Chaos.

15
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:32,318
Qing Tian tricked me and trapped me here at the God Tying Pavilion.

16
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,439
I can do her no harm.

17
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,780
You have nothing to worry about.

18
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,359
My offering will do good to not only for you and me,

19
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:44,820
but to all living creatures...

20
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,450
in the three realms.

21
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,659
Only by becoming the Chief God of Chaos,

22
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,639
will you alter destiny.

23
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,310
   

24
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,298
 Even if you're the Chief God, 

25
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:03,660
 I will love you as always. 

26
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,399
 Bai Jue will never betray your love. 

27
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,499
This story script is good.

28
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:15,219
It's related to the nine-headed serpent.

29
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:17,300
I'm copying it down.

30
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,518
I overheard that, Master Bai Jue will treat you to dinner

31
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:25,060
in his room, alone.

32
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,580
 The red line pays off? That's too soon! 

33
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:34,519
- Your Royal Highness, let's go and prepare. 
 - Prepare what?

34
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,780
To change your clothes and freshen up.

35
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,879
Now that True God Bai Jue invites me,

36
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,539
I'd better show up, right?

37
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:45,379
Anyway, we're still pursuing cultivation.

38
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:48,960
Do not be bothered by these trifles.

39
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,178
If Master Bai Jue confesses his love to you,

40
00:04:57,178 --> 00:05:02,059
you should respond accordingly as the Chief God of Chaos.

41
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:07,078
That's not what you're supposed to say.

42
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:08,958
We're not that close.

43
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,279
How dare you mock me!

44
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,060
I dare not.

45
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,718
Your Royal Highness, Master Bai Jue would like to see you.

46
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:26,659
Please come to Abyss Hall if you may.

47
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,478
You may tell him, I'll be there.

48
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:30,979
Yes.

49
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,298
It's just an ordinary dinner.

50
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:56,319
That's extravagant.

51
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,698
When Hong Ri came to me, I was selecting the dress for Selection Day with Wu Huan.

52
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:04,479
I didn't want to keep you waiting.

53
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,600
So I set off wearing it.

54
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,839
Try them out. They're your favorite.

55
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,199
You're best known for being a foodie.

56
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,920
What's wrong? Lost your appetite?

57
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,759
 Dumb! Can't you tell? 

58
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,979
 I'm trying to be elegant! 

59
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,480
Try the sour bamboo shoot. It's appetizing.

60
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,339
 See that? The shining bracelet on my wrist! 

61
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:45,700
 I really cherish your gift. 

62
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,139
The dumplings are still warm.

63
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,600
They are best served warm.

64
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,100
 My lip makeup... 

65
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,399
Don't you like it?

66
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,079
Is it good?

67
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,340
Take it easy. Don't choke.

68
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,740
Shang Gu, I have something to discuss with you.

69
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,340
 Here it comes! 

70
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,099
 Ice Cube Bai is pouring me wine! 

71
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,160
 Is it... 

72
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,159
 the time for a love confession? 

73
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,419
I came up with a good plan

74
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,880
to help you with the instruction feather.

75
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,818
Good news. There's too much to learn. I shouldn't cease learning.

76
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:53,619
Shall we set off together?

77
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:59,780
I'm afraid you're on your own this time.

78
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:03,080
On my own?

79
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,019
Where to?

80
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,479
Combat is the fastest way to cultivate.

81
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:14,978
You should... head to the Netherworld alone.

82
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,220
The Netherworld?

83
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,640
For how long?

84
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:24,320
1,000 years.

85
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,539
1,000 years.

86
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,479
Shang Gu,

87
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:34,980
you've been learning hard.

88
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,160
Time is running out. I have no other choice.

89
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,940
I'm not reluctant to go with you.

90
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,018
But you're practicing the Power of Chaos.

91
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:45,658
I can't help you. Nor can Tian Qi or Zhi Yang.

92
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:47,699
You're on your own.

93
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,179
I'm reciting Classic of Mountains and Seas.

94
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:52,959
I will learn hard.

95
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,340
Don't bluff me with the Netherworld.

96
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,939
It's my decision. It's settled.

97
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:00,819
I don't get it.

98
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:03,419
Why are you expelling me?

99
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,339
What did I do wrong?

100
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,159
It's a dangerous place.

101
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,499
There will be no one protecting you, guiding you.

102
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:13,180
You must not act willfully.

103
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,699
Think twice before you make a move. Remember?

104
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,699
I'm not leaving! Not without you!

105
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,478
I prepared these elixirs for you.

106
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:25,798
It may come to help—

107
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,760
I don't agree!

108
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:36,898
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

109
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:39,578
I know I'm willful. I hate learning or cultivating.

110
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:42,060
I was never into reading, but I'm learning.

111
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,358
I will try to live up to your expectations.

112
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:47,400
Don't send me there, please.

113
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,119
You're a True God, born to govern the three realms.

114
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:58,679
This is not ours to decide.

115
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,679
So this is the last meal.

116
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:13,218
Fine. I'll leave.

117
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:18,860
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

118
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:25,459
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

119
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:32,665
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

120
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:39,633
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

121
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:43,179
 He's always been ruthless. 

122
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:45,478
 You were over thinking. 

123
00:11:45,478 --> 00:11:47,400
 It only brings trouble. 

124
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,320
What did Bai Jue do this time?

125
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,620
He said... he's sending me to the Netherworld.

126
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,820
On my own, for 1,000 years.

127
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,710
Is he crazy?

128
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,919
It's crowded with the devils!

129
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,379
How could he be so cruel!

130
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:06,899
I must talk to him.

131
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:12,999
Do you think... I have to be the Chief God of Chaos

132
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,340
to make him satisfied?

133
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,500
Stupid girl. I don't want you to go through these.

134
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,799
I don't want to go. Not to the Netherworld.

135
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,158
What should I do? How could he take it back?

136
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,598
Whatever happens, I'll be on your side.

137
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:39,660
We will think of a way.

138
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,540
What's the big deal?

139
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,579
If all, we can fight.

140
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,539
It's Selection Day tomorrow.

141
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:47,200
You should rest now, Master.

142
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,979
Go to the Lower Realm for me tomorrow.

143
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:52,698
Transfer Spiritual Power to Wu Xi.

144
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,718
Help him change into a human form.

145
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:56,340
What?

146
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,419
I'm just doing a favor.

147
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:00,459
Wu Xi and Feng Yan are separated.

148
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:02,840
I have sympathy for them.

149
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,040
Sympathy from you? For real?

150
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,459
They've been separated for 1,000 years.

151
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,119
I can't imagine the suffering.

152
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,938
Mu Guang, thanks.

153
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:53,959
Don't mention it.

154
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,440
We had a deal. Help each other out in the God Realm.

155
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,719
It's Selection Day. The day when we pick our disciples.

156
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:14,179
The four Immortals below are the best of all years.

157
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,598
Please select carefully.

158
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:20,419
To cultivate talents and to prolong our glory.

159
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,520
 Yes, Your Royal Highness. 

160
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,559
On your feet.

161
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,358
You're outstanding in the Lower Realm.

162
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:30,598
You've been ranked by the Selection Trial.

163
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:33,940
Introduce yourself.

164
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,038
I'm Zhong Li of Mountain Kunlun.

165
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,238
I'm Xia Hui, a Crane Demon from Shanzhou Island.

166
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,480
I am Mu Guang, a Golden Dragon Demon from Mountain Tianci.

167
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,018
 A Golden Dragon Demon! 

168
00:15:46,018 --> 00:15:49,539
Mu Guang is a talent with great power.

169
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:52,038
He ranked first in the trial.

170
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,238
And he's practicing mind calming art.

171
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:58,558
In my opinion, Shang Gu should take him in.

172
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,959
I am Gu Jun.

173
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,599
a Flood Dragon Demon from the Swamp of Netherhill.

174
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,058
 - Flood Dragon? 
 - Seriously? 

175
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:09,378
Why is there someone from the wild land? 
    

176
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:11,979
Selection Day is a solemn ceremony.

177
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:13,759
If the Lower Realm can't get together four candidates,

178
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,319
they could have reported it.

179
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,980
Why is there a lower demon here?

180
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,039
Goddess of Snow, are you looking down upon the demons?

181
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,618
I dare not.

182
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:28,419
I heard that apart from the four True Gods,

183
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:30,859
all other gods have their own responsibilities.

184
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,079
That all gods are equal.

185
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,659
If I am a lower demon,

186
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,330
what does that make this goddess in the God Realm?

187
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,399
If the God Realm categorize us by regions in the Lower Realm,

188
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,120
Then this humble demon would rather quit.

189
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,379
How dare you! You...

190
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:52,359
Young man, you've got a backbone.

191
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,419
Come close. Let me take a look.

192
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,138
That face looks familiar.

193
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:10,798
Of course. Your toughness rings a bell.

194
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,658
Zhi Yang, I love his character.

195
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:19,819
The others are yours to choose.

196
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,699
He will be the disciple of Pilgrim Hall.

197
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:23,899
It's your call.

198
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:25,559
At your service, Master.

199
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,639
I disagree.

200
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,438
Master Bai Jue, Pilgrim Hall is beyond you.

201
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:32,639
It's up to Shang Gu.

202
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,799
It's Pilgrim Hall that's choosing disciples,

203
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,238
not Master Bai Jue.

204
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:41,218
Rumors in the Lower Realm say, Wu Huan is serving Her Royal Highness.

205
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:43,238
That's why she has gotten promoted so quickly.

206
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:46,859
I'm afraid Gu Jun is taken in because of his looks, too.

207
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,339
 How could she say so? 

208
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:49,879
 Come on. 

209
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,139
Say that again!

210
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:52,238
How could you say that?

211
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,218
You may insult me! Don't you dare ruin my master's reputation!

212
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,059
You're a lower demon.

213
00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:59,799
What could you do?

214
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,559
A humble god can also achieve a great cause.

215
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,799
We have a long life.

216
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,859
No one knows about the future for sure.

217
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:11,540
Goddess of Snow, I challenge you as Gu Jun's master.

218
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,379
you two shall have a fight in a month.

219
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:17,800
I promise that if Gu Jun is defeated,

220
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,038
I will set off to the Netherworld and cultivate the Power of Chaos.

221
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:26,279
I will not return to the God Realm until I deserve the instruction feather.

222
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,118
But if you're defeated,

223
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,380
you shall leave the Gods Realm forever.

224
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:42,319
I accept your challenge.

225
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,359
Raise your hands.

226
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,658
Thank you, Master. I, Mu Guang, will never fail you.

227
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:06,479
I never expected much for Selection Day.

228
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,438
I'm surprised to have a disciple ranked first.

229
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,438
Don't worry. Although I'm not a True God,

230
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:13,198
you'll get what you deserve.

231
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,958
I will try my best to teach you

232
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:17,439
and make you a god as soon as possible.

233
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,358
I, Mu Guang, a Golden Dragon Demon from Mountain Tianci

234
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,198
will be Goddess of the Stars and the Moon's disciple.

235
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:27,939
I owe my life to my parents and my career to you.

236
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:31,559
I will be devoted to cultivation.

237
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,020
Raise up. Save the etiquette.

238
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,459
You're a talented disciple.

239
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:41,739
But you're dull. That resembles Zhi Yang.

240
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,438
I dare not.

241
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:49,839
By the way, I haven't submitted my proof of allegiance to you.

242
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:54,098
The next time I go back, I will make it up to my master.

243
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:55,598
Don't bother.

244
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,520
Now I'm impressed with your etiquette and culture.

245
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,759
Moonlight Pavilion is built.

246
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,718
But there's only a plaque but no couplets.

247
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:07,520
Can you handle that?

248
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,718
Yes, Master. I can handle that.

249
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,018
Bear this in mind.

250
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:17,039
Don't make it pedantic. Make it grand.

251
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,098
Then you can find me in Peach Woods.

252
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:20,700
Yes, Master.

253
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,358
Immortal Gu Jun, this is Pilgrim Hall.

254
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,698
Her Royal Highness is inside. You may wait here.

255
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,739
Thank you.

256
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,919
Master, Gu Jun at your service.

257
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,598
Don't panic.

258
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,759
I used to be the same when I got here.

259
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,619
Rise up. There are only you and me.

260
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,898
I'm here to report to master as her disciple.

261
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:18,559
Please transfer it for me, Goddess.

262
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,958
Her Royal Highness is reading. She can't see you.

263
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:24,520
She asked me to pass on a message.

264
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:26,598
I'm all ears.

265
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:29,958
The duel is approaching. Be sure to practice.

266
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:33,358
Forget about the unnecessary formalities.

267
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,819
Don't be constraint by etiquette.

268
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:40,279
Don't worry. Her Royal Highness is amiable.

269
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,279
And she's kind to us.

270
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,959
Just do as she says.

271
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:52,319
I comply with your wish, Master.

272
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:56,318
All right, that's it.

273
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,800
Pilgrim Hall is your home from now on.

274
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:05,279
I heard you're from the Swamp of Netherhill.

275
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,459
Where did you practice?

276
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,679
I'm from Flood Dragon Pool.

277
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,499
Flood Dragon Pool?

278
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:14,618
What a coincidence!

279
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:17,419
I practiced there for 100 years.

280
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,559
Is that so?

281
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,718
I thought Flood Dragon Pool was a barren place.

282
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:24,358
There isn't enough spiritual power.

283
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,599
Why did you choose that place?

284
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:32,799
Lord of the Ground there is benevolent.

285
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,598
He loves to share his knowledge.

286
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:38,499
I'm here thanks to his favor.

287
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:44,218
I owe it to the Lord of the Ground to pass the trials.

288
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,378
How is he doing?

289
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:49,779
Three bottles a day, as usual.

290
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:52,700
He's always into wine.

291
00:22:55,439 --> 00:23:00,740
Goddess, when did you practice there?

292
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,258
It's 3,000 years ago.

293
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:03,819
I was there, too.

294
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:04,819
Is that so?

295
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:07,519
Why didn't I notice you?

296
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,258
My cultivation only reached the lower level.

297
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:12,238
I practiced in seclusion.

298
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:14,999
No wonder you didn't notice me.

299
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,799
It's only been 3,000 years.

300
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,118
You've improved a lot.

301
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,519
I'm not an intelligent demon.

302
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,318
I may only be a little diligent.

303
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,438
No wonder Her Royal Highness picked you.

304
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:28,978
You are one of a kind.

305
00:23:28,978 --> 00:23:31,799
Stop making fun of me, Goddess.

306
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,999
Don't call me goddess.

307
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,939
Just call me Wu Huan.

308
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:40,318
What a coincidence! We share a bond.

309
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,559
I'm surprised, too.

310
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,519
I didn't know the sacred beast of Chief God

311
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,838
used to practice at a barren place.

312
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,078
I thought...

313
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,078
the swamp was only for

314
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,239
lower demons like me.

315
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,718
You are right.

316
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:57,100
I am a lower demon from the Wutong forest.

317
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,118
A five-colored phoenix.

318
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:00,759
Sorry. That's not what I mean.

319
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,138
Truly.

320
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:03,779
Origin says nothing about us.

321
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:05,098
No one can despise us

322
00:24:05,098 --> 00:24:07,139
as long as we're confident.

323
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,780
All right, it's time to cultivate.

324
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,960
I'm...

325
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,780
leaving.

326
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:22,440
Gu Jun.

327
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,338
Whatever you need,

328
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:28,039
don't hesitate to tell me.

329
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,099
Thank you, Lordess Wu Huan.

330
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,639
Unyielding.

331
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,340
He's more honorable than

332
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,250
some of those arrogant gods.

333
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,200
   

334
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,679
God Zi Han, Master Zhi Yang has given the order.

335
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,579
Mu Guang will learn from Upper Goddess Yue Mi.

336
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:53,838
We shall be Master Tian Qi's disciples.

337
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,958
Would you please

338
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,539
lead us to our master?

339
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,759
Cut it off.

340
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,819
Master said,

341
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:02,399
only beautiful gods are permitted in his hall.

342
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,078
Ugly as you are, you're not allowed to come in.

343
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,680
Not allowed?

344
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,750
What should we do?

345
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,958
We must have somewhere to go here.

346
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,318
Right.

347
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,539
All right. I'll send you snow lotus seeds.

348
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:17,799
You may become good-looking with them.

349
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,238
The next Selection Day, Master might appreciate you.

350
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,200
Master...

351
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:34,399
He's only a sacred beast! How dare he lecture us!

352
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,100
That's annoying.

353
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:39,099
I really envy Mu Guang.

354
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:41,499
After Goddess Yue Mi took him in,

355
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,060
she cherishes him so much

356
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,959
that she's teaching him like the 12-star envoys.

357
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,598
We can't match Mu Guang for sure.

358
00:25:50,598 --> 00:25:54,899
But how could the humble Gu Jun steal our thunder?

359
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:59,239
I must get revenge when I have the chance.

360
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,980
Let's go.

361
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,478
 Goddess Xue Ying. 

362
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:12,019
Don't panic. I didn't hear anything.

363
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:15,738
It's just that... the nine-clawed lotuses are blooming by Abyss Hall.

364
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:19,718
It's a highly toxic flower, don't underestimate it.

365
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:21,760
It's scourging the angelfish in the pool.

366
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,659
You should deal with it.

367
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,899
Yes, Goddess.

368
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,439
Your Royal Highness, you haven't been to Abyss Hall for days.

369
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,539
Hong Ri keeps asking about you.

370
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:52,779
What did he say?

371
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,519
We are worried about the challenge.

372
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:59,059
Xue Ying is a goddess.

373
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:03,139
We don't think Gu Jun can match her.

374
00:27:03,139 --> 00:27:06,939
Gu Jun came all the way from the Swamp of Netherhill to the Selection Trial.

375
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:10,380
He must have the perseverance it takes.

376
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,038
With enough time, I'm sure I can do better.

377
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:18,139
By that time, Pilgrim Hall will be the best hall of all for sure.

378
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:20,699
Just keep cultivating.

379
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:22,620
I will take care of this place for you.

380
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,339
You and Gu Jun can focus on cultivating.

381
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,539
Gu Jun, you should be thankful.

382
00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:00,899
If it wasn't for us, you'd burn yourself.

383
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:03,258
Whatever, you're just a demon.

384
00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:05,660
Do you really think that you have acquired divine power?

385
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,879
If I were you, I would go home early.

386
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,038
In case you embarrass the Chief God in a month.

387
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:12,539
Shut your mouths.

388
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,539
 What the hell is that? 

389
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:24,078
 It hit my face! 

390
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,519
- Let's go! 
  - Master! 

391
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,718
 Master, are you okay? 

392
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:28,380
You!

393
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,499
Your Royal Highness.

394
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:39,419
Everlasting Hall is on fire.

395
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:43,419
Zi Han detained Gu Jun, saying that he was assassinating Master Tian Qi.

396
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,500
   

397
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,880
 Your Royal Highness. 

398
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,280
You're hurt this badly!

399
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:21,400
Steady. Steady.

400
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:28,259
Shang Gu, I was careless. Those immortals caught me off guard.

401
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:31,379
I'm afraid I'm dying.

402
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:33,519
It's just a nine-clawed lotus.

403
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,618
You're a True God. How is that possible?

404
00:29:36,618 --> 00:29:38,618
It's more than that.

405
00:29:38,618 --> 00:29:40,819
I've been practicing recently.

406
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:44,578
But it got deviated, my meridian of the heart is hurt.

407
00:29:44,578 --> 00:29:46,559
Nine-clawed lotus is harmful to my heart.

408
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,699
It worsens now.

409
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:51,380
I'm afraid...

410
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,460
I can't make it this time.

411
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,160
Really?

412
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:03,459
Shang Gu... I wish you could be by my side

413
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:05,940
as I pass away.

414
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:09,599
Don't worry. You will make it through.

415
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,859
Why?

416
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:15,979
I just learned the pressure point technique from the Lower Realm.

417
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:19,139
It won't work.

418
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:21,560
We must try everything.

419
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,679
Don't you say so?

420
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,919
I know it. I said you can make it through.

421
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,240
When did you notice?

422
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,860
Of course, I knew the moment I walked in.

423
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,560
Is my acting skill that bad?

424
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,780
Not as good as mine!

425
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,059
When I was young, I was hurt by Tao Tie.

426
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:49,539
You took me to the Lower Realm for a cure.

427
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:52,219
We spent more than a century there.

428
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,739
As for me, I knew I recovered.

429
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:58,698
You were using me as an excuse to play around.

430
00:30:58,698 --> 00:31:00,038
Nonsense.

431
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:02,138
You were so naughty. As naughty as a boy!

432
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:03,660
Zhi Yang could hardly stand you.

433
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,918
I was the only one who covered it up for you.

434
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:08,398
I learned nothing from you

435
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:11,098
but playing tricks and telling lies.

436
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:13,359
You learned that from Yue Mi.

437
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,600
You must be mistaken. Not me.

438
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:24,059
Although the Demon King is locked by God Tying Chain,

439
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,859
there are many other devils in the Netherworld.

440
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:28,619
It's too dangerous.

441
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:30,919
I don't want you to go.

442
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,038
I know you.

443
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:36,498
You're only pretending to be willful.

444
00:31:36,498 --> 00:31:39,179
On the inside, you're tough.

445
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:42,238
Shang Gu, you have grown up in controversy.

446
00:31:42,238 --> 00:31:45,799
After hearing the gossips about you,

447
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:48,779
you'd get revenge and educate them with pranks.

448
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,498
But back in the hall, you cry on your own.

449
00:31:51,498 --> 00:31:53,439
The title of Chief of God sounds glorious.

450
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:56,359
Uneasy is the head that wears a crown.

451
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,899
I found it out on Selection Day.

452
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:00,699
Zhi Yang and Bai Jue must have discussed it.

453
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:03,299
Neither of them stopped you to leave.

454
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,699
Don't worry, I'm on your side.

455
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:08,760
No one can force you against your will.

456
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,899
It's just the Netherworld. Merely 1,000 years.

457
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,918
It will pass in a blink. I don't mind it.

458
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:18,119
You're not a good actor, either.

459
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,459
It's all for the instruction feather.

460
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:27,060
I'll do whatever it takes.

461
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:33,338
The naughty Chief of God finally grew up.

462
00:32:33,338 --> 00:32:37,000
You're way too sensible now.

463
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:58,059
I'm sorry.

464
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,978
Which god are you?

465
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,580
Please accept my apology, I am Mu Guang.

466
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,800
It's you!

467
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,918
I am not a god. I'm only a servant here.

468
00:33:13,918 --> 00:33:17,259
I don't deserve your bow.

469
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,800
You're Her Royal Highness's sacred beast, Wu Huan.

470
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,338
I was being rash.

471
00:33:29,338 --> 00:33:30,939
I apologize.

472
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:34,800
I will pay for your dress.

473
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,819
Never mind, it was an accident.

474
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:42,359
Your calligraphy has gotten dirty.

475
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,700
It's all right.

476
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,258
"Between light and shadow,

477
00:33:49,258 --> 00:33:51,700
lies the infinite space.

478
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,740
From beginnings to finales, one marches without regret."

479
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,760
I like it.

480
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,560
I sense deep feelings.

481
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,400
And it's majestic.

482
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,760
Here you are.

483
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,638
Goddess Yu Mi asked me to write the couplet for the Moonlight Pavilion.

484
00:34:10,638 --> 00:34:13,139
I came up with a lot of ideas.

485
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,519
But only this pair impresses me.

486
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,280
I was on my way to show it to my master.

487
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,260
That was why I ran into you. Sorry about that.

488
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,319
It's okay. You've apologized to me.

489
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:27,899
It's okay. I'm waiting to hear from Gu Jun.

490
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,019
Please excuse me.

491
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:33,359
Gu Jun? Is everything okay?

492
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,459
He got into trouble at Everlasting Hall.

493
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:39,879
I'm worried about him.

494
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:43,578
With Her Royal Highness there, he should be okay.

495
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:51,139
What if she wasn't there?

496
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,878
You're from a noble family.

497
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:59,919
You never know how hard it is for lower demons like us.

498
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:04,339
I'm afraid you cannot share Gu Jun's feelings.

499
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:07,120
I don't know about that.

500
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,719
I don't want to be looked down upon.

501
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:28,899
What's wrong? You're uglier than yesterday.

502
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:30,940
Gu Jun hit us; we seek Master's respect and judgment.

503
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,499
Don't call me Master.

504
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:35,099
Everlasting Hall won't take losers in.

505
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,660
It's more than that. How could you hurt Master Tian Qi,

506
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,099
especially his face?

507
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:45,598
2,000 years ago, a leaf of an old tree fell onto his face.

508
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:48,540
And he banished the tree to the Lower Realm.

509
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,899
- Spit it out. Which one of you used the nine-clawed lotus? 
 - It's him!

510
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,079
What lotus? I've never heard about it.

511
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,359
Gu Jun, although you're a disciple at Pilgrim Hall,

512
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,459
I must act justly. Be honest with me.

513
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:02,260
Did you put the nine-clawed lotus here?

514
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,859
I didn't.

515
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:06,720
Okay, I believe you.

516
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,178
Your Royal Highness, the nine-clawed lotus is a specialty in the Demon Realm.

517
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:13,339
We're immortals. How could we have that?

518
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:16,378
Even so, in the God Realm, there are...

519
00:36:16,378 --> 00:36:18,958
In the east pool of Abyss Hall.

520
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:21,058
Gu Jun must have taken it from the Lower Realm.

521
00:36:21,058 --> 00:36:23,040
If can't be Bai...

522
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:27,219
Enough. I don't want to know the details.

523
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:30,678
You two, take three Sky Thunders as your punishments.

524
00:36:30,678 --> 00:36:31,559
Yes, Master.

525
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,639
As for you,

526
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:37,199
that's not my concern.

527
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,779
Shang Gu knows what to do.

528
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:45,178
Go away. I don't want to see your face.

529
00:36:45,178 --> 00:36:47,479
Forget about the etiquette?

530
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,560
Thanks, Master.

531
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,858
I just tested Gu Jun's cultivation.

532
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:01,198
With freezing meridians, his spiritual power is in a mess.

533
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,740
He could only match Xue Ying

534
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,859
if he makes it to a god.

535
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:08,040
Otherwise, he'll be defeated.

536
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:12,119
I'm here to check on you. What happened?

537
00:37:12,919 --> 00:37:16,039
Zhong Li and Xia Hui. They tried to set me up.

538
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:18,299
But they're doomed to failure.

539
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:20,579
You've made it.

540
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,199
Now you're Her Royal Highness's disciple.

541
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:26,638
Many envy you. Be sure to take care.

542
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:29,478
I get it. I'm afraid I'm cultivating too slowly.

543
00:37:29,478 --> 00:37:31,019
What if I lose to Xue Ying?

544
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:32,678
It will embarrass my master.

545
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:34,678
I'll practice with you.

546
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:39,199
We can help each other with our disadvantages.

547
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,479
Thanks, Brother.

548
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,638
What's that?

549
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,700
It's a couplet I wrote for my master.

550
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:54,539
By the way, do you always practice your sword at Pilgrim Hall?

551
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:58,398
I'm afraid not. I practice whenever I feel like doing it.

552
00:37:58,398 --> 00:38:00,460
Let's take a walk.

553
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,099
Sure.

554
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,519
Is Lordess Wu Huan in Pilgrim Hall often?

555
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,478
Right.

556
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:12,158
How is she?

557
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,800
She's nice.

558
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:21,900
One, two, three, four,

559
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,019
five, six, seven, eight.

560
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:28,119
Wait! Zi Han was right.

561
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,100
There's one missing.

562
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,919
That's to say, the nine-clawed lotus in Everlasting Hall is from the east pool.

563
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:42,618
Ever since Goddess of Snow arrived, she's been taking care of the pool.

564
00:38:42,618 --> 00:38:45,399
Shall we ask her about it?

565
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:47,398
Where are you going, Master?

566
00:38:47,398 --> 00:38:51,799
To Pilgrim Hall. I must tell it to Shang Gu and prove Gu Jun's innocence.

567
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,479
Master is concerned about Her Royal Highness.

568
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:02,900
If she really goes to the Netherworld,

569
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,879
will he regret it?

570
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:14,259
When will Shang Gu be back?

571
00:39:14,259 --> 00:39:17,420
We must get Gu Jun promoted.

572
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,398
It's been a night.

573
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,479
What's she doing at Tian Qi's place?

574
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:39,679
Stop looking. Mind your business.

575
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:49,500
Goddess Yue Mi, your tea.

576
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,578
I heard that there's a Dark Serene Land in the God Realm.

577
00:39:56,578 --> 00:39:59,058
It's ideal for Gu Jun to practice.

578
00:39:59,058 --> 00:40:00,740
That's Ice Cube Bai's treasure.

579
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,360
I've never seen him lend it.

580
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,398
Gu Jun is on Her Royal Highness's side.

581
00:40:06,398 --> 00:40:10,599
Maybe Master Bai Jue will lend a hand.

582
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,098
He must be desperate for Gu Jun to lose.

583
00:40:14,098 --> 00:40:17,739
That way, Shang Gu could go to the Netherworld.

584
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:23,039
It's only a trifle.

585
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:25,478
I didn't expect it to alert True God Bai Jue.

586
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:26,999
Master Bai Jue.

587
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,238
Where's Shang Gu?

588
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,660
Where she's supposed to be. It's not your business.

589
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,459
Master Bai Jue,

590
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:36,520
Her Royal Highness is in Chaos Hall.

591
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,699
What do you want?

592
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:42,099
The nine-clawed lotus is from Abyss Hall.

593
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:44,539
I must apologize to Tian Qi.

594
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,380
Apologize?

595
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,299
I'm afraid you're there to start a fight.

596
00:40:54,979 --> 00:40:58,600
Shang Gu, I'm hurt badly.

597
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,359
I can't even hold the chopsticks.

598
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,100
How about you feed me a bite?

599
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,859
Stop it. How can a nine-clawed lotus hurt you?

600
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:09,198
You used to stamp on the nine-headed serpent and kill the giant roc with your bare hands.

601
00:41:09,198 --> 00:41:11,100
Since when have you been that fragile?

602
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,779
I don't remember being that powerful.

603
00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:15,679
You must be getting old and have a bad memory.

604
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:23,819
Shang Gu, just feed me once.

605
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:32,918
Why are you here? I didn't invite you.

606
00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:36,639
Are you here for me?

607
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:51,880


608
00:41:53,540 --> 00:42:00,099
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

609
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:06,879
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

610
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:13,400
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

611
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,560
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

612
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:26,460
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

613
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:32,719
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

614
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:40,140
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

615
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:46,800
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

616
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:05,240
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

617
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:11,819
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

618
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:19,000
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

619
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

620
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:34,180
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

621
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:41,060
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

622
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:47,440
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

623
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,939
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫

00:43:53,939 --> 00:44:03,760
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
