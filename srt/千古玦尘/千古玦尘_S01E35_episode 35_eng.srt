1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920


2
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:21,450
   

3
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,150
   

4
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:38,289
It's a draw.

5
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:41,508
I didn't expect you to be so good at the game of Go.

6
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:44,148
I don't usually play it and I'm not good at it.

7
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:46,349
Then you are talented.

8
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,709
If I have time one day,

9
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,669
I will go to Qingchi Palace to learn from you.

10
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,010
Okay.

11
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,670
That's good.

12
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,890
You didn't just let me win on purpose, did you?

13
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,148
How could I?

14
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,950
I've had the tea and played chess,

15
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,148
I should go back to Qingchi Palace.

16
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,870
Right, it's really late.

17
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,228
How about having dinner before you leave?

18
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:12,148
After dinner, will you say that because it's late at night,

19
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:14,489
why don't you stay for the night before leaving?

20
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:17,148
What makes you think so?

21
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:19,888
That's what they play on the stage in the Human Realm.

22
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:21,949
I have never seen a play.

23
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,109
I'll take you to see it sometime.

24
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,470
Okay.

25
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:27,689
I really have to go now.

26
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,550
I don't know if Hou Chi and Qing Mu have gotten the Spirit Gathering Pearl.

27
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,550
- I am very worried about it. 
 - Okay.

28
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,350
 Report! 

29
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:38,350
Your Highness, Demon Emperor is leading his army to call for battle,

30
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,490
and asking to see you and Lordess Feng Ran.

31
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,909
How did he know I was here?

32
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,150
What should come will finally come.

33
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,829
You've already expected it, so you kept me on purpose.

34
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,269
You took away the greatest treasure of the Demon Clan,

35
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,510
this matter will not be easily settled.

36
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:57,149
But I'm here with you, I will protect you.

37
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,749
I have notified the Heavenly Palace,

38
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,549
the immortal soldiers will soon come to support.

39
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,609
Demon Emperor, do you really want to start a war?

40
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,708
As long as you hand over the Demon Gathering Flag,

41
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,348
I'll withdraw my troops immediately.

42
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:07,950
Demon Emperor, didn't Lord Zi Han tell you?

43
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,109
What?

44
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,628
He lent the Demon Gathering Flag to Qingchi Palace.

45
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,309
Ridiculous.

46
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,109
It's the most precious treasure of our clan,

47
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,730
which can not be lent to others.

48
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,228
Ask him if you don't believe me.

49
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:20,269
Then why didn't you go back to Qingchi Palace,

50
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,109
but went to Jing Jian's camp

51
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,730
and stayed there for four hours?

52
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:27,669
It's none of your business.

53
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,300
Feng Ran and I are old friends,

54
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,100
so she had tea and played chess with me, which has nothing to do with the flag.

55
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,050
No need to explain so much.

56
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,900
Demon Emperor, Qingchi Palace borrowed the Demon Gathering Flag to save people.

57
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,348
It's Demon God who knows the great righteousness and helps generously.

58
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:44,649
If you do not believe it, just send an instruction feather to ask him.

59
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:48,589
Your Highness, over these years,

60
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,249
our Demon Clan is weaker than the Immortal Clan and has always been bullied.

61
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:55,068
We finally waited until the Demon God awakened

62
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,769
and thought he could revive the might to unify the three realms.

63
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:59,370
But we didn't expect that

64
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,748
the soldiers on the battlefield would fight to the death.

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,000
Demon God has repeatedly shaken the foundation of the Demon Clan for Hou Chi of Qingchi Palace.

66
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,149
Now he even gives the greatest treasure of our clan to Feng Ran so casually.

67
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,700
If this goes on, without the attack of the immortals,

68
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,348
the Demon Clan is already in danger.

69
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,750
Shut up!

70
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:20,869
He's Demon God, the god of our Demon Clan.

71
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,669
Who gave you the guts to talk like that?

72
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,630
Father God, we can't let this matter go easily.

73
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,028
We can ignore the matter of Qingchi Palace.

74
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,829
But right now the battle is urgent,

75
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,050
it will be troublesome if the Heavenly Palace gets the Demon Gathering Flag.

76
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,869
Even if Qingchi Palace borrowed it from Master,

77
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,730
it has been two hours. It is time to return it.

78
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,290
It is not in my hands. I have given it to Hou Chi.

79
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,129
If you can, just go to Heavenly Palace to take it.

80
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,809
Array, protect Second Highness!

81
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:04,669
How could this happen?

82
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,329
Isn't the evil aura sealed in the Underground Palace?

83
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:08,869
We're still too late.

84
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,009
It's all my fault.

85
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,750
I was too hasty that day and took the Soul Tower.

86
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,909
It's because of the collusion between Bi Xi and Wu Huan. It is not your fault.

87
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,490
It's all my fault.

88
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,520
In order to save Bo Xuan, I brought disaster to the whole world.

89
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,068
Today, even if I scatter all my cultivation,

90
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:26,090
I will subdue the evil aura into the Underground Palace again.

91
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,748
I'll set a barrier at the highest point of the tomb with spiritual power

92
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:31,348
to trap the overflowing evil aura.

93
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,750
You divide it inside to remove the evil aura in one fell swoop.

94
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,170
Okay, I'll be with you.

95
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,748
 Oh no, the bracelet has lost its spiritual power. 

96
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:05,029
 With my spiritual power, I'm afraid I can't support this barrier. 

97
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:15,788
Hou Chi, do you want to die?

98
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,328
Don't worry about me, hurry to purify the evil aura.

99
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,269
Feng Ran, because of Upper God Gu Jun and Hou Chi,

100
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,409
I am treating you with courtesy.

101
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:28,589
If you still do not know how to behave,

102
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,709
today let's settle old and new grudges together.

103
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:44,028
Brother, what took you so long?

104
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,929
It happened suddenly, I was delayed halfway.

105
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:59,269
- Feng Ran. 
 - Upper God Gu Jun.

106
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,748
I have just purified the evil aura here,

107
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,689
are you going to have a war?

108
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,069
Sen Jian, you once complained to me that the Immortal Clan oppressed the Demon Clan.

109
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:12,709
But what about today?

110
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,269
Do you really want to see

111
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,649
the Immortal Clan and Demon Clan to be incompatible forever?

112
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:22,348
Feng Ran stole our most precious treasure

113
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:24,200
and is close to Jing Jian,

114
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,429
I'm worried about the Heavenly Palace getting Demon Gathering Flag,

115
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,028
which will be bad for our Demon Clan,

116
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,809
so I came to ask for an explanation.

117
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,609
Is this true?

118
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:36,450
Bo Xuan's spiritual consciousness is dissipating and needs the Demon Gathering Flag for help.

119
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,988
It was Demon God who lent the flag to Qingchi Palace.

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,700
It's not enough for the Demon Gathering Flag to reunite the spiritual consciousness.

121
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,548
What else did Hou Chi take?

122
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,789
Spirit Gathering Pearl and Soul Tower.

123
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,068
Where is she now?

124
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,540
The Heavenly Palace.

125
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:54,349
This matter is in my mind.

126
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,789
Sen Jian, you go back to Xuanjing Palace first.

127
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,508
Later, I'll give you an explanation.

128
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,930
Yes.

129
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,909
Today, I will give Qingchi Palace face.

130
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,370
Withdraw.

131
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,170
Thanks for your help, Upper God Gu Jun.

132
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,489
It's all because of her.

133
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:20,628
Jing Jian, do you still want to be with her?

134
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,130
Brother.

135
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:25,229
I have to return to the Heavenly Palace to report.

136
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,349
Farewell.

137
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,930
Wait.

138
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,089
This matter was caused by Qingchi Palace,

139
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:32,370
I'll go back with you.

140
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:36,628
What? Can't I go?

141
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,150
That being the case, Upper God Gu Jun,

142
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,510
please.

143
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,690
Qing Mu!

144
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,609
How are you?

145
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:19,949
I'm fine.

146
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,628
The evil aura entered your body, how can you be fine?

147
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:24,709
We don't know when this evil aura leaked.

148
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,650
I'm afraid it has flowed into the Lower Realm a lot.

149
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,508
I will seal the evil aura in my body back to the Underground Palace,

150
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:31,609
which can reduce your guilt.

151
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:33,450
Then you will…

152
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,190
I'm okay.

153
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:39,750
Believe me. I have the help of the Tai Cang Spear.

154
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,289
I will suppress the evil aura in my body and not let it hurt my spiritual veins.

155
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:46,690
Don't lie to me. I don't want to lose anyone around me.

156
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,709
When have I ever lied to you?

157
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,250
Even the Ninth Heaven Black Thunder of Blue Dragon Pavilion can't hurt me,

158
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,280
let alone the evil aura of the Lower Realm.

159
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,650
You underestimate me as the greatest Upper God of the Immortal Clan.

160
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,409
Quickly go to the Heavenly Palace to tell Heavenly King about the rupture of the seal of evil aura.

161
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,589
I'll come to you after I finish sealing the evil aura.

162
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,149
Let me seal it. You go to the Heavenly Palace to report it.

163
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:06,429
Fool. It's inside me.

164
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:08,409
Do you want to seal me together?

165
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,108
Hurry up. There's no time.

166
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:14,610
We have to go back to Qingchi Palace to save Bo Xuan.

167
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,690
Don't get hurt anymore.

168
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,690
Let's meet at the Heavenly Palace.

169
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,409
Hou Chi.

170
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,108
Since Blue Dragon Pavilion, I've already recognized you as my love forever.

171
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:28,849
No matter what happens in the future,

172
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:30,829
I will bear it with you.

173
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,269
I've troubled you and owed you too much.

174
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,149
When this is over,

175
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,250
I will give you all the blessings of my next life.

176
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:41,089
Okay, how will you give it to me?

177
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,329
Go ahead.

178
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,300
Father God, Because of the sudden incident, I had no time to mobilize the three armies.

179
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:27,229
I had to go alone.

180
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,890
In the end, the Immortal Clan suffered damage.

181
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,829
Father God, please punish me.

182
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,548
Your Majesty, the Demon Clan has killed our soldiers,

183
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:36,229
so please, Your Majesty, don't forgive them lightly.

184
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,569
 Please punish the Demon Clan severely, 

185
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:40,149
 attack the Xuanjing Palace 

186
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,910
 to avenge the dead soldiers and generals. 

187
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,150
Demon Emperor suddenly led his troops across the border and confronted you.

188
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,130
Jing Yang, the crime of framing

189
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,840
an Upper God is very serious. You should think about it clearly before speaking.

190
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,548
Feng Ran was ordered by Hou Chi

191
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:59,990
to steal the Demon Gathering Flag from Xuanjing Palace

192
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,428
and hid in my brother's camp.

193
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:04,709
Demon Emperor was afraid that Heavenly Palace would get it,

194
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,390
so they started the war to get the Demon Gathering Flag back.

195
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:11,668
Jing Jian, is this true?

196
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:14,568
Father God, Feng Ran did take Demon Gathering Flag

197
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:16,409
and did come to my camp, but she…

198
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:18,108
When we were surrounded by demons,

199
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:20,289
fortunately, Upper God Gu Jun arrived in time

200
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:24,350
to save our lives. Please, Father God, look into it.

201
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:28,748
The Demon Gathering Flag is really in Hou Chi's hand.

202
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:30,590
But it was not stolen by Feng Ran.

203
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,628
Demon God willingly lent it to Qingchi Palace.

204
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:35,930
The Demon Emperor didn't know it,

205
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,749
so he led his troops to ask for an explanation.

206
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,868
I have settled the matter with him.

207
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:43,469
As for the dead soldiers in this war,

208
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,490
Qingchi Palace will give their families an explanation.

209
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,789
Father God, I really don't understand.

210
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,349
The war is coming.

211
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,868
The Demon Gathering Flag is vital to our Demon Clan.

212
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:03,070
But…

213
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:08,030
But how can Master give it to Feng Ran?

214
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,668
Sure. All demons worship the Demon God as lord,

215
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:14,149
but if he does not care about our safety,

216
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,769
why should we still worship him as our lord?

217
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,610
Stop it.

218
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,170
Your Majesty, Master has come out

219
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,440
and has invited you to Purple Moon Spring for discussion.

220
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:38,759
- Feng Ran. 
 - I went to the Heavenly Palace

221
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,489
and they said you were in the Lower Realm to suppress the evil aura.

222
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:41,609
We were still late.

223
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:43,250
Some evil aura has flowed into the Lower Realm.

224
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,390
I'm now going to the Heavenly Palace to ask for forgiveness.

225
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,330
Take these three treasures back to Qingchi Palace,

226
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,230
and ask my father to reunite the spiritual consciousness of Bo Xuan.

227
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,270
He is in the Heavenly Palace.

228
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:55,960
Why is Father God in the Heavenly Palace?

229
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,188
Something happened in the Luocha Region.

230
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,539
Demon Emperor attacked there on the grounds that the flag had been stolen.

231
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:00,950
The Immortal Clan suffered heavy losses.

232
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,810
He wants you to take these treasures back now,

233
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,309
seal the mountain, and not come out.

234
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:07,089
He'll take all the blame for you in the Heavenly Palace.

235
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:19,069
Gu Jun, the Demon Gathering Flag is a treasure of the Demon Emperor and military order of the Demon Clan.

236
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:22,950
Why would Demon God give it to Qingchi Palace?

237
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:33,068
I've never lied for 60,000 years,

238
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:36,270
believe it or not, it's up to you.

239
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,208
I'm afraid that your words can not convince the three realms.

240
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,509
Father God, I can prove that

241
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,190
the Demon Gathering Flag was truly given by Demon God to Hou Chi.

242
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,469
Brother, how can you prove it?

243
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:54,188
Did you see it?

244
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:57,570
He really can't prove it, but I can.

245
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,589
Zi Han.

246
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,709
My master let me come to tell the immortals

247
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,589
that he lent the Demon Gathering Flag to Hou Chi,

248
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,628
and it was not stolen by Qingchi Palace.

249
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:08,270
As for the war in the Luocha Region,

250
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,068
Qingchi Palace should bear the responsibility.

251
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,469
But did Heavenly Palace and Xuanjing Palace have no responsibility?

252
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,970
The Immortal Clan and Demon Clan have been fighting for 60,000 years, accumulating deep grievances.

253
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,250
Even if there is no misunderstanding,

254
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,629
it is difficult to stop the war.

255
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,988
Upper God Gu Jun, I would like to ask

256
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:28,829
what is the relationship between Hou Chi and Demon God?

257
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,969
Demon God didn't hesitate to lend the Demon Gathering Flag

258
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:34,068
and sent Zi Han to prove her innocence.

259
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:37,370
Is it because Hou Chi and Demon God are secretly in cahoots,

260
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,710
or your Qingchi Palace has already colluded with the demons?

261
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:49,370
If I tell you, will you believe me?

262
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,050
Then why did no one believe what I said just now?

263
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,068
Since no one believes me,

264
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:57,309
then why should I say more?

265
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,469
If Your Majesty still has questions,

266
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,969
please go to Xuanjing Palace to ask Demon God.

267
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:05,709
I have to go back to Qingchi Palace

268
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,509
to make amends for the dead soldiers.

269
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,969
Farewell.

270
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:12,450
Your Majesty, although it has been clarified that

271
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,289
the Demon Gathering Flag was not done by Hou Chi alone,

272
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:16,789
the Lower Realm has just reported Soul Tower has been lost,

273
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:18,788
and the evil aura is ravaging the world.

274
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,469
As an Upper God, Hou Chi ignored the people.

275
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,450
Please, Your Majesty, make the decision to punish Hou Chi severely.

276
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,729
Bi Xi said that the evil aura can be sealed for a few days,

277
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:30,908
why is the world still suffering from the disaster?

278
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:34,049
Your Majesty, after all, the matter is related to Upper God Hou Chi.

279
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:36,749
If everyone follows Qingchi Palace to seize treasures and disrupt the world,

280
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,869
how can the three realms be safe?

281
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,029
 Please punish God Hou Chi severely, 

282
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,629
 and take back the Soul Tower. 

283
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:50,090
Qingchi Palace never needs the Heavenly Palace to intervene.

284
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,028
His Majesty had already made a decision on Soul Tower.

285
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,700
If you continue to pester me,

286
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,230
I don't mind destroying this place.

287
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,350
 What? 

288
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,788
Gu Jun.

289
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,350
Father God!

290
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,068
Father God, sorry.

291
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:12,788
Sorry to trouble you again.

292
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:14,050
Don't worry.

293
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,668
I'm here. I won't let you suffer any wrong.

294
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:20,050
You taught me that I shouldn't be afraid of making mistakes,

295
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,950
but we must admit our wrongs if we make a mistake.

296
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,709
It's my fault.

297
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,268
I am your daughter.

298
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:28,209
I should be the one to bear all of this.

299
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:34,550
As an Upper God, I know the importance of all living beings.

300
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,050
But because of my selfishness,

301
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,289
I ignored all living beings and hurt others.

302
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:39,829
It's my fault.

303
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,068
Your Majesty's punishment on me is the rule of Heaven.

304
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:44,668
Even if I am punished,

305
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:46,829
I am still ashamed of the True God's mandate

306
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,470
and all the beings in the world.

307
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,788
So here and now, in front of the gods,

308
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:55,309
I'd like to aggravate my punishment to set an example.

309
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,330
Punishment?

310
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,370
How are you going to punish yourself?

311
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,290
I stole the divine weapon which caused disaster to all living beings.

312
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,209
I know that I have sinned deeply.

313
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,448
So today I'll cut off my god position and ask for punishment from Heaven.

314
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,628
I'd like to take it with my body and go to Shenyin Mountain for 100 years

315
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:16,369
to eliminate the evil aura and repent my mistakes.

316
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:23,089
Hou Chi, do you know how heavy this self-punishment is?

317
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:26,909
Only hope Your Majesty can exempt Qing Mu from all punishment

318
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:29,709
and I will take the blame for all these sins.

319
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,410
All right, I will promise you.

320
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,669
Father God, I'm sorry.

321
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,428
I know I was too impulsive in the hall.

322
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:42,209
But I can't see Qingchi Palace being criticized.

323
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:49,209
So you let go of me and Qing Mu,

324
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:51,548
and chose self-exile.

325
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:55,629
Father God, there is no perfect way in the world.

326
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,129
In order to save Bo Xuan,

327
00:20:57,129 --> 00:20:59,349
I implicated Qing Mu and harmed the world.

328
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,448
This is my fault. I should be punished.

329
00:21:02,448 --> 00:21:04,928
As long as there is a glimmer of hope for Bo Xuan,

330
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:08,270
then I am willing to bear all of this.

331
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:15,769
I ask you that if one day Bo Xuan wakes up,

332
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:18,850
but he is no longer who he used to be,

333
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:24,370
would you not regret it?

334
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,170
No regret.

335
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,170
As long as he lives safely, that's enough.

336
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:44,530
Sometimes, fate is more cruel than you think.

337
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:49,069
You can't always get what you want.

338
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,729
You have made up your mind,

339
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,949
of course I won't stop you.

340
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,790
But everything is predestined.

341
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,010
Rather than recalling the past,

342
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,550
it is better to cherish the present.

343
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:32,850
Qing Mu.

344
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,028
Why are you so weak?

345
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:35,610
Where is Hou Chi?

346
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,229
I care about your body.

347
00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:40,869
Thank you for your concern.

348
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,709
I'll heal myself when I return to Qingchi Palace.

349
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,088
Qingchi Palace?

350
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:46,028
Whose Qingchi Palace are you going back to?

351
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:49,428
Hou Chi has already confessed all the crimes in Xuan Tian Hall.

352
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:51,308
My father has exempted you from punishment,

353
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:52,988
so you don't need to go back to the North Sea to confess.

354
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:54,328
What?

355
00:22:54,328 --> 00:22:56,149
Where is Hou Chi?

356
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:58,189
How did His Majesty punish her?

357
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:00,829
She punished herself

358
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,210
and has been exiled to Shenyin Mountain for 100 years.

359
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:33,430
Have you decided?

360
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,170
Yes.

361
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,250
All the immortals were witnesses, there is no change.

362
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,210
All right.

363
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:43,910
Then I won't go back to the North Sea.

364
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,049
I'll go to Shenyin Mountain with you in three days.

365
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,630
Qing Mu, you can't go to Shenyin Mountain with me.

366
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:53,308
What did you tell me at the imperial mausoleum?

367
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:55,788
Don't you want to be with me for the rest of your life?

368
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:58,710
Is your promise to me so worthless?

369
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,589
It's not what you think.

370
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,689
I will be with you in 100 years.

371
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:05,589
Can you wait for me for 100 years?

372
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,869
A mortal's life is only 100 years,

373
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,168
do you think it is very short?

374
00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:12,709
Or am I not that important in your heart?

375
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:16,129
Sorry.

376
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:18,550
I said something wrong.

377
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,949
Qing Mu.

378
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,109
You are the one I want to cherish most,

379
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:25,390
how can I abandon you?

380
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:28,249
Blame me.

381
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:32,129
I didn't protect you well.

382
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:35,109
Qing Mu, this is my own crime,

383
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,650
I should make up for it.

384
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,840
I promise you that

385
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,890
I will miss you every day for 100 years. Okay?

386
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:49,670
If you don't miss me, who else will you miss?

387
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,548
I'm just…

388
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:58,810
I don't know how to spend the 100 years when you're not here.

389
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,629
Since that is the case, will you make a vow to me,

390
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,850
to my Father God, and to Heaven and Earth,

391
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,829
that you will never leave me?

392
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,548
Of course.

393
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,869
I…

394
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:12,989
Hou Chi,

395
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,908
what do you mean?

396
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:19,668
Lord of the North Sea, Qing Mu,

397
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:22,869
that day at Blue Dragon Pavilion,

398
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,249
you said you would be willing to use your body to betroth yourself to marry Hou Chi of Qingchi Palace.

399
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:29,369
 Passing this thunder, 

400
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:32,790
 we will return to Qingchi Palace... 

401
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,949
 to see the spring of Qingchi Palace, 

402
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,968
 to see flowers roaming the mountain. 

403
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,649
 Upper God Gu Jun, 

404
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:41,688
 I'm willing to use my body to be betrothed 

405
00:25:41,688 --> 00:25:43,550
 to marry Upper God Hou Chi. 

406
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:48,669
 Upper God Gu Jun, 

407
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:54,219
 my love for Hou Chi is very sincere, 

408
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,169
 I sincerely ask to marry her. 

409
00:25:57,549 --> 00:25:59,969
 Perhaps both Hou Chi and I 

410
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:02,370
 will eventually be replaced by True Gods, 

411
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,188
 but our love is sincere, 

412
00:26:07,189 --> 00:26:10,090
 which is more important than my life. 

413
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,690
 If I give up now, 

414
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,510
 I'll definitely regret it in the future. 

415
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:17,229
 Please, Upper God Gu Jun, agree. 

416
00:26:17,229 --> 00:26:18,590
 Our wedding is coming, 

417
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,668
 of course I can make the decision. 

418
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:20,769
 Qing Mu. 

419
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:23,109
 Are you getting married? 

420
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:24,410
 Did Gu Jun agree? 

421
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,428
 Of course. 

422
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:28,028
 Gu Jun has agreed to let me marry Hou Chi. 

423
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:29,990
Does it still count?

424
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,649
Yes. Of course.

425
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:42,730
I, Lord of the North Sea, love Goddess Hou Chi,

426
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,769
and wish to marry you and never separate with you.

427
00:26:56,189 --> 00:26:58,449
Put me down.  You still have injuries.

428
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:28,810
I'm all for the Demon Clan.

429
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,189
I'm right.

430
00:27:31,189 --> 00:27:32,590
Sen Yu.

431
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:34,949
Please, Master, let him go this time.

432
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,689
Sen Yu is young. Please give him one more chance.

433
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,469
Sen Hong died in the war,

434
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,749
Sen Yun died in the Swamp of Netherhill.

435
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,530
I only have this one son left with me.

436
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,470
I hope Master can spare him one more time

437
00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:00,630
for the sake of my loyalty over the years.

438
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:06,670
What if I don't agree?

439
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:16,188
I will never disobey your order.

440
00:28:16,189 --> 00:28:18,388
Remember what you said today.

441
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:20,388
Within the Demon Clan,

442
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:23,430
everything is decided by me.

443
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,949
If anyone hurts Hou Chi again,

444
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,869
I will never forgive him.

445
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,289
Yes.

446
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:40,630
Father.

447
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:57,149
Mother God, I'll go to kneel outside Xuan Tian Hall

448
00:28:57,149 --> 00:28:59,589
to beg Father God to change the edict.

449
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,569
Brother, Father God is so determined this time that

450
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:04,789
even if you kneel a few more days

451
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:06,609
he won't see you.

452
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:10,530
But Qingchi Palace and Demon Clan are involved.

453
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,829
Mother God is doing so for the whole Immortal Clan.

454
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,989
Why did Father God punish her?

455
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,749
In this way,

456
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,370
who else would respect the Heavenly Palace

457
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,810
and respect Mother God?

458
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,570
Father God is confused.

459
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,590
Watch your words.

460
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:31,629
Yang'er, all things are favors of Heavenly King.

461
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:33,969
Since your father has ordered,

462
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:36,189
I will go to the Netherworld.

463
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:44,049
It is my incompetence, I didn't protect you well.

464
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:50,469
Good boy. I know all your filial piety.

465
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:55,590
After I leave, you must take good care of Zhao'er.

466
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,169
Don't let her suffer any grievances.

467
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,329
Mother God.

468
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,028
Remember that if anything happens,

469
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:10,410
send a message to me with an instruction feather.

470
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,030
Kill Bi Xi.

471
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:20,109
The evil aura in the Lower Realm

472
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,510
must not be known to others.

473
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:28,188
Mother God, don't worry.

474
00:30:28,189 --> 00:30:31,490
I will let this matter go down forever

475
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,989
and never let Father God know it.

476
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:36,989
Bo Xuan, after 100 years,

477
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,049
we will be able to see each other.

478
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,850
 Bo Xuan, I hope that you can rest in peace inside. 

479
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,229
 If 100 years is not enough, then rest for 200 years. 

480
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,510
 It's better for 300 to 500 years. 

481
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,049
 No, it's better for 10,000 years. 

482
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,649
What are you mumbling about?

483
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:02,670
Do you have something to tell Bo Xuan?

484
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,850
No.

485
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:07,750
Just seeing you happy, I am also happy for you.

486
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,109
If Bo Xuan wakes up, and sees you,

487
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,430
he will be happy for me.

488
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,129
Mother God was banished to the Netherworld by Father God,

489
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:38,668
while you are sitting in Purple Pine Hall peacefully.

490
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:42,229
Jing Jian, what on earth are you thinking about?

491
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,449
Mother God had gone too far.

492
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:46,210
If Father God really wanted to punish her,

493
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,810
he would have already cut her off from her position as queen.

494
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:51,449
The decision of Father God is good for Mother God.

495
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:54,969
Everything Mother God did is for the Heavenly Palace.

496
00:32:54,969 --> 00:32:57,989
You would rather plead for the people of Qingchi Palace,

497
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,709
than say a word for Mother God

498
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,449
who gave birth to you.

499
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:10,509
It's because of that phoenix, right?

500
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,128
In the Luocha Region, you and I almost died because of her.

501
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:16,308
Qingchi Palace is a scourge,

502
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:18,349
with not one good thing in it.

503
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:22,550
My love for Feng Ran is my willingness,

504
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,410
and has nothing to do with her.

505
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:31,808
I should have already known that

506
00:33:31,808 --> 00:33:37,028
your heart was hooked away and hollowed out by that wild phoenix.

507
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:42,450
From now on, you can only have one of us.

508
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:46,109
Brother! Brother.

509
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,780
Master, although Her Highness is going to Shenyin Mountain

510
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,628
to be punished for 100 years.

511
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:36,569
100 years is a very short time for an immortal,

512
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:39,069
but now Her Highness will be happily married.

513
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,950
When Lord Bo Xuan wakes up,

514
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:44,348
Qingchi Palace will be more lively and prosperous than before.

515
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:47,690
Why do you still look so sad?

516
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,830
When Lord Bo Xuan wakes up,

517
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:54,289
will he still be nice to Hou Chi as before?

518
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:55,749
Of course.

519
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,668
Lord Bo Xuan has always treated Her Highness well.

520
00:34:58,669 --> 00:35:00,229
Don't worry.

521
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,908
I heard that there is a rule that

522
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:17,809
the newlyweds should not see each other before they get married for good luck.

523
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:22,009
The wedding of Qing Mu and Hou Chi should follow this rule.

524
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:27,609
Master, Her Highness will only stay in Qingchi Palace for three days in total.

525
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:29,388
If those two days are subtracted,

526
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:32,209
then Lord of the North Sea will be too pitiful.

527
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:35,550
He made it himself, who can he blame?

528
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,389
Yes.

529
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,088
Upper God Gu Jun has ordered that before the wedding,

530
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:56,529
Her Highness and Lord of the North Sea must not meet in private.

531
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,469
Don't worry, Jia Ye, not to mention a living person,

532
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,709
we guarantee that not even a male fly

533
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,370
can enter the room of Her Highness.

534
00:36:05,149 --> 00:36:08,469
I think Upper God Gu Jun is too bored.

535
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,769
Lord Qing Mu has strong spiritual power and is handsome,

536
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:15,188
it's difficult to find another son-in-law like him.

537
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:17,269
He still insists on doing so.

538
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:21,229
Another one. Actually, there is really one.

539
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,989
He's the one lying at the bottom of the pond, Bo Xuan.

540
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,549
Don't be ridiculous.

541
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,989
Lord Bo Xuan always wears a mask and he is always cold to others.

542
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,949
Except for Her Highness, he ignores everyone.

543
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,869
He is not good at all.

544
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:36,188
If they are compared, Lord Qing Mu wins.

545
00:36:36,189 --> 00:36:38,148
But I heard from Chang Que that

546
00:36:38,149 --> 00:36:40,229
Lord Bo Xuan has strong spiritual power.

547
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,348
Everywhere he goes, no grass grows there.

548
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:46,868
And he is so low-profile, modest, and most gentle.

549
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:48,188
So what?

550
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:49,309
No matter how good he is,

551
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,250
isn't Lord Bo Xuan in a coma now?

552
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,210
All right.

553
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,749
There is no need to compare.

554
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:56,908
All men are alike.

555
00:36:56,909 --> 00:36:58,229
In order to please women,

556
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,828
either give them some jewelry

557
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:01,549
or some clothes and powder.

558
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,749
In my opinion, whoever can win the heart of Her Highness,

559
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:06,890
will be able to win.

560
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:11,250
What are you laughing at?

561
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,729
If you keep laughing, I'll burn you.

562
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,030
Stop laughing. I'll burn you.

563
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,569
Lord.

564
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:25,428
Did you hear it all?

565
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:26,989
What?

566
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,949
You mean Bo Xuan?

567
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,729
I heard that. You're right.

568
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:37,310
Bo Xuan is handsome and is really better than me.

569
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,889
This?

570
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:43,469
Just mundane objects I picked up by the roadside,

571
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,309
not for Hou Chi.

572
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,828
I'm busy. Farewell.

573
00:37:56,629 --> 00:37:57,950
You called me in such a hurry.

574
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,650
What happened?

575
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:03,349
Hou Chi and I are getting married.

576
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:04,870
Now?

577
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:10,650
Well, that's fine.

578
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,668
You've been in love with each other for a long time.

579
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:15,990
Although it is hasty, it's also perfect.

580
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:18,709
Qing Mu, congratulations.

581
00:38:19,629 --> 00:38:20,989
What are you doing?

582
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,810
It's not easy for me and Hou Chi,

583
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,828
thanks to your help and support all the way.

584
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:28,829
I really appreciate it.

585
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:30,709
Don't be so polite.

586
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,089
You didn't call me here today just to say thank you, did you?

587
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,469
I really have no experience.

588
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,309
So I wanted to ask you. Before getting married,

589
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,170
what should I give Hou Chi?

590
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,789
She grew up in Qingchi Palace since she was a child.

591
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,729
Some of the treasures there are even better than those in Heavenly Palace.

592
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:54,108
I'm afraid it's useless for you to give anything.

593
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:55,729
Then what should I do?

594
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,469
You have experienced life and death,

595
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,609
what's the point of giving these things?

596
00:39:01,429 --> 00:39:03,050
After all, it's a wedding.

597
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,150
An important event of one's life,

598
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,429
which needs some sense of ceremony.

599
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,510
Vulgar things are not good.

600
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,240
How about giving her a living thing?

601
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,429
Think about what you can give her that she can take to Shenyin Mountain.

602
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,190
Right. I know it.

603
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,690
Thank you.

604
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:30,830
You are much luckier than me.

605
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:34,850
I'm afraid I can't even

606
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,050
express all my sincerity and feelings.

607
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:49,989
Since coming back from the Heavenly Palace,

608
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,609
you have been frowning.

609
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:54,069
I'm not worried.

610
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,029
I will go to Shenyin Mountain for 100 years,

611
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,330
which is neither long nor short.

612
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,469
The one I worry about most is you.

613
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,148
Don't worry.

614
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,469
I'll help you guard Qingchi Palace.

615
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:08,588
But no one knows your heart, won't you be lonely?

616
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:10,148
How could I be lonely?

617
00:40:10,149 --> 00:40:12,908
I can read stories and roll the dice.

618
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:15,170
I'm pretty good at entertaining myself.

619
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:20,088
Then who should you tell your affections to at this moment?

620
00:40:20,088 --> 00:40:21,989
You can tell?

621
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,428
We've been together for ten thousand years,

622
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:26,689
so we would know each other best.

623
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:28,569
Is he Jing Jian?

624
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,430
Did I guess wrong?

625
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,469
What do you think of Jing Jian?

626
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:52,010


627
00:40:54,416 --> 00:41:00,837
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

628
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:07,704
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

629
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:14,160
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

630
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,272
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

631
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:27,215
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

632
00:41:27,216 --> 00:41:33,726
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

633
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:40,971
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

634
00:41:40,972 --> 00:41:47,650
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

635
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:04,800
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

636
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,349
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫
