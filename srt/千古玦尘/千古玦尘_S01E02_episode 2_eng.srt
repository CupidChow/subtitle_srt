1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,930


2
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:21,380
   

3
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:26,060
   

4
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:31,265
I've never thought I would have to make a match after entering Abyss Hall.

5
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,280
Unbelievable.

6
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:39,159
So tell me why you like Ice Cube Bai.

7
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,440
Tell me why.

8
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:44,100
I can't understand you.

9
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:56,332
Forget it. As you're so pious, I think I should do something for you.

10
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:58,320
Thanks, Your Royal Highness!

11
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,540
Master, please have some tea!

12
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:44,655
- Hong Ri, let me go! 
 - I refuse!

13
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:47,140
So don't blame me for not being polite!

14
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,087
Master, I've set three barriers.

15
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:06,640
I really don't know how they get in.

16
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:14,470
Where's Shang Gu? Hasn't she come back?

17
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,399
Since you asked her to complete a task of the demon,

18
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,779
she's come back several times, staying here only a while.

19
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:25,680
Maybe she's solving the puzzle.

20
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,339
Pack up our things. Let's go to the Lower Realm tomorrow.

21
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:32,544
Won't you attend her birthday celebration?

22
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:34,179
I don't like all the bustle.

23
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:38,080
But I think you should go to congratulate her.

24
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,900
This morning, I brought Master water.

25
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,644
He gave me several glimpses.

26
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:51,966
Why are you so proud of it?

27
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,677
I've seen Master's handwriting!

28
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:55,111
Have you seen it?

29
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:59,132
While he's writing something, he's so handsome and charming.

30
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:00,879
Oh, come on.

31
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,666
- Goddess of Snow even danced for him! 
 - Really?

32
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:10,159
I heard Master played music last night.

33
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,629
I think it's a Heaven-made match!

34
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,265
Thanks for Your Royal Highness's help! Or we wouldn't have had this chance.

35
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:18,169
The celebration will start soon.

36
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,199
Let's go inside to celebrate.

37
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,621
She's right. My gift is more abundant than last time.

38
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:27,040
Maybe we can dance to his music under the moon later on.

39
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,960
 Congratulations on your 10,000th birthday! 

40
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,000
Bai Jue?

41
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,460
 Greeting to Master Bai Jue! 

42
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:50,266
I'll ask Zhi Yang to promulgate a decree.

43
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:54,658
From now on, you're not allowed to enter Abyss Hall anymore.

44
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,939
You're the Chief God of Chaos.

45
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:02,339
How can you exchange me for these gifts?

46
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:04,611
What a joke!

47
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:08,379
And you! Take these tawdry things away.

48
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,120
Yes...

49
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,911
They're mine. Why do you decide it?

50
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:22,143
You're right. I can't teach a student without virtues like you.

51
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:24,844
Go and explain it to Zhi Yang when I leave here.

52
00:05:24,844 --> 00:05:26,740
Let's never meet again.

53
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,078
Please conduct yourself.

54
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,660
You really let him down this time.

55
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,800
Come on.

56
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,470
Master has neglected us for years.

57
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,179
10,000 years are the same.

58
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:52,319
As Your Royal Highness was scolded the most, why do you feel so sad?

59
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,030
Master...

60
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,340
He refuses me to enter the hall forever.

61
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,650
Why are you weeping so ruefully?

62
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,221
I'm afraid you don't know.

63
00:06:04,222 --> 00:06:08,020
Just at the birthday banquet of Her Royal Highness, Master Bai Jue was furious.

64
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,040
He prohibits us from entering Abyss Hall.

65
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,890
He has no compassion for women.

66
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,269
Don't think too much about his words.

67
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,159
It's different this time.

68
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,838
He also scolded Her Royal Highness.

69
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,420
What? He blamed Shang Gu?

70
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:36,110
How can you still read books here?

71
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,580
What did you do to Shang Gu?

72
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,788
Why can't I feel Shang Gu's power?

73
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:44,009
When she just came here, I sealed her power.

74
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:45,420
You!

75
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:48,266
Do you know Shang Gu is missing?

76
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:49,576
Don't worry.

77
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,710
It will rain soon.

78
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,310
As she can't bear to suffer, she'll come back after it rains.

79
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,366
Bai Jue, what did she do?

80
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:01,020
Why do you detest her so much?

81
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,810
What did she do? She admires treasures.

82
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,030
She dares accept expensive gifts

83
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,430
and allows goddesses to get into my hall after staying here only for a few days.

84
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,177
How absurd!

85
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:13,100
Expensive gifts?

86
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,130
You're mistaken about her.

87
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,599
Shang Gu didn't do it for the treasures.

88
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,000
She wants to solve your task.

89
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:29,420
 He's here! 

90
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:32,532
 It's Master Bai Jue! 

91
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,520
 - Master Bai Jue is here! 
 - Oh my goodness. 

92
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:47,179
 About a thousand miles to the west of the Luo Cha Region. 

93
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:51,188
 Secluded Mountain... Thousand rivers. 

94
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:52,760
 I found it! 

95
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,269
 Tian Qi is right. 

96
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,322
 Demons are spontaneous. 

97
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:15,633
 They can only be infected by true happiness. 

98
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:19,080
You mean I misunderstood her?

99
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,332
You not only have to bring her back but you also have to apologize to her.

100
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:26,176
It's her 10,000th birthday!

101
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:28,133
Who can put up with it?

102
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,860
How do I apologize?

103
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,800
I've eaten your birthday peach.

104
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,100
Was it sweet?

105
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,611
Sour and hard... just like you!

106
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:40,100
Don't you have a sense of taste?

107
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,366
Anyway, I've thought of a way for you.

108
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:45,765
Don't you like stone carving? You can carve a bracelet for her!

109
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:48,020
Girls like ornaments.

110
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,700
Don't ignore me.

111
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,121
I've told you that you must coax her back today.

112
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:56,620
Otherwise, I...

113
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:58,840
I...

114
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,700
- Master Tian Qi. 
 - Don't call me!

115
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,839
- Come here! 
 - Master Tian Qi.

116
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,710
I'll abduct him to Everlasting Hall to warm wines for me!

117
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,980
- Master Tian Qi! 
 - Why call me?

118
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,519
Master, we have to go out to find her.

119
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,576
If it becomes a heavy rain, as she has no spiritual power...

120
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:29,640
how can she...

121
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,399
Why don't you avoid the rain in the hall?

122
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,980
Is it self-pity or are you examining yourself?

123
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,499
Didn't you say "to never meet again"? So why come and find me?

124
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:53,380
Give me back my power!

125
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,232
Gods are permanent as mounts and rivers, the sun and the moon.

126
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,487
When the spiritual power is locked,

127
00:10:00,488 --> 00:10:02,439
you're like a mortal.

128
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,420
Put it on. Don't catch a cold.

129
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,422
Are you apologizing to me?

130
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:09,688
Will you forgive me?

131
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:12,555
Only by a gown? Impossible!

132
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:15,244
Blood Forest is on the border between the Immortal and Demon Realms.

133
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:18,254
The first battle 70,000 years ago reduced the spiritual power here.

134
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:23,410
Your way can only let them be happy for a while, not a whole life.

135
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,890
I've asked Tian Qi about it.

136
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,760
He can't complete it. How can you ask me to do so?

137
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,455
You're just being difficult!

138
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:31,209
Tian Qi can't do it. Zhi Yang and I can't either.

139
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:32,477
But you can.

140
00:10:32,477 --> 00:10:34,420
Me?

141
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,510
Only you can keep the peace for the world of all ages.

142
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,199
Only you can let the Tiger Demons stay happy and peaceful forever.

143
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,430
It's my first task for you.

144
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,360
It's also your lifelong mission of being a Chief God.

145
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,066
I think you look down upon me.

146
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:50,600
Zhi Yang doesn't let me solve the memorials.

147
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,843
My celebration should be managed to a high standard.

148
00:10:58,844 --> 00:11:03,010
Only gods with treasures can attend.

149
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,640
So isn't this a bit light for a gift for me?

150
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:17,540
Is this enough?

151
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,220
 I've never thought he would try to make me happy. 

152
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,580
 It's a good time to bully him! 

153
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,399
I'm the Chief God of Chaos.

154
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,510
Others only dare to gossip about me on the sly.

155
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,100
While I suffer many humiliations from you!

156
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:51,500
What do you want me to do?

157
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,554
I'm not that jealous.

158
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:58,760
Seal your power for 30 minutes.

159
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:01,080
Okay.

160
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,540
With this palm, now we're even.

161
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,344
Seal your power for 30 minutes.

162
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:28,840
Okay.

163
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,065
Impossible! You've sealed your power!

164
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,144
Are we even?

165
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:46,790
You must have cheated!

166
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,280
You're just a mortal without power.

167
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,100
I can't believe it.

168
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,319
Can you believe it now?

169
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,558
A god's life is immortal.

170
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,019
When you finally become the real Chief God of Chaos,

171
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:10,380
maybe you'll know some new rules and definitions of the world.

172
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,639
It's already late. Please go to sleep early.

173
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,288
Hold on.

174
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:16,565
How did you do that?

175
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:20,380
Come here at 7:00 tomorrow. Don't be late.

176
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,070
"When Heaven and Earth emerge, the power of chaos appears.

177
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,644
Heaven and Earth are congested with creatures, which can also replenish the power of chaos.

178
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:42,399
The process is endless.

179
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,639
What is divination 'Tun'?

180
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,109
It means the beginning of things.

181
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,679
Creatures need initiation when they're born, which is called 'Meng.'

182
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:54,700
'Meng' means creatures are initial.

183
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,687
The initial need cares, which is 'Xu'."

184
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:03,377
- Bai Jue knows how to teach her. 
 - "'Xu' means creatures need diets. When we mention diets, quarrels come..."

185
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:07,022
The last time I saw her reading was 8,000 years ago.

186
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:10,758
Nice job. You can control her.

187
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:13,144
Others censure her because of her poor power.

188
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:17,299
As she's competitive, goading her into action is useful.

189
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:22,578
Though you just come back, you've known all the gossip?

190
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:25,600
If I want to know then I will.

191
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:31,940
The reason why Shang Gu can't make progress is because of him.

192
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,900
She told me you stopped her solving memorials.

193
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,280
She can't do it. It only made trouble.

194
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,479
When I traveled to the Lower Realm, I'd met many interesting things.

195
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:48,598
What are they?

196
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:52,900
Many crocodiles live in snake areas.

197
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,339
The ownership of the region is a controversy.

198
00:14:55,339 --> 00:15:00,039
A True God made a mistake and let crocodiles live in a snake area.

199
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,839
It brought them a war lasting for a thousand years.

200
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,100
Which True God did it?

201
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,940
It's me.

202
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,511
It wasn't long for me to manage affairs for Ancestral God.

203
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,487
I was immature at that time so it's common to do something wrong.

204
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:16,259
That's it.

205
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:18,759
You always made trouble at the beginning.

206
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,810
So why are you so strict with Shang Gu?

207
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,477
Tian Qi, try some tea.

208
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:25,839
Don't you think it smells like fire?

209
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,120
Ice Cube, where did you get this treasure?

210
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,200
It's from Fiery Forest.

211
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:37,940
What's the story about Fiery Forest?

212
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,422
Zhi Yang went to tackle matters in the Lower Realm

213
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:45,243
and he was kidnapped by a female leader in the Fiery Forest, becoming her husband.

214
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:46,780
What?

215
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:52,665
Such a solemn True God in the God Realm becomes a female leader's husband?

216
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:54,744
Why are you laughing?

217
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:58,210
More than that. I've heard stories about Youyou Valley,

218
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,920
Wangqing Cliff and Duanqin Sea.

219
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,400
Oh, come on.

220
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,500
In the God Realm, they usually say that I am the least serious.

221
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,122
I think they've been cheated by your solemn style.

222
00:16:11,122 --> 00:16:12,940
You know nothing!

223
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,199
They're just past accidents. Don't mention them again.

224
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,180
Ice Cube, did I offend you?

225
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,750
No.

226
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,839
Just because you told me one thing.

227
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,559
Obedient, hardworking, and studious

228
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,860
never cause trouble.

229
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,243
Why am I learning kids books?

230
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:33,580
 Bai Jue! Come over here! 

231
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,821
I've told you not to offend him before.

232
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:39,088
He bears grudges.

233
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:40,680
I agree.

234
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,580
See! The barrier is breaking again.

235
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,229
How does it come here?

236
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,890
"Three months later. At the barrier of the Nether World.

237
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,955
I invite the Chief God of Chaos to have a peace talk there.

238
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:25,180
Yours, Xuan Yi."

239
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,388
Is he kidding me?

240
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:33,500
Xuan Yi wants to see me?

241
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,120
What do you mean?

242
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,679
He's Demon King Xuan Yi!

243
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,444
Will you let me go?

244
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,711
Though they've been trapped in the Netherworld for 70,000 years,

245
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:53,933
in the past few months, the seal has been breaking and many devils have poured in,

246
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,570
disturbing the Immortal and Demon Realms.

247
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,976
Zhi Yang, as the barrier of the Netherworld is going to collapse, they'll come here sooner or later.

248
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:05,689
I think we should agree to meet him and go to the Netherworld to investigate.

249
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:10,239
- Did you hear me? I said... 
 - Xuan Yi is always deliberate.

250
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,188
I think he has a hidden motive.

251
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:16,376
He's right. As he's stayed there for 70,000 years, he must have an evil plan.

252
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:18,749
So it must be his trap to meet Shang Gu.

253
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,465
It must be a trap!

254
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,640
That's it. I think we shouldn't...

255
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,710
He used to be the top of the True Gods.

256
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:28,649
If he hadn't become a devil, he should have been Chief God of Chaos.

257
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,399
As Ancestral God's passed away, there's no Chief God now.

258
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,060
If they start a war, it will destroy the world.

259
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,909
If Shang Gu can talk to him, maybe we can avoid a disaster.

260
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,189
You're right.

261
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,733
We can't let the disaster repeat again.

262
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:46,965
Wait. I don't want the war to come again.

263
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:51,877
But my poor ability can do nothing to stop it, right?

264
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:53,033
Am I right?

265
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,855
Bai Jue, I'll leave her to you.

266
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:58,100
You must teach her many skills in three months.

267
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,120
We'll go to the Neitherworld together after three months.

268
00:19:11,522 --> 00:19:15,621
Come on. I'm the Chief God, right? Can you listen to my ideas?

269
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,519
Am I a Chief God?

270
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,519
I can't even manage my things.

271
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,821
I'm going to die without being the real Chief God.

272
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:36,665
He's Demon King Xuan Yi!

273
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,759
Even Ancestral God almost failed.

274
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,932
So how can I defeat him?

275
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,732
Then, what are you going to do?

276
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:46,900
Escape. Or should I wait for the festival here?

277
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,700
I heard you're going to escape?

278
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,044
Impossible. I won't run.

279
00:19:58,044 --> 00:19:59,877
Upper God Kunlun had a son,

280
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:01,510
so I'm going to celebrate with him.

281
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:03,311
Then, how should we tackle the Netherworld?

282
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:04,655
I'm too busy to do it.

283
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:07,288
Sorry for not joining you this time. Pardon me.

284
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,143
Seriously?

285
00:20:08,143 --> 00:20:09,700
Of course.

286
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,900
It's fine. Then I'll be free.

287
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,822
What do you mean?

288
00:20:15,822 --> 00:20:20,487
Nothing. By the way, I suggest you find a suitable weapon.

289
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,100
In case you meet the devils.

290
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,340
Maybe it can save your life.

291
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,210
There's no devil in Kunlun.

292
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,822
Xuan Yi is going to find you.

293
00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:29,600
Wherever you are, there are devils chasing you.

294
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,100
It's easy to find you within three months.

295
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,800
Will you leave now?

296
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:46,880
Tomorrow.

297
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,980
I'll go to learn tomorrow.

298
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,860
You don't need to wait that long.

299
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,470
How can you let him take her away so easily?

300
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,760
How can she suffer his education?

301
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,943
- If you can, go and teach her. 
 - I...

302
00:21:10,943 --> 00:21:14,310
We've tried to teach her for 10,000 years but she learns nothing.

303
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,366
She needs to face Xuan Yi and the devils this time.

304
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:18,866
A thousand years from now, it'll be the Doom of Chaos.

305
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:21,849
We can protect her once but not forever.

306
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:24,100
She's the heir of the Chief God of Chaos.

307
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,260
She has to grow up.

308
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:37,960
It's Observation Mountain. I practice here.

309
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,055
Stay here and exercise.

310
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:42,665
I can practice in Abyss Hall, so why must I come here?

311
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:45,622
The devils are cunning. Especially Xuan Yi.

312
00:21:45,622 --> 00:21:50,039
According to your power, you can't enter the Netherworld without practicing hard.

313
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,150
It's quiet here. No one will disturb you.

314
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,630
We'll go back after three months.

315
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,390
The disciplines of the God Realm are severe.

316
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,659
Though you teach me, you're not my teacher without the ceremony.

317
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:01,865
So you can't decide for me.

318
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:05,360
It's fine. You don't need to call me teacher.

319
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,811
When shall we go back?

320
00:22:06,811 --> 00:22:08,880
When will we go to the Netherworld?

321
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,900
It should be up to me.

322
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,020
If you disagree with it,

323
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,760
you can do as you want.

324
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:27,233
Why is there a barrier here?

325
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:29,855
This place is the border among the God, the Immortal, and the Demon Realms.

326
00:22:29,855 --> 00:22:33,980
How could it be peaceful without my barrier?

327
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,322
I don't want to stay here anymore.

328
00:22:38,322 --> 00:22:40,780
Let me go back to Abyss Hall.

329
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,388
We haven't had the ceremony.

330
00:22:42,388 --> 00:22:45,520
You can go as you please, so why do you ask me?

331
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:49,380
- Bai Jue. 
 - I don't have compassion for women

332
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,390
so please leave on your own.

333
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:53,330
 Forget it. 

334
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,059
 He's more powerful than me now so I have to be humble. 

335
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,176
 When I learn something, I'll find a chance to run. 

336
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:03,454
I'm a magnanimous god so I won't be fussy about it.

337
00:23:03,454 --> 00:23:09,138
I hear the starry sky here is the most beautiful so just do as you want.

338
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,920
Anyway, only three months.

339
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,920
Bai Jue? Let's retreat!

340
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,399
Did they disappear? They scared me! They nearly ate me.

341
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:10,040
You only know to ask for help or escape when you're in danger.

342
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,822
The courage of the little Chief God was a real eye-opener.

343
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:16,087
Can't I defeat them?

344
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,421
I was just absent-minded and did nothing.

345
00:24:18,422 --> 00:24:20,330
I know your poor power.

346
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,476
But what have you learned in the past?

347
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:26,155
Why don't you know some basic skills? They're just low-grade devils.

348
00:24:26,155 --> 00:24:31,687
Don't blame me. Didn't you say that your barrier was here? So how did they get in?

349
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:35,144
How can it be a practice without facing devils?

350
00:24:35,144 --> 00:24:39,043
If I had a suitable weapon, I could defeat them easily. Just like you.

351
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:40,600
Really?

352
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,422
You... I... I can't hold it.

353
00:24:44,422 --> 00:24:45,576
Don't you want a weapon?

354
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:47,465
You...

355
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:51,154
Do you want to give me a weapon? I think you want to crush me!

356
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,620
I just want you to know one thing.

357
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,980
Devils are not those gods. They won't praise you.

358
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,679
Tian Qi and Zhi Yang can't protect you forever.

359
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,288
You have to fight against them sooner or later.

360
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:11,139
If you still refuse to practice seriously, your purest but unusable spiritual power will be the reason

361
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:15,654
for you to be respected in the God Realm but also kill you someday in the future.

362
00:25:15,654 --> 00:25:18,155
Power is supreme. You're right. Is that okay?

363
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:20,011
Do you know why you can't get your sacred meridian?

364
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:22,976
Am I not eager for it? I want to be stronger too.

365
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:27,277
- But... 
 - Because Tian Qi pampers you or Zhi Yang is too busy?

366
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:31,160
- You... 
 - I'll help you open it at 7:00 tomorrow.

367
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:34,410
Great!

368
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,600
 When I open it, I'll punish you. 

369
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,132
Your Royal Highness! It's dawn! Wake up!

370
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:49,354
It's time to get up!

371
00:25:49,355 --> 00:25:51,510
What time is it now?

372
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:54,377
Even the rooster hasn't gotten up yet.

373
00:25:54,377 --> 00:25:55,980
I don't want to get up.

374
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:10,940
Ice Cube Bai.

375
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:14,660
It's his trick again.

376
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,900
There are three kinds of power in the world.

377
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,238
The Power of Chaos used by Ancestral God.

378
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:36,120
The Power of Laws managed by True Gods,

379
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,100
which is from the Immortal, the God, and the Demon.

380
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,040
The last is the spiritual aura in the Lower Realm.

381
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,640
Are the devils coming?

382
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,610
The fight lasted until midnight.

383
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,900
I only slept for four hours as you woke me up.

384
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,880
I can't stay awake any longer even if I'm an iron god.

385
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,488
Are you sleepy?

386
00:27:01,488 --> 00:27:03,640
Then I'll make you sober.

387
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,840
Wait a second!

388
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,640
I'm sober now. We can go on.

389
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:29,759
There are three types of power in the world.

390
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,600
I have a question.

391
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,840
Why didn't you mention the evil power?

392
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,120
Because it's not a natural spiritual power.

393
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,260
Xuan Yi had the Power of Chaos like you.

394
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,000
He's the heir of the Chief God of Chaos.

395
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,729
As there's no evil power in the world, how can he become the Demon King?

396
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:53,344
And why are there devils?

397
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:57,599
70,000 years ago, Xuan Yi was dissatisfied with Ancestor God's way of ruling the world,

398
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,579
so he struggled to be the Chief God before gaining the instruction feather.

399
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:15,254
But when he was on the verge of defeat, he suddenly violated the way of Heaven

400
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:18,420
and forcibly absorbed the evil spirit from the dead soldiers.

401
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,688
The evil spirit mixed with the Power of Chaos

402
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:26,960
and finally became the evil power which can devour everything.

403
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,309
Men with evil thoughts in the Lower Realm learned from him

404
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,358
and became his followers.

405
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,620
Then the devils appeared.

406
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,820
That's the origin of the devils.

407
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:44,899
After Ancestral God defeated Xuan Yi, he broke the void and left.

408
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:49,238
His last breath gave birth to you. And let you be the new heir.

409
00:28:49,238 --> 00:28:54,843
As you have the Power of Chaos, you should warn yourself not to repeat Xuan Yi's misfortune.

410
00:28:54,843 --> 00:28:57,333
When you inherit the instruction feather,

411
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,159
you'll be responsible for all the things

412
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:01,640
and opening up the Human Realm.

413
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:06,677
I know. I'm born with the responsibility of operating

414
00:29:06,677 --> 00:29:09,032
the Heavenly Realm, the God Realm, and the Human Realm.

415
00:29:09,032 --> 00:29:10,455
Isn't there an old saying?

416
00:29:10,455 --> 00:29:12,122
"The larger the capability, the larger the responsibility."

417
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:13,979
As my capability is limited,

418
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:18,319
I think Zhi Yang, Tian Qi, and you are more suitable to manage the world.

419
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:20,011
So you have to learn.

420
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:21,622
I want to learn it, too.

421
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:24,109
But you've also told me that my sacred meridian is still locked.

422
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:26,377
I will strike your sacred meridian with external force.

423
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:28,755
It's still up to you whether it can be opened or not.

424
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:31,487
- What are you going to do? 
 - Relax.

425
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:34,620
Are you going to punish me?

426
00:29:38,555 --> 00:29:39,922
Can you feel anything?

427
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:41,344
No.

428
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,000
Nothing.

429
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,044
Hurry! Take back your power!

430
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:36,000
I can't.

431
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,709
I feel unwell. There's too much power.

432
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,280
If you continue like this, you'll go mad.

433
00:30:45,122 --> 00:30:48,532
Do something! I'm so young. I don't want to die.

434
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,760
Close your eyes. I'll help you.

435
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,800
Shang Gu, pardon me.

436
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,280
 ♫ Time is like you ♫ 

437
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,920
Shang Gu, don't be afraid.

438
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,540
Use your heart to feel it.

439
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,660
 ♫ I hold your warm hands tightly ♫ 

440
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,999
 ♫ The meteor is shining in the sky ♫ 

441
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,859
 ♫ I can never forget the memories of you ♫ 

442
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:31,380
 ♫ I cherish the time to be with you ♫ 

443
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:37,769
 ♫ It's still vivid for me ♫ 

444
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,160
 ♫ When I meet you ♫ 

445
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,976
 ♫ I hope we can be together forever ♫ 

446
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:47,530
 ♫ When we meet again ♫ 

447
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:53,419
 ♫ I'll travel with you without hesitation ♫ 

448
00:31:53,500 --> 00:32:05,100
 ♫ The feels. That distance. The small talk ♫ 

449
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,022
 I can't sleep. 

450
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:09,240
 Was it the feeling of opening the sacred meridian? 

451
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,100
 If I could talk to Yue Mi, it'll be great. 

452
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:18,321
 Ice Cube Bai, don't try to buy me over with your beauty. 

453
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:22,299
 Now my sacred meridian is open. I'll leave here after learning several skills. 

454
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:37,639
Your Royal Highness.

455
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,888
Master asked me to teach you today.

456
00:32:41,888 --> 00:32:43,340
Where's Bai Jue?

457
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,844
He...

458
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:48,754
- He's sick. 
 - Sick?

459
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:50,933
Is it serious? Let me in.

460
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:55,665
No. He just caught a cold. And seldom coughs.

461
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:59,860
Master doesn't want to infect you.

462
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,087
Tian Qi told me as my sacred meridian's are just opened,

463
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:05,310
if I can practice hard, my cultivation can surge.

464
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,665
And it's easy to gain achievements.

465
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:09,279
So how can he be ill at the moment?

466
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,399
Others would think he was pretending to be sick.

467
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,577
I think we should go and practice now.

468
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:17,599
Do you want him to worry about you while he's sick?

469
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,980
No.

470
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:24,540
Your Royal Highness, you can't go inside!

471
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,720
Master is really sick!

472
00:33:33,955 --> 00:33:38,587
It's dawn. Get up! Be a model for me!

473
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I will just do unto you what you did to me.

474
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,688
Your sacred meridian is so weak. Are you sick?

475
00:33:55,688 --> 00:33:56,976
Played enough?

476
00:33:56,976 --> 00:33:59,899
I'm sorry... I thought...

477
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,588
Do you think I'd get up late like you?

478
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:05,221
- Sorry about that... 
 - Leave here.

479
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,620
How can you put him in the wrong?

480
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,233
Your Royal Highness, you were the breath of Ancestral God

481
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:27,554
so your sacred meridian was blocked.

482
00:34:27,554 --> 00:34:28,754
If it was easy to break open,

483
00:34:28,755 --> 00:34:32,539
why hadn't Master Tian Qi and Zhi Yang done it for you?

484
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:38,579
If he hadn't been powerful, you might have stayed in bed.

485
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:42,743
Though I stayed up all night, I still feel energetic.

486
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:46,677
I feel that I seem to have endless power.

487
00:34:46,677 --> 00:34:49,987
Please practice yourself. I'm too paltry to teach you.

488
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,477
Where are you going?

489
00:34:51,477 --> 00:34:55,043
As Master has lost so many powers, he should drink some medicinal tea to make up for it.

490
00:34:55,043 --> 00:34:56,760
I'll go with you.

491
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:00,855
Why are you so friendly?

492
00:35:00,855 --> 00:35:03,465
Anyway, I can't owe him.

493
00:35:03,466 --> 00:35:06,022
Does he have any hobbies?

494
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:08,340
- Why do you ask? 
 - I just want to know.

495
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,043
I made some medicinal tea for you.

496
00:35:56,044 --> 00:35:57,960
Do you want to try it?

497
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,079
I know you're angry with me.

498
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,219
If you're really angry about it, you can punish me as you want.

499
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:20,799
I'm not that bored to do so.

500
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,566
Thank you for helping me open my sacred meridian.

501
00:36:24,566 --> 00:36:26,540
And we even...

502
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:32,250
I mean...

503
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,710
I don't know why I couldn't control my power.

504
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:39,599
I've never thought to absorb your power and hug you...

505
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,022
You didn't care?

506
00:36:41,022 --> 00:36:42,940
Why should I care?

507
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,800
Nothing.

508
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,165
As you treat me so well, how could I do such things to you?

509
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,480
I'm really sorry about that.

510
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:56,854
Haven't you said to punish me? So how can you feel sorry about that?

511
00:36:56,854 --> 00:37:00,343
I was kidding. Why did you take it seriously?

512
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:03,460
I have a very good memory.

513
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:09,376
I never owe others favors.

514
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:12,580
So what do you want me to do?

515
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,221
Practice well and defeat the Demon King later on.

516
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:19,420
Then I can be relieved.

517
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,560
I'll amaze you.

518
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,560
Let's go. I'll teach you to use a sword.

519
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,519
Use a sword?

520
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,910
It's nice to open the sacred meridian.

521
00:37:31,911 --> 00:37:34,400
I can use a sword now!

522
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,599
You've known Yue Mi for a long time.

523
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,079
Her sword skills are at the top of the God Realm.

524
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,999
How many books have you read about Taiyin Six Forms?

525
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,220
Taiyin... What did you say?

526
00:37:49,211 --> 00:37:52,180
Then, what about Star Sword and Cloud Sword?

527
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,180
I've never heard about them.

528
00:37:57,455 --> 00:37:58,999
You've stayed with Yue Mi for 10,000 years,

529
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:00,960
so what has she taught you?

530
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,132
Drink, dice, play Pai Gow (Chinese poker), enjoy operas, and novels.

531
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,080
I'll teach you.

532
00:38:48,022 --> 00:38:49,760
Have you learned it?

533
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,380
Yes.

534
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,040
Come and try.

535
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:13,020
 ♫ I really want to know where you are now ♫ 

536
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:20,120
 ♫ But the time tries to seal my memory ♫ 

537
00:39:22,788 --> 00:39:27,287
I didn't see it clearly. Can you show me again?

538
00:39:27,919 --> 00:39:31,200
Only once. No more chances.

539
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,740
 ♫ My dream is incomplete ♫ 

540
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,130
 ♫ But I still miss you so much ♫ 

541
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:47,239
 ♫ What's in my mind is what I can't get over ♫ 

542
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,460
 ♫ Time goes by, how many chances can tie us together ♫ 

543
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,700
 ♫ It's a long journey, about a thousand years ♫ 

544
00:39:53,722 --> 00:39:55,420
 ♫ I can summon clouds and mist ♫ 

545
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:00,400
 ♫ But I can't pray for an endless love ♫ 

546
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,590
 ♫ It's dreamlike and aimless ♫ 

547
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,970
 ♫ For one single glance at you ♫ 

548
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:14,770
 ♫ I don't regret cultivating myself, even if I have to live alone ♫ 

549
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:28,020
 ♫ I want to protect our love ♫ 

550
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,422
Have you remembered this time?

551
00:40:30,422 --> 00:40:32,100
Yes.

552
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,260
It seems to be easy.

553
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,732
Master, are you happy today?

554
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,880
The tea is nice.

555
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,320
Her Royal Highness collected them from the back mountain yesterday.

556
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,200
- No wonder you're so happy. 
 - The water is not bad.

557
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,788
She collected the water from the stamens of flowers in the morning.

558
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:10,980
It's sweet.

559
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,839
What on earth do you want to say?

560
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,770
I want to say...

561
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:19,159
Although you often have quarrels with Her Royal Highness,

562
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:21,250
you still care about each other.

563
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:25,270
Though you've never performed the rites of mentoring and apprenticeship,

564
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,510
you are beyond teacher and student.

565
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:29,840
I think you want to warm the wine.

566
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,100
Ice Cube Bai! Take this!

567
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:50,080


568
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:07,240
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

569
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:14,219
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

570
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:20,739
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

571
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:26,899
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

572
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:33,699
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

573
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:40,260
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

574
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:47,480
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

575
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,900
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

576
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:11,380
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

577
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:17,860
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

578
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:25,140
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

579
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:33,640
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

580
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:40,220
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

581
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:47,000
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

582
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,480
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

583
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:59,980
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

584
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:10,260
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
