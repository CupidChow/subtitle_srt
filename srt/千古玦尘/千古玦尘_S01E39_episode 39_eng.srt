1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,910


2
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:21,722
   

3
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:26,133
   

4
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,360
Did you already know that Bai Jue was back?

5
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,236
He is...

6
00:01:41,237 --> 00:01:42,744
Yes.

7
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:46,464
Hou Chi.

8
00:01:46,465 --> 00:01:48,946
Qing Mu is Bai Jue.

9
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:54,133
I thought you two could enjoy some time together at least.

10
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,719
Unfortunately...

11
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,240
The day has finally come.

12
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:03,211
Hou Chi.

13
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:05,498
Since Bai Jue has been awakened,

14
00:02:05,498 --> 00:02:08,560
Qing Mu doesn't exist in this world anymore.

15
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,211
As for Bai Jue, your love for Qing Mu is meaningless now.

16
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:16,300
Impossible.

17
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,920
He's Bai Jue but he's also Qing Mu.

18
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,200
He will never forget me.

19
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,700
Hou Chi.

20
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,740
He's forgotten.

21
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:42,760
Feng Ran, tell me what happened.

22
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,758
Why did Jing Lei say you slaughtered the Phoenix Clan?

23
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,329
Someone lured me to Wutong Forest.

24
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,918
When they arrived, the Phoenix Clan had already been wiped out.

25
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,719
Then, Jing Jian and I were trapped by a weird power.

26
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,959
Qing Mu fought with the one who disguised as me alone.

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,100
By the time we woke up,

28
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,840
he was already Bai Jue.

29
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,700
He doesn't remember anything.

30
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,460
He's lost all his memory

31
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:10,578
and all the things about Qing Mu.

32
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:13,160
Where's Bai Jue now?

33
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,178
He rebuilt Abyss Hall

34
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:19,600
and in the Blue Dome of Heaven, he is commanding the three realms in the name of a True God.

35
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:23,520
Hou Chi.

36
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,722
Where are you going?

37
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:34,065
I have to find him.

38
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:36,022
He doesn't remember you anymore.

39
00:03:36,022 --> 00:03:37,233
If you leave now,

40
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:39,900
what's the point of your 100 years of captivity now?

41
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,433
If he doesn't tell me he's forgotten me himself,

42
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:46,079
I won't believe that he doesn't remember me anymore.

43
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,439
This barrier was created by him back then.

44
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,838
For ordinary immortals, they can only enter and not exit.

45
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:53,599
Though you care nothing about yourself, what about your child?

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,850
Do you want him to die with you?

47
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,398
Myself?

48
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:59,355
Qing Mu's life is my life.

49
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:00,659
He had discarded everything for me.

50
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,159
He's now waiting for me to return.

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,879
How can I only think about myself and leave him alone?

52
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,838
Hou Chi, wake up!

53
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:09,300
He's now Bai Jue.

54
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,660
No one waits for you now.

55
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,180
You've told me if Shang Gu wakes up, I'll disappear.

56
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,680
So is it the same for Qing Mu and Bai Jue?

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,739
Do you think Bai Jue will still allow Qing Mu to exist?

58
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:27,300
Fine. Then I'll get Soul Tower to find Qing Mu.

59
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,722
I must find him.

60
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:30,933
Hou Chi.

61
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,244
No one can find a spiritual consciousness that was shattered by a True God's power.

62
00:04:33,244 --> 00:04:37,200
Not to mention the Soul Tower, even the Ancestral God can't do anything about it.

63
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:41,444
I have bowed to Heavens and Earth with him.

64
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:43,358
His promises are forever.

65
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:46,739
He's never broken them, the same goes for me.

66
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:51,479
No matter how he's changed, he will always be my husband

67
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,440
and my child's father.

68
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,220
Jing Yuan, please let me go.

69
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,444
If you leave now, you'll only hurt yourself.

70
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:05,278
Jing Yuan,

71
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,700
Qing Mu has no parents

72
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,700
and only a few friends.

73
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,479
From now on,

74
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,398
maybe no one will remember his existence.

75
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,798
His loves, hates, life and death, happiness and anger, how can his life be decided for him?

76
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:27,620
Now, only I can struggle for him.

77
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,899
As long as he still has a glimmer of hope, I won't give up.

78
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:36,039
I won't believe Bai Jue could be so heartless until I meet him.

79
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,080
I won't believe that the heavens would be so cruel to us.

80
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:41,900
Jing Yuan,

81
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,720
please let me go out to find him.

82
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,220
Fine.

83
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:53,722
I can let you out but you have to promise me one thing.

84
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:55,118
What?

85
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:59,180
Accept everything and say farewell to Qing Mu.

86
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:27,958
It's the only way.

87
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,398
I'll restore my immortal body

88
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,840
and kill Tian Qi and Bai Jue.

89
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,140
I've heard that True God Bai Jue has forgotten his past.

90
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,380
He doesn't remember Qing Mu.

91
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,687
Does he forget or pretend to forget?

92
00:06:47,688 --> 00:06:50,954
He split his core power and then slept for 60,000 years.

93
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:53,610
As he just woke up, he fought against you.

94
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,999
So he must have hurt his god consciousness.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,800
Whether it's true or false, I'll know after a try.

96
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,613
Your Highness, Prince Jing Yang has been waiting for you outside for a long time.

97
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,388
This time thanks to you for saving me in this time of crisis.

98
00:07:21,388 --> 00:07:22,999
Your Highness flatters me.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,400
These are all things that I should do.

100
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:34,400
From now on, we will be walking on this ice.

101
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,480
I've become a devil...

102
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:39,580
so take the secret to your grave.

103
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,080
I understand.

104
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:00,720
Greetings to Mother God.

105
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,300
Please rise.

106
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,540
I'm here to take the Mother God back to the Heavenly Palace.

107
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,033
My son has always kept me in his heart.

108
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:14,619
Yang'er, it hasn't come to 100 years,

109
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,339
so why does your Father God ask me to return?

110
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,919
Something's wrong with the Phoenix Clan

111
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,680
so he invites you to tackle the case of the Wutong Forest yourself.

112
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,358
What happened to the Wutong Forest?

113
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:31,179
I dare not discuss it here.

114
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:35,120
So please go back and discuss it with Father God.

115
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:44,580
Mother God, True God Bai Jue has awakened.

116
00:08:47,022 --> 00:08:48,709
Really?

117
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,855
What great luck for the Immortal Clan!

118
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:53,100
Yes.

119
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,480
But Bai Jue is Qing Mu...

120
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:58,999
No matter who he was before,

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,480
since he's awakened, I should go and visit him.

122
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,698
60,000 years. I don't know

123
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:13,460
whether True God is still a True God.

124
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,319
As you've decided to meet him,

125
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,360
I'll tell Zhao'er to arrange it for you.

126
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,678
Why do you ask her?

127
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,038
He's been living in Blue Dome of Heaven since he woke up,

128
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,038
with Zhao'er nursing him continuously.

129
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,120
She's now become the deputy of the Blue Dome of Heaven.

130
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,580
   

131
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:53,455
Greetings to Mother God.

132
00:09:53,455 --> 00:09:55,020
Stand up.

133
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,040
Let me have a look at you.

134
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,118
I haven't seen Mother God for many years.

135
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:04,119
I don't know if Mother God's body has recovered.

136
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:06,340
Everything is fine.

137
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,220
We're going to have a private conversation.

138
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,833
You don't need to be here. You can leave now.

139
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,520
 Yes. 

140
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:27,718
Mother God, let me show you around the garden.

141
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:28,880
Fine.

142
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,510
As I knew you would come,

143
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:36,888
I begged Master to ask the Flower Immortal to bloom hundreds of flowers.

144
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:38,988
So you can admire them here.

145
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:43,319
Zhao'er, does Bai Jue remember nothing about Qing Mu?

146
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,180
I think he's forgotten.

147
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,080
Otherwise, he wouldn't treat me so well.

148
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,060
Treat you so well?

149
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:58,999
Right now, I'm the only one closest to Master.

150
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,598
And I'm responsible for all affairs in Abyss Hall.

151
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:05,088
However, Bai Jue's never close to women

152
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:07,360
so why does he treat you differently?

153
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,211
Is he deceiving you?

154
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:13,279
Mother God, speak cautiously.

155
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,400
Are you clear about what you want?

156
00:11:19,988 --> 00:11:21,980
Mother God,

157
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,439
I only hope I can stay with him forever.

158
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,455
That's enough.

159
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,880
That can't be enough.

160
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,319
You need to let him marry you.

161
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,879
It can't be done in a hurry.

162
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,920
You have to let him fall in love with you

163
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,678
and marry you as soon as possible.

164
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,400
Only when you're his wife in the Blue Dome of Heaven,

165
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,620
will it be the best for you.

166
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:55,999
Please be at ease.

167
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,222
I've thought it over during my time in the Blue Dome of Heaven.

168
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:03,700
Only the honor of a True God is the most precious of Heaven and Earth.

169
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,798
Good girl.

170
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:13,520
You're quite like me when I was in charge of Pilgrim Hall.

171
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,678
Master really cares about Princess.

172
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,199
As she said she wanted to see flowers,

173
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,358
then Master asked the Flower Immortal

174
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,319
to create the scenery at night.

175
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,118
That's it. Though he's cold,

176
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:29,079
he is concerned with her a lot.

177
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,038
And he only asks her to serve him.

178
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,180
It seems there will be a wedding in Blue Dome of Heaven soon.

179
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,839
Well... I've heard that Master married Upper God Hou Chi a hundred years ago.

180
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,776
If so, can he marry another woman?

181
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:45,320
Don't say nonsense!

182
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,639
It's the Lord of the North Sea who married Hou Chi.

183
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,238
Not Master.

184
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:53,639
Besides, Hou Chi is no longer a god

185
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,319
so how can she compare with Princess?

186
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,100
But isn't the Lord of the North Sea Master Bai Jue?

187
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,759
Heavenly King has announced

188
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,959
Qing Mu was just a body of Master.

189
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,478
Don't say any nonsense again;

190
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,944
otherwise, I'll report it to Princess.

191
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:08,421
Maybe she'll take away your Immortal Bone

192
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:09,999
and expel you to the Human Realm.

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,800
I see. I dare not say that again.

194
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:16,400
Who's there?

195
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,740
How dare you break into the Blue Dome of Heaven?

196
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,122
This is a swamp and wildland that is not owned by the three realms,

197
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:25,619
why can't I get in?

198
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:29,598
Now, True God Bai Jue has begun practicing here

199
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:32,839
so no one can enter here without his permission.

200
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,118
If you still want to get in, you should tell us your name

201
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:37,588
and hand your request to Princess first.

202
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:39,620
Request?

203
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,358
To Jing Zhao?

204
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:44,259
Then you can go to ask Qing Mu for me

205
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:48,200
whether we need to come here with his permission.

206
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:51,511
You...

207
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:52,940
You're...

208
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,040
Have you recognized me?

209
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,460
Greetings to Lordess.

210
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,300
Where's Qing Mu?

211
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,318
Lordess Hou Chi, do you want to find Master Bai Jue?

212
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:05,954
You already know, so why ask?

213
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:07,519
Master...

214
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,100
Master reads in the Peach Woods at this time every day.

215
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:36,440
 As long as the sea hasn't dried up, 

216
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,480
 I'll be with you forever. 

217
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,160
 Bow to each other. 

218
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:57,000
 Remember to pick me up in a hundred years. 

219
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:17,040
The tea is cold. No need to add more.

220
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:30,400
Qing Mu.

221
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,800
I'm back.

222
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,333
I know you promised me. You won't break your word.

223
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,611
Qing Mu, is that you?

224
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:51,300
You can recognize me, right?

225
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,677
You look like her but you're not her.

226
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:21,222
Qing Mu, you used yourself as a betrothal gift to marry me.

227
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:25,740
You promised you'd be with me forever.

228
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,255
You said to me yourself that you would wait for me.

229
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:32,100
I'm not Qing Mu. I have no wife.

230
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,900
Who are you?

231
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,880
Master.

232
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,920
This is Upper God Hou Chi from Qingchi Palace.

233
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:47,588
Gu Jun's daughter.

234
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:50,399
How dare an immortal call herself "god"?

235
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,598
I can explain to you as you're calling me "Qing Mu."

236
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:56,879
Qing Mu was just my body as an immortal.

237
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,611
It doesn't matter to me what kind of relationship you had with him.

238
00:17:00,611 --> 00:17:02,120
See her off.

239
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:05,598
Have you heard Master's words?

240
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,118
You're now in the Blue Dome of Heaven,

241
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,759
not in your Qingchi Palace.

242
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,688
Don't act recklessly to disturb Master.

243
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:13,279
Master?

244
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,622
See him clearly!

245
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:17,118
His face, heart,

246
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,577
and everything shows that he's Qing Mu.

247
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:20,744
Fine.

248
00:17:20,744 --> 00:17:22,759
If you're not Qing Mu,

249
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,111
then I hope Master Bai Jue can give Qing Mu back to me.

250
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,560
He is dead.

251
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:41,122
Then his spiritual thoughts must exist, right?

252
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:43,060
Give them back to me.

253
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,666
His spiritual thoughts disappeared when I woke up.

254
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,519
He's no different from being dead.

255
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,679
Whether you believe it or not, that's the truth.

256
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,560
And the love debt of the two of you shouldn't have to be repaid by me.

257
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,759
Master answered you with kindness thinking of his friendship with Upper God Gu Jun.

258
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,877
But please conduct yourself.

259
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,760
Is dinner ready?

260
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,620
Yes.

261
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,980
All your favorite dishes.

262
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,522
I've made them myself.

263
00:18:16,522 --> 00:18:18,160
You've worked hard.

264
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:20,598
Forget it.

265
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,700
I won't punish you this time.

266
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,638
It is announced that the three realms will build a clothes tomb in the North Sea.

267
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:33,480
All his old friends can go there to mourn for him.

268
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:39,400
But if someone else trespasses into the Blue Dome of Heaven in the name of Qing Mu again, I won't forgive them.

269
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,560
Yes.

270
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,860
A clothes tomb?

271
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,840
Such a True God

272
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,240
dismissed me with just a clothes tomb?

273
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,640
So in your eyes, was his existence...

274
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,860
just a pawn for you to wake up?

275
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,560
Seeing that you're trapped in love,

276
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,180
I'm exceedingly happy about it.

277
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,958
You've seen that Qing Mu has chosen me this time.

278
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:35,955
No. I should call him "Master Bai Jue."

279
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:37,438
Whoever?

280
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:40,520
Anyway, I win this time.

281
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,477
If you have self-knowledge,

282
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:46,720
don't come to bother him anymore.

283
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:56,960
A True God?

284
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:03,333
Even though I have to fight against the heavens,

285
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,180
I'll still uphold justice for Qing Mu.

286
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,020
Greetings to Master.

287
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:22,340
Save the courtesy. Stand up.

288
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,219
It has been a long time. You're still so graceful.

289
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:28,580
I haven't changed but you've changed a lot.

290
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:31,159
Wu Huan,

291
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:34,620
I thank Mu Guang and you for upholding the Immortal Clan

292
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,380
and the Heavenly Realm for years.

293
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,759
I would still be a humble five-colored phoenix

294
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,140
without the guidance of you and Master Shang Gu.

295
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,759
Master Zhi Yang asked me and Mu Guang to protect the Immortal Clan.

296
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,519
We've done what we should do so I dare not claim credit for ourselves.

297
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,055
You're still as humble as before.

298
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:57,939
Be at ease. I won't forget your and Mu Guang's credits.

299
00:20:57,939 --> 00:21:00,759
As of now, the Phoenix Clan has a catastrophe which involves evil auras

300
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,080
and you're just back from the Netherworld.

301
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,700
We should find out the truth as soon as possible, pacify the demons, and bring peace to the three realms.

302
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,880
Yes, Master.

303
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,522
Master, I have to report something.

304
00:21:19,522 --> 00:21:21,520
What's the matter?

305
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,559
As you're just awake, I'm afraid you don't know that Demon God Tian Qi is still alive.

306
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,310
He hides in the Demon Realm in the name of Jing Yuan and tries to bring disaster to the three realms.

307
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:35,066
Speaking of which, he was personally executed by you.

308
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:36,639
What do you mean?

309
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,900
I'm just curious as to why he could come back to life.

310
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,689
He tried to destroy the world. Everyone should come together and punish him.

311
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:48,166
I was severely injured at that time.

312
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:51,898
Maybe... he had the chance to keep for himself a trace of consciousness.

313
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:54,199
The details are unknown.

314
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:56,320
I see.

315
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,438
The Demon Clan helped him that year.

316
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:03,800
Is it the reason why you often attack the Demon Clan?

317
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,780
You know the wars between the immortals and demons?

318
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,010
When the God Realm existed, the two realms could live in peace.

319
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,039
But now, battles break out now and then.

320
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,800
I'm really unworthy of your trust.

321
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,233
You don't need to blame yourself.

322
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:20,200
It's your responsibility to do so.

323
00:22:20,877 --> 00:22:22,880
Yes.

324
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,438
I think you've seen Hou Chi.

325
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:32,000
Don't you think she's quite similar to Shang Gu?

326
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:36,059
How could a firefly compare with the moon?

327
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,340
How dare you compare Shang Gu with an immortal?

328
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,078
I've misspoken.

329
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:46,120
It's just that I feel uncomfortable every time I think of what happened back then.

330
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:53,966
I still can't believe that Master has passed away.

331
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:57,739
60,000 years have passed. Let bygones be bygones.

332
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:02,311
Mother God, Master has just been awakened.

333
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:06,920
So please don't mention these past things to annoy him.

334
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,387
Master, it's rare for her to come to the Blue Dome of Heaven.

335
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:13,544
Shall we invite her to dine with us?

336
00:23:13,544 --> 00:23:17,333
As it's your filial affection, just do so.

337
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,040
Thanks, Master.

338
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,860
Thanks, Master.

339
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:31,321
Master, why did you let her go to ask for trouble?

340
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:37,470
Who is blessed? Who is to blame?

341
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:39,591
You can't hide from it.

342
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:42,478
As Her Royal Highness has left here,

343
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:44,589
will you go back to Triple Heaven?

344
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,799
As you were away, there has been unrest in the clan lately.

345
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,598
I know.

346
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,738
He's discontented with me because of the Demon Gathering Flag.

347
00:23:52,738 --> 00:23:54,598
It's just a trifle.

348
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,020
I know how to handle it.

349
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,879
- But... 
 - Enough.

350
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,879
Send Feng Ran back to Qingchi Palace first.

351
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,932
I'll stay here for several days.

352
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:08,580
I'm afraid something else in the matter of Bai Jue will happen.

353
00:24:09,688 --> 00:24:11,200
Yes.

354
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:25,066
 Whether you want to believe it or not, that's the truth. 

355
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:28,709
 Qing Mu was just my body as an immortal. 

356
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,999
 It doesn't matter to me what kind of relationship you had with him. 

357
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,220
 Believe or not, it's the truth. 

358
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,860
 It is announced that the three realms will build a clothes tomb in the North Sea. 

359
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,040
 All his old friends can go there to mourn for him. 

360
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:01,520
- Hou Chi! 
 - Father God...

361
00:25:30,288 --> 00:25:32,700
Fate always fool us.

362
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,799
I shouldn't have been so softhearted

363
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,240
that you're suffering in such a situation.

364
00:26:04,788 --> 00:26:08,360
A'Chi, do you feel better?

365
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,660
Father God.

366
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:16,480
Let me help you.

367
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,760
He lost his memory.

368
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,960
He remembers nothing.

369
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,777
I just want to know what has happened.

370
00:26:28,777 --> 00:26:30,680
You went to find him?

371
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:34,880
He remembers nothing?

372
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:42,011
It doesn't matter.

373
00:26:42,011 --> 00:26:46,920
As long as I'm here, the sky won't fall.

374
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,340
I don't know him at all.

375
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:53,440
He seems to be a complete stranger.

376
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,180
Is it impossible for me to revive Qing Mu?

377
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,160
Such a lively immortal suddenly disappears.

378
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,800
Take care of your baby first.

379
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,220
I'll find a way to solve it.

380
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,400
Father God.

381
00:27:19,777 --> 00:27:21,480
Why didn't you

382
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:26,320
tell me you were pregnant?

383
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,840
I mean it's a happy event for Qingchi Palace.

384
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,160
I'm going to be a grandfather.

385
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:39,800
Get some good rest.

386
00:27:40,777 --> 00:27:42,580
Father God.

387
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:51,860
I'll go to buy something for my little grandson tomorrow.

388
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,500
Ask Feng Ran to do it.

389
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,732
No. How can she go?

390
00:27:55,732 --> 00:27:57,266
She has bad taste.

391
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:58,598
By the way,

392
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:04,540
the things you have when you were a child were all hand-picked for you by me, one-by-one.

393
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,219
That's why I was very much like a boy when I was little.

394
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:15,420
How could a newborn baby know the difference between a boy and a girl?

395
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,622
So you always bought me some boys' toys,

396
00:28:18,622 --> 00:28:23,060
such as carriage models, slingshots, and weapons.

397
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:29,480
Well, I know nothing about girls.

398
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,838
Then why didn't you ask those female lords?

399
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:36,720
Don't you have a female friend?

400
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,640
I'm...

401
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,500
not good at it.

402
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:46,660
Father God.

403
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:52,279
If one day I have to leave Qingchi Palace, you will be very lonely.

404
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,999
I think you'd better find yourself a companion.

405
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,044
Why do you say that?

406
00:28:58,044 --> 00:28:59,833
Where do you want to go?

407
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:03,180
A'Chi, as long as you're here,

408
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,820
I won't feel lonely.

409
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:14,740
You always think too much.

410
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,520
My grandson can't be like you.

411
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,243
It's exceedingly nice for him to be like Qing Mu.

412
00:29:22,244 --> 00:29:24,840
Why would he be like him?

413
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,744
Your father can handle everything.

414
00:29:27,744 --> 00:29:32,340
I'll arrange everything for your baby.

415
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:39,780
Come on.

416
00:29:41,555 --> 00:29:43,140
All right.

417
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,698
Get some good rest first. Let me help you.

418
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,280
Everything will be fine when you wake up.

419
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:21,621
Your Highness, His Majesty came here during dinner time.

420
00:30:22,522 --> 00:30:24,360
Really?

421
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:27,311
Did he say anything?

422
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:28,500
No.

423
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,233
He rejoiced when he knew you were having dinner with Master Bai Jue.

424
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:38,319
Then he said you'd suffered a lot in the Netherworld and asked us to take good care of you.

425
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,900
It seems that he's forgiven me.

426
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,039
I think His Majesty still thinks of you a lot.

427
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,318
I wish you could be harmonious.

428
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:54,960
You are still the most honorable goddess of the realm.

429
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:01,800
I would have been glad to hear it in the past,

430
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,620
but now...

431
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,310
Since I came back from the Netherworld, I'd made up my mind.

432
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:23,620
I must be the master of my own future.

433
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,400
My future shouldn't be decided by him.

434
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,600
I've made an indiscreet remark. Please punish me.

435
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,700
Stand up.

436
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,340
There is no need for more courtesy between you and me.

437
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,300
I wasn't angry just now.

438
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,020
And I wasn't self-pitying.

439
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,310
I have no time to think about it.

440
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:49,780
Did you get any information in the Blue Dome of Heaven today?

441
00:31:50,939 --> 00:31:53,720
Of course, he acted perfectly.

442
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:56,540
He didn't admit he was Qing Mu,

443
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,120
or that Hou Chi has a relationship with Shang Gu.

444
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,080
If Master Bai Jue remembered Qing Mu,

445
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,459
he would not have left you for dinner.

446
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,055
Bai Jue is discreet.

447
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,440
I'm starting to think more and more

448
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,933
that he became Immortal Bo Xuan

449
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:18,560
to live in Qingchi Palace in order to revive Shang Gu.

450
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:21,958
If Hou Chi is Shang Gu,

451
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:25,866
she's seen everything I've done over the years.

452
00:32:25,866 --> 00:32:28,100
When she wakes up,

453
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,100
what awaits me is punishment.

454
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,319
I thought to suppress Hou Chi.

455
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,400
It seems that now I have to find a chance to completely eradicate her

456
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,700
to erase potential trouble.

457
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,640
How could Master Bai Jue condone you?

458
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,500
I don't know why he contends with you.

459
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,620
He hasn't completely restored his power

460
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,500
and he still looks weak.

461
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,780
He can't hide it.

462
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,922
It's a perfect opportunity for me, to keep practicing to get better.

463
00:33:04,922 --> 00:33:07,620
When I have enough power

464
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,180
and become the Devil God,

465
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:14,299
no Upper God will be able to stop me then.

466
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:18,500
All my problems can be solved at that time.

467
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,420
What should we do next?

468
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,480
I've broken through the first task after leaving the Netherworld.

469
00:33:25,455 --> 00:33:29,043
Feng Nv, go and find Elder Dan Feng at once.

470
00:33:29,043 --> 00:33:31,100
With her around,

471
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:35,377
I can't sleep well.

472
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:37,080
Yes.

473
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:49,776
 Is it important to be a god or a devil? 

474
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:51,800
Of course.

475
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,080
I'm the Heavenly Queen,

476
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:58,060
so how can I become a devil?

477
00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:01,160
 You're wrong. 

478
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:05,400
 Whoever can define a god or a devil, 

479
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,720
 and judge life and death, 

480
00:34:09,939 --> 00:34:12,660
 are the most important. 

481
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:00,533
Greeting to Master Bai Jue.

482
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:02,566
I guessed you would come.

483
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:07,120
Master Bai Jue, I'm here tonight just to ask you

484
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,860
whether you remember the Doom of Chaos that happened 60,000 years ago?

485
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,060
 You exist as the three realms exist. 

486
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,740
 You're the Chief God of Chaos. 

487
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,380
 I won't let you die. 

488
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,900
 I won't let you die! 

489
00:35:38,955 --> 00:35:45,079
 Master's spiritual consciousness has been nurtured for 40,000 years, but we still can't see her birth. 

490
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:49,680
 You've spent half of your power to complete the God-Reviving Spell. 

491
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,119
 It will lapse tomorrow. 

492
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:57,180
 If she can't be revived today, all our efforts would have been in vain. 

493
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,900
 She's Shang Gu. 

494
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,899
 If she can't change her life herself, who else can help her? 

495
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:26,610
 - Master! 
 - Be quiet. Don't disturb her. 

496
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,922
 She's weak as she's just been born. 

497
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:31,554
 We need to look after her carefully. 

498
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:33,160
 Yes. 

499
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:44,660
 Master Bai Jue, why do you seal her god consciousness? 

500
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,733
 She said she was unwilling to become a god again on Universe Pavilion. 

501
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:53,399
 As it's her wish, she's no longer Shang Gu in this life. 

502
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:55,955
 - But... 
 - Things have changed. 

503
00:36:55,955 --> 00:36:57,359
 The future is unknown. 

504
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,289
 She's no more the Chief God of the world so she won't be responsible for all creatures. 

505
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:05,720
 It's her good fortune. 

506
00:37:08,077 --> 00:37:12,176
 An ancient tree stands in the wind and the moon is shining in the pool. 

507
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,740
 From now on, you're called "Hou Chi." 

508
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,200
 Hou Chi, grow up well. 

509
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,320
 You'll live a peaceful life under my protection. 

510
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:34,799
Hou Chi.

511
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,780
This name was chosen for her by you yourself.

512
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,911
In order to save her,

513
00:37:39,911 --> 00:37:44,976
you changed into Bo Xuan and looked after her for thousands of years.

514
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:47,398
But the resurrection of Shang Gu

515
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:51,200
means that the Doom of Chaos has not disappeared.

516
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:58,188
No one but me knows that it was you who temporarily sealed the doom.

517
00:37:58,188 --> 00:38:00,400
Why do you mention it?

518
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,700
After that, you endured the agony of tearing your core power

519
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:10,000
to divide into another body to absorb the demon power of Heaven and Earth.

520
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,559
Thousands of years ago, you even decided to go to the North Sea

521
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,119
to merge heavenly power with demon power

522
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,880
to create the Power of Chaos.

523
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,398
So?

524
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:25,533
I came here tonight to ask about your return this time.

525
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:29,918
Is it still going to be carried out as planned?

526
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:32,660
Are you still willing to devote yourself

527
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,119
to Master Shang Gu and all creatures of the world?

528
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,340
If you didn't change your mind,

529
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,976
so why did you pretend to forget everything and destroy Qing Mu?

530
00:38:42,976 --> 00:38:46,740
Why did you let Hou Chi feel agony?

531
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,940
I had planned for everything,

532
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,918
but I didn't count the body that absorbed the demonic energy of Heaven and Earth,

533
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:05,600
that body with the supreme demon power would produce consciousness.

534
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,160
He devoured me when I tried to merge them.

535
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:13,650
After I woke up thousands of years later,

536
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,060
I found he'd fallen in love with Hou Chi.

537
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:17,979
Why do I have to pretend to forget it?

538
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:20,160
You should give me an answer.

539
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,120
What were you doing?

540
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:27,155
Why didn't you stop her?

541
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:30,420
I... I tried to stop her but failed.

542
00:39:31,299 --> 00:39:33,421
I'm a dying man.

543
00:39:33,422 --> 00:39:36,799
She will give up only when I deceive her

544
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,960
and abandon our marriage.

545
00:39:41,155 --> 00:39:45,900
But... when Master Shang Gu wakes up,

546
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,660
and knows you treated Hou Chi harshly and replaced her to confront the Doom of Chaos,

547
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,918
she will hate you.

548
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:54,240
It's better than her losing life.

549
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,640
As long as she hates me,

550
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,238
she won't feel agony for my death.

551
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,819
I'll be at ease as long as she can live on well.

552
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,200
There will be hope for all beings in the three realms.

553
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,500
Master.

554
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,020
Master Shang Gu treated me with kindness,

555
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,759
I'd like to finish the plan with you.

556
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,918
But for tens of thousands of years, I've already regarded Hou Chi as my own daughter.

557
00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:28,439
I can't bear her to be so unemotional.

558
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,088
Then why did you let her exile herself on Shenyin Mountain for a hundred years?

559
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:34,100
You could have stopped it.

560
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:40,840
But you still watched as a newlywed couple was forced to be separated for decades.

561
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,990


562
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,419
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

563
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:12,400
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

564
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:18,820
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

565
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:24,980
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

566
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:31,579
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

567
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:38,324
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow♫ 

568
00:41:38,325 --> 00:41:45,599
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

569
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,820
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

570
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:09,340
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

571
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:15,920
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

572
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:23,099
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

573
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:30,300
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

574
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:38,280
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

575
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:45,160
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

576
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:51,574
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

577
00:42:51,575 --> 00:42:58,149
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

578
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:07,450
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
