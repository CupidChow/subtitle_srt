1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:09,000


2
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:21,220
   

3
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,080
   

4
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,859
Qing Mu, is there really a True God in the world?

5
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,458
Sometimes, I really want to ask them something.

6
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:56,380
I haven't done anything bad in 60,000 years,

7
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,842
but why did I lose everyone around me?

8
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:01,838
Besides, my own cultivation can't even save you.

9
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:05,640
It's all up to her Dragon Elixir.

10
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,319
You're fine.

11
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,065
You don't need to console me.

12
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:12,879
I'm eager to be a True God

13
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,738
so that I would be able to take charge and cultivate the heavens.

14
00:02:15,738 --> 00:02:18,920
Maybe I won't have too many troubles at that time.

15
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:24,019
Hou Chi, don't focus on things that are over your head.

16
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:28,178
You and I are admiring True Gods while mortals are envying us.

17
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,999
Besides, as you've absorbed the spiritual aura of Pilgrim Hall,

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,278
becoming a god is just around the corner.

19
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:39,500
Your title will reverberate in the three realms.

20
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,198
I'm waiting for that day.

21
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,820
- Are you serious? 
 - Of course.

22
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,420
There's still a long time for me to be an Upper God,

23
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,659
but I want to run amok in the three realms and show prestige.

24
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,759
Sure!

25
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,576
Let's travel around the three realms after Heavenly Queen's birthday.

26
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:01,369
Let the three realms have a look at the demeanor of Upper God Hou Chi.

27
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:05,487
Tomorrow, I will let all the immortals in the Heavenly Palace see the demeanor of this god.

28
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:07,211
Are you going to attend her birthday banquet?

29
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,734
What?  You don't want me to?

30
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:12,159
Are you trying to hide something from me?

31
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,578
How can I?

32
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:16,601
If you want, I'll accompany you.

33
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:17,836
Don't worry.

34
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:20,239
Let's go back to Qingchi Palace once it's over.

35
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,099
Father God and Bo Xuan care about me a lot.

36
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,946
They won't blame me.

37
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:26,211
Hou Chi, what are you going to do?

38
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:28,279
Don't do foolish things for me.

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,239
I'm not foolish.

40
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,180
Trust me.

41
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:03,199
Your Highness is still seriously injured so please drink less.

42
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,280
How dare you bother my things?

43
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,240
Why don't you stop her?

44
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,000
Are you well?

45
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,700
Don't bother me.

46
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,760
Your Highness!

47
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,579
Go to report Heavenly King and Queen that she fainted.

48
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:28,100
Yes.

49
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,479
Her Majesty knows it's not your fault.

50
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,539
Leave now.

51
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,500
 Thanks, Your Highness. 

52
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,459
Please be at ease. I only used a little power.

53
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,499
She's fine.

54
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:56,576
I just wonder what you're going to do.

55
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,620
 Greetings to Your Highness. 

56
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,600
Mother God, what happened?

57
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,399
Zhao'er lost her Dragon Elixir and her power has elapsed too fast.

58
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,560
I'm afraid she can't hold her immortal body anymore.

59
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,380
I'd like to transfer some power to her.

60
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,919
It won't be of use.

61
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,954
She's lost her elixir.

62
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:40,100
I'm afraid that this time Zhao'er will have more bad luck coming.

63
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,020
You can leave us.

64
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,240
I want to talk to your Mother God.

65
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,020
 Yes. 

66
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,899
Huan, I thought about it for a few days and came up with a way.

67
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:08,798
If I transfer my Dragon Elixir to Zhao'er, it should be able to solve the immediate problems.

68
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,840
How can you do that?

69
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,060
Mortals have a saying,

70
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,260
"Children are the debt of their parents."

71
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,959
As now she's suffering,

72
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,340
it's my fault for not teaching her well.

73
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,019
Mu Guang, you're the Heavenly King.

74
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,920
If you lose your Dragon Elixir,

75
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,060
how can the Heavenly Realm and the Immortal Realm

76
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,659
tackle the Demon Clan and domestic affairs?

77
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,680
Have you forgotten what Master Zhi Yang asked you?

78
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,820
We've been married for years.

79
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,420
Do you remember

80
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,540
how hard it was to have Zhao'er after Yang'er and Jian'er?

81
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,165
Of course, I remember.

82
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:16,243
At that time, it was my first time conquering the Demon Realm.

83
00:07:16,243 --> 00:07:18,010
When you were pregnant with her,

84
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,398
it was hard to develop a Golden Dragon.

85
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,719
You nourished her by your spiritual veins

86
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,220
so that she could be born.

87
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,299
She acted in impulse

88
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:36,280
and led herself to such an end.

89
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,620
Though she did it herself,

90
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,299
being her mother,

91
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,518
how could I do nothing

92
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,320
but to see her become weaker and weaker?

93
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,398
Huan, why are you...

94
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,479
I've asked Lord Dong Hua.

95
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,829
He said that there is no other way but to let Qing Mu go to Blue Dragon Pavilion

96
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,359
to suffer enough from 49 thunder ordeals.

97
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,699
If so, Qing Mu will...

98
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,619
I know you're responsible for all creatures.

99
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,458
And you show no biases to Jian'er and Yang'er.

100
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,100
I can understand all that you've done.

101
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,680
If you don't want to be the bad guy,

102
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,519
never mind, I can do so.

103
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,019
Tomorrow is my birthday banquet.

104
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,820
We are husband and wife

105
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,620
and I only have one request.

106
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,299
Brother!

107
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,179
You're not my brother!

108
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:49,139
Brother, I do care about Zhao'er.

109
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,399
But as things are, it'll be useless even to kill Qing Mu.

110
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,979
Moreover, he didn't do it on purpose.

111
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,799
So why do you force him so?

112
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,819
Because Zhao'er is my sister.

113
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,239
Helping her is my justice.

114
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,578
I want to ask you a question.

115
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:07,420
You've told Mother God you like Feng Ran. Is it true?

116
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,039
- Yes.
 -  At that year, in the Swamp of Netherhill,

117
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,639
if Zi Yuan hadn't rescued me, I would have died by her hand.

118
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,800
Anyway, you tell me you like her.

119
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,940
Jing Jian, what are you think about on earth?

120
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,999
If you really think that I'm your brother

121
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,380
and Zhao'er is your sister,

122
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,260
then you should make a clean break with them.

123
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:30,459
Otherwise, I won't be your brother anymore.

124
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,460
I don't want a brother like you.

125
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,899
I've never thought though Hou Chi risked her life to enter Pilgrim Hall,

126
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,180
Jing Zhao was still faster than her.

127
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:22,299
When I heard my mother would go to Pilgrim Hall,

128
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,339
I couldn't be at ease

129
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,880
so I asked Zhao'er to take care of Qing Mu.

130
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:30,297
I've never thought things would be like this.

131
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:32,758
I care about Zhao'er

132
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,640
but also I don't want Qing Mu to be in a dilemma.

133
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,619
As you feel sorry for your sister, I feel sorry for Hou Chi!

134
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:43,539
I know the consequences of ruining spiritual veins.

135
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,229
Anyway, Jing Zhao is really shameless.

136
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,919
Qing Mu can neither keep nor return it.

137
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:53,000
Why doesn't she know that love can't be forced?

138
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:04,020
Forget it. It's not your fault.

139
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,699
Just seeing them in so much pain,

140
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,840
I hate I can't do anything for them.

141
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,180
Lordess Feng Ran, mortals have an old saying,

142
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,360
"When the boat is steered to the bridge, it will go naturally straight with the current."

143
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,180
Maybe it'll take a favorable turn.

144
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,940
I hope so.

145
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,620
Are you worrying about something?

146
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,880
Why do you say that?

147
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,819
You'll call me "Feng Ran" when you're happy

148
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:55,019
and you'll call me "Lordess" when you're depressed.

149
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,920
Neither of us can hide our hearts.

150
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,658
I've never thought you to observe me so carefully.

151
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,279
Because you once saved my life.

152
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,860
Reciprocity reaps rewards.

153
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:21,300
 I like Feng Ran. 

154
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,479
 I can't and dare not give in today. 

155
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,699
 There is a blood feud between me and her. 

156
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,060
 But you like her. 

157
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,159
You see, it's not a wooden face when you smile like this.

158
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,899
Pretty nice. Smile more.

159
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,839
Thank you.

160
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,378
Why do you thank me?

161
00:12:54,378 --> 00:12:57,099
We're good friends. Good friends.

162
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,300
Come on. Cheers.

163
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,439
 You're awake? 

164
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,239
 Miss, did you save me? 

165
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,380
 Is anyone else here? 

166
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,799
 What's your name? 

167
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,279
 How dare you come to the Swamp of Netherhill yourself? 

168
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,160
 Do you want to die? 

169
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,500
 I don't think you committed a crime. 

170
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,780
 So were you discarded by your family too? 

171
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,880
 I... 

172
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,859
 Forget it. You can refuse to tell me. 

173
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:36,800
 After entering this hellish place, 

174
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,839
 you should learn to protect yourself first. 

175
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,099
 Miss, you don't need to worry about me. 

176
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:47,439
 You can go back home first. I'm fine. 

177
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:52,459
 You're fine now because I'm guarding you. 

178
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,179
 Once I leave here... 

179
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:55,840
 Look at behind you. 

180
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,519
 You're such a coward. 

181
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,900
 You can't even cram their teeth with your tiny body. 

182
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,939
 How can you laugh now? 

183
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,839
 When a stronger devil comes here, 

184
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,420
 even I can't protect you. 

185
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,760
 Miss, you don't need to worry about me. 

186
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,558
 It's dangerous here, 

187
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,719
 so you'd better go home first. 

188
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,229
 Home? 

189
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,979
 This place is my home. 

190
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,579
 Anyway, I'd better bring you to hide in the cave first. 

191
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:30,920
 Let's go. 

192
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,359
 If the old man knows that I've saved an immortal, 

193
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,740
 he will probably scold me a lot. 

194
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,839
 Oh, no. He's calling me. 

195
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,459
 What's this? 

196
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,259
 It's Phoenix Feather. 

197
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:52,999
 The old man uses it to notify me when he wants me to come. 

198
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,900
 I have to leave now. 

199
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,140
 Miss... 

200
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,719
 I'm in a hurry, I'll go back first. 

201
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,900
 Take care of yourself. 

202
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,600
 Miss, your... 

203
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,200
Feng Ran, when will you know

204
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,620
that I am the boy you saved back then?

205
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,659
Have you heard that a person from Qingchi Palace is also here for the birthday banquet?

206
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:58,959
Last time, she's ruined Lord Dong Hua's birthday banquet.

207
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,199
What will happen this time?

208
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,399
Tens of thousands of years have passed.

209
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,438
Which banquet could be bustling like this?

210
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,760
It seems the Heavenly Palace attaches great importance to this event.

211
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,420
What? You don't like it?

212
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,519
Feng Ran prepa,red so many robes for you

213
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,820
why did you choose this one?

214
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,839
As I've absorbed the divine power of Pilgrim Hall,

215
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,499
I find I like things about the ancient God Realm more and more.

216
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,279
Feng Ran told me its style was handed down from that time.

217
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,619
As I really like it, then I put it on.

218
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,799
What a coincidence! We really are in touch.

219
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,759
Look at me and you.  Truly a match made in Heaven.

220
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,320
Smug boy.

221
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,859
You still need something.

222
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:08,580
Need what?

223
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,839
It's my first time to see such a hairpin.

224
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,199
It's like an ancient God's ornament.

225
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:19,360
It's perfectly suitable for your garment.

226
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,739
Is it special for me?

227
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:23,300
Come on.

228
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,879
How about it? It suits you.

229
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:34,949
You usually like to flatter me by cooking or flowers.

230
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,639
Why changed today?

231
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:38,339
So shouldn't you praise me?

232
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,419
Was it made by yourself?

233
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,159
Yes.

234
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,838
In fact, I don't know why.

235
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,199
I just had a brainwave to make it.

236
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,639
You don't like dressing up yourself,

237
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,059
and know few things about ladies' likes.

238
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,159
However, you've made such a delicate hairpin,

239
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,954
better than those tender ladies.

240
00:18:56,954 --> 00:18:59,011
Can you tell me the reason?

241
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:01,759
Your comment to me doesn't sound right.

242
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,239
What do you mean?

243
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:05,100
Nothing.

244
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,119
I'm glad to see you can make a hairpin.

245
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,180
- Let's go. 
 - Fine.

246
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:28,999
 Congratulations on the Queen's birthday. 

247
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,859
 I wish Your Highness longevity and happiness. 

248
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,589
Please stand up.

249
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,499
Today is Heavenly Queen's birthday.

250
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:41,379
We're here to celebrate so enjoy yourselves and neglect the rules today.

251
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,719
Upper God Hou Chi and Lord of the North Sea, Qing Mu, have come to celebrate.

252
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:07,469
We wish you happiness and health.

253
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,159
The immortals may not know.

254
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,879
As the Lord of the North Sea, Qing Mu, fell in love with Princess Jing Zhao,

255
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,839
Jing Zhao then sent him her Dragon Elixir

256
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,065
and the Heavenly King saw this scene and then ordered their marriage.

257
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:22,618
Anyway, several days later, things have changed.

258
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:25,399
Qing Mu, as you insist on breaking off the engagement,

259
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,780
you should return Jing Zhao's Dragon Elixir.

260
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,280
It's quite funny to find you can distort facts like that.

261
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,159
Hou Chi, though you have the title of "Upper God,"

262
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,999
don't think you can offend me here.

263
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:44,779
We're now in the Heavenly Palace, not in your Qingchi Palace.

264
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:48,879
As you've done so much to protect your daughter,

265
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,739
then I won't tell them the fact let it will bring shame on Heavenly King.

266
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:56,987
Anyway, Qingchi Palace will tackle both favors and debts.

267
00:20:56,987 --> 00:21:01,159
Even though Your Highness mentions nothing, I'll still repay the favor.

268
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,639
Really?

269
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,519
Then tell me about it. How will you repay it?

270
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:11,418
My Father God Gu Jun is a flood dragon so, of course, I should be.

271
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:15,039
As Jing Zhao loses her Dragon Elixir, I can return her one.

272
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,339
Hou Chi, what nonsense are you talking about?

273
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:19,399
How can you go on cultivating without it?

274
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,279
You'll protect me so what if I stop cultivation?

275
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,699
 Let's go back Qingchi Palace as it's over. 

276
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,619
 Father God and Bo Xuan care about me a lot. They won't blame me. 

277
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:32,919
 Hou Chi, what are you going to do? 

278
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:34,759
 Don't do foolish things for me. 

279
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,440
 I'm not foolish. 

280
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,887
You already had this planned.

281
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:41,559
All immortals know the importance of Dragon Elixir.

282
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,199
You need to think it over.

283
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,759
I'd like to break off all relations with you

284
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,439
by my Dragon Elixir and all spiritual veins.

285
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:49,760
I refuse!

286
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,299
There should be no distinction between you and me.

287
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:54,099
No matter what happens in the future,

288
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:55,499
we should confront it together.

289
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:57,080
Hou Chi?

290
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,919
Where's my Dragon Elixir?

291
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:10,320
 She's not Gu Jun's daughter. 

292
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,118
Hou Chi, who are you?

293
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:18,218
As you know, Gu Jun is a flood dragon

294
00:22:18,218 --> 00:22:20,919
and I'm a five-colored phoenix.

295
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,819
If she is really my daughter, how can there not even be an elixir in her body?

296
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,160
She must be someone who is deceives the realms, pretends to be a god,

297
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,600
and causes chaos in the Heavenly Palace.

298
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,039
Mother God, if so, shall we wait for Upper God Gu Jun's arrival?

299
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,179
Let's make the final decision after making it clear.

300
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,559
You're so muddled!

301
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,059
As she has no Dragon Elixir, what else should we investigate?

302
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:47,578
If I don't give an explanation to all the immortals today,

303
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:50,700
everyone will want to pretend to be a god.

304
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,787
Qing Mu, how dare you make trouble here?

305
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:01,043
If you want to add another crime, there is nothing to worry about.

306
00:23:01,043 --> 00:23:04,118
She is for I trust her.

307
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,720
Others' words are useless.

308
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,699
Enough! It's a birthday banquet and all the immortals are here to celebrate.

309
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,999
Don't stir up trouble.

310
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:15,659
You can go back to Qingchi Palace right now.

311
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:19,500
- Mu Guang... 
 - I've said it's enough.

312
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,399
Thanks to Your Majesty, but I don't want to leave now.

313
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:32,378
What happened today was all because of me

314
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,438
but Hou Chi finally suffered the humiliation.

315
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:36,078
If we leave here with no words,

316
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,299
would everyone come to suspect her identity later on?

317
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:40,759
What do you want?

318
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,732
Upper God Hou Chi is right.

319
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:46,280
As I owe you a Dragon Elixir, I should return it right now.

320
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,539
Heavenly King and all immortals here.

321
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:52,859
Please allow me to go to Blue Dragon Pavilion to suffer 49 thunder ordeals

322
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:55,259
to return Jing Zhao's Dragon Elixir.

323
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:57,020
Qing Mu...

324
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:01,238
Hou Chi, trust me.

325
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:02,899
That's not the point.

326
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,999
The point is that the thunder ordeal will lead you to death.

327
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:07,300
I won't want to owe her anything.

328
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:12,820
I only want to be with you forever.

329
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,500
If you'll lose your life because of it,

330
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,459
then I would rather not be with you.

331
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:23,460
Hou Chi, I won't die so easily.

332
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,460
Calm down. Trust me.

333
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,410
Master, what's the matter?

334
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,159
Hou Chi has been in the Heavenly Palace for long without any news.

335
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:05,280
I can't be at ease with her.

336
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:08,899
Lead troops to the border of the Immortal Realm and the Demon Realm.

337
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:10,319
Then let's go to the Heavenly Palace.

338
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,239
If something wrong happens, attack the Heavenly Realm at once.

339
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,521
Master, please calm down.

340
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:16,500
We haven't prepared well. If we attack Wu Huan so rashly...

341
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,899
If Hou Chi meets an accident,

342
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:20,860
what's the point of my tens of thousands of years of preparation?

343
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,080
This time, I won't let her be in danger.

344
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,459
Qing Mu, have you decided?

345
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:42,079
Ninth Heaven Black Thunder can seriously injure you with just a few strokes.

346
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,459
I'm afraid you'll vanish after 49 thunder ordeals.

347
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:48,080
It's fine.

348
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,500
Hou Chi!

349
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,060
Hou Chi?

350
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,640
Hou Chi, what are you going to do?

351
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,500
Who arouses the Sky Thunder?

352
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,980
It's...

353
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,600
It's...

354
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,320
Hou Chi!

355
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,259
You've been injured like this after seven thunders.

356
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:26,900
It seems that the young and promising the Lord of the North Sea will be damaged at this Blue Dragon Pavilion.

357
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:30,979
Hou Chi, do you really want to die with him?

358
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,779
Your Highness, please be at ease.

359
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:37,880
Even if I die here today, I am willing.

360
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,620
You overrate yourself.

361
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,620
Qing Mu!

362
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,299
Zhao'er.

363
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,419
Qing Mu! Come out!

364
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:04,579
I won't marry you!

365
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,199
And I won't ask you to stay in the Heavenly Palace!

366
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,279
Leave there!

367
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,500
You'll die if you take the Dragon Elixir out!

368
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,279
Zhao'er!

369
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,419
Brother, don't stop me.

370
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,799
I want to save him.

371
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,499
It's too late.

372
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:26,218
The Sky Thunder has been activated.

373
00:30:26,218 --> 00:30:31,999
The barrier won't disappear until all 49 thunders have struck.

374
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:36,959
Zhao'er! Where's your decency?

375
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,940
Zhao'er.

376
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,880
Qing Mu...

377
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,279
Hou Chi...

378
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:02,399
It's all your fault!

379
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,200
If it weren't for you, why would he give up his life?

380
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,779
If it wasn't for you, nothing would happen!

381
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,409
Hou Chi! Come on.

382
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,180
Jing Zhao.

383
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,559
I'm grateful that you could use your elixir to save his life.

384
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:46,900
But you should know that he's a living man, not your toy.

385
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,679
He has the right to choose his life.

386
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,860
Besides, I'd like to live and die with him.

387
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,800
Princess Jing Zhao,

388
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,380
thanks for your care to me.

389
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,740
Anyway, Hou Chi is my only love

390
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,135
so I can't accept your admiration.

391
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,377
I hope you can let me off

392
00:32:11,377 --> 00:32:14,719
after I give your elixir back to you.

393
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,199
Master.

394
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,040
If Her Royal Highness can't suffer the Sky Thunder...

395
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,200
You did so in the past. So do you now.

396
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,819
Shang Gu, is he really worth giving your everything for?

397
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:48,840
And when can you notice me?

398
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,240
Hou Chi!

399

 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫

 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫

There's only one Sky Thunder left...

412
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,300
Will you regret doing so?

413
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,100
As long as I can be with you,

414
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,600
I regret nothing.

415
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,420
 God Hou Chi, I'm here to ask you one question. 

416
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,619
 I've been solitary in the North Sea for years without seeing you once, 

417
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,800
 but why do I feel familiar with you when I see you? 

418
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,299
 Playboy, are you finished? 

419
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:57,079
 I can't see others censure you, bully, and insult you. 

420
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:01,487
 And I can't stand to see you pretend nothing happens even though you're suffering from injustice. 

421
00:35:01,487 --> 00:35:05,120
 How can a girl drink so much outside? 

422
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,420
 What if you expose your identity? 

423
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,059
 If you still want to drink later on, I must accompany you. 

424
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,640
 There is something I have wanted to say that I have kept in my heart for a long time. 

425
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,954
 I'll make you birthday noodles every year in the future. Not only your birthday. 

426
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:23,060
 As long as you want it, I'll cook it for you. 

427
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,940
 Hou Chi, I like you. 

428
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:31,120
 Maybe your Father God will leave. 

429
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,280
 Maybe others will leave, but I will be with you. 

430
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,600
 But when I first met you on Observation Mountain, 

431
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,718
 I've known that you were the one I wanted. 

432
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:46,378
 We'll stay with each other just like the sky and the sea. 

433
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:53,880
When we pass the final one, let's go back to Qingchi Palace

434
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,443
to see the spring there and beautiful flowers on the mountain.

435
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:07,580
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫ 

436

Qing Mu!

437
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,820
Don't leave...

438
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,640
Come on...

439
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,829
If I want to live, even the heavens can't kill me either.

440
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,180
Qing Mu! What are you going to do?

441
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,479
Zhao'er.

442
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:08,800
 Qing Mu... I love you so deeply but you're heartless. 

443
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,140
Qing Mu!

444
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,080

Qing Mu...

446
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,599
You promised me that you'd live.

447
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,699
You've never broken your words before so I can't believe you'd die so easily.

448
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:38,980
It's impossible.

449
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,900
 - Why bother? 
 - I'm afraid he's... 

450
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,740
Master! Qing Mu...

451
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:50,719
Hold on a second. How could he be killed by some Sky Thunder?

452
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:57,219
Qing Mu, I've told you that I'll accompany you no matter what happens.

 ♫ If our love turns into ashes in the end ♫ ​

454
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,779
His spiritual veins have been destroyed.

455
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,510
It's useless even though she gives him all her power.

456
00:38:10,511 --> 00:38:13,521
He can't come back to life after death. So why bother?

457
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:18,179
If she loses all her power, she will vanish.

458
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:22,999
She's trapped by love. She wants to die with him.

459
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,718

485
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,740
Who said we can't fight against Heaven?

486
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,300
I will show everyone in the three realms today that I will definitely conquer Heaven.

487
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:43,070


488
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:53,819
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

489
00:41:53,820 --> 00:42:00,700
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

490
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:07,220
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

491
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:13,280
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

492
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:20,080
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

493
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:26,575
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

494
00:42:26,575 --> 00:42:33,949
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

495
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:40,225
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

496
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:57,799
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

497
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:04,275
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

498
00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:11,549
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

499
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:18,025
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

500
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:26,675
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

501
00:43:26,675 --> 00:43:33,425
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

502
00:43:33,425 --> 00:43:39,974
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

503
00:43:39,975 --> 00:43:46,499
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

504
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:56,050
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
