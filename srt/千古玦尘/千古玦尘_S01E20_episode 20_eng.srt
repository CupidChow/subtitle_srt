1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:08,960


2
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:20,140
   

3
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:26,700
   

4
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,622
I've been admiring this place for a long time, so I must enter it today.

5
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,711
If you don't like it, you can go back to the inn and wait for me.

6
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:36,200
When I have had enough fun, I'll go back to find you.

7
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,822
Wait.

8
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:42,580
What? Do you want me to take you back to the inn?

9
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,677
How come? I just don't understand that

10
00:01:45,677 --> 00:01:47,800
this place only entertains men...

11
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,111
 Let's go. 

12
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,220
...so how can you have a good time here?

13
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,620
Or do you want to take this chance to get rid of me?

14
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,711
It's clear that Your Highness is ignorant.

15
00:01:57,711 --> 00:02:00,900
The whorehouse of the Demon Realm has female demons and naturally has male demons.

16
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,160
What? Men can come, but women can't come?

17
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,100
Then please give me a lesson tonight.

18
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,700
This way, please.

19
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,955
 Long time no see! I've been waiting for you for so long. 

20
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:18,400
 Let's go. 

21
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:28,600
Xuanjing Palace is over there.

22
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,088
Demon Zi Yue lives there.

23
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:33,600
It's heavily guarded here so we can't break in.

24
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:37,460
You're starting to use your brain.

25
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,160
When haven't I used my brain?

26
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,744
You not only act recklessly but also have a poor memory.

27
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:45,960
Don't you remember you fought against others yesterday?

28
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,777
Jing Jian always praises me for helping others. So why is it so hard for you to say?

29
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:55,188
Then please use your brain to find us a surefire plan.

30
00:02:56,966 --> 00:03:00,822
Maybe... we can disguise ourselves as Xuanjing Palace soldiers.

31
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:02,788
The guards of Xuanjing Palace are all from the same battalion.

32
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:06,700
So how could they not know each other?

33
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,680
You're right. I didn't think too much into it.

34
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:12,920
You're still doing it, right?

35
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,060
A'Qin! A'Qin!

36
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:22,620
Prince Sen Yu, what's the matter?

37
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,700
A'Qin.

38
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,860
Please take the token back.

39
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:31,333
As I've returned the military token,

40
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,540
it means I want to leave.

41
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,522
From now on, things of Xuanjing Palace are none of my business.

42
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:40,540
As you are nobility, are you going to force me to stay?

43
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,380
You know I hate parting with you.

44
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,280
But why do you still do so?

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,020
A'Qin,

46
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,420
can't you stay with me anymore?

47
00:03:57,788 --> 00:03:59,520
Xiaoli.

48
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:07,960
Xiaoli, why did you come out?

49
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,620
Your immortal soul is unstable so what would happen if you caught a cold?

50
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,240
A'Qin.

51
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:25,460
A'Qin.

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,300
Don't leave me, okay?

53
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,577
 This is Prince Sen Yu. 

54
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:34,700
The rules of the Demon Clan are based on power.

55
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,944
If you refuse to let me off, then let's fight.

56
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:43,277
If I win, no one of Xuanjing Palace can stop me.

57
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,680
A'Qin, don't be mischievous.

58
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:06,480
Sir, just baked melon seeds.

59
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:16,840
Walnut flavor melon seeds from Dibei City are the most delicious. Totally unforgettable.

60
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,722
If the female immortals see what you're like now,

61
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:22,780
I don't know how long they'd cry.

62
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:25,920
Can't I enjoy eating melon seeds?

63
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,680
Too ordinary.

64
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,959
I eat whole grains and I am an ordinary person.

65
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,288
And only a True God is an inediate.

66
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:34,644
Poor immortals.

67
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:38,300
They thought you were an elegant and uncommon immortal.

68
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,900
They've wasted time and emotions.

69
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,500
It's all the fault of my face.

70
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,260
It's too elegant to be normal.

71
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,240
Forget it. I already knew you weren't pretending.

72
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,500
He's Sen Yu, the second prince of the Demon Clan.

73
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,040
The woman is the young master of the Fox Clan, Chang Qin.

74
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,440
They used to be lovers

75
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,660
and were engaged to each other thousands of years ago.

76
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,420
Then, why are they fighting?

77
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,780
It's relevant to the war between the immortals and demons.

78
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,155
That year, Sen Yu was heavily injured and he was saved by a fox.

79
00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:17,622
The fox gave him her demon elixir.

80
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:20,380
Since then, she hasn't been able to turn back into a human.

81
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,800
Then Sen Yu brought her back to Xuanjing Palace to look after her

82
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,060
and promised to protect her forever.

83
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,300
The young master of the Fox Clan is prideful.

84
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,700
How can she stand such an insult?

85
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,540
In a fit of anger, she broke the engagement between two people,

86
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,920
and only wants to leave this Triple Heaven of the Demon clan and return to the Fox Clan.

87
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,320
Fate gathering and dispersing is so common,

88
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,100
why is it so entangled?

89
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:50,300
The Lord of the North Sea's words sound a bit hypocritical.

90
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,540
Sen Yu is a male.

91
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,880
Which man in this world doesn't want to sit back and enjoy the blessings of everyone?

92
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,700
Yes. The one in front of you.

93
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,600
Blame me for talking too much.

94
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:10,500
- Lord Qing Mu. 
 - Call me Qing Mu.

95
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,020
Qing Mu, why do you have a demon power in your body?

96
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,655
If you don't want to say it, don't say it.

97
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:18,988
Our Qingchi Palace acts fairly to both immortals and demons.

98
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:21,000
I see this, there must be a secret.  I won't look down upon you

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,440
or tell your secret to the immortals.

100
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,620
I have no secrets to you.

101
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,540
My demon power has existed since I can remember.

102
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,588
It won't show up typically. It'll lose control only when I exert strong power.

103
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,580
The coexistence of both immortal and demon powers in the body.

104
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,420
I've never heard it before.

105
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,000
That's it.

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,940
So I want to find Bo Xuan as soon as possible and ask him about my background.

107
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,340
It's weird.

108
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,877
They should have equal abilities.

109
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:10,380
Why has Sen Yu improved a lot?

110
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,400
No. Chang Qin should have slipped back.

111
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,460
Her spiritual power can't control such moves at all.

112
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,020
Did you get hurt?

113
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,380
A'Qin!

114
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,844
You know that Xiaoli is weak.

115
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:36,220
- So I have to... 
 - I don't care... about your business.

116
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:41,140
Without my word, no one will dare allow you to leave Triple Heaven.

117
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:52,580
 Prince Sen Yu. 

118
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,580
She's so troublesome.

119
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,155
As she's weak, why doesn't she stay in the palace and find a doctor to take care of it?

120
00:08:58,155 --> 00:09:00,460
Why did she come here to make trouble?

121
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,800
What did you say?

122
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,480
- She's troublesome? 
 - Last sentence.

123
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,380
I've found a way to enter Xuanjing Palace.

124
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:14,420
What's this?

125
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:19,200
Knowing that the young lady is weak, how dare you let her run out of the palace?

126
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,444
I asked you to find doctors yesterday.

127
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:23,540
Where are the doctors?

128
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,066
 Your Second Highness, forgive us of our sins. 

129
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm a doctor!

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,280
- What are you going to do? 
 - I know what to do.

131
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:33,760
Your Second Highness.

132
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,420
I'm Bei Chi from the Fox Clan.

133
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,140
I'm good at curing fox diseases.

134
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,688
As you're worried about Miss Xiaoli,

135
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:43,720
let me try to help you.

136
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:52,900
You're from Secluded Mountain.

137
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,400
From which clan?

138
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,160
I'm from the Silver Fox Clan.

139
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,300
My teacher is Senior Chang Mei.

140
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,922
He's my assistant, Nan Mu.

141
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:03,620
He's just transformed into a human. A hybrid fox.

142
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,311
Senior Chang Mei's student...

143
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,244
So you must have excellent skills.

144
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:11,633
Come on.

145
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,680
Please diagnose her.

146
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,600
 Fortunately, Feng Ran taught me some anecdotes and miscellaneous stories every day. 

147
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,022
 She not only taught me about Sen Yu and Chang Qin, 

148
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:23,780
 but also knowledge about the three realms. 

149
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,060
 She didn't even touch it.  Amazing. 

150
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,960
 The Recovery Pill is useless to me 

151
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,260
 but it benefits the fox. 

152
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,580
You're a professional!

153
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,440
You're definitely Senior Chang Mei's brilliant student.

154
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,820
What about inviting you to Xuanjing Palace to dine?

155
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:52,788
This is not good. My teacher asked me to travel all over the world.

156
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:55,044
How could I go and disturb you?

157
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:56,488
That's right, Master Bei Chi.

158
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:59,310
Senior Ping Hui from Flood Dragon Clan is waiting for us.

159
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,720
We have no time to stay here.

160
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,480
You can cure even flood dragons? You're so powerful.

161
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,720
Join me. I'll treat you as my honored guest.

162
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,477
It's fine. Senior Ping Hui has my pill and should be fine now.

163
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:23,080
As Miss Xiaoli has an old illness, it's more urgent to heal her.

164
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Fine. We'll stay in your palace for a few days to diagnose and treat her.

165
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,688
Great. This way, please.

166
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:37,520
My good student. Hold my medical kit and follow my steps.

167
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:07,244
 The Xuanjing Palace is prohibited everywhere. 

168
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:11,144
 Demon Lord Zi Yue is noble and we don't know where he lives. 

169
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:17,640
 Little Master Bei Chi, how is Xiaoli? 

170
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,200
Please be at ease. I'm curing her now.

171
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,180
Hou Chi!

172
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,077
She's lost her elixir and has no power to maintain her immortal soul.

173
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:35,200
Even if the Heavenly King were to come, he might not be able to cure her. Can you do this?

174
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,555
Though I have poor power, I know something interesting.

175
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:43,133
If something happens, you must find an excuse to leave first. I'll take the blame.

176
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:46,880
Pay attention to yourself first. Don't give yourself away.

177
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,240
Take care of yourself well first.

178
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:52,455
 Little Master, how's her condition? 

179
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,580
Please be patient, Your Second Highness.

180
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:09,520
Xiaoli!

181
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,230
- Xiaoli! 
 - Your Highness...

182
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,320
You're now a human.

183
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,160
- I... 
 - She's lost her elixir

184
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,000
so it's hard for her to be a human.

185
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,340
My acupuncture can maintain her human shape only for a few days.

186
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:30,619
But please be at ease.

187
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:33,700
Though it's hard to cure her old illness,

188
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,488
as I've learned a lot about this kind of disease.

189
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:38,400
As long as I give needles for another three days,

190
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,366
Miss Xiaoli can reunite with her spiritual powers into her body.

191
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:44,880
Then she can recover her human shape.

192
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,155
Really?

193
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:48,580
Thank you, Master Bei Chi.

194
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,811
Servants, bring her to change clothes and set up a banquet.

195
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,080
I want to entertain her well.

196
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,980
No!

197
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,033
She's not good at drinking. You don't need to do so.

198
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,400
Your assistant is quite impolite.

199
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,955
I'm talking to your master so why do you disturb me?

200
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:09,177
You're right. It's my first time to be here.

201
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:13,688
I've admired Xuanjing Palace for a long time and I want to learn many things from you.

202
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:15,088
Master...

203
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:18,822
Please ask the servants to bring him to his room.

204
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:21,144
Don't let him make trouble.

205
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:23,120
Little Master, please rest assured.

206
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,020
Demons really know how to enjoy life.

207
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:02,377
Come on. Thank you for saving Xiaoli.

208
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:04,840
Let me drink a toast to you.

209
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,400
It's no bother. You don't need to mind it.

210
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:18,777
I really appreciate your deep affection for her.

211
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:20,400
I used to live in Secluded Mountain for years.

212
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,479
I'd never thought Xuanjing Palace would be such a brilliant place.

213
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,939
Especially when I first came here.

214
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:29,880
That round purple moon is more resplendent and hangs higher than other places.

215
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,159
As you may not know,

216
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,900
Demon Lord Zi Yue is now living here.

217
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,111
His power manifests the purple moon.

218
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:42,220
So it's different from other places.

219
00:15:43,522 --> 00:15:46,960
So when did Demon Lord Zi Yue come here?

220
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,240
I'm afraid it should be 10 thousand years ago.

221
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,020
10 thousand years.

222
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:56,288
Your Second Highness,

223
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,688
I've admired him for a long time

224
00:15:58,688 --> 00:16:01,480
so could I have a chance to meet him?

225
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:08,300
I'm afraid the Little Master will be disappointed.

226
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,060
He's withdrawn and always wears a mask,

227
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,300
living beside the Purple Moon Spring behind the palace.

228
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,679
He never meets strangers.

229
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,500
It's rare for me to meet him either.

230
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:26,920
Withdrawn... Wears a mask...

231
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,140
He's come for 10 thousand years...

232
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,666
It's like Bo Xuan more and more.

233
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,933
What did you say?

234
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:35,920
Nothing.

235
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,122
Your Second Highness, let me drink another toast to you.

236
00:16:40,122 --> 00:16:43,077
Little Master, are you okay? Please drink slow.

237
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:59,000
Unfortunately, Qing Mu is not here.

238
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,420
He couldn't see the beautiful views here.

239
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:06,900
What's wrong with me?

240
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,020
Why do I miss him?

241
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,280
Little Master, are you drunk?

242
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:24,860
Fine. Let's continue.

243
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,022
- Sir, you haven't come here for a while. 
 - Let's go.

244
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:35,140
Come on. Let's cheer!

245
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,660
Let me fill the cup for you.

246
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,060
Prince Jing Jian, one more, please.

247
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:56,080
No... I can't drink...

248
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,880
I can't drink too much...

249
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,600
It's good not to drink more.

250
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,780
Anyway, you must drink it.

251
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,120
You won't let me lose face, will you?

252
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,719
Oh, please... I can't drink...

253
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:14,160
Come on. Drink it.

254
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:17,100
Let's continue.

255
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:28,000
Young boy, when I was the master of the Swamp of Netherhill, you didn't know where to play.

256
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,340
Wait. Didn't you get drunk?

257
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:39,877
Where are you going?

258
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:42,380
Lord Feng Ran.

259
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,520
I...

260
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,320
Aren't we going to leave till we get drunk?

261
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:53,340
- I... 
 - Come on...

262
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,680
- Let's continue... 
 - Drink? Let me go!

263
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:12,844
Spirit Lock?

264
00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:16,466
How dare you do so? Untie it!

265
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:19,140
Jing Jian!

266
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,500
Jing Jian, untie me!

267
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:43,355
I'm here worrying about her. What about her?

268
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:45,522
All the gods and demons seem to be her family.

269
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:47,740
She can be familiar with everyone!

270
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,900
What time is it now? Why hasn't she come back?

271
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,460
 Master! Be careful! 

272
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,299
 Please slow down. Don't fall down! 

273
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:03,133
The wines of Xuanjing Palace are so delicious!

274
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:04,280
Be careful!

275
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,640
They are more intoxicating than the wines in the palace.

276
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,740
Master Bei Chi, you're back.

277
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:20,770
- Lord Qing Mu, why don't you go to the Heavenly Palace to find your lover? 
 - The Heavenly Palace?

278
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,233
Why do you come to my dream?

279
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,755
Master, you're drunk. What lovers in the Heavenly Palace?

280
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:27,500
Don't trust story scripts.

281
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:32,599
Actually, you're so handsome.

282
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,660
If Jing Zhao wasn't already in love with you,

283
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,430
I'd wait for you. Waiting for you would be different.

284
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,822
You're drunk.

285
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,430
- Let me send you back. 
 - I'm not drunk.

286
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,880
No. You are.

287
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,480
Wait...

288
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,199
Master Bei Chi!

289
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:48,820
Don't disturb them.

290
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,988
As her assistant is so handsome, I think we shouldn't stay here to bother them.

291
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:09,480
Give me five more pots, please.

292
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:13,520
How can a girl drink so much outside?

293
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:16,460
What if you expose your identity?

294
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,100
If you really meet a bad guy,

295
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,044
you'd have been ruined by him!

296
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:27,200
If you still want to drink later on, you must stay with me.

297
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,800
Did you hear me?

298
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:00,740
Don't annoy her.

299
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:48,544
 Shang Gu has changed a lot. 

300
00:22:48,544 --> 00:22:51,280
 She won't play with you everywhere. 

301
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,140
 Why are you here? 

302
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,366
 Shang Gu has been unhappy since she came back from the Netherworld. 

303
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:57,080
 I want to make her happy. 

304
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,360
 She's so ungrateful. 

305
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,560
 You should have predicted it since you invite Master Bai Jue to come back. 

306
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,400
 Hold on a second. Why do you call him "Master" 

307
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:07,940
 and call me without a title? 

308
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,220
 Sometimes, you'll call my name. 

309
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,520
 Do you need to show your power by calling your title? 

310
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:16,744
 Of course not. 

311
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:19,580
 I'm handsome and charming. Everyone likes me. 

312
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,760
 I don't need these bubble reputations. 

313
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,060
 So why did you ask it? 

314
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,840
 We're estranged from Bai Jue because we fear him. 

315
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,311
 You're not the same. 

316
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:31,388
 We've grown up together. 

317
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:35,400
 As for me, you're not a superior True God. 

318
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,260
 You're my trusted friend. 

319
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:43,600
 You're so considerate. 

320
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,720
 Of course, my qualities surpass his over thousands times. 

321
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
 Is it for Shang Gu? 

322
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,222
 Too long. Not fresh. 

323
00:23:58,222 --> 00:24:00,430
 Let me bring you to pick the most beautiful flower in the world. 

324
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,840
 - Really? 
 - Let's go. 

325
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:14,900
 It's so depressing here. 

326
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,259
 Driving winds by divine power will damage the spiritual aura here. 

327
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:22,340
 But we've seen no flower after walking for three li. 

328
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,480
 Are you fooling me? 

329
00:24:25,288 --> 00:24:26,800
 You may not know that. 

330
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,455
 Although this Demon Clan's southern land will be full of demon flowers, 

331
00:24:29,455 --> 00:24:33,550
 but what is really precious is what grows on the cliffs of the northern land. 

332
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,866
 It's called Purple Velvet Flower. 

333
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:36,820
 - Purple Velvet Flower? 
 - That's it. 

334
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,200
 It's barbed and hard to get. 

335
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,433
 It contains the best wishes 

336
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:44,000
 but its temperament is cold and arrogant. 

337
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,920
 I'm eager to get it. 

338
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,780
 Bring me there at once. It's the perfect gift for Shang Gu. 

339
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,940
 Aren't you tired of walking three li? 

340
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,460
 I can walk another three li. 

341
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,200
 We'll soon arrive. 

342
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,600
 Help! Anyone's here? 

343
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,320
 Let's go take a look. 

344
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:09,440
 Help! Can anyone save me? 

345
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:19,988
 Thank you, sister. 

346
00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:21,460
 I'm Sen Jian, from the Tiger Clan. 

347
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,440
 I thought to pick the flower during the day 

348
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,944
 but I fell down from the cliff accidentally. 

349
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:28,611
 Do things based on your capability. 

350
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,488
 Don't take risks later on. Understand? 

351
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,877
 I'll keep it in mind. 

352
00:25:32,877 --> 00:25:34,188
 We can leave. 

353
00:25:34,188 --> 00:25:36,500
 Our effort is in vain. 

354
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,280
 What do you mean? 

355
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:42,860
 Are we here for the flower in his hands? 

356
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,488
 Forget it. Shang Gu has seen numerous good things. 

357
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:51,880
 She could know our minds. 

358
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,855
 Let's go back. 

359
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,640
 Goddess. 

360
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,677
 My mom said I should repay others for their favors. 

361
00:25:57,677 --> 00:25:59,944
 Do you have anything that has not been completed? 

362
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:02,780
 Then give me the flower. 

363
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,033
 God, what else can I do for you? 

364
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:07,840
 I dare to complete it even if it's dangerous. 

365
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,940
 But I can't give you the flower... 

366
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,740
 I think you just want to say something to repay us. 

367
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,880
 God, you may not know it. 

368
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,755
 My mother stays in bed all year around. 

369
00:26:18,755 --> 00:26:20,499
 I could do nothing for her 

370
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:23,460
 but to get the flower for her to wish her well. 

371
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,900
 I really want to repay you. I'm not kidding. 

372
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,888
 If you tell me your names, 

373
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:33,420
 I'll cultivate to become a lord to repay you. 

374
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,800
 You young tiger. 

375
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,340
 You're quite the arrogant one. 

376
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,640
 God! 

377
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:46,988
 He looks pure. He's suitable to cultivate. 

378
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:48,800
 Shall I bring him back to be your sacred beast? 

379
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,266
 Don't! 

380
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:51,880
 Don't restrain him. 

381
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,711
 By the way, maybe it'll restrain me. 

382
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:59,322
 I don't like others following me to call me every day.  "Goddess this and Goddess that." 

383
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:00,611
 I knew you would say this. 

384
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:02,477
 Don't worry. As he's kind and filial, 

385
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:05,020
 I'll ask Zi Han to go and help him. 

386
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:07,600
 Master, you're a visionary. 

387
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,360
 I really admire you. 

388
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,120
 Are you laughing at me? 

389
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,900
 Fine. I'll go to Peach Blossom Forest to drink all your wines. 

390
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,350
 How dare you! They're for Shang Gu! 

391
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:35,040
Master, are you missing Goddess Yue Mi again?

392
00:27:38,377 --> 00:27:40,488
Please don't blame yourself too much.

393
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:43,340
- That year... 
 - Don't mention it.

394
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,180
My crimes can't be repaid by my whole life.

395
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,460
How am I qualified to...

396
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:54,880
miss Yue Mi?

397
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,140
I just think the purple moon tonight is so charming.

398
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,940
It'll be regrettable to drink nothing.

399
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:09,066
By the way, there is some news from the spies you sent out a few days ago.

400
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:12,955
They saw a lady who was very similar to Her Royal Highness in the area of Observation Mountain.

401
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:16,566
But they can't ascertain only by your painting.

402
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:19,488
Do they know her background?

403
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:22,480
They heard she's from Qingchi Palace.

404
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,933
Observation Mountain belongs to Bai Jue while Qingchi Palace is Gu Jun's.

405
00:28:29,744 --> 00:28:31,660
Interesting.

406
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,180
Her Royal Highness has great luck.

407
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,066
Even though she tackled the doom with her body, she would turn ill luck into good.

408
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:39,088
Maybe we can get her news soon.

409
00:28:39,088 --> 00:28:43,680
Zi Han, you've worked hard for 60 thousand years.

410
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,160
In the past, I asked you to find Shang Gu was because of my obsession.

411
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,720
She's the Chief God.

412
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:58,180
- Even though she disappeared, there should be signs for us to find her. 
 - I agree.

413
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,288
As long as you believe it, Her Royal Highness will come back to you.

414
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:07,840
Master, I really think she's alive.

415
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,840
Okay. You're right.

416
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,766
What do you mean? Have you sensed her?

417
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:17,480
No.

418
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,880
I just saw an immortal lordess who looked like Shang Gu.

419
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,760
Also, an immortal lord stayed next to her, similar to Bai Jue.

420
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,800
And now, they're in the Demon Realm.

421
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,877
Really?

422
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:39,620
It's the same as what you've just said.

423
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,380
The eclipse will be a bit weak tonight.

424
00:29:55,811 --> 00:30:00,900
Shang Gu, can we meet again?

425
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:21,160
Hou Chi!

426
00:30:29,488 --> 00:30:32,319
Hou Chi!

427
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:34,460
No!

428
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,820
Don't!

429
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:45,940
No. No!

430
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,340
   

431
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,060
Jing Jian, get up!

432
00:31:26,422 --> 00:31:28,940
What's the matter?

433
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,660
What else do you want to do?

434
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,340
Come out!

435
00:31:38,455 --> 00:31:40,620
Please be at ease.

436
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,844
I told you I couldn't drink yesterday,

437
00:31:42,844 --> 00:31:47,140
but because of your gracious hospitality is what made you and me drunk here.

438
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,580
- I was going to... 
 - To make me drunk?

439
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,560
To get rid of me?

440
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,000
So what?

441
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,133
You know I'm unwilling to be with you

442
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:00,233
but you still follow me all the time.

443
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:03,860
You're free but I'm not.

444
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,460
How dare you stick to me by the Spirit Lock?

445
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,640
None are good in the Heavenly Palace!

446
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,520
Please pardon me.

447
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:16,540
I did get drunk yesterday.

448
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,760
I don't remember when I used it.

449
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,000
- Shall I vow in the name of... 
 - Stop the nonsense! Let me go!

450
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,980
It's my Father God's treasure.

451
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,020
I don't know how to unlock it.

452
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,820
What did you say?

453
00:32:44,822 --> 00:32:46,780
Let me go!

454
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,911
You may not know that the treasure

455
00:32:53,911 --> 00:32:56,266
is made of Essence of Herb in the East Wilderness,

456
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,055
Spirit of Dark-steel from Western Heaven,

457
00:32:58,055 --> 00:33:00,655
Breath of Fire of the South and Vein of Cold Ice under the North Sea.

458
00:33:00,655 --> 00:33:02,660
Merge them by methods of the God Realm.

459
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,640
No one in the world can melt or untie it.

460
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:11,200
As long as we're tied together, we'll be together generation after generation.

461
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,640
Jing Jian!

462
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,220
I shouldn't have drunk so much last night.

463
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,240
The demon maids are so sweet.

464
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,920
It's you. Where's Qing Mu?

465
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,444
Demons enjoy eating meats.

466
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:17,400
The vegetarian steamed stuffed buns...

467
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,740
Did Qing Mu cook these for me?

468
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,120
So promising.

469
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:39,240
He's not faking it. Is he being serious?

470
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,940
It's really nice to be a master.

471
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,940
He asked me to wait for him here?

472
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,540
What tricks does he want to play?

473
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,560
Shall we go out for a walk after I'm full?

474
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,720
If you refuse, I'll go myself.

475
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,780
I don't know whether she likes the buns or not.

476
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,500
But I'm sure she will like the peach blossom wine.

477
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,480
Hou Chi. Hou...

478
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,940
Where's Hou Chi?

479
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,060
She acts alone and didn't wait for me again!

480
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,080
Master.

481
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,133
She's from the Silver Fox Clan. Senior Chang Mei's student.

482
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:55,140
Her name is Bei Chi.

483
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,860
Have you seen her face?

484
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,766
I dared not to show up without your permission.

485
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:06,460
When I showed the soldier the painting,

486
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,133
he also said they were similar.

487
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:12,700
Bei Chi.

488
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,588
- What about the other? 
 - He's her assistant.

489
00:36:15,588 --> 00:36:16,544
Assistant?

490
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:20,000
A hybrid fox. He's called Nan Mu.

491
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,660
Bei Chi. Nan Mu.

492
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,340
Must be their fake names.

493
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,200
Bei Chi joined Sen Yu's feast alone yesterday,

494
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,177
leaving him alone in the room to have congee.

495
00:36:31,177 --> 00:36:36,020
Nice cooperation. They must have known each other for a while.

496
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,560
Master, why did they disguise to be doctors to come here?

497
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,020
What do they want?

498
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,500
What else can they want?

499
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,700
Do they want to approach me?

500
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,759
Master, I don't want to pour cold water on you but...

501
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:58,555
But you haven't sensed their power, right?

502
00:36:58,555 --> 00:37:02,077
Yes. If she's Her Royal Highness and he's Master Bai Jue,

503
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:05,600
Xuanjing Palace should be flooded with enormous power.

504
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,240
Not only you,

505
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,480
but also I fail to sense their power.

506
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,520
But it won't be a coincidence.

507
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,320
Do you have any plans?

508
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:22,055
We'll know the result today.

509
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:23,988
 This way. 

510
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:26,280
 I haven't drunk freely for so long. 

511
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,100
I have to tell you something first.

512
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,380
Sen Yu has a vendetta against me for killing his brother.

513
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,866
If you want to go there with me, I won't be responsible for what you meet.

514
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:47,860
Please be at ease. I'll try my best to solve everything.

515
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,400
Then let me see what you can do.

516
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,200
 How excellent the sword is! 

517
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,580
 Obviously! 

518
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,940
 I've stolen half of the treasures of the Fox Clan 

519
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,480
 and found a famous craftsman to forge it. 

520
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,540
 It should be superb. 

521
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,755
 As you've stolen from your family, 

522
00:38:39,755 --> 00:38:41,944
 will your big brother come to catch you back? 

523
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:46,677
 I've left him a letter telling him that I'm going to marry and I'm not going back. 

524
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:54,000
 A'Qin, are you promising to marry me? 

525
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:07,477
 A'Qin! Let's get married after I come back from the battlefield. 

526
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,940
A'Qin.

527
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:44,340
How did we get to where we are today?

528
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,880
Your Highness, are you missing Sister Qin again?

529
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,460
The famous doctor from the Fox Clan has superb medical skills.

530
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,440
You'll be restored after several days.

531
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,580
Then you can practice and get your demon elixir again.

532
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,580
All your sufferings will come to an end.

533
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,220
Your Highness, are you really going to abandon me?

534
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,120
How could I do so?

535
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,800
I remember your help so I must repay you for your kindness.

536
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,880
This place is heavily guarded.

537
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,140
I don't have enough spiritual power to sneak in.

538
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:38,811
But if I miss such a good chance, I might not find another one to get into the Purple Moon Spring.

539
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:56,260


540
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,960
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

541
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:12,960
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

542
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,420
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

543
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:25,480
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

544
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:32,460
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

545
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:38,940
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

546
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:46,260
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

547
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:53,720
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

548
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:10,020
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

549
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:16,500
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

550
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:23,680
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

551
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:31,180
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

552
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:38,860
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

553
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:45,740
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

554
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:52,200
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

555
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,770
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

556
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:10,750
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
