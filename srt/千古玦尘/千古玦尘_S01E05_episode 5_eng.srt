1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:12,070


2
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:21,450
   

3
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,180
   

4
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,890
I just saw that...

5
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:35,209
Ancestral God was really hard on you when you were little.

6
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,969
I'm used to it.

7
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:40,649
I didn't like getting along with others, and I won't in the future.

8
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:50,409
What are you doing?

9
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,690
Don't try to shake me off. I'm still wounded.

10
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:04,200
Bai Jue, in this world, there are not only indifferent and fearful people.

11
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:08,628
People should be kind and warm to each other.

12
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,309
From now on, I'll always accompany you;

13
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:16,030
accompanying you to practice, read, and drink.

14
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,709
When the weather is fine, we can go out to fly kites.

15
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:25,050
I won't leave you alone anymore.

16
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,450
 ♫ But I still miss you so much ♫ 

17
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:34,449
 ♫ What's in my mind is what I can't get over ♫ 

18
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,800
 ♫ Time goes by, how many chances can tie us together ♫ 

19
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,149
 ♫ It's a long journey, about a thousand years ♫ 

20
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,750
 ♫ I can summon clouds and mist ♫ 

21
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,749
 ♫ But I can't pray for an endless love ♫ 

22
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,900
 ♫ It's dreamlike and aimless ♫ 

23
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,250
 ♫ For one single glance at you ♫ 

24
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:02,200
 ♫ I don't regret cultivating myself, even if I have to live alone ♫ 

25
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:13,450
 ♫ I want to protect our love ♫ 

26
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:16,669
I'll be over.

27
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,340
When Zhi Yang comes back tomorrow,

28
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,389
I'm afraid that I'll be sent to the Lower Realm for many years and will not be able to come back.

29
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,128
So what? I'll take the wine to visit you.

30
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,550
You know nothing.

31
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,208
Am I afraid of having no wine to drink? I'm afraid that I can't see Shang Gu.

32
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,129
Then I will not go and see you, so you won't even get wine to drink.

33
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:40,030
Yue Mi, I didn't mean that.

34
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,230
Of course, you're also important to me.

35
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,889
Think of it.

36
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:47,249
My fame has been kept for 10,000 years.

37
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:49,389
I'm going to be with Shang Gu soon,

38
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,568
how could it be ruined by these two people? Right?

39
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:54,210
Sorry.

40
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,629
It's my own fault, so I'll take the blame myself tomorrow.

41
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,329
Really?

42
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,529
Of course.

43
00:04:03,529 --> 00:04:04,969
Good brother.

44
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:08,089
Then you stay here and I'll go to check Shang Gu.

45
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,108
Little Guang, I miss you. Where are you?

46
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:17,328
- Little Ye. 
 - Little Guang.

47
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,728
- Little Ye. 
 - Little Guang.

48
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,350
- Little Ye. 
 - Little Guang.

49
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,090
Little Guang.

50
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,109
- Little Guang. 
 - Little Ye.

51
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,748
When did Pu Hua's marriage string become so effective?

52
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:32,149
Even a True God can't get a grip on it.

53
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,508
Yue Mi, hold on.

54
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:34,829
I can't.

55
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,429
- Little Ye. 
 - Little Guang.

56
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,228
Why is his force so strong?

57
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:41,168
Little Ye, come here.

58
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,069
The God Realm will finally have a happy event.

59
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,469
What?

60
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:57,589
Master Bai Jue, why is it you? Why are you here?

61
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:02,149
I didn't even know that you had such a blessed place.

62
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:03,709
Master, please forgive me.

63
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,909
Yesterday, the sun and the moon were both dark and I was too far away,

64
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:09,050
so I really didn't see clearly.

65
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,630
So were you the one who entered the secret room yesterday?

66
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,570
The female god who came in with you…

67
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:18,409
Was this place set for Tian Qi?

68
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,890
It was indeed Master Tian Qi

69
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,770
who asked me to set up the room.

70
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,748
But he didn't come yesterday, you came in.

71
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:31,628
I really don't know the reason.

72
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:33,770
Why did he arrange this?

73
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,788
Of course, for his marriage with Little Master God.

74
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:43,570
He and Little Master God have always been close.

75
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,709
Now Little Master God has grown up,

76
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:52,149
so Master Tian Qi is always thinking about how to marry her.

77
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:54,308
He even asked me to pull the marriage string for them.

78
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:56,968
- Did you do that? 
 - Yes. But it didn't work.

79
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:00,010
How can I pull the marriage strings of the God Realm?

80
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,508
As soon as I pulled it, the string broke. That's strange.

81
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:06,068
The turmoil yesterday…

82
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:10,050
Did I even mistake Little Master God?

83
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,929
You could even mistake me and Tian Qi who are so different, not to mention Shang Gu.

84
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:16,450
Yes. It's all my fault.

85
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,709
The marriage string of a True God is not something that you can hold.

86
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:20,149
So don't do such things in the future.

87
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,969
Shang Gu is a Chief God, who is responsible for the whole world.

88
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:25,669
How can her marriage be arranged casually?

89
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,089
It was a little reckless of Tian Qi to do that.

90
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:32,310
Master Bai Jue, you're right.

91
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,949
This time I really didn't think carefully.

92
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:40,188
I promise that from now on, I won't arrange any marriage for Little Master God.

93
00:06:40,188 --> 00:06:42,870
Let her be a bachelorette for 100,000 years.

94
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,949
Master Bai Jue, then yesterday…

95
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,389
Nothing happened yesterday.

96
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,028
I'm really getting old and confused.

97
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:56,349
After the banquet yesterday,

98
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:00,908
I just went back to my cave to rest early.

99
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:02,490
Right?

100
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:04,490
You just leave.

101
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,989
Yes, I'll leave.

102
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,009
I'll leave.

103
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,669
I wasn't dreaming, was I?

104
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,748
You're not dreaming.

105
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:37,770
True God Bai Jue is really holding a female god.

106
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,129
Oh my god!

107
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,949
- Who is that female god? 
 - I don't know.

108
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:49,189
Dear Ancestral God, our God Realm is going to have some big gossip.

109
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,389
God Sun and God Night, after you two fell in love,

110
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:03,770
regardless of the laws of Heaven and Earth, privately going to the Lower Realm,

111
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,409
causing the disaster of turning the day and night upside down.

112
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:08,028
Do you know your sin?

113
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,449
Master, it's all my fault.

114
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,668
Yesterday, it was I who forced God Sun to the Lower Realm, so we made a mortal mistake.

115
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:16,468
If you're going to punish anyone, I'm willing to bear it all.

116
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:18,930
Please don't blame God Sun.

117
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,328
Master Zhi Yang, yesterday it was I who forced God Night to the Lower Realm. It's all my fault.

118
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:24,970
Please don't punish Xun Ye.

119
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,788
No, I couldn't help myself so I made a huge blunder.

120
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,669
Everything has nothing to do with God Sun.

121
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,649
Xun Ye...

122
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:34,408
God Sun. God Night. Pu Hua has untied the marriage string for you,

123
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:38,510
so did you really fall in love with each other?

124
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:44,829
It began with a misunderstanding, getting stuck as acquaintances, then becoming loyal to the depth of love.

125
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:46,010
Me too.

126
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,209
Enough! No matter what reasons you have,

127
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:52,608
you are wrong! I'll punish you heavily.

128
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:55,508
Master, what's wrong with liking someone?

129
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:58,229
What rule does it say they can't be together?

130
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,108
Nonsense! You've been in the God Realm for a long time.

131
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:05,149
It's a natural rule that day and night can't be performed at the same time.

132
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:08,229
Three-year-old children know it. Is there any need to write it in the rules?

133
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:09,949
It's not their fault anyway.

134
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,108
Yesterday, it's me who carelessly threw the marriage string of Pu Hua on them,

135
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:16,390
which caused them to go down to the realm regardless of their duties.

136
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,289
I am also wrong. I should not have held the matchmaking event.

137
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:23,229
Pu Hua, you have no fault.

138
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,649
You were just acting on the orders of Tian Qi.

139
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,128
But you, Yue Mi, I don't care about your usual nonsense,

140
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:31,710
can't you tell the importance of this matter?

141
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:41,050
- Yue Mi, when will you change the problem of taking everything upon yourself? 
 - Tian Qi.

142
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:44,908
I am a man, I shall be responsible for what I did.

143
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,728
I just drank some wine and threw a marriage string on them.

144
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:51,910
Just punish me as the rule.

145
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,260
Master Tian Qi, you're a True God.

146
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,340
Why do you take the blame for Yue Mi?

147
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,428
And the marriage string is obviously her…

148
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:01,670
What hers?

149
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,789
That's what I prepared for Shang Gu and me. Can't I?

150
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:06,589
Nonsense!

151
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,810
What are you doing?

152
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,008
Even if you held the matchmaking event without telling me, now you're saying such ridiculous things.

153
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:14,108
The marriage string is yours, right?

154
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:17,868
Fine. You made the chaos of day and night, so get youself grounded in the hall.

155
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,009
When you know you are wrong, then come out again.

156
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:22,949
Why? It's just a piece of string.

157
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,189
You've been lonely for so many years, why won't you allow others to find love?

158
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:29,049
Shut up! Take him away!

159
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:30,188
Master Zhi Yang.

160
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:31,890
No need!

161
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,150
I'll go myself.

162
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,769
Wasn't I in the secret room of Peach Woods?

163
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,930
How did I come back?

164
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,250
Master Bai Jue carried you back.

165
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,289
Was my sleeping position beautiful?

166
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,108
Did I snore and drool?

167
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:16,010
A little.

168
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,409
Did anyone see that?

169
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:27,450
Everyone saw that.

170
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:31,150
Oh, no. It's terrible.

171
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,308
The goddesses will beat me up when they see me, and some of them may even kill me.

172
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:41,309
Then when I go to practice in Abyss Hall, should I pick a time when no one is around?

173
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,669
Why are you laughing?

174
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,068
Am I not as beautiful as other goddesses?

175
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:49,490
You are the most beautiful.

176
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:51,948
- You may leave. 
 - Yes.

177
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,490
What should I wear to class tomorrow?

178
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,849
Wear my red dress? Or that green one?

179
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,769
 Who was he holding? 

180
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:23,988
 Which goddess is she? 

181
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:26,050
Come on. Place your bet.

182
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,409
Let's see which goddess was the one that touched the heart of our Master Bai Jue yesterday.

183
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:32,849
Come on. Place your bets.

184
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,470
How dare you make jokes about Master?

185
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,229
Master Bai Jue.

186
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,810
Master, how should we punish them?

187
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,549
What's the situation?

188
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,010
Which one do they think I like?

189
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,428
   

190
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:53,349
The cute one.

191
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,850
Why?

192
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,468
Maybe the yin and the yang are in harmony, and she complements you.

193
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,668
It turns out that I am so cold in your heart.

194
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:08,349
Sorry for my words.

195
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,470
It's okay. I'm too serious.

196
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,109
 The dress. 

197
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,710
It's her.

198
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,549
Master Bai Jue actually cares about her.

199
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,589
What a terrible day.

200
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,909
I'm asking for such big trouble.

201
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,929
I'll never care about the things of gods again.

202
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:53,149
Maybe I'd better just close the Marriage Temple.

203
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,769
Right, I'll go in seclusion for 200 years to avoid trouble.

204
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,369
Pu Hua.

205
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:00,290
Your Royal Highness.

206
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,109
Please get up.

207
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,529
You're in charge of marriage in the three realms, so you should know the most about love. Right?

208
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:13,708
Listening to you say that, do you want to know what love is?

209
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,330
Yes, what exactly is love?

210
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,150
The story scripts always say that true love is only when you can die for someone.

211
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:24,949
Then tell me, is it not true love without death?

212
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,789
Your Royal Highness, you shouldn't ask me about that.

213
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,489
Even you don't know that.

214
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:33,549
No wonder there are so many smitten men and women in the Lower Realm.

215
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,869
No. Love is very difficult to understand.

216
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:41,609
You don't know and I don't know, and those who are trapped in love don't even know.

217
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:45,199
So there is the phrase that love has an unknown beginning, and yet it grows ever deeper.

218
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,450
Then how can I judge...

219
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,908
Your Royal Highness, are you trying to figure out who you like in your heart?

220
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:55,229
Right.

221
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,010
Your Highness, if you ask like this,

222
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,810
I'm afraid that you've already fallen in love with someone.

223
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,428
Don't talk nonsense. I'm just curious.

224
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:09,649
Your Highness, if you really want to know who the person you like is,

225
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:13,050
you can feel it with your heart.

226
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,009
Feel? What?

227
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:18,670
Who you are thinking, hoping, and expecting

228
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,170
is the one that you love.

229
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,890
 You are considerate, gentle, 

230
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,990
 generous, and beautiful; 

231
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:34,189
 of course, you are one of the best in the three realms. 

232
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,209
Your Highness, I have to warn you that

233
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,548
love is just like this pot of wine.

234
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:45,020
When you first drink it, it is refreshing,

235
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,469
but if it is strong, it'll entangle your heart.

236
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,669
Your Highness, you must be careful.

237
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:03,769
Entangle my heart.

238
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,289
Does he attract a lot of goddesses?

239
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:10,150
And I am not as good as anyone?

240
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:25,208
The stars tonight are extraordinarily bright, not worse than watching them on the Observation Mountain.

241
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,430
Why are you here?

242
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:53,289
I was afraid you would feel lonely in the hall, so I came to visit and chat with you.

243
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:54,850
Are you drunk?

244
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,909
Today, I was in the mood, so I had a few drinks.

245
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:02,370
Sit down, let me sober you up.

246
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:22,500
 ♫ I really want to know where you are now ♫ 

247
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:29,150
 ♫ But the time tries to seal my memory ♫ 

248
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:35,650
 ♫ The affection in the eyes become wrinkles in the brows ♫ 

249
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:42,350
 ♫ The injury can't be seen ♫ 

250
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,709
 ♫ My dream is incomplete ♫ 

251
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,310
I was just thinking...

252
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:52,930
Are you looking cold because of your temper?

253
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,029
Or because you don't know what expression to show people,

254
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:59,209
so you just don't have any expression at all?

255
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:08,748
Do you remember that before you asked me,

256
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:12,269
why I gave all the credit for sealing Xuan Yi to you?

257
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,689
You finally want to say that.

258
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:21,068
How inferior you are, how conceited you are.

259
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,660
Now your sacred meridian is greatly opened and your power has increased,

260
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,510
so don't play those naughty tricks in the future.

261
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,469
I even feel tired because of you.

262
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,809
Do you still want to talk?

263
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,290
No, you're too good at talking.

264
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,410
Do you want to learn some new skills?

265
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:48,389
Besides cultivation, can't we do something else?

266
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,750
What do you mean?

267
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:53,709
For example…

268
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,410
Stars.

269
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,269
Look at the stars.

270
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,750
The stars are most beautiful on Observation Mountain,

271
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,330
but you've never taken me to see them.

272
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:24,650
If you want to see the stars, just go by yourself,

273
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,590
why do you need me to take you there?

274
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,830
I want you to take me to see them.

275
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,510
I know a place better than Observation Mountain.

276
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:05,849
This is Universe Pavilion,

277
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:08,189
where the Ancestral God sent down a warning.

278
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:11,028
Between Heaven and Earth, it is said that every 180,000 years,

279
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:12,668
a catastrophe will occur.

280
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:14,869
Only the Chief God of Chaos can

281
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:16,709
eliminate the catastrophe with divine power

282
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:19,188
and save living beings.

283
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:22,149
70,000 years ago, Ancestor God wanted to pass the throne to Xuan Yi,

284
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:24,909
but Xuan Yi lost control of his mind and became a devil,

285
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:28,210
which led to the catastrophe in Heaven and Earth.

286
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,989
I know all of these things.

287
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,028
Ancestor God left through the void,

288
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:34,368
leaving a breath of chaos on Universe Pavilion,

289
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:36,989
and I was born here thousands of years ago.

290
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,268
So I was born to inherit the will of Ancestor God

291
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:41,710
to keep Heaven and Earth stable.

292
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:49,900
So, Shang Gu, you hold the weight of the world and the most important responsibility than others with greater powers.

293
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,188
I will practice hard.

294
00:20:51,189 --> 00:20:53,149
I will work harder than you think,

295
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:57,168
as soon as possible to take charge of the instruction feather of Chief God as Chief God of Chaos.

296
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,669
Where's my compliment?

297
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:08,168
Don't keep a cold face every day.

298
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:10,648
When you look cold, I feel uncomfortable.

299
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:12,749
When I feel uncomfortable, I can't do well in my cultivation.

300
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:15,509
Then if I can't take up the post of Chief God of Chaos,

301
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,950
you say, then whose fault is it?

302
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,249
Nonsense.

303
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:30,300
 ♫ Time is like you, disturbing my feelings and thoughts ♫ 

304
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,149
 ♫ I hold your warm hands tightly ♫ 

305
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,649
 ♫ The meteor is shining in the sky ♫ 

306
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:44,349
 ♫ I can never forget the memories of you ♫ 

307
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:48,949
 ♫ I cherish the time to be with you ♫ 

308
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:52,028
 ♫ It's still vivid for me ♫ 

309
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:54,149
Do I have a painting on my face?

310
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,849
 ♫ When I meet you ♫ 

311
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,849
When you're sober, we'll go back.

312
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:02,549
 ♫ I hope we can be together forever ♫ 

313
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:05,200
 ♫ When we meet again ♫ 

314
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,940
 ♫ I'll travel with you without hesitation ♫ 

315
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 ♫ The feels. That distance. The small talk ♫ 

316
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,949
 ♫ Such good times and beautiful scenery ♫ 

317
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:36,650
 ♫ May you stay by my side ♫ 

318
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,629
What's wrong?

319
00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:32,769
Did you have a nightmare?

320
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:37,650
Or are you suddenly in a bad mood?

321
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,850
Nothing.

322
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,148
Did something happen again in the Netherworld?

323
00:23:56,149 --> 00:24:00,408
No. These days, has Universe Pavilion ever delivered warnings related to Shang Gu?

324
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:01,968
No.

325
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:03,449
Since Shang Gu was born,

326
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:05,709
Ancestral God hasn't shown a warning for many years.

327
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,659
Shang Gu bears a heavy burden,

328
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:10,629
which is related to the Power of Chaos and the people of the Lower Realm.

329
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,388
So there must not be any mistakes.

330
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:13,968
Issue a royal order tomorrow that

331
00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:17,128
no god is allowed to go to Universe Pavilion.

332
00:24:17,128 --> 00:24:19,809
Why? The warning of Ancestral God

333
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,349
must be known by all the gods at once.

334
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:24,208
Universe Pavilion is the cornerstone of the God Realm.

335
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,960
Although Xuan Yi has been sealed now, it still cannot be underestimated.

336
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,108
In order to avoid the return of the devils,

337
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:31,910
I will guard Universe Pavilion in the future.

338
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:36,729
All right. Tian Qi has become increasingly absurd recently.

339
00:24:36,729 --> 00:24:38,268
Since you have returned,

340
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,488
before Shang Gu takes up the post of Chief God of Chaos,

341
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:42,949
you should regain control of some affairs of the gods.

342
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:48,008
In order to avoid the disaster caused by God Sun and Night to happen again.

343
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:50,189
At first, I was only asked back to teach Shang Gu,

344
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:53,750
but now...

345
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,068
Don't worry.

346
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,870
When we're done, I'll send you back to Observation Mountain

347
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,349
to enjoy your leisure alone. Okay?

348
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,449
No need. I accept your arrangement.

349
00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:06,449
True God Bai Jue with a hard mouth but a soft heart is the most righteous one.

350
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,148
Why are you like this?

351
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:25,010
Isn't it just a few thunders?

352
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,969
The thunder torture of a True God,

353
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:31,190
even I can't stand it.

354
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,548
How could Zhi Yang do this to you?

355
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:37,028
It's me who let God Sun and Night fall in love, breaking the rules.

356
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:39,068
So it's me who should be punished.

357
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:41,670
No, I'm going to find him.

358
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,929
Thirsty.

359
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:46,509
Why didn't they give you any water?

360
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:50,308
I'm not used to the water here.

361
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:53,550
Then wait for me to get you some spring water.

362
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,769
Fetching spring water is too troublesome.

363
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:59,148
Just go to Everlasting Hall to bring me some good wine.

364
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:00,949
You're a prisoner,

365
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:02,869
you are not supposed to drink wine by law.

366
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,520
Yue Mi, I'm so thirsty.

367
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,650
Please help me.

368
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,629
Okay. I'll get it for you right now.

369
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:21,429
It's okay to break the rules for you.

370
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,768
Whether five or ten jars,

371
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:28,230
the more the better.

372
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,870
Okay.

373
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,409
Yue Mi, I remembered that

374
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:36,109
I have several jars of fine wines for millennia in Everlasting Hall.

375
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,528
Ask Zi Han, he knows where they are.

376
00:26:38,528 --> 00:26:41,609
And bring the tribute wine from the East Sea as well.

377
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:43,869
Come back quickly, I'll be waiting for you.

378
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,669
Why are you not so breathless now?

379
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,030
So you are just greedy for wine.

380
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:54,169
You…

381
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,890
What?

382
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,228
Don't you want to know why I threw that marriage string?

383
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:03,670
Right.

384
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,349
Who were you asking for with that marriage string?

385
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,149
Don't tell me you really have a crush on someone, do you?

386
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,188
I shouldn't have asked you.

387
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:15,950
Do you really have a crush on someone?

388
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,469
Great. When I get out of the hall, I'll be sure to check him for you.

389
00:27:21,469 --> 00:27:26,350
I tell you that a male god looking at a male god is different than a goddess looking at a male god.

390
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,449
Don't you feel bad?

391
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:29,770
This is a good thing, why should I feel bad?

392
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:35,649
That was not for myself. I was…

393
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:39,369
Because you like Shang Gu, I begged it for you.

394
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:49,950
Yue Mi.

395
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:54,060
Since you are affectionate and I'm righteous,

396
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,530
then starting from today...

397
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,960
become brothers?

398
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,369
From now on, I'm your brother.

399
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:11,149
Do you want to be the big brother?

400
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:12,850
It's not suitable, right?

401
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,970
Who wants to be your brother?

402
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:19,549
You haven't brought me the wine yet.

403
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,168
I asked you to give me some advice,

404
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:34,788
why do you look more worried than me?

405
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:37,108
Are you bored of practicing with Bai Jue again

406
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:39,308
and want to make trouble in the Lower Realm?

407
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:40,428
No.

408
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,730
Tell me. What is it?

409
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:47,308
I like someone.

410
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,268
Like?

411
00:28:49,268 --> 00:28:50,909
Then you like a lot of people.

412
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:53,108
Zhi Yang, Tian Qi, and me.

413
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,789
You like all of us.

414
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:56,829
Not that kind of like,

415
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,669
but the kind that...

416
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:02,590
you don't know what to do to make him happy.

417
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:06,768
Anything else? Do you have any other feelings?

418
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:08,308
His eyes…

419
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:12,288
His eyes are as bright as the stars.

420
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:14,308
It seems that you really love him.

421
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:17,330
It's not a heartbeat, it's a tremor.

422
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,388
But what's the good of liking someone?

423
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:22,168
Take this snack, for example.

424
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:24,049
When you first eat it,

425
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:26,569
it is as sweet as honey.

426
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:29,669
But gradually, you will feel it is more sour than a hawthorn.

427
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:31,668
If this snack likes to be eaten by you, it's okay.

428
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:35,888
But if it doesn't, it will be as bitter as medicine.

429
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,689
What sour, sweet, and bitter?

430
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,849
What are you talking about?

431
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:43,429
If you don't like the snack, then don't eat it.

432
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:45,429
So?

433
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:47,789
Who do you like?

434
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,170
You don't know.

435
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,089
He is not one of our gods?

436
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:55,188
Yes.

437
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:57,468
Then just go and confess your love to him.

438
00:29:57,468 --> 00:29:59,989
With your status and beauty,

439
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,350
no male god in the God Realm can refuse you.

440
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:07,050
Let me put it to you that this can't be rushed.

441
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,610
There are too many goddesses who have confessed their love to him,

442
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,429
but they all failed.

443
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:15,730
If you really want to know whether he likes you or not,

444
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,670
- I have a method for you. 
 - What?

445
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,010
Just go and kiss him,

446
00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:24,829
and see how Bai Jue reacts.

447
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:27,789
Of course, it's not that kind of kiss to transfer power,

448
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:31,089
but that kind between a man and a woman.

449
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:32,610
Forget it.

450
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,949
If I kiss him, he will certainly take my tendons and skin me alive,

451
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:37,469
and send me to purgatory.

452
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,709
Wimp.

453
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,649
I'm not a wimp, but following my heart.

454
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:44,229
No.

455
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,229
I didn't seem to tell you that he was Bai Jue, right?

456
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,289
How did you guess him right away?

457
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:51,609
He's the only one in the God Realm who can control you.

458
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:53,989
If it's not him, could it be Tian Qi?

459
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,990
I'm not stupid, I already guessed it.

460
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:01,649
Look at you. Inferior, small, and uneasy;

461
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:04,810
who is definitely different from the unruly and free you were before.

462
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:07,630
Am I that obvious?

463
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:11,129
If you really want to please Bai Jue,

464
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:15,610
you should not deliberately be inferior yourself or cater to him cautiously.

465
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:19,029
As it turns out, those methods don't work for Bai Jue.

466
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:22,388
Xue Ying has been waiting for him for tens of thousands of years.

467
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:25,130
She is a lesson to you.

468
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,130
Then, what should I do?

469
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,568
The story script says that

470
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:33,949
if a woman wants to pursue a man,

471
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,929
she can't do it by force, but by attraction.

472
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:42,370
Attraction? How to attract?

473
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,908
Don't ask me about that.

474
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:46,988
If I knew how to attract someone, then I would not…

475
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:51,828
Look at your expression. Did you also fall in love with someone?

476
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:58,009
You know that I just feel superficial about love.

477
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:01,029
Right. You read the story scripts more often than I do.

478
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:02,308
Do you still want me to give you advice?

479
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:05,508
Yes. But you have to promise that

480
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:08,288
only you and I know about this matter;

481
00:32:08,288 --> 00:32:09,788
otherwise, all those things about you…

482
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:13,508
I promise that I won't say anything to others.

483
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:15,289
Attract?

484
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:18,830
You can try to do what he likes.

485
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:23,870
The key is that...

486
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:28,088
Bai Jue has no pastime and no hobbies,

487
00:32:28,088 --> 00:32:30,349
so what can I do to attract him?

488
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:33,769
Anyway, I remind you that he is heartless,

489
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:36,089
who even burned the flowers planted by Xue Ying.

490
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:39,250
So you'd better not hold too much hope.

491
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,110
Got it.

492
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,609
Your Royal Highness, what are you doing with these gadgets?

493
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:54,509
To make your master happy.

494
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,070
He always frowns.

495
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,008
Your Royal Highness, you are so kind.

496
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:01,610
But I'm afraid that Master Bai Jue won't appreciate it.

497
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,149
Will he?

498
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:07,690
Your Master.

499
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,970
You are quite early today.

500
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:12,529
What are these?

501
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:16,348
After class, it gets boring so I'm making these gadgets to play with.

502
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,749
A kite. Is it beautiful?

503
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:21,510
Have you ever played?

504
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,568
No.

505
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:26,949
God, Hong Ri, your master has never played with a kite.

506
00:33:26,949 --> 00:33:28,509
Is that strange?

507
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,530
Kites, rattles, and revolving lanterns,

508
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,330
these are the gadgets that everyone plays with as a child.

509
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,089
Yes, there are balls and shuttlecocks. Right.

510
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:36,730
I wasn't so bored as a kid.

511
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,650
I know. When you were a child, you were always with your Tai Cang spear,

512
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,689
conquering demons everywhere.

513
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:44,348
Since you wanted to play, there was no time for you.

514
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:46,188
I don't like playing with these.

515
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:48,908
Try it out. I'm good at flying kites.

516
00:33:48,908 --> 00:33:53,309
Your Royal Highness, Master won't play it.

517
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,409
All right, I'll fly it with you.

518
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:09,370
Aren't you the best at flying kites?

519
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,028
There is a lot of knowledge to flying them.

520
00:34:11,028 --> 00:34:15,009
A kite must fly against the wind to fly high and far.

521
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:17,149
Let me help you.

522
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,229
It's flying! It's flying!

523
00:34:26,229 --> 00:34:28,050
It's flying.

524
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,828
Look, how high it flies!

525
00:34:29,828 --> 00:34:31,550
Look.

526
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,989
Flying a phoenix has great meaning.

527
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,968
Shang Gu, if you could choose,

528
00:35:22,968 --> 00:35:25,269
would you like to be an ordinary god,

529
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:27,388
or a Chief God who is responsible for the lives of the three realms?

530
00:35:27,388 --> 00:35:29,588
Why do you suddenly ask this? Do you want to test me?

531
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:33,428
No. I just want to hear your sincere answer.

532
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:35,649
Since I was born as the Chief God of Chaos,

533
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:39,269
the three realms have been my responsibility.

534
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:44,109
In that case, no matter how much responsibility I have on my shoulders,

535
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,609
I am willing to bear it.

536
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:49,969
Okay. I will do my best

537
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:52,309
to help you take over the God Realm as soon as possible.

538
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:58,310
One day, your divine light will shine in every place.

539
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,828
Master, what's wrong with you?

540
00:36:12,828 --> 00:36:14,169
Did you hurt your back?

541
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:17,449
Don't talk nonsense. My back is very good.

542
00:36:18,249 --> 00:36:20,649
It's just that the ground of the hall is too hard.

543
00:36:20,649 --> 00:36:22,850
So my back hurts from sleeping there.

544
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,149
By the way, during the days that I have been imprisoned,

545
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:27,849
did Zhi Yang do anything?

546
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:29,229
He gave you some great wine,

547
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,850
which are all millennia wines and to your taste.

548
00:36:32,629 --> 00:36:34,650
That's fine.

549
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,869
By the way, Master, during your imprisonment,

550
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:39,649
I took the time to visit a demon clan.

551
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:41,548
Sen Jian is truly a talent that can be cultivated.

552
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:44,288
I've sent this little tiger demon to the third heaven for training.

553
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:47,748
All tiger demons are brave. They can be of great use in the future.

554
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,949
You did a good job. Good for you.

555
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:55,209
It's you who are so wise that you found such a good general for our demon clan.

556
00:36:55,209 --> 00:37:01,190
My wisest choice was to take you up as a divine beast.

557
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,789
During the dragon war,

558
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:05,109
if it was not for you protecting me…

559
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:06,049
Stop.

560
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:08,350
If you have the time to repay my favor, you might as well come in and drink with me.

561
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,449
Come on.

562
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:10,968
Master, I'm not good at drinking.

563
00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:13,209
I'm afraid you won't enjoy yourself.

564
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:14,990
Have fun.

565
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,670
What's going on with Ice Cube Bai these days?

566
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,428
It is rumored that after the matchmaking event,

567
00:37:26,428 --> 00:37:29,108
Master Bai Jue came out holding a female god.

568
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:31,629
They all said there was something unusual.

569
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:33,208
Female god?

570
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,150
Who is she?

571
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,728
There were many witnesses as well as rumors.

572
00:37:37,728 --> 00:37:40,050
Some said it was Goddess of Snow, some said it was Goddess of Rain,

573
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,350
some said it was Goddess of Flower.

574
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,868
There are all kinds of rumors.

575
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:45,949
Some even said it was Her Royal Highness.

576
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,589
What? Shang Gu?

577
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:51,730
All the female gods who were alone at that time were suspected.

578
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,428
Because of this, a bet was opened at the gate of Abyss Hall.

579
00:37:55,428 --> 00:37:57,809
Did Goddess of Snow, Flower, or Rain admit that?

580
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:58,950
They all admitted it.

581
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,800
They all said that they were the ones held by Master Bai Jue.

582
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:04,929
Then it became an unsolved secret.

583
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,609
Where did Ice Cube Bai and the female god come out from?

584
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:11,908
Did they come out from the marriage cave?

585
00:38:11,909 --> 00:38:14,530
I don't know about that.

586
00:38:16,189 --> 00:38:18,889
I have to ask Pu Hua who knows that best.

587
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:22,788
Your Master, Pu Hua has gone to the Immortal Realm, not in the God Realm.

588
00:38:22,788 --> 00:38:25,089
He did not go early or late, but at this time!

589
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:26,428
He is obviously hiding from me.

590
00:38:26,428 --> 00:38:28,469
Master, don't think too much about it.

591
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,569
These are all uncertain rumors

592
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:33,650
that will probably disappear in a few days.

593
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,469
Bring me Zhi Yang's wine.

594
00:38:37,469 --> 00:38:39,070
Yes.

595
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,950
   

596
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,480
Her Royal Highness said she will put these gadgets here temporarily.

597
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,728
When she wants to play with them after class, they will be convenient to pick up.

598
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,549
Your Master, you haven't written with the instruction feather for many years.

599
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,749
Who are you writing to?

600
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,549
Elder Feng Yun of the Phoenix Clan.

601
00:39:06,549 --> 00:39:08,449
Now that Shang Gu's divine vein has been opened,

602
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:10,588
it's time to go to the Phoenix Clan to choose a divine beast.

603
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:11,849
Why choose Feng Yan?

604
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,009
That bird is very garish and useless.

605
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,289
Ancestral God issued an order before he broke the void,

606
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:22,248
saying that the beast of Shang Gu must come from Phoenix Clan.

607
00:39:22,248 --> 00:39:24,849
Besides, most of the beasts are single,

608
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:27,428
only the Phoenix Clan has a strong population.

609
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:30,130
If the Phoenix Emperor can become Shang Gu's beast,

610
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,400
the Phoenix Clan will definitely be the most loyal

611
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,450
and powerful support of Shang Gu in the future.

612
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:38,588
You are deliberate.

613
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:42,049
But I also heard that Feng Yan is approaching the period of nirvana.

614
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:45,459
And we don't know if her temperament will change drastically after rebirth.

615
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:47,148
It's better to find someone like me,

616
00:39:47,149 --> 00:39:50,448
honest and loyal, who can also talk with Her Royal Highness.

617
00:39:50,448 --> 00:39:52,248
I think it's better for me to find someone dumb,

618
00:39:52,248 --> 00:39:54,289
so that he won't be nagging around me every day.

619
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:55,869
Annoying.

620
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:02,510
What's wrong?

621
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,668
For hundreds of thousands of years,

622
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:08,189
this is the first time you've joked with me.

623
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,310
Her Royal Highness is really awesome.

624
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,769
What's she got to do with it?

625
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:19,309
Yes, it has nothing to do with her.

626
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:22,750
I'm going to send sweetmeats to her.

627
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,188
Open your feet and straighten your arms.

628
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:38,109
Turn right and down. Exhale.

629
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:39,148
Turn back.

630
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:43,249
Arms up and put your right foot in front. Exhale.

631
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,189
Turn back.

632
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:48,770
Lift your right foot and open your hands.

633
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,230
Inhale. Stretch.

634
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,629
Relax your body and empty your mind.

635
00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:56,189
Upward and forward.

636
00:40:56,189 --> 00:41:00,089
Strive to achieve a state of unity of mind and body.

637
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,388
Stop.

638
00:41:02,388 --> 00:41:04,688
Your Royal Highness, you are a beginner, so don't be anxious.

639
00:41:04,688 --> 00:41:07,248
Use your legs to exert strength, do not focus on your body shape.

640
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:08,529
It's all about the mind.

641
00:41:08,529 --> 00:41:10,089
Okay.

642
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:19,989
Stay.

643
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:39,990


644
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:47,709
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

645
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:54,550
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

646
00:41:54,550 --> 00:42:01,069
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

647
00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:07,149
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

648
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:14,069
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

649
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:20,579
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

650
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:27,849
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

651
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:34,650
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

652
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:52,949
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

653
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:59,449
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

654
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:06,649
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

655
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:12,750
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

656
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:21,749
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

657
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:28,649
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

658
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:35,049
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

659
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:41,650
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

660
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:51,360
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
