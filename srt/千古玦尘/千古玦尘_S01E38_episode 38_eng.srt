1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:21,500
   

3
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,080
   

4
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,359
Qing Mu, what are you doing?

5
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,059
What demon are you?

6
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:44,439
Why not show us your real appearance?

7
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,800
Qing Mu, are you mad? What demon? I am Feng Ran.

8
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,159
Are you insane? Don't you know me?

9
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,460
Jing Jian, don't be cheated by her.

10
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,579
For the sake of Hou Chi, I won't fight against you.

11
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,449
If you go too far, don't blame me for the fight.

12
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:02,760
Tell me what I said to you when Hou Chi and I got married.

13
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,030
 When did Hou Chi have a thick waist? 

14
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,110
You said I had a thick waist.

15
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,080
You are really Feng Ran.

16
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,069
Qing Mu, what happened today for you to act this way?

17
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,689
Early this morning, the evil auras in the Human Realm have been getting intense.

18
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:25,380
I traced it and found out

19
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,660
it was from the Region of the Phoenix Clan.

20
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,909
Then I wanted to ask the elders of the Phoenix Clan.

21
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,670
However...

22
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,719
 This place is the Phoenix Clan. 

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,159
 I've been here with my Mother God. 

24
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,269
 Qing Mu, let me go in with you. 

25
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,079
 The evil aura here is quite strange. 

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,820
 Jing Zhao, hurry back and don't follow me anymore. 

27
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,959
 This place is where birds pay homage to the phoenix. 

28
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,910
 How did it become like this? 

29
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,960
 The smell... 

30
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,799
 It... 

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,340
 I'm afraid many from the Phoenix Clan died in this forest. 

32
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,190
 Qing Mu, why did it happen? 

33
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,720
 Who is there? 

34
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,800
 Qing Mu! 

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,360
 Jing Zhao! 

36
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,930
 Feng Ran? 

37
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,640
You mean the Phoenix Clan have all been killed

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,239
and they were killed by someone who looks like Feng Ran.

39
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,750
Yes.

40
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,700
We just came across that black spiritual aura you mentioned just now.

41
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:43,389
That spiritual aura is very strange.

42
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,469
We have never met it in the Heavenly Palace.

43
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,740
It's somehow a bit like the devil aura in the ancient books.

44
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,709
Didn't the devils disappear after the war between the gods and devils 60,000 years ago?

45
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,870
No matter who the other party is, Jing Zhao is now in their hands.

46
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,879
Whatever the truth is, we must find Jing Zhao first.

47
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,719
Wutong Forest has a complex formation.

48
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,999
When it hits the midnight hour, it'll have many evil barriers.

49
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:09,259
Why don't the three of us split up before it gets dark?

50
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,549
If any of us runs into trouble, tell each other by instruction feather.

51
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:13,270
How's this idea?

52
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,350
Qing Mu.

53
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,880
If something happens to Jing Zhao,

54
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,200
I'll definitely be punished by the Heavenly Palace.

55
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,339
It's okay for me to take responsibility alone,

56
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,549
but Hou Chi is on Shenyin Mountain.

57
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,600
I can't let her be worried about me.

58
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,169
All right. Don't worry.

59
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,880
I promise you. I'll be fine.

60
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,300
 Qing Mu. Qing Mu, I'm here. 

61
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,319
 Qing Mu! 

62
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,980
Zhao'er.

63
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,790
Oh no! The time has come. The evil barriers have just begun!

64
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,369
Qing Mu! Qing Mu!

65
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:05,310
Here you are. Help me!

66
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,070
Qing Mu.

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,200
Qing Mu.

68
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,350
I didn't know the origin of my power was demon power.

69
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,379
Bo Xuan.

70
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,320
You're Bai Jue, right?

71
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,729
It's my destiny. I won't resist it.

72
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,760
But it hasn't been 100 years

73
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,740
and Hou Chi hasn't returned.

74
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,670
 One hundred years from now, you'll have to remember to pick me. 

75
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,880
 I'll be right here waiting to take you home. 

76
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,230
I'm not satisfied.

77
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:20,499
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

78
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:26,279
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

79
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:33,180
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

80
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:39,719
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

81
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,960
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

82
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,900
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

83
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,280
 Qing Mu. 

84
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,349
 We have many long years to grow old together. 

85
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,759
 We can raise many children. 

86
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,439
 I'll teach them to fight against the demons and devils. 

87
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,900
 You can teach them piano, chess, calligraphy and painting. 

88
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,330
 From now on, Hou Chi is my wife. 

89
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,469
 My wife, from now on, we share weal and woe  

90
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,180
  and never be apart! 

91
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,100
 I'll try to live longer and love her more. 

92
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,380
 I will persevere, 

93
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,500
 but will True God Bai Jue treat Hou Chi well?  

94
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,290
Please take care of...

95
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hou Chi.

96
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:03,499
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

97
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,539
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

98
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:15,349
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

99
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:17,150
What do you want to have tomorrow?

100
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:26,910
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫ 

101
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,850
What are you thinking about?

102
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,990
I don't know.

103
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,130
I feel today is somehow strange that something big is going to happen.

104
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:44,960
 Master Bai Jue, please treat Hou Chi well. 

105
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,809
 I was in a hurry. Only 40 percent of my spiritual power is recovered. 

106
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,669
You've purified too much evil aura causing your own loss,

107
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:05,210
so now you worry too much about gains and losses.

108
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,230
If you were like her in the past, that would be all good.

109
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,180
What was she like in the God Realm?

110
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,250
She grew up in a pampered and carefree way.

111
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,689
She also had a good friend named Yue Mi who pampered her the most.

112
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,549
They made a lot of trouble together.

113
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:36,970
Just like me and Feng Ran, right?

114
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:43,710
Yes. Only if it could be like this all the time.

115
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,420
Jing Yuan.

116
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,909
Hou Chi, have you thought about

117
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,589
why Bo Xuan had to seal the other god consciousness in your body?

118
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:54,409
If he cared about you,

119
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:57,839
he'd give you the most honorable title and the greatest power.

120
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,549
Just like Chief God in the past,

121
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:02,960
who had the highest status and was respected by others.

122
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,229
The heart can't lie.

123
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:10,420
I can feel that Bo Xuan is sincere with me.

124
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,180
Sincere with you?

125
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,240
I've been sincere with you, too, but you never see me.

126
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,100
Jing Yuan, thank you.

127
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:30,470
It's just that my small heart can only contain one person for this life.

128
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,869
All right. Who wants to hear you say all this?

129
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,639
Anyway, Bo Xuan is an ordinary Immortal saved by my Father God.

130
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,619
According to my Father God,

131
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:46,030
he may have followed my Father God's instruction to seal me.

132
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,430
Ordinary Immortal?

133
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:54,170
According to Gu Jun, he never did anything without reason.

134
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,230
What are you mumbling?

135
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,350
I was saying what to make for you to eat tomorrow.

136
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,400
Heavenly Queen.

137
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,879
It's all my fault that I was too impatient!

138
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,669
I wanted to kill them all when my spiritual power was strong.

139
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:38,450
I didn't expect it to cause Bai Jue to wake up.

140
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,259
Bai Jue? Do you mean True God Bai Jue?

141
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,319
Moreover, do you still remember

142
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:52,400
that portrait under the Huajing Pond in the Qingchi Palace?

143
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,060
I saw it in person today.

144
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,530
The man in that portrait is Bai Jue.

145
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:11,840
Even Qing Mu was created and separated from Bai Jue's origin.

146
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,999
His original spiritual power isn't immortal power but strong demon power.

147
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,280
Back then, Bai Jue lived in the Qingchi Palace.

148
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,339
Hou Chi is similar to Shang Gu.

149
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:30,910
Is she really Shang Gu?

150
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,149
But why did Bai Jue create Qing Mu?

151
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:37,570
What is his plan?

152
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,890
Did True God Bai Jue recognize your identity?

153
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:50,110
I transformed myself into Feng Ran using evil auras and took Zhao'er away.

154
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,600
He would never suspect me.

155
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,899
But I was too careless to let Elder Dan Feng run away.

156
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:07,100
It'll lead to great trouble.

157
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,569
Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness!

158
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,670
Feng Ran!

159
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,590
Feng Ran.

160
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,880
Feng Ran. Feng Ran!

161
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,090
Rumor has it that there's a forbidden place in the Phoenix Clan.

162
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,110
Perhaps, did Feng Ran and I just fall into it?

163
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,420
Wu Xi.

164
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,080
Feng Yan.

165
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,450
Why do these names sound familiar?

166
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:07,270
Fire phoenix? There has never been a fire phoenix in the Phoenix Clan before.

167
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,829
 I'm dying. I hope to meet you before I die 

168
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,020
 and tell you about your birth. 

169
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,260
 Your origin? 

170
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,969
Phoenix Empress? This Phoenix Empress is not just a phoenix.

171
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:31,880
I see.

172
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,759
Star Lord, last night, the stars moved and the sky changed.

173
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,369
What happened?

174
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:55,959
Your Majesty, yesterday when I was on duty,

175
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:59,499
I saw fire over the Phoenix Clan's Wutong Forest.

176
00:17:59,499 --> 00:18:02,309
I was afraid that something might happen and harm the Human Realm.

177
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,659
So, I assigned Dubhe, Alkaid, and Pollis

178
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:07,810
these three stars to guard the Northeast and against the fire.

179
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,020
Fire?

180
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,709
Lord Dong Hua, what's your opinion?

181
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:15,799
Your Majesty, the power of this fire is very pure.

182
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:18,589
It's very likely to be True God Bai Jue's fire.

183
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:22,339
I have a bold proposal. Would Your Majesty be brave to go and take a look?

184
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:29,910
I've been willing to restart the God Realm for years.

185
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,209
Even if it's not True God coming to the realm, it must have something to do with the God Realm.

186
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:37,360
It's such an important issue. I need to have a look in person.

187
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,900
 I'll willing to go with Your Majesty. 

188
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,659
Qing Mu, you're awake.

189
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:02,080
This god is Bai Jue.

190
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,180
Bai...

191
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,310
Only one is called this name among the three realms.

192
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,779
Greetings to Master Bai Jue.

193
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,080
Did you save me?

194
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,069
Replying to Master.

195
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:22,249
You were seriously injured and were passed out in the Wutong Forest.

196
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:25,469
My apologies for offending you, Master.

197
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:27,069
Golden Dragon?

198
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:29,579
What's the relationship between you and Mu Guang?

199
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:34,849
He's my Father God. I'm Jing Zhao.

200
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,939
And who's your Mother God?

201
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:39,920
Goddess Wu Huan.

202
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,720
Who is Qing Mu you just mentioned?

203
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,010
Qing Mu is...

204
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,939
Greetings to Master Bai Jue.

205
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:56,740
Please go to the Qingchi Palace, True God Bai Jue.

206
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,279
Qingchi Palace? Why not Pilgrim Hall?

207
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,560
Pilgrim Hall and the God Realm have been closed.

208
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,310
Did Master forget?

209
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,159
I've been asleep for a long time.

210
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,009
So, I have forgotten many things.

211
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:22,100
Now I'm awake.

212
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,639
I want to have a good rest.

213
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,500
You both may leave.

214
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,720
Yes, Master.

215
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,799
After Master woke up, was it you who took care of him?

216
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,550
Yes.

217
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,349
Last night, there was a lot of evil aura in the Wutong Forest.

218
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:52,509
I was held by evil aura. Qing Mu came to rescue me.

219
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,760
But when I woke up...

220
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,830
 Qing Mu. 

221
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,930
 Qing Mu! 

222
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,880
I found the awakened Master.

223
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,500
Then why did Master lose his memory?

224
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,260
Are you aware of the consequences if you lie to me?

225
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,899
Upper God Gu Jun,

226
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:29,159
it's impossible for me to hurt Qing Mu.

227
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,560
Moreover, he's now awakened as Master Bai Jue.

228
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,309
Master has slept tens of thousands of years.

229
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,400
It is normal to have memory loss after waking up.

230
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,710
Father God.

231
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,109
Qing Mu is awakened.

232
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,140
He is Master Bai Jue.

233
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,659
I'm Mu Guang.

234
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,639
Greetings to Master Bai Jue.

235
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,509
It's been 60,000 years. How are you?

236
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:01,340
 Come in alone. I'd like to ask you something. 

237
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,520
 Yes, Master. 

238
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,439
Now Master Bai Jue is back.

239
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:18,589
The immortals don't have to fear the demons.

240
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,280
Perhaps we can attack the Luocha Region and unite the Heavenly Realm.

241
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,230
It turns out Lord Qing Mu is Master Bai Jue.

242
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,799
Then it makes sense that he was powerful at such a young age.

243
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,439
He also obtained Tai Cang Spear on Observation Mountain.

244
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:32,939
Everything comes to light.

245
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:35,899
I heard the Lord of the North Sea married her.

246
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:38,620
In the future, Qingchi Palace will be on the rise.

247
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,130
Master only saw the Heavenly King but not Upper God Gu Jun.

248
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,950
I don't think it's that easy.

249
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,859
You finally woke up. I was so worried about you.

250
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,280
Worried about me?

251
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,659
Yesterday when there were evil barriers in the Wutong Forest,

252
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:22,830
you were trapped and passed out.

253
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,690
Where is Qing Mu?

254
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,100
I don't know.

255
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,349
Early this morning after the evil barriers changed,

256
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,829
I carried you out of the cave.

257
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,450
Since then, I haven't seen anyone in this forest.

258
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,009
I feel that Wutong Forest is quite strange.

259
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:40,520
What happened yesterday might not be an accident.

260
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,759
After you recover,

261
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,160
I'll report it to my Father God back in the Heavenly Palace.

262
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,230
Take this devil.

263
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,500
What happened?

264
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,679
Your Highness.

265
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,799
Yesterday in the Wutong Forest,

266
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,639
she fought against Master Bai Jue.

267
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,349
Master and His Majesty suspect she is related to the devils.

268
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,980
His Majesty demanded us to arrest her and bring her back to the palace.

269
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,729
Father God, it's a misunderstanding.

270
00:24:34,729 --> 00:24:36,219
I was with Feng Ran in the Wutong Forest.

271
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:37,779
She can't be the one who attempted to kill him.

272
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:39,309
Please investigate it carefully.

273
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,609
Jian'er, watch your manners.

274
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:45,760
Answer the questions when Master asks you.

275
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,920
Master.

276
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,170
Jing Zhao.

277
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,469
Yes.

278
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,279
Talk about what happened to you yesterday.

279
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,820
Yes.

280
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,620
Yesterday, the Lord of the North Sea and I

281
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,799
noticed a difference in the evil aura in the realm at noon.

282
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,609
So we traced it to the Wutong Forest of the Phoenix Clan.

283
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:13,189
We saw blood everywhere and a devil aura deep in the Forest.

284
00:25:13,189 --> 00:25:15,189
All Immortals of the Phoenix Clan were imprisoned,

285
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,279
and they all lost their spiritual power and died.

286
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,929
I saw it in person that Lordess Feng Ran killed the immortals

287
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:24,230
and even trapped me using devil aura.

288
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,999
If it weren't for the Lord of the North Sea who came to my rescue and for Master Bai Jue waking up,

289
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,160
I would have been killed by Feng Ran.

290
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,879
What you said, is it true?

291
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,680
With respect to Master, all I  have said is true.

292
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,830
If I lie about anything, I'm willing to suffer from the pain on the heart by devil aura.

293
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,000
Feng Ran, what else would you like to talk about?

294
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,109
I went to the Wutong Forest for my own business.

295
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,100
Their death has nothing to do with me.

296
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,669
That's just what you said. Do you have any evidence?

297
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:01,719
What Jing Zhao just said, what evidence does she have?

298
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,919
I'm always fair to everyone.

299
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,919
Master may pretend not to know it.

300
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,829
But Qing Mu would not.

301
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,760
I have integrity and have never lied since I was born.

302
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,189
If I really killed anyone,

303
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,919
I wouldn't have been afraid to admit it.

304
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,959
But it's obvious that someone disguised as me.

305
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,780
I won't accept being framed!

306
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,679
Yesterday, Master was also in the Wutong Forest.

307
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,429
If she had a devil aura,

308
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,639
how could she have escaped from Master?

309
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,189
There're few people who have such power in the Phoenix Clan.

310
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,069
It's clear someone framed her.

311
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,919
Though Master was in sleep for 60,000 years,

312
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,910
could you not even tell the difference?

313
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,709
Gu Jun.

314
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,959
Upper God Gun Jun.

315
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:50,690
How can you be disrespectful to Master?

316
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,920
Master, I have no intention of framing her.

317
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,609
It's about the devils, so it should be severe punishment.

318
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:06,589
Imprison Feng Ran

319
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,069
and torture her to speak out the truth.

320
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,800
 Yes. 

321
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,479
Master, Feng Ran is too weak to be punished.

322
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,500
I don't care about who you are, Bai Jue or Qing Mu.

323
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,600
If you dare to let Hou Chi down, I won't forgive you.

324
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,759
- Take her down. 
  - Yes. 

325
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,920
Qing Mu is just an ordinary body.

326
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,899
From now on, in the Heavenly Realm,

327
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:44,590
I don't want anyone to mention him.

328
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,819
Yes.

329
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:49,330
I'll make the order right now.

330
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,399
The devils were killed by all the gods.

331
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,280
The one who fought against me isn't one of them.

332
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,679
Master, do you mean...

333
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:11,039
Feng Ran didn't do it.

334
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,799
I was worried about alarming the enemy,

335
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,399
so I put her in jail.

336
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,709
When this matter's settled, set her free.

337
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,080
You're considerate.

338
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,039
Have you figured out who would be the killer?

339
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,399
I have only one clue.

340
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,169
Though this person has much devil aura,

341
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:29,210
her instruction feather is from the immortals.

342
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,489
She's an immortal.

343
00:28:33,489 --> 00:28:36,379
Mu Guang, you've been in charge of the Heavenly Palace for 60,000 years.

344
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:38,730
You must know the immortals very well.

345
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,700
According to your knowledge,

346
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,160
who do you think is possessed by the devils?

347
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,679
My apologies.

348
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,690
Please punish me for my oversight.

349
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,709
Wu Huan was appointed by Shang Gu as the patriarch of the Phoenix Clan back then.

350
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,579
Now she's also the Heavenly Queen.

351
00:28:57,579 --> 00:28:59,149
As the whole Phoenix Clan were killed,

352
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:01,470
why didn't she show up to discuss it?

353
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,539
Master may not know that I've punished her to the Netherworld.

354
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,290
The Netherworld?

355
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,160
Why did you punish her?

356
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,730
Over some trivial things.

357
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,450
Trivial?

358
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,119
Master, although she was been punished in the Netherworld at this moment,

359
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:24,189
she'd never become a devil.

360
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,740
Moreover, that devil caught Zhao'er,

361
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,779
who Wu Huan loves the most.

362
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:31,979
She wouldn't let Zhao'er suffer!

363
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,609
You're too serious. Have a seat.

364
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,099
Wu Huan used to accompany Shang Gu.

365
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:40,659
I trust her.

366
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:43,879
I'll still let her manage the Phoenix Clan.

367
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,389
Yes.

368
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:47,039
I have just awakened.

369
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,879
I need to get some rest and recover my spiritual power.

370
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,679
Tomorrow, I'll go to the Blue Dome of Heaven.

371
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,549
So for managing the Heavenly Palace,

372
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:55,690
you're still the one in charge.

373
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,999
Since Master is back, it should be you.

374
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,399
- This... 
 - I've made my mind.

375
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,140
There's nothing more to discuss.

376
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,169
Back then when the God Realm was closed,

377
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:10,279
God Hong Ri also passed away.

378
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,229
Now no one can take care of you.

379
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,799
If you go to Blue Dome of Heaven alone,

380
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,079
I'm afraid it will be inconvenient for you.

381
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,640
Father God.

382
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,300
I'm willing to follow Master and take care of his daily needs.

383
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,519
You?

384
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,919
You're pampered.

385
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,399
How can you take good care of Master?

386
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,759
Step back.

387
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,069
Jing Zhao is your daughter.

388
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,559
She also saved me once in the Wutong Forest.

389
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,679
For me, I do owe her a favor.

390
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,859
If you want, you can follow me.

391
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:43,259
It's beneficial for your cultivation and I can return your favor.

392
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,740
Thank you, Master.

393
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,429
I knew you would come.

394
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,250
The matter about Wutong Forest's murder has been decided.

395
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,759
I came here not for Feng Ran but for my best friend,

396
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,900
Lord of the North Sea, Qing Mu.

397
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,589
Please tell me where his god consciousness is.

398
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,860
What can I do to bring him back?

399
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,690
Since I've been awakened, Qing Mu doesn't exist anymore.

400
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,310
Whatever you do, he won't come back.

401
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,759
It can't be. Qing Mu was a determined and tough man.

402
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:39,709
His god consciousness wouldn't disappear easily.

403
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,609
- He'll definitely find a way... 
 - Say no more.

404
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:42,949
He's just an ordinary immortal.

405
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,169
I've said before no one shall mention his name again.

406
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,539
In your opinion,

407
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:54,430
are the lives of ordinary immortals just like ants?

408
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,279
Your Highness.

409
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,280
His Majesty just ordered you to leave the Netherworld.

410
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,639
What did you say?

411
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,559
He let me out of the Netherworld?

412
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,280
I've heard it's True God Bai Jue's order.

413
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,679
I haven't recovered from severe harm.

414
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,349
Now I only have the lowest level of spiritual power.

415
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,759
And the evil aura in my body hasn't been cultivated.

416
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,690
If I leave the Netherworld now,

417
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,349
it means I'll walk right into the trap.

418
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:47,190
But it'll be suspicious if Your Highness doesn't follow the order.

419
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,329
It's all about destiny.

420
00:32:54,329 --> 00:32:57,880
Your Highness, what do you mean?

421
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,519
Back then, Devil King Xuan Yi,

422
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,199
he was the Chief God of Chaos created by Ancestor God.

423
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:07,709
But he changed his spiritual vein and became a devil.

424
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,590
Spiritual power and evil power have the same origin.

425
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,570
He could do it.

426
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,100
So can I.

427
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,919
Your Highness, do you plan to transfer all your spiritual power to evil power?

428
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,820
That's impossible!

429
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,210
Then tell me what can I do!

430
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,820
Once I transfer all the spiritual power that I have

431
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,790
from the Phoenix Clan into evil power,

432
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:41,039
I can cultivate quickly and hide my devil auras.

433
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,640
Then I'll be back to the top of gods.

434
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,230
Look at that.

435
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,279
God Slayer Flowers have blossomed.

436
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,370
It seems to be the will of the gods.

437
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:10,400
Well, I care about the Heavenly Palace and my children.

438
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,500
Even if I have evil power,

439
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,050
I don't belong to the devils.

440
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,130
- Jing Jian. 
 - Feng Ran.

441
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,989
Feng Ran. Let's go.

442
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,509
How are you? Are you all right?

443
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:43,499
Much better.

444
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,329
- Let's leave here. 
 - No.

445
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:46,909
The charges on me haven't been clarified.

446
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,229
If I leave, you'll become an accomplice.

447
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,190
I'm clear about your matter more than anyone else.

448
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,909
You can count on me.

449
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:56,029
I won't leave. What about you if I leave?

450
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,709
I am Prince Jing Jian.

451
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,009
Even if my Father God is going to punish me, he will do it lightly.

452
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,799
I don't want to owe you a favor.

453
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,400
We owe you.

454
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,330
What do you mean?

455
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:15,209
Feng Ran, Upper God Gu Jun also asked me to release you.

456
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:18,059
He asked me to tell you if the Heavenly Palace finds out you've escaped,

457
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:19,469
they will send people to Qingchi Palace.

458
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:22,800
So you should go to Shenyin Mountain to find Hou Chi.

459
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,000
What if Hou Chi asks about Qing Mu?

460
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,169
Your Highness, how could you release this devil?

461
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:32,759
Feng Ran, leave!

462
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,860
Otherwise, it'll be too late!

463
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,730
Silly Icecube.

464
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,470
After all, you have awakened.

465
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,080
But why is it at such a moment?

466
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,979
If Shang Gu knows it,

467
00:36:57,979 --> 00:37:00,320
she will scold you about being ruthless.

468
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,869
You should stay in bed. Why do you come out?

469
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:11,559
Be careful! Come and sit.

470
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,189
I've been lying in bed for the entire three months.

471
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,329
I got really bored. So I thought of picking flower buds

472
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:23,900
to make you some Pear Blossom Cakes.

473
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,999
I'm here for this kind of rough work.

474
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:29,159
Here. This is the red jujube soup I made for you.

475
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,800
Have some before it gets cold.

476
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,149
You're spoiling him now.

477
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,949
After he is born, how will you spoil him more?

478
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,149
He will be born with my care.

479
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,380
If I'm willing to spoil him, who dares say no?

480
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,189
But it has been a long time.

481
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,569
Why don't you look like you're pregnant?

482
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:01,969
I've never seen other immortals being pregnant.

483
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:03,759
But we're connected by blood.

484
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,010
I can feel that he's very healthy.

485
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,759
Perhaps there's little spiritual power here for him to absorb.

486
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,670
So he's growing slowly.

487
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,490
I hope so.

488
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:20,220
Why don't I find Chang Que for you, so that he can check you?

489
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,329
Jing Yuan, Qing Mu hasn't written me letters for a long time.

490
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:27,279
He wouldn't be like this for no reason.

491
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,280
Has anything big happened in the three realms?

492
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,520
Anything big?

493
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,630
I haven't heard.

494
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,060
Perhaps there's another battle between the immortals and demons?

495
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,759
I'm studying recipes with you here every day.

496
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,559
I have no time for affairs outside.

497
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:43,179
Hou Chi, later teach me how to make Pear Blossom Cake.

498
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:46,610
Jing Yuan, I can't leave here.

499
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:50,230
Can you help me find Qing Mu?

500
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,560
The barrier is shaking.

501
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,120
Someone is breaking in.

502
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,670
Stop!

503
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,129
Goddess Hou Chi, we've been asked to arrest this criminal.

504
00:39:12,129 --> 00:39:13,759
Please don't make trouble for us.

505
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,959
Ridiculous!

506
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:17,709
Since when did the Head of Qingchi Palace become a criminal?

507
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,609
For her personal issue, Feng Ran killed the Phoenix Clan in the Wutong Forest.

508
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,330
His Majesty demanded us to take her back to the Heavenly Palace.

509
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,390
The Phoenix Clan were slaughtered? Nonsense.

510
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,909
Feng Ran is not one who does such desolate things.

511
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,240
I'm here.

512
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,459
Who dares to touch her?

513
00:39:31,459 --> 00:39:32,619
Goddess Hou Chi.

514
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:36,069
Not only you, even if Upper God Gu Jun were here, but you also couldn't save her.

515
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,559
Come on, arrest her!

516
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,090
Jing Yuan.

517
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,959
- Demon God. 
 - Get off of Shenyin Mountain.

518
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:49,859
Demon God, God Bai Jue is back to the three realms.

519
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:53,229
With his power, let's see how long you can keep this up.

520
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,950
Bai Jue?

521
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,759
He's awakened. So what?

522
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,999
I wasn't afraid of him in the past.

523
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:02,229
Now I'm not afraid of him, either.

524
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,860
Get out!

525
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,010
Did you already know that Bai Jue was back?

526
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,560
He is...

527
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,290
Yes.

528
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,050
Hou Chi, Qing Mu is Bai Jue.

529
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:36,430
I thought you two could enjoy some time together at least.

530
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,899
Unfortunately...

531
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:41,520
The day has finally come.

532
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,630
Hou Chi.

533
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,869
Since Bai Jue has been awakened,

534
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:51,150
Qing Mu doesn't exist in this world anymore.

535
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:05,000


536
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:16,439
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

537
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:23,319
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

538
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:29,839
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

539
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:36,000
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

540
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,800
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

541
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,324
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

542
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:56,680
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

543
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:03,375
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

544
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:20,499
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

545
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:26,979
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

546
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:34,159
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

547
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:41,460
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

548
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:49,275
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

549
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:56,074
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

550
00:42:56,074 --> 00:43:02,599
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

551
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:09,249
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

552
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:20,100
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
