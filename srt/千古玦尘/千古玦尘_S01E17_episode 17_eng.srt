1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,020


2
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:21,080
   

3
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,900
   

4
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:02,571
That's the birthday gift from Zijin Mansion.

5
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:07,400
This Fire Coral is more exquisite than that of East Sea Dragon Palace's.

6
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:14,360
Jing Yang treats his benefactor well.

7
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,140
He had no position in the Lower Realm,

8
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,780
but he became a lord of the Heavenly Palace

9
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,280
and a guest of Observation Mountain in less than 10,000 years.

10
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,057
Zi Yuan also deceived people too much.

11
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:24,957
You were badly hurt because he attacked you from behind.

12
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:27,850
Now he allows his apprentices to get in and out of Qingchi Palace.

13
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,442
We're invited to Lord Dong Hua's birthday party

14
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,100
of Daze Mansion on Observation Mountain.

15
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,100
Lordess, Lord Dong Hua is an important minister of the Immortal Realm.

16
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,410
People will go to his birthday party.

17
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,120
Why don't we take this opportunity to tell on Zi Yuan?

18
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,900
No way. Zi Yuan has gotten a higher status in the Heavenly Palace all these years.

19
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,720
He's always bossy.

20
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,480
It'd ruin Qingchi Palace's honor if we tell the Heavenly Palace about that.

21
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,428
But Qingchi Palace and the Heavenly Palace are equal.

22
00:02:56,428 --> 00:02:59,942
Even if Upper God Gu Jun is absent, Little God is also an Upper God.

23
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:01,310
Though the Heavenly Palace is powerful,

24
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,870
it should show Little God respect.

25
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,600
Chang Que, it's fine that Jia Ye and the other don't know.

26
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,385
Why do you make nonsense as they do?

27
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:09,940
Didn't you see just now?

28
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:27,185
But you said her immortal power was better.

29
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:28,580
Turns out it's fake.

30
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,970
Chang Que, do you know what I saw this month?

31
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,670
From that day, I went to the Spiritual Spring for ten days in a row.

32
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,600
I saw her practice from sunset to dawn every day.

33
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Chang Que, we've been with her for thousands of years,

34
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,290
but we don't know her very well.

35
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,340
I learned it.

36
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:17,430
I've practiced it for so many years.

37
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,160
Why did I get it at this time?

38
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:28,060
Is it because I practiced in the Spiritual Spring and it worked?

39
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,630
If that's true,

40
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,370
can I travel with Bo Xuan and take the ordeal?

41
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:57,070
Hou Chi was born with closed spiritual veins.

42
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,290
God Gu Jun spent 40,000 years helping her break her shell.

43
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,200
She's sick. Her spiritual veins are unstable.

44
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,142
The three realms know that her mother doesn't like her.

45
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:08,780
For the sake of Qingchi Palace,

46
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,800
Hou Chi has rarely gone out in the past 20,000 years.

47
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,830
It's sad to see...

48
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,450
the way she is.

49
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:26,880
Chang Que, can't you learn some jokes to please her?

50
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,042
Don't be hard on me.

51
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:32,370
Since Lord Bo Xuan left,

52
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,510
Upper God Gu Jun often wanders around

53
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,142
on the grounds of collecting herbal medicine for Little God.

54
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:39,871
The spiritual aura of Qingchi Palace is never the same.

55
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:44,140
Several immortal mansions down below have moved.

56
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,440
Upper God Gu Jun will be back one day.

57
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,385
At first, I was rejected by the Immortal and Demon Realms.

58
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:51,910
It was Upper God Gu Jun who took me in.

59
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:57,450
While he's out, I have to protect Hou Chi.

60
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,160
Lordess.

61
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,642
A drop of water in kindness shall be returned with a surging spring of recompense.

62
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:09,310
Will we go to the birthday party at Daze Mansion, then?

63
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,850
Forget it.

64
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,250
Give back the invitation.

65
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,242
Qingchi Palace is different from the Heavenly Palace.

66
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,510
It will always be.

67
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,690
Yes.

68
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:23,690
Be quick.

69
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:33,930
Are you sure Immortal Zi Yuan's Fire Coral was left here?

70
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,860
Yes, I'm sure. I told you many times.

71
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,780
If you hadn't stayed at the Spiritual Spring,

72
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,800
we wouldn't have made such a big mistake.

73
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,530
Keep quiet. Or you'll draw people of Qingchi Palace to us.

74
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,228
Who are you?

75
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:49,250
Why are you on the back hill of Qingchi Palace?

76
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,171
You're an immortal. I'm an apprentice of Immortal Zi Yuan of Zijin Mansion.

77
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:55,228
I passed by Qilian Mountain.

78
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:58,390
I was thirsty. So, I went in to drink some water.

79
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,150
You're lying. There's a barrier of Qingchi Palace here.

80
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,240
How did you break in?

81
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,540
Or I'll tell Lordess Feng Ran, the master here.

82
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,740
What... What barrier?

83
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,550
Everyone knows that this place is the most desolate of the Heavenly Realm.

84
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,414
On a normal day, even if you invited me, I wouldn't bother to come here.

85
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:18,720
Look. Could she have taken the Fire Coral?

86
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,350
Did you steal Immortal Zi Yuan's Fire Coral?

87
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,650
What Fire Coral?

88
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,920
It seems that you won't tell me if I don't let you suffer.

89
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,790
Bo Xuan.

90
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,670
- Hou Chi, are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

91
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,170
How dare you guys of Zijin Mansion break into Qingchi Palace?

92
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,140
She's that phoenix.

93
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,010
- Go. 
 - No way.

94
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,228
Don't go, Feng Ran.

95
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:42,150
It's better to save trouble.

96
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,860
Besides, they didn't hurt me.

97
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,760
I'm glad you're okay.

98
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,530
What to do? What should I do?

99
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,420
I provoked Feng Ran and lost Lord Zi Yuan's Fire Coral.

100
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,520
Though Qingchi Palace is weak, it's Upper God Gu Jun's mansion.

101
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,570
If Feng Ran tracks us, there will be consequences.

102
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,430
I told you to be quiet. But you shouted.

103
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,190
It must be your shouting that drew them to us.

104
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,314
Stop scolding me. You usually have a lot of ideas.

105
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:14,660
Find a way.

106
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,285
Feng Ran has a grudge against His Elder Highness.

107
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:20,210
Qingchi Palace rarely engages with the Heavenly Palace.

108
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,850
Upper God Gu Jun was from the Swamp of Netherhill.

109
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,980
What?

110
00:08:28,657 --> 00:08:30,760
It hurts.

111
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:36,842
- What? 
 - Look.

112
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:39,940
Doesn't it look like the wound of a man burned by evil power?

113
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,771
Yeah. Where did you get this spiritual water?

114
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:45,020
I bought it from an underground market.

115
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,542
It can change the attributes of a wound in a second.

116
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,257
Immortals fought devils for so many years.

117
00:08:49,257 --> 00:08:52,240
There are always cowardly deserters who need it.

118
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,770
If Lord Zi Yuan knows, you'd...

119
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,070
I bought it for fun.

120
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,970
I didn't expect it to come in handy for this.

121
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,780
Why don't we take a chance since we'll get punished anyway?

122
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,330
Where's the invitation from Lord Dong Hua?

123
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,940
I have it.

124
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,060
Lord, have you changed your mind?

125
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,640
It's fine that Zi Yuan humiliated me.

126
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
But his apprentices dared hurt Hou Chi.

127
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,790
They were outrageous. I can't bear it.

128
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,114
I must make him pay at Lord Dong Hua's birthday party.

129
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,780
But Zijin Mansion always gets close to the Heavenly Palace.

130
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,130
What if the Heavenly Palace is partial to Zijin Mansion?

131
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,328
I can't care that much.

132
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:37,300
Chang Que, prepare a gift for Dong Hua of Daze Mansion.

133
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,820
Yes.

134
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,357
Lord, Upper God Gu Jun is the guest on the invitation.

135
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:48,720
If you go with his invitation, Zi Yuan will pounce on it.

136
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,150
There's more than one god in Qingchi Palace.

137
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,200
I can't go, but someone can.

138
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,885
Lord, do you want Her Royal Highness...

139
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,850
 When you're in danger, put your immortal power into it, 

140
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,857
 it can instantly improve your cultivation. 

141
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:23,500
 It doesn't last long, but enough to get you out of danger. 

142
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:27,950
 Don't use it often, or it'll damage your consciousness. 

143
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:36,910
Your Royal Highness, what are you thinking about so intently?

144
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,385
Why have you come to me?

145
00:10:38,385 --> 00:10:41,614
It's Dong Hua's 70,000th birthday in a few days.

146
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:43,760
His apprentice sent an invitation to us.

147
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,500
He asked us to attend his birthday party.

148
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,080
How about we go to Observation Mountain?

149
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:50,860
Observation Mountain?

150
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,420
No. Even if I'm not a true Upper God, I'm a god.

151
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,400
Why do I have to go to an immortal's birthday party?

152
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,280
Dong Hua is the owner of Observation Mountain.

153
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,860
He's only below the emperor in the Immortal Realm.

154
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,142
People may think we're arrogant if we don't go.

155
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:10,171
After all, he is the same age as me,

156
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,910
and he can be considered my senior.

157
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,642
You know what, you go with Chang Que.

158
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:17,450
We'll show Dong Hua respect if you go and celebrate his birthday in person.

159
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,180
No. The invitation is for you and Upper God Gu Jun.

160
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,520
Chang Que and I are just lords. How can we go with an Upper God's invitation?

161
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,885
I'd like to go, but I can't.

162
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:30,328
I have to learn immortal spells in the books Bo Xuan left every day.

163
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:34,085
My spiritual cultivation will be delayed after this trip.

164
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:37,050
I'll fail again when you test me.

165
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,970
Your spiritual power is in last place. Why are you afraid of the delay?

166
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,910
I can't miss one day's cultivation for my immortal base.

167
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,942
You saw me learn the Spell of Moving Things.

168
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:48,570
Come on. It's because I...

169
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,470
Because you what?

170
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,514
You helped me secretly,

171
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:56,950
so I successfully used the Spell of Moving Things.

172
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,980
You know?

173
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,485
I guess you saw me practice.

174
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:06,990
You worried I'd be impatient if I failed the exam.

175
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,210
Therefore, you orchestrated the whole thing.

176
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,942
You know that.

177
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:15,580
Hou Chi, why are you so smart?

178
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,314
You didn't get spiritual power but a clever mind during cultivation?

179
00:12:19,314 --> 00:12:21,780
Feng Ran, I'd like to go.

180
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,500
However, my Father God told me before he left

181
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,685
that if I can't be as good as an Upper God,

182
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:29,700
I can't get out of Qingchi Palace.

183
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,057
Don't worry.

184
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:33,770
Since Upper God Gu Jun appointed me as the head of Qingchi Palace,

185
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,520
I can allow you to attend a birthday party.

186
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,740
What... What if he learns of it one day?

187
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,940
It's my own responsibility.

188
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,100
- You promise. 
 - Yes.

189
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,420
Okay.

190
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,830
No. Hou Chi's look is more like that of a fox in the back hill.

191
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,530
No. Hou Chi.

192
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,540
Hou Chi!

193
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,420
Bo Xuan.

194
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:15,100
You've been gone for 10,000 years.

195
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:18,150
Why haven't you come back yet?

196
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:26,728
 ♫ Time is like you, disturbing my feelings and thoughts ♫ 

197
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:29,490
 ♫ I hold your warm hands tightly ♫ 

198
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,480
 Bo Xuan, I also want to learn spells. 

199
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,110
 To fly around like them. 

200
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,450
 Your consciousness is unstable. 

201
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,300
 You should build your immortal base. 

202
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,620
 Take it up first. 

203
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,180
 Can I not drink it? 

204
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,340
 I slept over the winter after I took it last time. 

205
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,580
 I didn't see the snow. 

206
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,480
 It's easy if you want to see the snow. 

207
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,140
 I'll show it to you if you drink it. 

208
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,871
 ♫ I hope we can be together forever ♫ 

209
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,270
 ♫ When we meet again ♫ 

210
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,940
 Go ahead. 

211
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,771
 I'm tired of the scenery here. 

212
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:06,840
 I heard the view of Observation Mountain is very lovely. 

213
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,290
 Let's go there. 

214
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,180
 However... 

215
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,980
 I'll be fine with your protection. 

216
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,940
 Let's go. 

217
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,200
 ♫ The feels. That distance. The small talk ♫ 

218
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,210
 ♫ Such good times and beautiful scenery ♫ 

219
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:31,985
 ♫ May you stay by my side ♫ 

220
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,240
 It's so beautiful. I like it so much. 

221
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,100
 If you like it, I'll bring you here when I'm free. 

222
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,230
 You're so good to me. 

223
00:14:46,557 --> 00:14:54,000
 ♫ Time is like you, disturbing my feelings and thoughts ♫ 

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,457
 ♫ I hold your warm hands tightly ♫ 

225
00:14:57,457 --> 00:15:00,630
 Bo Xuan, tell me a story. 

226
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,340
 What do you want to hear? 

227
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,760
 Tell me about the God Realm. 

228
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,014
 The God Realm is closed and all the gods have fallen. 

229
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:13,050
 I've never heard anyone talk about these things. 

230
00:15:14,457 --> 00:15:16,670
 Gods. 

231
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,757
 Gods are eternal as mountains and oceans. 

232
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:20,571
 It's their choice to upturn the mountains and seas. 

233
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:23,240
 They're the most powerful in the three realms. 

234
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,357
 True Gods rank higher than other gods. 

235
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,110
 And the Chief God is above True Gods. 

236
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,871
 She rules the universe. 

237
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:34,940
 She lives and dies together with the three realms. 

238
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,110
 Is the Chief God eternal? 

239
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,700
 Yes. She is eternal. 

240
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,185
 Then why didn't I see her in the Heavenly Realm? 

241
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:46,740
 I've never heard of her name. 

242
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,740
 Because she did something she had to do. 

243
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:08,500
 Bo Xuan, your mask is like one part of your face. 

244
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,150
 I curious about what you look like. 

245
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,380
 There's no rush. 

246
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,690
 You'll see my face someday. 

247
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,580
 Hou Chi, no matter what, you should promise me 

248
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,590
 to wear this bracelet all the time. 

249
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,200
 So that I can find you wherever you go. 

250
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,130
 Don't worry. I don't want to take it off. 

251
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,757
 I keep it for fighting. 

252
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,070
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

253
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:42,457
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫ 

254
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,440
Where are you?

255
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,785
 Where are you going? 

256
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:50,585
 Why didn't you say goodbye to me? 

257
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:52,180
 I'm going to take the divine ordeal. 

258
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,242
 Don't worry. I'll be back in 10,000 years. 

259
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:57,340
 Will it be dangerous? 

260
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,620
 When I'm back, I'll go wherever with you, let alone Qingchi Palace. 

261
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,840
Hou Chi, you just have fun and look after yourself in this life.

262
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,860
 Don't hurt yourself when I'm away. 

263
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,480
 But 10,000 years is too long. 

264
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,142
 Can I go with you? 

265
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:18,442
 Your spiritual power is low. 

266
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:20,385
 You'd be in danger if you went with me. 

267
00:17:20,385 --> 00:17:22,114
 I've been weak since I was a child. 

268
00:17:22,114 --> 00:17:26,610
 I can't share my Father God's duty but have become your burden. 

269
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,420
 I won't say goodbye to you because I don't want to see you be sad. 

270
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,360
 I'll gather the spiritual power and learn spells. 

271
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,430
 If you like, you can learn immortal spells in the books I left for you when you're free. 

272
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,400
 Then you can travel everywhere with me. 

273
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,780
 10,000 years. This is the deal between us. 

274
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,130
 I'll be back in 10,000 years. 

275
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,300
 I'll find you no matter where you are. 

276
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,210
 I'll gather the spiritual power and learn spells. 

277
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:13,740
Although my Father God is elusive,

278
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,390
he occasionally sent back an instruction feather to ask about our situation.

279
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,760
But you didn't send a letter to me.

280
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,910
When you're back, if you learned my spiritual power hasn't improved,

281
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,928
will you mock me for having the name

282
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:32,450
of an Upper God without spiritual power as the three realms did?

283
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,757
You like me so much. You won't.

284
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:39,020
Feng Ran decided to go to Observation Mountain.

285
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,800
I'll take this opportunity to find you over there.

286
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,560
I hope you won't be in danger when you take the ordeal.

287
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,800
You absolutely won't.

288
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,190
You're lucky. You'll be safe.

289
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:05,230
You said someone from Qingchi Palace hurt you with evil power.

290
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,428
And she took the gift I prepared for Lord Dong Hua.

291
00:19:08,428 --> 00:19:10,110
Qingchi Palace has isolated itself for 10,000 years.

292
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,560
Why did she hurt you for no reason?

293
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,560
Lord, I passed by Qilian Mountain with Wu Wang.

294
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,000
We met an immortal of Qingchi Palace by chance.

295
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,710
When she knew we were your apprentices, she called you nasty and spiteful.

296
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,000
I was angry, so I refuted her views.

297
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,330
She attacked me suddenly.

298
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,730
She took the treasure and almost killed me.

299
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,080
- Really? 
 - I can't lie.

300
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,760
Look!  He was hurt by an immortal of Qingchi Palace.

301
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,400
He was burned by an evil power.

302
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,428
Since someone of Qingchi Palace practiced evil power,

303
00:19:50,428 --> 00:19:52,330
it's not your fault that the gift was stolen.

304
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:56,414
Each of you is punished to return a sword to the storeroom.

305
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,900
Thank you, Lord.

306
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,771
Besides, rest here in the next few days.

307
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:07,580
I'll take you to Lord Dong Hua's birthday party in two days.

308
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,380
 Yes. 

309
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,857
Damn you, Feng Ran.

310
00:20:15,857 --> 00:20:19,170
I haven't settled with you about the past.

311
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:25,410
There's a mark of Zijin Mansion on Fire Coral.

312
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,110
You'll see.

313
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,530
You'll see what I'll do to you.

314
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,940
Wu Xu, although Lord Zi Yuan didn't ask about the details,

315
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,590
I feel unsettled.

316
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,310
- Look... 
 -  I heard Upper God Gu Jun left for 10,000 years to pick herbs for Little God.

317
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,470
I guess he wouldn't bother to attend Lord Dong Hua's birthday party.

318
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,657
Isn't there another Upper God in Qingchi Palace?

319
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:51,210
If she beats us out for that immortal...

320
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,770
That Little God's spiritual power is worse than the most junior immortals.

321
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,771
She just has the name of it.

322
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:58,230
She's also the daughter of the queen.

323
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,271
Princess Jing Zhao was born to be admired by the three realms.

324
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:05,514
But I heard that Little God was born without spiritual power.

325
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,680
She's miserable.

326
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,100
Don't talk too much.

327
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,470
Princess Jing Zhao hates people to comparing her to the Little God of Qingchi Palace most.

328
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,760
If she learned of it,

329
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,990
the whole Zijin Mansion would be punished.

330
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,880
Qing Lian, I heard His Majesty invited the Little God of Qingchi Palace

331
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,710
to celebrate the queen's birthday in the Heavenly Palace.

332
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,128
Really?

333
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:31,390
I heard it from a bodyguard of Xuan Tian Hall. It must be true.

334
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,671
They all say Princess Jing Zhao is the most beautiful in the three realms.

335
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:37,070
You don't know what that little god looks like.

336
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,414
Which of them do you think is pretty?

337
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:41,790
They say the little god is terrifying and three feet tall.

338
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,570
But she rarely goes out of Qingchi Palace.

339
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,114
It must be a folk rumor.

340
00:21:46,114 --> 00:21:48,385
She and Princess Jing Zhao are daughters of the queen.

341
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:51,150
I guess she's gorgeous as well.

342
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,950
Your Highness.

343
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,430
How dare you compare me to that fake upper god?

344
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,071
    
 Take them away and flog them 100 strokes.

345
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,760
Your Highness, please.

346
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,285
Mercy.

347
00:22:03,285 --> 00:22:07,310
If I hear her talk nonsense again, I'll send her to the Lower Realm.

348
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,350
Never to be in the Heavenly Palace again.

349
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,290
 Yes. 

350
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,550
Father God.

351
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,060
Mother God.

352
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,557
You punished two immortals just now.

353
00:22:33,557 --> 00:22:37,128
Why has this trifle come to your attention?

354
00:22:37,128 --> 00:22:40,250
As immortals, they didn't stick to their duties

355
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,920
but gossiped all day.

356
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,700
I had to punish them.

357
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,157
Zhao'er, it's difficult to become an immortal.

358
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:51,640
They just talked some gossip you didn't like.

359
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,490
You could lecture them.

360
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,790
Why did you flog them?

361
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,260
Father God.

362
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,570
Enough. Zhao'er, just listen to your Father God.

363
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,650
Your Majesty,

364
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,014
I thought you summoned Zhao'er here because you had something to tell her.

365
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,842
It's Dong Hua's birthday in a few days.

366
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:16,271
Your elder brother went to check the Lower Realm.

367
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:19,350
I want you to be there on his birthday with your second elder brother,

368
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,130
as a sign of our good faith.

369
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,528
I won't go.

370
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:27,190
Why do I have to attend such an average immortal's birthday party?

371
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,950
Zhao'er!

372
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:35,090
I heard your second elder brother asked the Lord of North Sea to go with him.

373
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:40,000
If you don't go, I'll ask another minister to go.

374
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,600
I will. I'll go.

375
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,680
I'm going to get ready.

376
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,570
Zhao'er.

377
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,260
I'm leaving.

378
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,970
Zhao'er is too bossy.

379
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,120
I'm afraid she'll get hurt.

380
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,542
Zhao'er has been spoiled since childhood.

381
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:08,240
Of course, she's being self-willed.

382
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,371
You don't have to be too hard on her.

383
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:16,100
Except for me, she's the only Golden Dragon in the world.

384
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,271
I hope she can be calmer and steadier.

385
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:23,810
Or how will she shoulder the future of the Golden Dragon Clan?

386
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,040
Your Majesty, Zhao'er is still young.

387
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,350
There'll be time for us to teach her.

388
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,442
Why are you watching me?

389
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:43,780
You're out of the palace for the first time in so many years.

390
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,170
But you're so quiet today. It's weird.

391
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,230
What's this?

392
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,880
Oh, you lied to me.

393
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,930
You came out to find Bo Xuan.

394
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,200
What are you talking about?

395
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,030
I'm going to Observation Mountain with you.

396
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,430
I'm out of the palace to help you punish Zi Yuan.

397
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,210
Nonsense. I begged you yesterday.

398
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,657
You've already... Hou Chi.

399
00:25:06,657 --> 00:25:08,160
 See you on Observation Mountain. 

400
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,928
You remember to take the spiritual spell Upper God Gu Jun gave to you.

401
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,040
I'll see how far you go.

402
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,371
 Let me find an immortal to ask. 

403
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:51,685
 Lord of the Ground is familiar with Observation Mountain. 

404
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:54,910
 He may have seen Bo Xuan. 

405
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,470
Enough? I knew you couldn't fly too far.

406
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,460
Yes. Absolutely enough.

407
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,400
Don't fly around. Find Bo Xuan in the bamboo house of the back hill.

408
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,942
I'll meet you there when I'm done with Zi Yuan.

409
00:26:21,942 --> 00:26:24,785
I heard Jing Jian would go to Dong Hua's birthday party.

410
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:25,710
Try to avoid him.

411
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,920
I'm not afraid of that down-and-out phoenix.

412
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,470
I beat his elder brother.

413
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,560
All right, don't worry. Be careful.

414
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,350
 Come on. It's the great event of the Immortal Realm every 100 years. 

415
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,660
Don't pass it by.

416
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,460
Little Lordess, you're too late.

417
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,670
Someone bought the Painting of the Lord. How about another painting?

418
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,780
I don't need it for now.

419
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:54,185
There's such an ugly man in the Immortal Realm.

420
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:58,340
- It's the Little God of Qingchi Palace. To keep evil away. 
 - Who's it?

421
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,028
The Little God of Qingchi Palace, Hou Chi.

422
00:27:01,028 --> 00:27:04,060
It's said she was born three feet tall. She's very strong.

423
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,660
Though she's ugly, unlucky immortals like to buy it back to keep away evil.

424
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,880
It's selling very well.

425
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,000
You can get it with a cheap spiritual gem, not a magic weapon, if you like it.

426
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,157
Who says the Little God of Qingchi Palace looks like that?

427
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:19,210
This portrait has been passed for thousands of years. It's always like that.

428
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,685
You're so upset.

429
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:23,342
Do you know the Little God of Qingchi Palace?

430
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:26,270
I kn... Think about it.

431
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,920
Upper God Gu Jun is glowing and handsome.

432
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,080
I don't think his daughter would be much worse.

433
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,228
Yeah.

434
00:27:33,228 --> 00:27:36,871
I also have portraits of immortals, if you like.

435
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:39,200
Look!  This is the Blessing Painting of Princess Jing Zhao.

436
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,950
You can take it back with three fine spiritual gems.

437
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,214
Come on. She's so ugly.

438
00:27:47,214 --> 00:27:49,760
I think the Little God of Qingchi Palace is better than her.

439
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,790
I don't want it.

440
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:03,060
Little Lordess, I just do a small business.

441
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,757
Why are you angry with me?

442
00:28:04,757 --> 00:28:08,460
As an immortal, you don't cultivate but fool people with these things.

443
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,170
You shouldn't set up this booth.

444
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,240
Little Lordess, you don't know.

445
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,214
The owners of these booths have no positions in the Lower Realm.

446
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:19,300
We became immortals in less than 100 years. Our spiritual power is low.

447
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,800
We can't go to Observation Mountain

448
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,371
or become Lord Dong Hua's apprentices.

449
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:26,370
We can only trade small things for magic weapons to help our cultivation.

450
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,410
Little Lordess, please have mercy. Don't ruin my business.

451
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,390
Thank you, Lordess.

452
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,780
He painted me like a ghost.

453
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,342
They say I'm three feet tall and strong. That's bullshit.

454
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:55,080
I'm just worth a cheap spiritual gem.

455
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,271
They're ignorant.

456
00:28:57,271 --> 00:29:00,785
Who'll go to Lord Dong Hua's birthday party,

457
00:29:00,785 --> 00:29:07,020
besides Second Prince Jing Jian and Princess Jing Zhao?

458
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,950
 - Who? 
 - Come on, tell us. 

459
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,840
 - Yeah. 
 - Who? 

460
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,660
 - Come on, say.  
 - Jing Zhao will come.

461
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,800
 - Tell us who'll come. 
 - Say. 

462
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,910
Lord of North Sea, Qing Mu.

463
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,390
 Qing Mu. 

464
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,560
Is it true?

465
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,110
I heard Lord of North Sea never showed up.

466
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,980
I want to battle him if there's a chance.

467
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,150
To see if he's as good as they said.

468
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,628
- Don't talk big. 
 - I...

469
00:29:32,628 --> 00:29:37,910
The Lord of North Sea, Qing Mu, has been the best of the Immortal Clan for a millennium.

470
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,260
It took him a millennium to get to the top of the lords.

471
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:46,614
He cleared all demons of of North Sea with a sword.

472
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,260
His Majesty shows respect to him without seeing him

473
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,350
and has bestowed on him the title of Lord Xing Yao of the North Sea.

474
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,480
 Xing Yao. 

475
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,960
Since Lord Qing Mu has been promoted,

476
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,400
a lot of people disagree with it.

477
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,660
They run to the North Sea and fight with him.

478
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,150
- What's the result? 
  - What's the result? 

479
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,400
 - Come on. 
 - Tell us. 

480
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:18,910
Every one of them became a dog beaten under the sword of Lord Qing Mu.

481
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,185
 Nonsense. 

482
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:24,957
 My Father God became a lord with 10,000 years in the Swamp of Netherhill. 

483
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,590
 No one can become the top of the lords in a millennium. 

484
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:34,070
I heard he's close to the princes of the Heavenly Realm.

485
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:39,228
Princess Jing Zhao likes him very much.

486
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,400
Uh... I think Lord Qing Mu will be

487
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:48,760
the son-in-law of the Heavenly Palace.

488
00:30:51,342 --> 00:30:55,030
The one that Jing Zhao likes must be handsome but ignorant.

489
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,040
I ran out of Fly Spell. Speed Spell.

490
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,860
All right, Speed Spell.

491
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:31,014
Immortal Xian Shan.

492
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,885
There are so many immortals at Lord Dong Hua's birthday party.

493
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:38,170
It's my master's 70,000th birthday, so we organized it.

494
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,610
As you can see, Lord Zi Yuan.

495
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:45,630
By the way, I wonder whom Qingchi Palace will send here.

496
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:49,210
We have sent an invitation to Qingchi Palace every year on my master's birthday.

497
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,414
However, Upper God Gu Jun is traveling outside.

498
00:31:51,414 --> 00:31:53,214
Lord Feng Ran hasn't been out for a long time.

499
00:31:53,214 --> 00:31:56,950
I guess she'll ask someone to be here as usual.

500
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,900
Your Highness.

501
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,428
   

502
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:19,070
Well, are you the Lord of the North Sea?

503
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:25,614
Your Highness, the Lord of the North Sea.

504
00:32:25,614 --> 00:32:27,620
Lord Xian Shan, you don't have to be so polite.

505
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,590
Please, Your Highness and Lord of the North Sea.

506
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,000
Princess Jing Zhao just arrived.

507
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,690
She's enjoying flowers in the back garden.

508
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,190
Where's Lord Dong Hua?

509
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,560
My master is resting in the back.

510
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,242
I'm going to see Lord Dong Hua.

511
00:32:39,242 --> 00:32:41,857
Jing Zhao is in the garden. You haven't seen her for years.

512
00:32:41,857 --> 00:32:44,571
She always talks about you. Go to stay with her for me.

513
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,130
Jing Jian, come with me.

514
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,440
You first.

515
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,750
Please.

516
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,980
You know I never deal with strangers.

517
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,260
You know Jing Zhao. She's not a stranger.

518
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,690
She's a princess.

519
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,160
I feel uncomfortable getting along with women.

520
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,580
Within the three realms,

521
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,140
you can see that there are a few people who have attached their own spiritual consciousness to paper people just like you.

522
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,714
You talk to yourself.

523
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:20,370
What's wrong with it?

524
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,557
People will think you're weird.

525
00:33:22,557 --> 00:33:24,870
I don't care about their views.

526
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,720
Qing Mu, you'll be isolated if you've been alone for too long.

527
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,580
Listen to me. It's good for you to make friends.

528
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,450
One bosom friend is enough.

529
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,070
I have you.

530
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:41,542
Don't forget we played three games of chess before we came here.

531
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,210
You lost after I let you retract a false move.

532
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,260
You came here with me because you lost.

533
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,660
I don't believe I'll fail when we have a sword fight next time.

534
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,310
Fine. Don't talk too much.

535
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,800
Just go.

536
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,270
Lord Qing Mu.

537
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,220
Qing Mu greets Her Royal Highness the Princess.

538
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,470
I didn't expect you to come to Dong Hua's birthday party.

539
00:34:12,871 --> 00:34:18,020
I heard flowers of Daze Mansion are the best of the Immortal Realm.

540
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,628
The birthday party hasn't started yet.

541
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:22,500
Why not walk around with me?

542
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,171
Are there no flowers in the Heavenly Palace?

543
00:34:24,171 --> 00:34:25,800
The Heavenly Palace...

544
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,740
Although flowers in the Heavenly Palace are good,

545
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,200
no one adores them.

546
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,640
If you don't want to walk, it's okay to sit here.

547
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,030
It's fine.

548
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,780
 The spell even bullied me. 

549
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:04,460
This is Daze Mansion of Lord Dong Hua.

550
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:16,090
It's so big. Where can I get out of here?

551
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:34,360
I guess you've never seen these flowers in the North Sea.

552
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,630
 North Sea? 

553
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:39,030
 Is it the Lord of North Sea, Qing Mu? 

554
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,290
 Why does this goddess look familiar? Have I seen her before? 

555
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,920
There are no flowers in the North Sea. So, I have never seen these flowers.

556
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,140
 It's really him. 

557
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,885
 His voice is nice. 

558
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:50,870
 He's having a relationship with Jing Zhao, 

559
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,890
 but he is still here privately meeting a female immortal. 

560
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,610
I'm not thinking.

561
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,840
What's so beautiful about these flowers?

562
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,257
You often travel the three realms.

563
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:03,420
You must see a lot of beautiful views.

564
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,280
I guess you don't care about these ordinary flowers.

565
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,810
If there's a chance,

566
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:14,610
I'd like to travel in the three realms and see the mountains and oceans with you.

567
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,090
 If Jing Zhao were to learn that someone was poaching him... 

568
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,490
I'm used to being alone.

569
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,290
It's inconvenient to take you.

570
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,742
 Why is Lord Qing Mu a dull dog? 

571
00:36:28,742 --> 00:36:30,830
 Forget it. It's none of my business. 

572
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,390
 I should go and find Bo Xuan. 

573
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,230
My Mother God's 90,000th birthday is coming soon.

574
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,620
She also wants to see you.

575
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:42,042
Do you have time to go to her birthday party in the Heavenly Palace?

576
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:43,120
 She's Jing Zhao. 

577
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,140
There'll be many guests at the party. It's okay if I'm not there.

578
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,550
Besides, I'll be cultivating by then.

579
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,180
I can't go to the Heavenly Palace.

580
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,090
You're too modest, Lord Qing Mu.

581
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,370
Who's there?

582
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:14,950
 ♫ I really want to know where you are now ♫ 

583
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,000
Who are you?

584
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,930
Sorry, I went the wrong way.

585
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,270
Stop!

586
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,000
She's just an immortal who was just eavesdropping.

587
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,557
You don't have to mind her.

588
00:37:26,557 --> 00:37:27,814
This thief is not simple.

589
00:37:27,814 --> 00:37:29,957
You go first and I'll be right there.

590
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,460
Qing Mu!

591
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,830
Sorry.

592
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,757
I thought you could avoid it. I didn't expect your spiritual power to be so low.

593
00:38:03,757 --> 00:38:05,600
Do you think you're so amazing?

594
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,400
Can a lord play tricks on others as he likes?

595
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,650
I was just curious and listened to you for a second.

596
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,785
Could you humiliate me like that?

597
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,660
I'll pay for your dress.

598
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:20,500
Can you afford it?

599
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,840
How about I give you this sword as compensation?

600
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,120
 I'm in this way because of this shit sword. 

601
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,090
 I'll teach a lesson to you. 

602
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,700
 Be done with it. 

603
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,880
 My sword is following her. I'll find her. 

604
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,585
Lord Zi Yuan, I heard you won when His Highness Jing Yang

605
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:54,900
gathered immortals to discuss theories in Kunlun last month.

606
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,770
You're knowledgeable and distinguished in the three realms.

607
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,557
I'm flattered.

608
00:38:59,557 --> 00:39:02,660
Lordess, it's invitation only here.

609
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,280
Do you have an invitation?

610
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,810
I forgot it.

611
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,670
How about this?

612
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,180
Sorry. I didn't know you were the Lordess of Qingchi Palace.

613
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,700
Please forgive me.

614
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,170
 You took them down. 

615
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,657
Don't mention it.

616
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:21,810
But Qingchi... Feng Ran.

617
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,860
Loser. You dare show up.

618
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,440
Loser?

619
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,780
I was hurt badly because you attacked me when I fought with Jing Yang.

620
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,230
You!  And you told the three realms that you defeated me.

621
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,460
How dare you?

622
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,810
You assassinated His Elder Highness for a demon.

623
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:45,271
If the two princes hadn't spared your life for the sake of Upper God Gu Jun,

624
00:39:45,271 --> 00:39:47,157
you'd have died from the thunder.

625
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:49,280
You're not keeping the door for your master.

626
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,871
What are you doing here?

627
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:53,910
Lord Dong Hua has invited Qingchi Palace to his birthday banquet.

628
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,430
As I'm in charge of Qingchi Palace, when God Gu Jun is away,

629
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,600
surely I'd be here for His Lordship's birthday.

630
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,442
What? The host isn't sending me away.

631
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:04,320
But an Upper Immortal of the Heavenly Palace is sticking his nose to it?

632
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,990
- Feng Ran. 
 - Enough.

633
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:17,900
Your Highness, I found that someone in our Immortal Realm is colluding with the Demon Clan!

634
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:35,000


635
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:44,760
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

636
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:51,640
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

637
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:58,140
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

638
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:04,160
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

639
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:11,110
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

640
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:17,590
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

641
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:24,860
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

642
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:31,210
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

643
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:48,700
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

644
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:55,220
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

645
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:02,420
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

646
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:08,620
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

647
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,500
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

648
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:24,420
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

649
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:30,910
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

650
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:37,450
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

651
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:47,450
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
