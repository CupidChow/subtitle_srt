1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:19,450


2
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:21,600
   

3
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,010
   

4
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:32,318
Master, you look happy today.

5
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,580
The tea is nice.

6
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,979
Her Royal Highness collected them from the back of the mountain yesterday.

7
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,880
- No wonder you're so happy. 
 - The water is not bad.

8
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,419
She collected the water from the stamens of flowers in the morning.

9
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:49,719
It's sweet.

10
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,580
What on earth do you want to say?

11
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:57,699
I want to say... Although you often have quarrels with Her Royal Highness,

12
00:01:57,699 --> 00:02:00,039
you still care about each other.

13
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,759
Though you've never performed the rites of mentoring and apprenticeship,

14
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,199
you are beyond teacher and student.

15
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,659
I think you want to warm the wine.

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,439
Ice Cube Bai, take this!

17
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,930
Even you can't escape from my movement.

18
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,920
It seems that I have great progress.

19
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,278
I'm not afraid of Xuan Yi anymore, let alone a group of people like him.

20
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,040
You have gotten carried away.

21
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:35,919
What do you want to do?

22
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,639
Since you've succeeded, I'm happy for you.

23
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,959
Shut up.

24
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,118
I've witnessed your trick many times.

25
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,599
I know what you mean.

26
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,758
What do I mean?

27
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,140
According to your expression,

28
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,260
you'll take me to the barrier of the Netherworld.

29
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,700
When I am beaten to death,

30
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,999
you will jump out and preach to me,

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,759
telling me not to be complacent.

32
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,819
So smart.

33
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,400
Thank you for your compliment.

34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,960
Afraid?

35
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,379
It's no use prodding me into action.

36
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:08,079
I need more exercise. Take me there next time.

37
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,019
You stay here. I'm going to the God Realm.

38
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,479
Yes.

39
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:28,340
Bai Jue, why do you come back alone?

40
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,019
Where's Shang Gu?

41
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,278
Bai Jue, Shang Gu is naughty in nature.

42
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,120
But don't beat her when something goes wrong.

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,479
I need four things.

44
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,819
Phoenix feather, a tortoise shell,

45
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,538
dragon horn, and black iron.

46
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:43,140
You want to refine a weapon?

47
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,199
Just one of them can make a great weapon.

48
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,439
But now you want four.

49
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,919
Are you going to poke a hole in the sky?

50
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,479
Not for me, but for Shang Gu.

51
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,900
Since you care about her so much,

52
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,238
- I can rest assured. 
 - Rest assured about what?

53
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,040
She hasn't opened her sacred meridian.

54
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,600
Even if you make the weapon, it won't help things at all.

55
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,499
I've opened her sacred meridian.

56
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:05,880
You did it?

57
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,700
How?

58
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,479
Your Royal Highness, you've practiced for four hours. Take a break.

59
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,479
No! It's hard to get into this state.

60
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,540
I must practice more movements.

61
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,149
You were idling days ago.

62
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,499
Why are you enlightened all of a sudden?

63
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:32,160
Shut up!

64
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,960
You're crazy!

65
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,039
Shang Gu's Chaos power is formidable.

66
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,419
You're so reckless.

67
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:39,479
A little mistake will make you vanish.

68
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,340
Why not ask us to protect you?

69
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,779
Yes.

70
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,140
 Shang Gu, sorry. 

71
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,699
Since I've opened her sacred meridian,

72
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,800
don't mind my way of teaching her.

73
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,100
Well...

74
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,439
All right.

75
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:11,579
Considering the matters concerning Xuan Yi, it's good to be strict with her.

76
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,599
Black iron is in the North Sea of Heaven.

77
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,639
I think you've lost a lot of strength from opening her meridian.

78
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,238
I'll take it to you later.

79
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,259
It's just a piece of iron.

80
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,939
I'll pick it myself.

81
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,239
Ice Cube.

82
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,838
Why are you suddenly so obsessed with Shang Gu?

83
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,838
I warn you. Don't fall in love with her.

84
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,540
Boring.

85
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,239
Bai Jue.

86
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,500
Shang Gu just received the power of an Upper God.

87
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,060
Now her meridian is opened.

88
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,260
She will suffer the first ordeal soon.

89
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,358
You should take very special care of yourself for her.

90
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,039
Don't be careless.

91
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,100
Don't be careless.

92
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,379
Evil spirit.

93
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,398
This place has no barrier. We must go back to the bamboo house.

94
00:06:07,398 --> 00:06:08,619
What do you want to do?

95
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,758
I'll fight the devils for practice. I'll be back soon.

96
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:12,718
Come back!

97
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:14,140
It's dangerous, Your Royal Highness.

98
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,200
Come back!

99
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,020
 Don't be afraid. 

100
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,540
 I've opened my sacred meridian. 

101
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,260
 The devils are a piece of cake. 

102
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,300
 They're easy to deal with. 

103
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,238
 No. If I'm defeated here, 

104
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,358
 I'll be teased by Bai Jue. 

105
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:18,798
 They're just devils. 

106
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,660
 I'll crush them. 

107
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,539
Master!

108
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,620
Where's Shang Gu?

109
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,359
Master, finally you're back.

110
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:37,980
Her Royal Highness went to fight the devils alone.

111
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,420
She makes a loud noise when fighting against the devils.

112
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,999
No.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,139
It's an ordeal only for her.

114
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,639
My god!

115
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,100
The thunder is much more frightening than common ones.

116
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,620
Why all of a sudden?

117
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,979
Will I suffer from a thunder ordeal today?

118
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,398
 The thunder has been so scary 

119
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,719
 since her sacred meridian just opened. 

120
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,380
 If she inherits the throne, 

121
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,599
 I'm afraid the earth will shake. 

122
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,540
How lucky I am!

123
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,939
Even the thunder can't hit me.

124
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,319
How fierce you are!

125
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,879
Why not hit me again?

126
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,598
 Her foundation is unstable. 

127
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,439
 If she's subjected to the thunder, 

128
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,679
 she might be hurt at the root. 

129
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,778
Bai Jue.

130
00:10:55,778 --> 00:10:57,420
What's the matter?

131
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,319
I'm familiar with these movements.

132
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,998
When will you take me to the Netherworld?

133
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:05,320
Your complacency really impresses me.

134
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,218
What do you mean?

135
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:10,778
You should know the devils would have killed you

136
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:12,670
if you had made any mistake.

137
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,218
What a coincidence!

138
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:16,258
I'm quite lucky this time.

139
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,898
I not only defeated the devils,

140
00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:20,778
but also survived the ordeal intact.

141
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:23,399
You were angry because I was lazy and afraid of the devils.

142
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,380
Now I am diligent and have taken the initiative to challenge the devils, but you're still angry.

143
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,899
Is it difficult to get along with you?

144
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,478
- For me? 
 - If you don't need it, you can return it.

145
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:37,258
No, I want it.

146
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:40,879
You scolded me and then compensated me.

147
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:46,358
Do you feel a little guilty because you scolded me too severely?

148
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:50,018
I just think you're too weak to protect yourself.

149
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:52,558
You are being kind to me for no reason.

150
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:55,679
Do you like me?

151
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,959
My taste is not so bad.

152
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,770
Among the three realms,

153
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:06,570
many people like me.

154
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,900
They're more handsome and gentle than you.

155
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,759
They're better than you.

156
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,099
I just blamed you a bit.

157
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:19,200
Why are you playing tricks?

158
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,819
I'm quite familiar with your thoughts. I can't fall for your trick.

159
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,419
Bai Jue. Bai Jue, what's wrong?

160
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:34,079
Hong Ri. Hong Ri.

161
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,519
Your master fainted with anger.

162
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,440
Hong Ri!

163
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,220
   

164
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,598
He helped her get through the ordeal and forged a divine sword.

165
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:10,860
Bai Jue treats her quite well.

166
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,440
Interesting.

167
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,718
Demon King.

168
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:20,238
How's it going?

169
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:21,558
You're right.

170
00:13:21,558 --> 00:13:24,698
The master of Pilgrim Hall has opened the sacred meridian.

171
00:13:24,698 --> 00:13:27,898
My men were defeated by her. 
    

172
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:30,519
Bai Jue is quite outstanding.

173
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,739
Zhi Yang taught her for ten thousand years but in vain.

174
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:37,600
But he just took a few days to open her sacred meridian.

175
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,819
I want to see Her Royal Highness.

176
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,478
Let your men continue to monitor Observation Mountain.

177
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:46,439
Report any news immediately.

178
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:47,900
Yes.

179
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,918
He's a true god.

180
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,440
But he suddenly fainted.

181
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,999
What the hell happened just now?

182
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:03,038
Nothing happened.

183
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:05,779
He gave me a sword and then...

184
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,359
What sword is it?

185
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,578
I didn't expect he made a weapon for you.

186
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:14,820
I've been with him for tens of thousands of years,

187
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,658
but I've never seen him treat a person so well.

188
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:21,879
Is it so difficult to forge a sword?

189
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,260
Your Royal Highness,

190
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,450
your power resource is different from that of Master.

191
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,258
Refining this sword for you under his current physical condition

192
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:31,179
will greatly damage his vitality and shorten his life.

193
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,658
Shorten his life?

194
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:33,758
I don't believe it.

195
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:37,070
He is a True God.

196
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,258
Do you think that as the successor of God,

197
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:41,079
the thunder will not hit you?

198
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,778
The 49 thunder strikes were all blocked by my master alone.

199
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:48,019
He has been badly weakened.

200
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,739
 How lucky I am! 

201
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:57,620
 Even the thunder can't hit me. 

202
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,939
He also made a weapon for you.

203
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:04,039
He is bound to lose his strength.

204
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,120
All I see is his arbitrariness.

205
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,860
I didn't expect him to do so many things for me.

206
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,449
His power has been weakened.

207
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,879
I must return to the God Realm and ask for Zhi Yang's help.

208
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,799
Your Royal Highness, take care of him.

209
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,320
Since Bai Jue is hurt,

210
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,299
the barrier is weakened.

211
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,440
The devils in Observation Mountain will find it.

212
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,258
Reset the barrier.

213
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:34,099
Don't let the devils in.

214
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,059
But Master...

215
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,778
I owe him.

216
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:39,940
I should pay it back myself.

217
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,719
Bai Jue, how dare you hurt yourself to win my confidence?

218
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,700
You are hurt so badly for me.

219
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,580
How dare I tease you and refute you?

220
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,479
Come on. I should have suffered from the thunder.

221
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:58,540
I can return the power to you.

222
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,158
Why can't I make use of the power?

223
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:12,339
I'm useless.

224
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,790
Bai Jue taught me that the divine power lies in my origin.

225
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,958
Yes. Origin.

226
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:24,350
 ♫ I really want to know where you are now ♫ 

227
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:30,625
 ♫ You're sealed in time like our memories ♫ 

228
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:38,275
 ♫ The affection in the eyes become wrinkles in the brows ♫ 

229
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:43,975
 ♫ The injury can't be seen ♫ 

230
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,339
Why are your hands still so cold?

231
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,339
Don't worry.

232
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,980
I'll always be here with you.

233
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,620
You must get better soon.

234
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:03,859
Master, report.

235
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:06,119
Since last night, the barrier of Observation Mountain

236
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,680
seems to be unstable.

237
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,940
The barrier becomes weak.

238
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,400
It seems that Bai Jue's origin is badly hurt.

239
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,330
We should take

240
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,350
this chance to teach them a lesson.

241
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,419
His hands have gotten warmer.

242
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,000
He's getting better.

243
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,018
Don't misunderstand.

244
00:19:58,018 --> 00:20:00,280
I just came to see if you were better.

245
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:04,119
I've basically recovered.

246
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:10,079
Who saved me?

247
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,619
Not me.

248
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,938
Tian Qi or Zhi Yang?

249
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:15,660
Tian Qi.

250
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,779
He...

251
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:20,039
Why do you look so bad?

252
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,118
I...

253
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,378
You're sick.

254
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:24,779
I was a little worried about you, so I didn't sleep well.

255
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,200
But I'll recover once I get some sleep.

256
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,500
Hong Ri told me

257
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,100
that you made the sword and blocked the thunder from me.

258
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,558
It's nothing.

259
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:45,258
It's nothing to you.

260
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:47,079
But it's important to me.

261
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,880
I've made a decision.

262
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,638
The God Realm has strict laws.

263
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:54,559
I owe you a salute.

264
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,660
I, Chief God Shang Gu,

265
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,618
want to learn from you, Bai Jue.

266
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:02,778
I'll always listen to you.

267
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:04,119
No matter how arbitrary you are,

268
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,519
I won't be angry with you.

269
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,450
There are thousands of ways in the world,

270
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,525
and there is no end to learning.

271
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,339
Are you willing to continue with me?

272
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:20,999
Since you say so,

273
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:24,158
I'll obey your order.

274
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:27,120
From now on, we'll go forward together.

275
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:31,960
Why are you so enlightened today?

276
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,519
What do you mean by "enlightened"?

277
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,738
I just feel a little uncombortable

278
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:39,139
about the war between the gods and devils in the future.

279
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:42,139
Also, all the goddesses in the God Realm could get injured,

280
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:44,279
including you, Zhi Yang, and Tian Qi.

281
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,839
Don't worry. I'll work hard

282
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,730
to improve my spiritual power.

283
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,538
It's a good thought.

284
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:52,639
But I have a question.

285
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,918
Tell me.

286
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:56,959
When did I act arbitrarily?

287
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,918
Are you joking?

288
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,980
I don't like joking.

289
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,480
Master, you're awake.

290
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,040
What's the matter?

291
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,259
The barrier between the Observation Mountain and the Netherworld has disappeared.

292
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:13,839
I'm afraid the devils will invade again.

293
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,499
The devils always make trouble.

294
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:19,839
I'll get changed. Wait outside.

295
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,439
Okay.

296
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,739
You haven't totally recovered.

297
00:22:41,739 --> 00:22:43,299
Don't worry.

298
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,839
Bai Jue, help!

299
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,419
I like you when you protect me.

300
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:17,678
The Netherworld is different from what I imagined.

301
00:24:17,678 --> 00:24:19,619
Ancestral God is selfless.

302
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:22,038
The Netherworld was once a blessed place in Heaven.

303
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:26,099
But it was sealed to trap the devils.

304
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,400
What kind of flowers are those? So beautiful.

305
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,659
God Slayer Flower. Highly poisonous.

306
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,318
Bai Jue, I haven't seen you for a long time.

307
00:24:43,318 --> 00:24:47,320
Shang Gu, he is the Demon King, Xuan Yi,

308
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,800
don't look at him.

309
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,038
What a clever and nice girl.

310
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:54,580
You must be Chief God.

311
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,118
I offended you in the barrier.

312
00:24:57,118 --> 00:25:03,300
Actually, this senior just wants to invite the little Chief God to the Netherworld to have a glass of wine.

313
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,278
Xuan Yi, she can't drink much wine.

314
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:07,738
She can't have it so don't waste your wine.

315
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:10,500
What if I insist?

316
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,719
Why are you so nervous?

317
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:17,339
I just want to have a chat with her.

318
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,920
Shang Gu!

319
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,920
Where's Bai Jue?

320
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,559
What did you do to him?

321
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:44,378
Don't worry. He won't have any trouble.

322
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:48,330
Only when he is away can we talk well.

323
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,999
What do you think?

324
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,520
Are you satisfied with my arrangement?

325
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:02,679
 He's Xuan Yi, the Demon King. 

326
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,680
 Don't look at him. 

327
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:07,759
I'm satisfied. Very satisfied.

328
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,619
Your arrangement is novel and interesting.

329
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,399
When I was in the God Realm,

330
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:15,640
Zhi Yang didn't allow me to play with them.

331
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,458
His stubbornness has never changed

332
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,840
for over 70,000 years.

333
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,070
You might as well stay a few more days...

334
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,070
if you like.

335
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:31,140
I know the boredom of the God Realm.

336
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,759
You're right.

337
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,079
The God Realm is quite boring.

338
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,018
How naughty you are!

339
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:40,199
Did Yue Mi look after you?

340
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,080
You know her?

341
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,460
She often stole my wine in her childhood.

342
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,399
Circumstances change with the passage of time.

343
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,418
Devils have been trapped here for years.

344
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:01,759
If you can lead the devils to be kind,

345
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,460
I think the Gods will let you return.

346
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:11,459
You are generous.

347
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:13,879
I almost destroyed the God Realm.

348
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,219
They won't welcome me back.

349
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,640
Considering how I saw Bai Jue treat the little Chief God,

350
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,660
you match him very much.

351
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,379
You're joking.

352
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:32,260
Well... I have nothing to do with him.

353
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,579
If Bai Jue heard that,

354
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:38,818
his heart would be broken.

355
00:27:38,818 --> 00:27:40,939
Why would his heart break?

356
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,939
I've known him for tens of thousands of years.

357
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:47,658
We have good days and bad days.

358
00:27:47,658 --> 00:27:49,930
But it's my first time seeing him

359
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,080
get close to a girl.

360
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:55,599
Get close to me?

361
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,200
He not only yells at me but also threatens me with profits.

362
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,219
You don't know. He is a misogynist by nature.

363
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:06,938
Even a female mosquito can't get close to him.

364
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:09,678
I once suspected that he had no sexual desire,

365
00:28:09,678 --> 00:28:12,619
let alone falling in love with a girl.

366
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:16,579
But since I saw how he treated you,

367
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:19,058
I won't have that thought anymore.

368
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:21,140
Don't talk nonsense.

369
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,960
Shang Gu.

370
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,099
Bai Jue!

371
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:00,538
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

372
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,039
Did Xuan Yi do anything to you?

373
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:05,019
He seems to have turned over a new leaf.

374
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:07,078
Yue Mi once stole wine in his hall.

375
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,839
If he had not rebelled against the God Realm,

376
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:12,160
I would have grown up in his hall.

377
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,318
We can have a negotiation. No war anymore.

378
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,590
Our little Chief God...

379
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,380
is a really compassionate person.

380
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,518
If you touch her one more time,

381
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:53,600
I'll burn the Netherworld.

382
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,210
You were not that angry

383
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,420
when I killed all your soldiers.

384
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,999
Where's the cold-blooded Bai Jue?

385
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,780
Less killing makes you compassionate,

386
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,279
so you fell in love with her?

387
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,620
Shang Gu, a man like Bai Jue

388
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,499
won't tell you his real thoughts

389
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:13,139
without uncommon means.

390
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:16,319
Shang Gu, I feel the connection between us two.

391
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,339
Why not stay in the Netherworld?

392
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:20,560
There are no laws here.

393
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,119
You can do anything.

394
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,079
But your act of pretending to be Bai Jue makes me sick.

395
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,039
Let's go.

396
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,580
Your wound from Observation Mountain hasn't healed yet.

397
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,520
Do you think you can easily take her away?

398
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,980
Xuan Yi sealed us here. What can we do?

399
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,579
I planned to bring you here to practice.

400
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:08,238
But I had no more power.

401
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:10,578
I'll try to open the barrier and you need to leave quickly.

402
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:11,900
Your power hasn't recovered.

403
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,458
I can't leave you here alone. We should leave together.

404
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,318
No. If you stay here, I'll be worried.

405
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,599
Xuan Yi wants to kill me. I can't let you face danger alone.

406
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:21,960
You know you're going to die, but you dare to stay.

407
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,000
I really admire your courage.

408
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,299
Xuan Yi, I'm your real target. I'm the Chief God.

409
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:30,639
I won't be lenient with you, then.

410
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,299
Go to find Zhi Yang.

411
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,059
Xuan Yi, the Ancestral God saved your life

412
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:45,319
and assigned the Netherworld to the devils

413
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:47,419
in order to reform the devils.

414
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,500
Why are you so stubborn?

415
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,039
When I was the Chief God 70,000 years ago,

416
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,759
you were just my follower.

417
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,159
Why should I need to explain to you what I want to do?

418
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:01,380
Have a try.

419
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,299
You will lose again after so many years.

420
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:05,619
Arrogant.

421
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:08,599
The gods let you fall here from the sky today.

422
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,100
Here you are. Go and rescue Bai Jue.

423
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,279
Don't worry.

424
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,519
He's quite lucky. He won't have any trouble.

425
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,840
Wait.

426
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,080
Aren't you surprised?

427
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,199
So... you already knew?

428
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,279
Shang Gu, it's not what you think.

429
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,659
It was planned by Bai Jue alone.

430
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:57,879
It has nothing to do with me.

431
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,780
I always treat you well.

432
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,960
It's impossible that I would cheat you.

433
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,880
Zhi Yang forced me to do it.

434
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,839
Shang Gu.

435
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:39,260
Bai Jue, you are becoming more and more naive after all these years.

436
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:49,319
It doesn't matter that the barrier is broken.

437
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,099
I can still kill you.

438
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,339
How dare you trick me?

439
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,919
What's wrong?

440
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:56,240
What did you do?

441
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,000
As early as the beginning of your rebellion,

442
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,039
the Ancestral God worried about this day.

443
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,839
He set a barrier here.

444
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,079
If you don't rebel,

445
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,478
it'll be the last chance for you and the devils.

446
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,039
But if you still do harm to the world,

447
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,158
you will be trapped on God Tying Platform

448
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,519
for the rest of your life.

449
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,599
Qing Tian, you can only trap me here.

450
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:23,300
You can't kill me.

451
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,940
One day, I will let the devils return to the world.

452
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:53,019
What's wrong?

453
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:55,559
This was a good deed for the common people of the Three Realms

454
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,279
by imprisoning Xuan Yi under the platform.

455
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,359
I shouldn't criticize you.

456
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,079
But now I'm very angry.

457
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,939
Tell me the truth. The trial at Observation Mountain. Protecting me from injury.

458
00:36:05,939 --> 00:36:10,480
Everything that you did, how much of it was prearranged?

459
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:13,299
Half.

460
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:15,058
You're honest.

461
00:36:15,058 --> 00:36:17,839
So you had arranged everything in advance

462
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,039
before I was taken to the Netherworld?

463
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,359
Xuan Yi thought you were badly hurt and didn't heal.

464
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,599
So he relaxed his vigilance.

465
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,180
You took the opportunity to defeat him.

466
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,019
They're good plans.

467
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,819
But you should tell me in advance. I could have prepared first.

468
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,940
Were the results bad?

469
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,100
I thought you were sincere when you dredged my sacred meridian,

470
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,620
helped me by forging a divine sword, and suffering the strikes of doom for me.

471
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,398
I thought you were dedicated to helping me.

472
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:47,220
I was afraid of your injury.

473
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,579
Looking back, your so-called sincerity

474
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,238
was a part of your plan,

475
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,478
and I'm just a pawn of yours.

476
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,100
You've become a god.

477
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
You've made much progress.

478
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,599
Is the process important?

479
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:03,760
Do you know what I'm angry about?

480
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,198
If the gods and devils go to war, everyone is a chess piece,

481
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,420
and no one is spared.

482
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,579
I understand your words.

483
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:12,460
But you can tell me in advance.

484
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,320
I will try my best to help you defeat Xuan Yi.

485
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,820
Why did you hide it from me?

486
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,900
Xuan Yi can spy on people's hearts.

487
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,059
It was my last resort.

488
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:26,319
Since we won, don't care about these things.

489
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,759
Bai Jue, have you prepared the wine?

490
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,739
Shang Gu made great contributions in her first war.

491
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:32,259
We have to celebrate.

492
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:36,020
No need to remind me. I've prepared it.

493
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,519
I told you not to keep Shang Gu in the dark.

494
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,860
But you don't listen to me.

495
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,559
Let's go back to the God Realm. What do you want to say?

496
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,239
Move out of my way.

497
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,059
You always have excuses.

498
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,380
I regret saluting you

499
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,599
and saying I would continue with you.

500
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,040
Mercy cannot command the army.

501
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,940
If you command the three realms

502
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,839
and need to sacrifice me,

503
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,080
I will do my best.

504
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,618
I don't want to listen to your speech.

505
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,779
Shang Gu!

506
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,700
Master, they used tricks.

507
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,319
It turns out that Qing Tian always guards against me.

508
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,638
Finally, I see his trick.

509
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:45,979
Master, this performance of Shang Gu fully meets your expectations.

510
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:48,080
She is kind and willing to save others.

511
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,638
She is the best person to succeed the Chief God to quell future disasters.

512
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:54,279
It's a pity that she's weak.

513
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,140
I wonder if she can inherit the position of Chief God within a thousand years.

514
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,399
Don't worry.

515
00:38:58,399 --> 00:39:00,860
Now I'm trapped in the platform.

516
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,279
It will only make Bai Jue relax his vigilance against me.

517
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,878
To let her master the power of Chaos as soon as possible,

518
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:10,339
they will come to me soon.

519
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,260
God Slayer Flower will bloom.

520
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,220
Since the Netherworld war, how long has it been?

521
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,839
Seven days.

522
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,660
Master, Her Royal Highness hasn't come to practice these days.

523
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:57,460
Why did Shang Gu save me with the power of Chaos at Observation Mountain that day?

524
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:00,620
I've told you several times.

525
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,000
One more time.

526
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,900
The day you fainted, I told her what you did for her.

527
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,599
She was quite anxious.

528
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:13,040
I wanted to go back to the God Realm for help.

529
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,839
But she was worried that the devils would hurt you,

530
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,918
so she saved you with her divine power.

531
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:20,259
Why not tell me that day?

532
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:24,019
Maybe it was because... as soon as you woke up, you went to the Netherworld with her.

533
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:27,539
I had no chance to tell you.

534
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:29,438
It was a hard decision for her.

535
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:31,219
It's hard to cultivate such supernatural power.

536
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:34,559
Yes. She gave you everything.

537
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,719
If I had known this, I wouldn't have let her go to the Netherworld.

538
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,819
Master, it's no use telling me.

539
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,958
Her Chaos origin is kept by you.

540
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:52,158
There are restrictions and barriers everywhere in the God Realm.

541
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:55,740
With no power, how will she lead a life?

542
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,799
I'm afraid she won't be able to stroll in the Lower Realm.

543
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,380
If you say more, go to Pilgrim Hall.

544
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,581
We're going to ask for things, not to fight.

545
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:08,581
Don't be impulsive.

546
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,438
If I had known I was used, I wouldn't have saved him.

547
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:14,180
I'm angry at the thought of that face.

548
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:29,190


549
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:38,219
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

550
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:45,000
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

551
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,420
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

552
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,579
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

553
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:04,480
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

554
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,940
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

555
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:18,260
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

556
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:24,520
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

557
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:43,459
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

558
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:49,839
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

559
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:57,019
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

560
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:03,520
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

561
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:12,299
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

562
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:19,179
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

563
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:25,459
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

564
00:43:25,459 --> 00:43:32,059
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

565
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:41,880
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
