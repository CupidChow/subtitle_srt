1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000


2
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:21,480
   

3
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,128
   

4
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:28,279
Except for the title of the Upper God,

5
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:29,957
I have no strengths.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
What's your purpose in confessing your love to me so many times?

7
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,300
Who said you were like this?

8
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,100
Rather than asking who said it, it's better to ask who in the three worlds doesn't see me that way?

9
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:42,720
Please allow me to emphasize.

10
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,170
The Immortal and Demon Realms are both respected by strength.

11
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,360
The person who matches you is not me,

12
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,528
and please don't mention this again in the future.

13
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,614
Come with me.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,585
Spring outing?

15
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:06,314
Where are they?

16
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:09,010
There's no one in this forest.

17
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,514
Paper Doll. Paper Doll.

18
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,210
Demon Jing Yuan must have found it.

19
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,850
Who's the villain? How dare you follow me?

20
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,019
Mercy, Lord of the North Sea.

21
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:32,879
I'm not a villain. I'm Jia Ye of Qingchi Palace.

22
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,379
Jia Ye.

23
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,019
I heard of you from Hou Chi.

24
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:39,019
I didn't expect the famous Lord Qing Mu would know me.

25
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:42,000
You honor me. No. How lucky I am.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,140
Why are you following me?

27
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,000
Lord, don't worry. I'm not up to something bad.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I just didn't think I'd meet you one day.

29
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,700
Do you mean I'm famous in Qingchi Palace?

30
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,257
Yes. Sure.

31
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:59,528
The scripts for story-telling we listen to every day are all about you.

32
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:02,328
Like, "meeting the princess at Heavenly Palace when you're drunk."

33
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:04,679
And "beating immortals with a sword in the North Sea."

34
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,260
All right, enough.

35
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,079
Those stories were made up. They're not true.

36
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:13,085
Let me ask you. Since you all heard about me, did Hou Chi hear about me, too?

37
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:16,320
No. Our Little Goddess has been practicing for the past 10,000 years.

38
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,757
She's not interested in that.

39
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,479
That's great.

40
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,379
Lord, so you're truly serious about our Little Goddess.

41
00:03:26,385 --> 00:03:27,960
Of course.

42
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,440
Then, does she know it?

43
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,659
I'll let her know it now.

44
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,119
Can you use the Congealing Spell?

45
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,100
Try it for me.

46
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,000
Try again.

47
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,028
What is it?

48
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:02,510
I found out that there seemed to be a powerful seal

49
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,639
inside you at Xuanjing Palace.

50
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,071
Your spiritual power is suppressed because of it.

51
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:12,390
But the bracelet gives you the great spiritual power to protect you.

52
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,100
Hou Chi, as long as you follow me back to the Demon Realm,

53
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:17,614
I'll find a way to break your seal.

54
00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:19,660
By then you'll know

55
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,540
what Bai Jue's remnant said was true on Observation Mountain.

56
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,020
You're supposed to be the most respected person in the world.

57
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,128
Go to the Demon Realm.

58
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:38,442
Restore my spiritual power.

59
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,259
If I have the strength of an Upper God,

60
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:46,670
maybe... Qingchi Palace will be able to return to the way it used to be.

61
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,710
I searched every corner of Qilian Mountain.

62
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,428
These flowers are the most beautiful.

63
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:54,270
They're for you.

64
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,840
There has been something inside me for so long.

65
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,020
I want to tell you...

66
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,240
Where did you... pick them?

67
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,028
On the west of the back hill.

68
00:05:14,028 --> 00:05:17,571
Only there but not any other place. Was there no place else?

69
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:20,700
How did you know? That's all the flowers.

70
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,828
They're the priceless treasures Chang Que asked from Flood Dragon Clan.

71
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:25,985
They're used as medicine.

72
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,328
It took him more than 100 years to successfully cultivate them on Qilian Mountain.

73
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:33,799
Not many in all.

74
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:38,259
He's been waiting for the seeds after they faded day and night.

75
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,000
But you ruined them.

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,700
Uh, I... I'll plant them back.

77
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,730
They won't live.

78
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,170
 Which mean thief picked all my medicinal flowers? 

79
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,780
 What's wrong with him? How could he pick them? 

80
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,459
I... I... I'll find the seeds for him.

81
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,779
Idiot.

82
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,542
Now, Qing Mu has the Tai Cang Spear,

83
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:13,799
which makes him the best Upper Lord in the Immortal Clan.

84
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:16,385
Mother God, what do you think of him?

85
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:20,930
I heard your Father God say you liked him very much.

86
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,639
I've never adored someone like this.

87
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,028
I want to spend the rest of my life with him

88
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:30,310
and tie the knot.

89
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,640
There are many immortals who like you in the Immortal Realm.

90
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,457
Why do you choose him?

91
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:40,520
I've been the princess of Heavenly Palace since I was a child.

92
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,785
All immortals either flatter me or fear me when they meet me.

93
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:49,420
Only Qing Mu is neither humble nor arrogant when he meets me.

94
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:55,050
He described his trips in the three realms eloquently to Jing Jian.

95
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,280
I like him because he's cool.

96
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,285
I thought I could travel in the three realms with him one day.

97
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:03,600
And we could be a happy and free couple.

98
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,640
But love can't be forced.

99
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,628
I heard he's taken by Hou Chi.

100
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,500
Mother God, don't listen to gossip.

101
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,728
I believe, within the three realms, except Jing Jian,

102
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:16,419
I'm closest to him.

103
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,959
He's never gotten along with girls before.

104
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,379
I'm guessing Hou Chi used an evil spell. That's what kidnapped him.

105
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:28,059
Mother God, I'm your daughter.

106
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:31,290
You can't be partial to Hou Chi.

107
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,857
How would I care about what Hou Chi thinks?

108
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:37,990
I'm afraid you'll get hurt in this relationship.

109
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,119
I know you gave me the Feathered Umbrella

110
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:45,770
because you don't want me to lose to Hou Chi.

111
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,760
But the Feathered Umbrella seemed to be disloyal to me on Observation Mountain.

112
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,779
It didn't listen to me for a second.

113
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,139
Really?

114
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,580
Take it out. Show it to me.

115
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,579
 I'll kill you. 

116
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:13,799
It's him.

117
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,099
Demon Power.

118
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:21,600
Mother God, who's capable of doing something to your Feathered Umbrella?

119
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,340
You can leave now.

120
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,500
 Yes. 

121
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,520
Since the God Realm closed,

122
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,570
Pilgrim Hall fell down into the Heavenly Realm.

123
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,500
I even thought that Mu Guang, Gu Jun, and I

124
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,819
were the last people of the God Realm.

125
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,579
I didn't expect...

126
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,380
60,000 years have passed.

127
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,000
The four masters were sealed with the God Realm.

128
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,159
Even if you're Tian Qi, so what?

129
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,479
In today's Heavenly Realm,

130
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:10,459
I'll never make it easy for you.

131
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,559
Qing Mu, what are you doing here?

132
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,059
Where is Jia Ye?

133
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:30,030
I distracted him. I want to make breakfast for you.

134
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,099
A bowl of pear soup.

135
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,342
There are no pears on Qilian Mountain.

136
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:37,640
Where did you get the pears?

137
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,985
I got up early and bought them in the Human World.

138
00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:41,620
You haven't healed yet,

139
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,100
- but you helped me... 
 - Sit down.

140
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,720
Let me tell you, the recipe for this soup is very complex.

141
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,420
I can use the Spiritual Fire Spell to control the timing.

142
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,742
However, it's a way of immortals.

143
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:56,320
We should cook it as humans do.

144
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,980
Let it simmer.

145
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:03,879
Slow-cook it until it's crumbly and soft.

146
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,660
Why are you watching me?

147
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,400
I didn't expect that not only are you good-looking, but you are also great at cultivating.

148
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,885
I didn't expect you to be good at cooking.

149
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:27,685
Not really. I just learned it.

150
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:32,060
I almost burned up Xuanjing Palace when I made buns for you last time.

151
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,600
After that, no matter what you make, I will be very, very supportive by eating it up.

152
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,228
Then I'll make food only for you.

153
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,680
- Let me help you. 
 - Okay.

154
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,099
It's almost done. Let me taste.

155
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,339
- What? 
 - Nothing.

156
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,220
I don't think the timing is good.

157
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,628
It should be cooked for a while.

158
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,919
Who is it? Come out.

159
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,499
Who are you?

160
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:06,400
You dare not show your face.

161
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:13,160
I didn't realize Demon Lord Zi Yue would collude with Qingchi Palace.

162
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,280
Stay now that you have come.

163
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,610
You dare not make moves.

164
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,728
What?

165
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,640
Are you afraid I'll recognize you?

166
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,390
What a great spiritual power.

167
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,257
Wait for me here.

168
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,700
It's you.

169
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,880
I didn't go to you, but you appear in front of me.

170
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,940
I'm not afraid of today's Demon God.

171
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,920
Who are you? How dare you break into Qingchi Palace?

172
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,599
 Bai Jue. 

173
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:07,300
 No. He's not Bai Jue. 

174
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,720
 He's Qing Mu. 

175
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,971
Who was it?

176
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:17,659
Just a crappy phoenix.

177
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:20,019
Hou Chi, are you hurt?

178
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,770
Your Highness.

179
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,650
Your Highness, is there something on your mind?

180
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,019
I went to Qingchi Palace today.

181
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:11,559
I found Demon Lord Zi Yue of the Demon Realm is the Tian Qi who destroyed the world.

182
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,039
The Destroyer Demon God?

183
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,339
Wasn't he killed by Master Bai Jue 60,000 years ago?

184
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't know why he's still alive.

185
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,500
Fortunately, his spiritual power hasn't been restored to that of a True God yet.

186
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,585
I don't have to fear him for now.

187
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:30,780
Your Highness, I think you should tell His Majesty about it.

188
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,080
The existence of the Destroyer Demon God is a threat to the three realms.

189
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,859
He knows an old secret about me, which controls me.

190
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:43,119
I can't tell His Majesty about it.

191
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:45,790
You can't tell it to anyone.

192
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,150
I'm only loyal to Your Highness.

193
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,157
I'll never disobey you.

194
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,010
Feng Nv, I picked you from the Phoenix Clan to be my trusted fairy.

195
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,839
I trust you.

196
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,700
We must kill Demon Lord Zi Yue.

197
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,500
If we keep standing against the Demon Clan, it might be the best move at this point.

198
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,580
We can never give him a chance to breathe.

199
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,642
But immortals and demons have been deadlocked for years.

200
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:13,970
Now, His Majesty wants to make peace with them.

201
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,540
How do we break it?

202
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,719
Qing Mu.

203
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:20,020
Tai Cang Spear.

204
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,100
He's of unknown origin.

205
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,560
If he's Bai Jue,

206
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,540
maybe I can use him against the Demon Clan.

207
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,680
If he's not,

208
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,439
I can use him...

209
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,880
to be a big help to me.

210
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,799
 Mother God. 

211
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,080
You may leave.

212
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,900
Yes.

213
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,399
Mother God.

214
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,339
Why are you being so polite?

215
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:07,280
Mother God, I have a request.

216
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,619
Please tell my Father God to...

217
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,980
arrange my marriage.

218
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,540
Who's she?

219
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,470
Why did she come to Qingchi Palace?

220
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,040
Don't mind it. She came for me.

221
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,240
Now that she met me, she won't come to Qingchi Palace again.

222
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,400
She's an immortal. And she broke into Qingchi Palace.

223
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,350
I'm afraid I can't get rid of it if I wanted to.

224
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,919
You're overthinking it.

225
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,042
You can take that energy to care about my affairs.

226
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:52,100
She's your old sweetheart?

227
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,079
That crappy phoenix...

228
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,520
Anyway, it's none of your business.

229
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,660
I'll take care of it.

230
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,379
Can't I take care of it,

231
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:06,319
or do you think the spiritual power in my body is not suitable to manage it?

232
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,380
Both of them.

233
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,380
You said you could unlock the seal inside me that day.

234
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,039
Yes.

235
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,920
Nothing in the world comes without cost.

236
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,370
You found that there was a seal inside me.

237
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,859
My Father God could have certainly found it. But he didn't tell me.

238
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:25,880
Do I have to pay the price if I want to break the seal inside me?

239
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,830
You're smart.

240
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,079
Hou Chi, there's a God Sense inside you.

241
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:37,660
To seal it, your spiritual veins were also sealed.

242
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,257
If you want to unlock them and cultivate the spiritual power,

243
00:19:40,257 --> 00:19:41,820
while you break the seal,

244
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,000
the God Sense inside you will wake up.

245
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,600
What will happen to me if it wakes up?

246
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,120
I don't know.

247
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,214
Maybe you can co-exist together,

248
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:57,780
or the two of you will become one.

249
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,920
You would no longer be you.

250
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,885
Lord Qing Mu,

251
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:07,670
no matter how good your spiritual power is, you can't see through the door.

252
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,060
Hou Chi, if the seal is broken,

253
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,540
you'll become the most powerful in the world.

254
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,200
It'll protect you and Qingchi Palace.

255
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,170
No one in the world can insult or bully you.

256
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,420
I just pushed you gently.

257
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,360
Why are you bleeding?

258
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,239
I suffered internal injuries because of the attack.

259
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,140
Now...

260
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,559
 Hou Chi, don't go. It hurts. 

261
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,239
 I won't go. I'll stay with you. 

262
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,560
 Are you better? 

263
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,419
 Much better. 

264
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,860
Let me check it.

265
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,660
Hou Chi.

266
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,679
Qing Mu.

267
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,060
You should go back to rest early since you're hurt...

268
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,914
or you'll catch a cold.

269
00:21:27,914 --> 00:21:30,942
I was injured in Qingchi Palace.

270
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:34,490
Its owner should take care of me.

271
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,579
Lord of the North Sea, you're out of your depth.

272
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,360
Qing Mu, stop it.

273
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,828
You're weak. Your spiritual veins are in disarray.

274
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:48,859
It's a sign of death.

275
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:51,459
You're hurt badly.

276
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,520
Hou Chi, I can't walk today.

277
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,940
I'm afraid I have to stay a little longer in Qingchi Palace.

278
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,860
Fine. You just get some rest in Qingchi Palace.

279
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,920
It seems ordinary medicine can't heal you.

280
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,885
You must be fixed by acupuncture.

281
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,840
Hou Chi, where are your needles?

282
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,279
How can acupuncture cure an immortal?

283
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,885
My medical skill is excellent.

284
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,000
Your spiritual power is better than mine,

285
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,640
but you suffered an injury in Qingchi Palace.

286
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,040
It's my responsibility.

287
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,000
Aren't you an immortal of Heavenly Palace?

288
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,820
What does Qingchi Palace have to do with you?

289
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:40,470
It was none of my business before.

290
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,720
But Qingchi Palace is my business now.

291
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,728
Hou Chi, I want to get some rest in my room.

292
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:55,259
Are you better?

293
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,180
   

294
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,320
Father God, I thought a lot when I was grounded recently.

295
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,485
I was shortsighted that day.

296
00:23:20,485 --> 00:23:24,900
I promoted Zi Yuan to repay the favor, which caused problems between immortals.

297
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,600
I was wrong.

298
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,950
I'm glad to hear you thought that way.  It gives me peace of mind.

299
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,239
You're my eldest son.

300
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:35,219
You should focus on the three realms.

301
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:37,980
You can't be emotional again.

302
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,440
Yes, Father God.

303
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,059
Get up.

304
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,760
Now we know where the Halberd of Sun and Moon is.

305
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,742
And the Tai Cang Spear has picked its owner.

306
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:56,785
Demon Emperor has promised me to look for the Purple Moon Whip in the Demon Realm.

307
00:23:56,785 --> 00:24:02,190
Next, I want you two brothers to find the Ancient Emperor Sword.

308
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,379
Let Yang'er do it.

309
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:10,740
Yeah.

310
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,300
My memory is poor.

311
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,900
Jian'er, you stay at Heavenly Palace.

312
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,442
We have something else for you to do.

313
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:24,610
The three realms have talked about Zhao'er and Lord of the North Sea for years.

314
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,580
Zhao'er was young before. Now she has grown up.

315
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,985
As her parents, we should pay more attention to her.

316
00:24:32,985 --> 00:24:36,259
Since Lord of the North Sea doesn't want to come to Heavenly Palace,

317
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:40,279
you go and invite him here for us.

318
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,099
Now he's the owner of the Tai Cang Spear.

319
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,480
He's important to the Immortal Clan.

320
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,060
I want to summon him here to take charge as commander-in-chief of the army.

321
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,000
Since Zhao'er has feelings for him...

322
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,185
Jian'er, you go to Qingchi Palace to pass my edict

323
00:24:57,185 --> 00:25:00,920
that I am rewarding him with a marriage to Zhao'er.

324
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,620
Your Majesty, you're wise.

325
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,779
The commander-in-chief deserves Zhao'er.

326
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,880
Father God. Mother God.

327
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,328
Qing Mu is used to leading a free life.

328
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:15,199
I'm afraid he doesn't want to be a minister.

329
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:20,342
Besides, the story of him and Zhao'er is just a rumor made by the troublemakers.

330
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:22,059
It's not true.

331
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:24,719
Brother, I'm serious about him.

332
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:29,160
Zhao'er, if Qing Mu liked you, he'd have come to ask for your hand,

333
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,385
instead of going to Qingchi Palace to avoid you.

334
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,659
Father God, Zhao'er is beautiful.

335
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,439
She will have no problem getting a good husband.

336
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:40,219
Why must we impose?

337
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:43,040
Jing Jian, you're my second eldest brother.

338
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:49,260
Jian'er, do you mean Qing Mu doesn't like Zhao'er?

339
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,920
Father God, it's not like that.

340
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,480
Zhao'er!

341
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,239
Jian'er, although you and Qing Mu are best friends,

342
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:00,440
marriage is huge.

343
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,079
How do you know he'd refuse our kindness?

344
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,239
- But he... 
 - No more!

345
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:09,360
Just go there.

346
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:14,580
Yes.

347
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,814
 Mother God knows Qing Mu won't agree. 

348
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:22,957
 Why did she ask me to check it? 

349
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,928
 Isn't she embarrassing herself? 

350
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:27,560
 If I express my intention for the visit, 

351
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,239
 Feng Ran will scold me. 

352
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,440
 All right, 

353
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,640
 I'll tell Qing Mu about it when I arrive at Qingchi Palace. 

354
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,259
 Ask him to write a letter to refuse the marriage. 

355
00:26:43,657 --> 00:26:45,114
Your Second Highness,

356
00:26:45,114 --> 00:26:49,580
Heavenly Queen ordered us to go to Qingchi Palace with you.

357
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,860
With so many soldiers?

358
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,585
Heavenly Queen said the Demon Clan has picked fights. They are often disrupting the Heavenly Realm.

359
00:26:57,585 --> 00:26:59,728
She's afraid something will happen to you on the way.

360
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,950
Mother God didn't do that when I went to the Luocha Region.

361
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,819
Now I'm going to Qingchi Palace and she...

362
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:08,319
You are dismissed.

363
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,339
I'll go there by myself.

364
00:27:14,771 --> 00:27:19,014
What? Can you not understand?

365
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:23,640
Your Second Highness, don't blame us.

366
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,128
We're just following orders.

367
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:28,110
We can't disobey the will of the Heavenly Palace.

368
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,885
Your Second Highness, don't make it hard on us.

369
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,271
Demon Lord Zi Yue is with Hou Chi every day.

370
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:47,214
I must do something.

371
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,779
I'm going to take her to Dibei City of the Human World.

372
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:53,839
No one can bother us there.

373
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,219
I can tell her everything inside me.

374
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,314
Do you think she'll refuse me?

375
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,760
If she refuses me, I'll burn you.

376
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,879
Hou Chi.

377
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,219
- Lord Qing Mu. 
 - Where's Hou Chi?

378
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:28,219
Demon Lord Zi Yue said he was uncomfortable.

379
00:28:28,219 --> 00:28:31,859
He asked Little Goddess to walk with him early this morning.

380
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:35,960
Damn. He lied to Hou Chi.

381
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,300
Why did you get it out?

382
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,839
Be careful. Be careful.

383
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,160
Oh, it's all right.

384
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,280
Lord Qing Mu, give it back to me.

385
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,590
I'll put it back. This is Little Goddess's treasure.

386
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,060
She has never allowed us to touch it.

387
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,559
Treasure?

388
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:56,400
It has no spiritual power. It's Hou Chi's treasure?

389
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,439
Lord Bo Xuan gave it to Little Goddess.

390
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:00,079
Little Goddess cherishes it.

391
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,679
From Bo Xuan?

392
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,820
On Little Goddess's birthday every 5,000 years,

393
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,480
Lord Bo Xuan would make a wood carving for her.

394
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,540
This is Hou Chi's birthday gift?

395
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,939
Yes.

396
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,080
September 6th.

397
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,520
Today.

398
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,959
It's Hou Chi's birthday.

399
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,319
Lord Qing Mu,

400
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:24,680
don't mention her birthday in front of Little Goddess.

401
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,079
Why?

402
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,420
After Lord Bo Xuan left,

403
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,885
Little Goddess has hated birthdays the most.

404
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:35,342
She doesn't allow us to celebrate it.

405
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:37,628
Whoever dares suggest celebrating her birthday

406
00:29:37,628 --> 00:29:40,080
would be ignored for half a month.

407
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,820
 My Father God went to find treasures for me. 

408
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,371
 He rarely comes back. 

409
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:48,439
 Feng Ran wasn't here at that time. Qingchi Palace is quiet. 

410
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:50,980
 Only Bo Xuan was with me. 

411
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,320
 Later, Bo Xuan left, 

412
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,199
 I never took half a step out of Qingchi Palace. 

413
00:29:56,199 --> 00:30:00,359
 Turns out you grew up like that in Qingchi Palace all these years. 

414
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,940
 I envy you forgetting your memories sometimes. 

415
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,940
Jia Ye, can you do me a favor?

416
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:21,142
You want to celebrate Hou Chi's birthday?

417
00:30:21,142 --> 00:30:23,800
It's not because we forget it's her birthday, but because she...

418
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,439
I know. She doesn't like her birthday.

419
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:29,300
Then, why do you bother to do that?

420
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,800
I'll be with her on her birthday every year.

421
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,171
You had better keep your word.

422
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,319
About the seal inside me,

423
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:48,180
I've decided not to break it.

424
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,079
I'm Hou Chi. I won't become anyone.

425
00:30:56,014 --> 00:30:57,400
Take this Instruction Feather.

426
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,319
You can find me with it if you need anything.

427
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,328
Demon LordZi Yue, thank you.

428
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,110
However, Qingchi Palace is always impartial.

429
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,100
We won't be partial to the Demon Clan.

430
00:31:07,728 --> 00:31:09,630
What are you thinking about?

431
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,079
It's my personal item.

432
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,839
It's my friendship to you. Not about the major issues.

433
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,219
Uh... Demon Lord Zi Yue.

434
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:20,139
Hou Chi, this is my...

435
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:25,785
Your Royal Highness, I know you're busy.

436
00:31:25,785 --> 00:31:28,600
But you should treat everyone the same.

437
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,040
You can't just stay with someone.

438
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,420
What do you mean?

439
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,580
Why have you come to me?

440
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,040
Go with me and you'll see.

441
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,299
Go.

442
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,420
Hou Chi.

443
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,039
What's he doing?

444
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,619
What can that fool do?

445
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:22,200
He's doing that for you.

446
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,259
Look.

447
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,180
I wonder if she likes birthday (long-life) noodles.

448
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,740
Birthday noodles? You told him?

449
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,485
It's not me but that noisy rabbit.

450
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,870
It's nothing to do with me.

451
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,380
Hou Chi.

452
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:42,360
Hot and fresh noodles are the best.

453
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,299
Taste. Are you hungry?

454
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,357
I hate my birthday.

455
00:32:50,357 --> 00:32:52,840
Taste. Here.

456
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:01,220
Is it good?

457
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,585
I'll make it for you every year if you like.

458
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,839
Don't kid me.

459
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,300
Really.

460
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,000
I'll cook birthday noodles for you every year.

461
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,500
Not just today.

462
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,580
I'll cook for you if you want to eat.

463
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,219
Come on. Eat more.

464
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,419
Here.

465
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,860
Qing Mu, why do you bring me here?

466
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,399
You like fireflies.

467
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,271
There are many fireflies on Qilian Mountain.

468
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:54,710
But it's difficult to find them during the day.

469
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:59,119
So I took a lot of trouble to get these 9,900 fireflies for you.

470
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,842
Why did you do that since it's so troublesome?

471
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,710
Because you like them.

472
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,520
I'll do anything you like.

473
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,239
And I'll avoid anything you hate.

474
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,185
If you like seeing the sights,

475
00:34:12,185 --> 00:34:14,600
I'll go with you to see them, wherever they are.

476
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,800
If you like peace,

477
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,140
I'll stay with you in this wilderness

478
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,850
to live a quiet life.

479
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,719
Qing Mu, what I want is a forever love.

480
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,657
If you can't do it, you don't have to talk too much.

481
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,679
We're still friends.

482
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,320
Don't change my mind.

483
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,080
I can do it.

484
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:49,019
I was serious from my first words.

485
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:52,340
Hou Chi, I like you.

486
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:57,920
I really like you.

487
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,840
So what?

488
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,528
In these thousands of years,

489
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:06,114
I witnessed the decline of Qingchi Palace from its greatness.

490
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,500
Flowers don't always bloom.  Scenery doesn't always last. 
  (Nothing stays the same) 

491
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:14,600
No one can always stay with the other one.

492
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,020
I can.

493
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,640
Hou Chi,

494
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,659
Bo Xuan may leave.

495
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:24,040
Your Father God may leave.

496
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,999
Everyone will leave. But I won't.

497
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,759
I'm serious about you as the day is long.

498
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,579
I'll prove it...

499
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,739
if you give me a chance to stay with you.

500
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:48,000
 ♫ The feels. That distance. The small talk ♫ 

501
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:51,880
 ♫ Such good times and beautiful scenery ♫ 

502
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:58,685
 ♫ May you stay by my side ♫ 

503
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:06,000
Insects of the grass and trees, summer life and winter death. 
  (Nothing lasts forever) 

504
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,379
Even if I trust you, I don't believe myself.

505
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,810
Besides, I have to find Bo Xuan.

506
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,760
And Qingchi Palace—

507
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,370
 ♫ Time is like you, disturbing my feelings and thoughts ♫ 

508
00:36:21,371 --> 00:36:25,530
Hou Chi, I'll prove it.

509
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,960
Fireflies will die, but I won't leave you.

510
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,300
 ♫ I can never forget the memories of you ♫ 

511
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,442
 ♫ I can never forget the memories of you ♫ 

512
00:36:39,442 --> 00:36:41,071
Why do you bring me here?

513
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:42,670
Don't speak.

514
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:48,057
 ♫ When I meet you ♫ 

515
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,800
 ♫ I hope we can be together forever ♫ 

516
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,800
Look! I was born here.

517
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,360
It's in the middle of nowhere.

518
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,460
There's only the sky and the sea.

519
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,339
It's lonelier than Qingchi Palace.

520
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:08,279
I'd cultivated and killed demons here day after day.

521
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,819
I don't know who my relatives are.

522
00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:14,539
I don't know why I came to the Heavenly Realm.

523
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,160
And I don't know where I'll go.

524
00:37:22,514 --> 00:37:25,560
But since the first time I met you on Observation Mountain,

525
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,320
I knew you were the one that I'd been looking for.

526
00:37:32,014 --> 00:37:34,157
See the line where the sky meets the sea.

527
00:37:34,157 --> 00:37:37,339
They rely on each other and stay together.

528
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,499
I know...

529
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:43,900
I know you have a lot of responsibility.

530
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,610
There's someone you can't forget.

531
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:48,779
I just hope you don't forget to look around when you've gone too far.

532
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:50,899
As long as the sea isn't dry,

533
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:53,700
I'll always stay with you.

534
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,800
 ♫ The feels. That distance. The small talk ♫ 

535
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,710
 ♫ Such good times and beautiful scenery ♫ 

536
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:10,985
 ♫ With me and you ♫ 

537
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:27,019
Where are they? They're taking too long.

538
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:29,930
If they aren't back soon, it won't be her birthday anymore after 1:00 a.m.

539
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:32,600
It's Her Royal Highness.

540
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,719
- Hou Chi. 
- Your Royal Highness.

541
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,020
Your Royal Highness, here you are.

542
00:38:37,157 --> 00:38:40,500
Your Royal Highness, this is the wine God Gu Jun hid in the back hill.

543
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,460
Lord Chang Que just dug it up.

544
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,160
Taste it, Little God.

545
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:53,379
It's good.

546
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,659
Hou Chi.

547
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,419
Since I was born,

548
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:20,880
this sword was my most precious and beloved thing.

549
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,379
Today, I'll give it to you.

550
00:39:26,379 --> 00:39:31,259
I hope it'll always be with you and protect you.

551
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:37,600
 ♫ I really want to know where you are now ♫ 

552
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:42,600
 ♫ You're sealed in time like our memories ♫ 

553
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,659
I'm so happy today.

554
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:47,379
Since my Father God and Bo Xuan left,

555
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:50,780
no one else has done this for me.

556
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:55,819
 ♫ The injury can't be seen ♫ 

557
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:57,471
Thank you, Qing Mu.

558
00:39:57,471 --> 00:40:00,771
 ♫ The dream is incomplete ♫ 

559
00:40:00,771 --> 00:40:03,140
 ♫ But I still miss you so much ♫ 

560
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:10,171
 ♫ What's in my mind is what I can't get over ♫ 

561
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:13,600
 ♫ Time goes by, how many chances can tie us together ♫ 

562
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,971
 ♫ It's a long journey, about a thousand years ♫ 

563
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,800
Hou Chi, happy birthday to you.

564
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,670
 ♫ It's dreamlike and aimless ♫ 

565
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,000
 ♫ For one single glance at you ♫ 

566
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 ♫ I don't regret cultivating myself, even if I have to live alone ♫ 

567
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:46,710
 Shang Gu, I'll always be like your brother. 

568
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,760
 No matter what happens between us, what we experience, 

569
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,220
 I'll stand by your side forever. 

570
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,959
 I like you. 

571
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:59,920
 I just want to let you know. 

572
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,880
 You can refuse me, but you can't push me away. 

573
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,459
 10,000 years is fine. 

574
00:41:05,459 --> 00:41:07,400
 Or 100,000 years. 

575
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,499
 I just want to like you and be with you 

576
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:13,740
 till I die. 

577
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:21,457
Master, I thought we were here to celebrate Her Royal Highness's birthday.

578
00:41:21,457 --> 00:41:23,128
What are we waiting for?

579
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:42,030


580
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,040
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

581
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,940
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

582
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:04,400
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

583
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:10,460
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

584
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:17,440
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

585
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,920
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow ♫ 

586
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:31,240
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

587
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:37,800
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

588
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:55,000
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

589
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,580
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

590
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:08,760
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

591
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:16,060
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

592
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:23,800
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

593
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:30,650
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

594
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:37,200
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

595
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:43,750
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

596
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:53,820
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
