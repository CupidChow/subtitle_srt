1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,020


2
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:21,000
   

3
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,548
   

4
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,500
If you're determined not to lend it to me, I can only offend you.

5
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,569
How do you know the core of Eight Diagrams Swords Trap?

6
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:57,128
 When I was three hundred years old, 

7
00:01:57,128 --> 00:01:59,649
 I saw this trap in Bo Xuan's old book. 

8
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,629
Who asked you to come here?

9
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,468
How dare you steal the treasure?

10
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:06,148
I'm just a nameless and mediocre person.

11
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,189
It seems the tower and you have merged into one.

12
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,788
You can't leave the tower.

13
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,909
I don't care if you saw my true body.

14
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,549
In the past 60,000 years, there have been many people who have seen my true body.

15
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,006
But no one has defeated me and taken the Soul Tower away.

16
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:21,348
Five elements and eight diagrams, yin and yang create each other.

17
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,508
I can decipher your trap.

18
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,290
How presumptuous!

19
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:37,849
- This... 
 - This is the exclusive bone-corrosion evil aura here.

20
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:39,508
It will eat away at your bones.

21
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:41,588
For thousands of years,

22
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:44,669
anyone who tried to steal the treasure have not survived after being infected.

23
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,910
So shall you.

24
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,669
Quick. Help me remove the God-Sealing Spell for me.

25
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:03,968
I'll restore you. Quickly!

26
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:05,888
If anything happens to Hou Chi, I won't forgive you.

27
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:07,350
Come on!

28
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,608
It is rare for you to have such a cultivation at such a young age.

29
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:21,868
It's a pity that you harbor evil intentions and want to steal the treasure.

30
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,248
You shouldn't blame me if you die here.

31
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:28,588
If you tell me who asked you to steal the Soul Tower,

32
00:03:28,589 --> 00:03:31,169
I can give you a quick death.

33
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,949
What contributions have you made?

34
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,349
Why are there so many ordinary blessings that protect you from evil aura?

35
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,550
Dibei City?

36
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,707
You are the Little Goddess in Qingchi Palace, Hou Chi.

37
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,889
You protected Dibei City.

38
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,710
No, I have nothing to do with Qingchi Palace.

39
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,669
It's okay that you don't admit it.

40
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:24,269
You said you wanted to take the tower to save someone.

41
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,569
Is that true?

42
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:28,789
Lord, the purpose of borrowing the Soul Tower today

43
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:31,348
is to save the my friend whose life is on the line.

44
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:34,269
He needs the Soul Tower to regather his spiritual consciousness,

45
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,928
so the only thing I could do was to enter the Underground Palace.

46
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:39,789
Please lend it to me, Lord.

47
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:09,009
Thank you, Lord Bi Xi.

48
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:13,349
Do you know why I'm willing to help you?

49
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,248
I've been staying here for thousands of years.

50
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:19,490
The Soul Tower's spiritual aura formed me.

51
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,109
I was enlightened by True God Bai Jue,

52
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,209
he asked me to purify the evil aura and protect the Human Realm.

53
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:29,669
A few days ago, immortals and demons fought in the Luocha Region.

54
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:31,449
War devastated the Human Realm.

55
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,109
You stopped two clans from fighting,

56
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,469
or people in Dibei City would have met with a catastrophe.

57
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:39,589
Since you saved the realm,

58
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,169
I lent you the tower to repay your kindness.

59
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,688
Hou Chi from Qingchi Palace will remember your help.

60
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:47,508
If you need any help,

61
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,228
just send a letter to Qingchi Palace.

62
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:53,009
I'll surely help you no matter what it is.

63
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:55,549
Okay.

64
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,068
Since you need to save someone, just go back.

65
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:01,928
But remember, you should return the Soul Tower as soon as possible.

66
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:05,549
My spiritual aura can only suppress evil aura for a short time.

67
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:08,068
Otherwise, there will be much evil aura in the Human Realm.

68
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:09,389
Many people will suffer.

69
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:10,920
I'll remember that.

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,500
When my old friend wakes up, I will send this Soul Tower back to you immediately.

71
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,308
Lordess?

72
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:41,990
Why are you here?

73
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,269
Aren't the three realms in chaos?

74
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,049
Maybe Qingchi Palace will also be involved in the future.

75
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:49,300
I'm here to ask for some elixirs to protect myself,

76
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,050
or to say life-saving elixirs.

77
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,950
Life-saving?

78
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,149
I remember the last time I wanted to prepare some elixirs for you.

79
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,849
You didn't like those elixirs,

80
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:01,068
and you didn't want to use them to take a bath.

81
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:02,189
Did I say that?

82
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,629
Yes.

83
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:10,148
Lord, you aren't asking for the elixirs for yourself. Right?

84
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,288
- Are you going to give them to me or not? 
 - No.

85
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:14,830
Chang Que!

86
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,028
Okay, I can give you some.

87
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:20,239
Tell me! What elixirs do you want?

88
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,670
Elixirs that can prevent evil aura.

89
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,989
What a coincidence.

90
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,949
It took me a hundred years to make the Almighty Elixir.

91
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,669
This elixir can not only dissolve any kind of evil aura,

92
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,908
but also can gather spiritual aura and solidify foundations.

93
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:38,270
This elixir is perfect for Prince Jing Jian.

94
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,908
Feng Ran.

95
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,429
Qing Mu.

96
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,050
Follow me.

97
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,149
The Demon Gathering Flag is in the Demon Realm.

98
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,829
I should find Jing Yuan first.

99
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,829
Heavenly Queen has the Spirit Gathering Pearl.

100
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,970
It's hard to get it.

101
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,270
I can figure it out when I got the Demon Gathering Flag.

102
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,829
Where is Hou Chi?

103
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,748
She went to the imperial mausoleum to get the Soul Tower.

104
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:10,292
Now I'm going to the Heavenly Palace and to the Demon Clan.

105
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:12,468
I'll fetch the Spirit Gathering Pearl and Demon Gathering Flag.

106
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:15,779
I need you to be here and wait for Upper God Gu Jun,

107
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,589
to see if there is another way to save Bo Xuan.

108
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,028
Wait.

109
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:20,949
You said you would steal the three treasures for her?

110
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,589
Things have become like this.

111
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,989
If she commits those crimes alone,

112
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,669
no one can protect her.

113
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,669
If she only took the Soul Tower,

114
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,629
Heavenly King would only punish her lightly with Upper God Gu Jun protecting her.

115
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:33,659
What about you?

116
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,568
When we get the three treasures, seal the mountain pass immediately.

117
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:38,045
I'll confess my crime to Heavenly King,

118
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:39,428
and tell him I wanted to steal the three treasures.

119
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,350
Are you insane?

120
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,450
When Hou Chi wakes Bo Xuan up,

121
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,508
even if the Heavenly Palace doesn't punish me,

122
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:49,229
I am afraid...

123
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,229
The Heavenly Palace is far from Demon Clan.

124
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,789
If you want to get the Spirit Gathering Pearl and Demon Gathering Flag before Hou Chi,

125
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,029
I'm afraid you can't do it alone.

126
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,049
I know Xuanjing Palace well. I'll fetch the Demon Gathering Flag.

127
00:08:57,049 --> 00:08:58,428
No.

128
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:00,108
This thing is important.

129
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:01,768
You can't get involved.

130
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:03,768
It's about Hou Chi, so I have to participate in it.

131
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:05,309
Let's go.

132
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,669
Be careful.

133
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,628
 Thank you, Master. 

134
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:33,489
 I will live up to your expectations. 

135
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,949
 Relax. 

136
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,789
 Although I'm not a True God, 

137
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,469
 I'll give you anything you need. 

138
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,570
 I'll teach you and let you become a god as soon as possible. 

139
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,229
 Goddess Yue Mi had a good relationship with the four True Gods. 

140
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,800
 If Demon God really killed Goddess Yue Mi, 

141
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,400
 why didn't True God Bai Jue kill him? 

142
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:05,169
 Who saw Demon God kill Goddess Yue Mi personally? 

143
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,308
 Wu Huan saw it. 

144
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:08,929
 You said it. 

145
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:10,508
 It's Wu Huan. 

146
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,829
 You didn't see it. 

147
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,070
 Gu Jun, what do you mean? 

148
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:18,088
 Wu Huan has been staying with you for sixty thousand years. 

149
00:10:18,088 --> 00:10:22,049
 You know her better than I do of what kind of person she is. 

150
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:27,528
 You never doubted the thing that happened in the Swamp of Netherhill? 

151
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:30,268
 Master, it was Demon God. 

152
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:33,689
 Demon God pushed Goddess Yue Mi into the eye of the formation. 

153
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:39,370
 I watched helplessly as Goddess Yue Mi lost her divine power and die. 

154
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:44,049
 Only Huan saw the death of Master. 

155
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:46,729
 Is what Gu Jun said true? 

156
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,108
 No. 

157
00:10:48,109 --> 00:10:49,589
 Impossible. 

158
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,868
 A'Huan wouldn't slander Demon God, 

159
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:54,270
 nor would she kill Goddess Yue Mi. 

160
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,830
Your Majesty.

161
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,409
Why are you here?

162
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:08,289
The Phoenix Clan brought us some glossy ganoderma as a tribute.

163
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:10,930
I made it into a medical decoction

164
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,030
and have brought it to you.

165
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,130
It can relieve fatigue and nourish divine power.

166
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:19,790
Thank you.

167
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:30,710
You're missing Goddess Yue Mi again?

168
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:36,829
This divine weapon,

169
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:42,409
Master gave it to me when I took her as my master.

170
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,949
Master treated me well.

171
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:47,309
She gave me many promotions,

172
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:54,210
so that the Golden Dragon Clan of Mountain Tianci could have a place in the three realms.

173
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,230
I once said that I would live up to my master's grace.

174
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,890
But now, I don't know how to repay her.

175
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,490
I can't figure it out.

176
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,290
Demon God and my master had been accompanying each other

177
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,590
and their relationship was good.

178
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,069
Before the Array of World Destruction,

179
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,088
there was no hatred between them.

180
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:21,489
Why would he do so?

181
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:25,549
Do you remember the details of it?

182
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,930
Why do you suddenly mention it?

183
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,330
I was thinking,

184
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:39,050
if Demon God had a reason that he couldn't tell us back then.

185
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:52,350
Goddess Yue Mi went to persuade Demon God under the order of Her Royal Highness.

186
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:56,229
Then they started to argue.

187
00:12:56,229 --> 00:13:01,029
I saw Demon God push her into the eye of the formation.

188
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:06,050
The array of World Destruction drained the divine power of Goddess Yue Mi.

189
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,650
Eventually, her core power vanished and died.

190
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:18,149
Goddess Yue Mi had also taken care of me.

191
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:20,869
Although it has been tens of thousands of years,

192
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:23,769
when I thought of the moment she died,

193
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:28,950
I can't forgive myself.

194
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,589
It's my bad.

195
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,449
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

196
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,568
Your Majesty, no matter what it was,

197
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:54,088
Demon God opened the Array of World Destruction.

198
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:58,189
It is a truth that he has become the enemy of the three realms.

199
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:01,230
He doesn't deserve to be a True God.

200
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,989
Master Zhi Yang gave us the order,

201
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:06,568
we should protect the three realms,

202
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:09,830
so that we can live up to his trust in us.

203
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,269
I have a headache now.

204
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:16,230
Just go back.

205
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,049
I can help you relieve it.

206
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:23,790
I said, go back.

207
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:54,950
A'Qin.

208
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,790
A'Qin.

209
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,289
Don't leave today.

210
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,868
Just live in Xuanjing Palace.

211
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:02,269
Step aside.

212
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,090
A'Qin!

213
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,349
The immortals are cunning.

214
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,308
Jing Jian and Jing Yang are guarding the Luocha Region.

215
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,050
It's dangerous.

216
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,308
I've asked for my father's permission to go with you tomorrow.

217
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:15,868
I came back to Triple Heaven for the survival of the Demon Clan.

218
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:17,409
Please show me some respect.

219
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:19,030
A'Qin!

220
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:22,729
I know you are still mad at me.

221
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:24,408
I don't expect you to forgive me.

222
00:15:24,408 --> 00:15:27,609
But can you stop pushing me away?

223
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:29,208
Okay, I admit I was wrong.

224
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:33,249
But I don't want us to miss each other again. Okay?

225
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:35,710
 Sister, don't show him any mercy. 

226
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:40,888
Sen Yu,

227
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:43,229
some people are destined to not be together.

228
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,509
Since we have missed each other, it's Heaven's will.

229
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:49,890
It's impossible between us.

230
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,549
A'Qin.

231
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:53,189
A'Qin!

232
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,150
So easy?

233
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,149
Why are you here?

234
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,370
I should be asking you this. Right?

235
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:42,709
Little girl, think about it.

236
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,988
If Master didn't agree with you to do so,

237
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:47,810
would you be able to break through the barrier of this secret room?

238
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,009
Demon God helped me?

239
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,428
No wonder it was so easy.

240
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:53,849
Did Qingchi Palace meet any trouble?

241
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:56,790
I need the Demon Gathering Flag to save Bo Xuan.

242
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,590
Just as Master guessed.

243
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,048
Just go. Be calm when settling things.

244
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:04,328
Don't be so surprised.

245
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:07,210
Thanks to Demon God for Qingchi Palace.

246
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:12,748
 If Sen Jian and Sen Yu found that 

247
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:14,908
 Master gave the Demon Gathering Flag to Qingchi Palace, 

248
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,950
 I wonder what they'll think about Master. 

249
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,629
Hou Chi.

250
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,028
Feng Ran, why are you here?

251
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:28,028
You don't need to go to the Demon Realm.

252
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:30,249
I've fetched the Demon Gathering Flag for you.

253
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:33,908
Were you hurt?

254
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:35,788
Thanks to the Demon God, I didn't even fight with them.

255
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,349
And I heard some gossip.

256
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,328
How did Jing Yuan know I needed the Demon Gathering Flag?

257
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:42,808
I'll tell you about it when we go back to Qingchi Palace.

258
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:45,170
You went to the Demon Clan, what about Qing Mu?

259
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,649
He went to Heavenly Palace to fetch the Spirit Gathering Pearl for you.

260
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,389
Heavenly Queen has the Spirit Gathering Pearl, right?

261
00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:51,909
If Heavenly Queen finds out, she won't let him get away with it.

262
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:54,886
But after the war in the Luocha Region, the immortals in Heavenly Palace have been dissatisfied with you.

263
00:17:54,886 --> 00:17:57,048
It's dangerous if you go there.

264
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:59,529
The three treasures are my responsibility.

265
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,009
I can't let him take risks alone.

266
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:02,388
I'll go to the Heavenly Palace now.

267
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:03,908
I'll bring him back when I see him.

268
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:05,428
I won't let Heavenly King and Queen know.

269
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:06,749
I'll go with you.

270
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,989
The more people, the more dangerous it will be.

271
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,369
You're right.

272
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:12,088
Immortals in Heavenly Palace also don't like me.

273
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:14,189
Take care of yourself.

274
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:22,529
It's not far from Jing Jian's tent.

275
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:24,830
Maybe he has a better idea.

276
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,228
This is the Heavenly Palace. Leave here quickly.

277
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:41,849
I'm Qing Mu, Lord of the North Sea. I'm His Second Highness's friend.

278
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:44,969
He asked me to bring this to the Heavenly Palace and put it here.

279
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:46,048
What's in the box?

280
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:47,549
I don't know.

281
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:50,129
Without His Second Highness's permission,

282
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,968
I didn't dare to open it.

283
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:53,229
Since it's His Second Highness's stuff,

284
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,970
we'll take care of it.

285
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,989
Thank you.

286
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,470
Goodbye.

287
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,850
Excuse me.

288
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,149
Your Highness, Qing Mu has come to Heavenly Palace.

289
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:29,769
How dare he trespass the Heavenly Palace.

290
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,590
Did he come here for the Halberd of Sun and Moon?

291
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:39,110
Luckily, I was already prepared for that.

292
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,708
What did Feng Nv say?

293
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:52,390
Your Majesty, it has been three days.

294
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,710
Did Qingchi Palace return the Halberd of Sun and Moon?

295
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:10,669
Your Majesty, please follow me.

296
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,589
Feng Nv told me,

297
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,372
someone is trying to steal the treasures of the Heavenly Palace.

298
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:35,110
 I wonder where Heavenly Queen put the Spirit Gathering Pearl. 

299
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:42,308
 Well, the Spirit Gathering Pearl is a divine weapon from ancient times. 

300
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:45,790
 Maybe the Tai Cang Spear can feel where it is. 

301
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,909
Who is it?

302
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:17,769
Lord of the North Sea?

303
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:19,730
Why are you here?

304
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,208
Your Majesty, I told you.

305
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,989
This Qing Mu is not a loyal person.

306
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,629
He came here to steal our treasure.

307
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,150
You saw it personally.

308
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,269
Please punish him.

309
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,590
Lord of the North Sea, do you confess your crime?

310
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,230
I wonder if she has found Qing Mu and Hou Chi.

311
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,990
What are you hiding?

312
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,423
Nothing. You saw it wrongly.

313
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:18,510
Show me your hands.

314
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:23,829
Is it something from your loved one?

315
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:26,750
It's nothing. Don't push me.

316
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,100
You're a white phoenix, why would you have a red feather?

317
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,269
This is my feather. Why do you have it?

318
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:41,548
Feng Ran,

319
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:45,870
actually, I wanted to tell you when we were in the Swamp of Netherhill.

320
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,529
Did I hurt you just now?

321
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,448
I was infected by too much evil aura.

322
00:22:58,448 --> 00:23:00,469
I'll be fine after an hour's meditation.

323
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,470
I'll give you some spiritual power.

324
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,568
Here.

325
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:16,529
This is the Almighty Elixir Chang Que made.

326
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,589
It can gather spiritual power

327
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:21,629
and resist the evil aura from the Luocha Region.

328
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:23,210
Thank you.

329
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,309
Why did you come to the Luocha Region?

330
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,600
We met some problems. I just came back from Xuanjing Palace.

331
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:44,649
Why did you go to Xuanjing Palace?

332
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:45,908
I borrowed the Demon Gathering Flag.

333
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:47,509
Demon Gathering Flag?

334
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,509
We found Bo Xuan in the North Sea.

335
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,810
You finally found Lord Bo Xuan.

336
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,883
But he failed to pass the ordeal and was seriously injured. He lost spiritual consciousness.

337
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:59,530
Only with the Soul Tower, Demon Gathering Flag, and the Spirit Gathering Pearl, can we save his life.

338
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,968
So, Hou Chi, Qing Mu, and I went to

339
00:24:00,968 --> 00:24:04,568
Triple Heaven, the Heavenly Palace, and the Human Realm respectively, to fetch the three treasures.

340
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,068
Now we have the Soul Tower and Demon Gathering Flag.

341
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:09,670
But we still need the Spirit Gathering Pearl.

342
00:24:10,189 --> 00:24:12,889
The Spirit Gathering Pearl is not important to the Heavenly Palace.

343
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:15,590
Father God should not make things difficult for them.

344
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:37,288
 Why is no one here? 

345
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:39,450
 Did anything happen? 

346
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:50,889
Upper God Hou Chi, we've been waiting for you.

347
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,288
The Heavenly Palace is so polite.

348
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:53,928
Such pageantry to greet me.

349
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:56,769
Heavenly Queen knew you would be coming here,

350
00:24:56,769 --> 00:25:01,268
so she let me wait here to invite you to have a talk in Fuyao Hall.

351
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,928
After the thing is settled,

352
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:04,769
Heavenly Queen will call you in.

353
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,069
What did you do to Qing Mu?

354
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,308
You also know the Lord of the North Sea came here to steal a treasure?

355
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:16,589
Did you ask the Lord of the North Sea to do so?

356
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,529
I don't have time for your tricks here.

357
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:20,388
This is the Heavenly Palace.

358
00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:22,308
Heavenly King and Heavenly Queen haven't summoned you!

359
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:24,529
Do you want to break in?

360
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,168
Your Majesty, I came here to borrow the Spirit Gathering Pearl.

361
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:52,249
It's urgent, so I took such measures.

362
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:54,629
If you want to borrow the pearl,

363
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,509
you could have just asked His Majesty.

364
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:00,888
Why did you choose to use the filthy means of stealing?

365
00:26:00,888 --> 00:26:04,549
People would think the Lord of the North Sea had other purposes.

366
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:06,428
As far as I'm concerned,

367
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:09,289
you stole it for the Demon Clan.

368
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:12,229
Your Majesty, I tried to steal Spirit Gathering Pearl.

369
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:13,788
I'm willing to be punished.

370
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:16,148
But I stole it to save someone.

371
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:18,509
It has nothing to do with the Demon God.

372
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,188
Your Highness, I don't understand

373
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:25,630
why you always link me with Qingchi Palace and the Demon Clan.

374
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,289
In your mind, you want Qingchi Palace to be the vassal of the Demon Clan,

375
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,330
instead of a helper of the Heavenly Palace?

376
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:37,588
You betrayed the Heavenly Palace first, then worked for Qingchi Palace.

377
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:40,429
You say I wronged you?

378
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,668
Okay.

379
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:46,164
Let me ask you. It has been three days,

380
00:26:46,164 --> 00:26:48,265
where is Halberd of Sun and Moon?

381
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,909
Where the Halberd of Sun and Moon is, others may not know,

382
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,928
but I think the Queen knows.

383
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:01,108
Hou Chi.

384
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:05,070
Hou Chi, stop purposely obscuring us here.

385
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,229
Say it straight.

386
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,048
I will not only say it straight,

387
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:10,589
but I'll also let all the immortals see

388
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,122
what Heavenly Queen in the Heavenly Palace is.

389
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:15,529
At the bottom of the North Sea,

390
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:18,709
the three-headed fire dragon designed a sneak attack and stole the Halberd of Sun and Moon.

391
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,889
Did you ask him to do so?

392
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,229
I don't know what you are talking about.

393
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,629
In the war in the Luocha Region,

394
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,009
all the immortals and demons saw you take the three-headed fire dragon away.

395
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:28,409
How can you explain this?

396
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:30,509
I did take the three-headed fire dragon away.

397
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,709
I wanted to take a strong general away from the Demon Clan,

398
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,769
so that the Immortal Clan could defeat the Demon Clan.

399
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:37,349
What is wrong with that?

400
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,268
Since you mentioned the war between the two clans,

401
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:42,288
how many innocent human beings were involved in the war in the Luocha Region?

402
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:43,688
What wrong did they do?

403
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:46,669
As Heavenly Queen in the Heavenly Palace, you created many conflicts.

404
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:49,108
You framed Qingchi Palace and let the two clans fight with each other.

405
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:51,869
Wu Huan, what do you want to do?

406
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,789
Hou Chi, it's not your turn to teach me a lesson.

407
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:57,268
How dare you be so presumptuous in the Heavenly Palace?

408
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:59,108
Do you respect His Majesty?

409
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:00,649
His Majesty is here, so what?

410
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:02,448
Even if True God and Chief God are here,

411
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:05,610
if there is injustice, I'll say it bravely.

412
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,150
 This is the Heavenly Realm. 

413
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,088
 There will be a Human Realm. 

414
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:16,889
 Everyone will respect the gods. 

415
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:19,749
 But what lasts long is the heart of humans. 

416
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:22,649
 If the heart is just, the world is just. 

417
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:24,709
 If the heart is selfish, 

418
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,509
 even if Ancestral God were here, 

419
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,630
 you need to get rid of that selfishness. 

420
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,649
 You will be responsible for the three realms someday. 

421
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,789
The Halberd of Sun and Moon?

422
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,829
Your Highness, you really treasure your life.

423
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,349
If you had other solutions,

424
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,029
I'm afraid you wouldn't have used the Halberd of Sun and Moon.

425
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:09,788
The truth has been revealed.

426
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,088
The Heavenly Palace can take care of the Halberd of Sun and Moon.

427
00:29:12,088 --> 00:29:16,470
As Heavenly King, how do you plan to deal with this?

428
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:30,249
Hou Chi, I'll surely give Qingchi Palace a satisfactory answer.

429
00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:34,810
Your Majesty, it's not like that. Let me explain.

430
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:40,090
Here's my order!  What Heavenly Queen did, has betrayed the will of Heaven.

431
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,469
She lost justice by framing others.

432
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:44,449
Here's the punishment.

433
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,090
She will be exiled in the Netherworld for a hundred years.

434
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:50,970
Your Majesty.

435
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,689
Say goodbye to our children.

436
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:57,010
Find a day to introspect in the Netherworld.

437
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,150
Your Majesty.

438
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,309
- I'm your wife... 
 - Enough.

439
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:11,969
Father God, I have something to tell you.

440
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:14,349
I'm tired today.

441
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:16,429
Find another day to tell me.

442
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:20,188
Your Majesty.

443
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:22,548
Although Qingchi Palace didn't collude with the Demon Clan,

444
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:27,869
Hou Chi already committed a huge crime before she came here.

445
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,889
I asked Yang'er to investigate.

446
00:30:30,889 --> 00:30:34,330
Don't you want to know what happened, Your Majesty?

447
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,489
Did you meet any problem when fetching the Soul Tower?

448
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:42,670
Lord Bi Xi who guarded the Soul Tower gave it to me himself.

449
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:44,470
Why would there be a problem?

450
00:30:45,189 --> 00:30:46,129
Your Majesty.

451
00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:47,968
Bi Xi, what happened?

452
00:30:47,968 --> 00:30:51,350
Your Majesty, someone broke into the imperial mausoleum, injured me,

453
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,088
and took the Soul Tower away.

454
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:55,549
Who was it?

455
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:56,729
Father God.

456
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:00,630
Hou Chi injured Bi Xi and took the Soul Tower away.

457
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:06,549
Bi Xi, is what Jing Yang said true?

458
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:09,049
Bi Xi, His Majesty is here.

459
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:10,749
Just speak frankly.

460
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,610
His Majesty won't forgive anyone who tries to make problems for the three realms.

461
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,169
He'll bring justice to you.

462
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:24,729
 Prince Jing Yang, the thing about the Human Realm...  

463
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:27,268
 No problem. As long as you keep your promise, 

464
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:29,208
 Mother God will surely do what she said. 

465
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:32,730
 She can protect the Human Realm from wars for a thousand years. 

466
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,689
Your Majesty, Prince Jing Yang is right.

467
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,709
Upper God Hou Chi from Qingchi Palace injured me and took the Soul Tower away.

468
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,002
Since the Soul Tower was taken away,

469
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,548
evil aura has broken out from the Underground Palace.

470
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:48,689
It will harm the Human Realm.

471
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:52,268
Please take the Soul Tower back for the safety of the Human Realm, Your Majesty.

472
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:53,729
Lord Bi Xi.

473
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:56,409
You told me you would use your spiritual power

474
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:58,109
to temporarily suppress evil aura for now,

475
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,169
you wouldn't let it harm the Human Realm.

476
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:02,548
Yes.

477
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:05,308
Although I suppressed evil aura for now,

478
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:07,129
some evil aura was leaked into the Human Realm.

479
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:08,208
Enough!

480
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:13,130
Hou Chi, did you really take the Soul Tower away?

481
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,228
Yes.

482
00:32:14,228 --> 00:32:15,749
Nonsense!

483
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:17,489
The Soul Tower guards the Human Realm.

484
00:32:17,489 --> 00:32:19,828
How could you do such a ridiculous thing?

485
00:32:19,828 --> 00:32:23,108
Your Majesty, don't just listen to what Bi Xi said.

486
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,708
The reason why Hou Chi took the Soul Tower away is what I asked her to do.

487
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:28,629
Qing Mu, it's none of your business.

488
00:32:28,629 --> 00:32:30,470
Don't say nonsense here.

489
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:33,589
Upper God Hou Chi,

490
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,668
you were blaming me just now.

491
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:39,170
So ridiculous!

492
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:43,409
Hou Chi, I don't care why you took the Soul Tower away.

493
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:46,749
Return it to Bi Xi immediately.

494
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,068
Let the Soul Tower go back to the Human Realm.

495
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:53,788
Your Majesty, I know it's a huge crime to take the Soul Tower away.

496
00:32:53,788 --> 00:32:56,589
I'll shoulder the responsibility alone.

497
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,148
But I can't return the Soul Tower now.

498
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:01,469
Do you know what you are talking about?

499
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,709
Yes.

500
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,509
Your Majesty, the Soul Tower is not the only thing that can suppress evil aura.

501
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:10,829
I can use my spiritual power to strengthen the seal of evil aura in the Underground Palace.

502
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:14,428
I'll use a hundred years to purify the evil aura in the Human Realm.

503
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:17,829
I have something to do today, can I leave now?

504
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,268
After I finish this thing,

505
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:23,469
I'll come back here to return the Soul Tower and receive punishment.

506
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,548
That's what you said.

507
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:27,408
Since you stole the Soul Tower,

508
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:29,349
how could you care about the safety of the Human Realm?

509
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,349
If His Majesty lets you go today,

510
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,730
you will go back to Qingchi Palace.

511
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:37,649
With the protection of Gu Jun, the Heavenly Palace can do nothing about you.

512
00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:39,949
Your Majesty,

513
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,049
I can receive Heavenly King's divine seal.

514
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:46,408
If Hou Chi breaks her promise, I'm willing to be burned by the seal and turned into to ashes.

515
00:33:46,408 --> 00:33:47,950
Qing Mu.

516
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,308
Hou Chi, tell me.

517
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:02,889
You won't return the Soul Tower.

518
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:05,388
What do you want it for?

519
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:07,629
Your Majesty, I have an old friend.

520
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,269
He failed in passing the ordeal and is dying.

521
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,989
Only the Soul Tower can save him.

522
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,509
I know this is a huge crime,

523
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,749
but I can't see my friend die and do nothing.

524
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,010
Please let me return it later.

525
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:28,889
Hou Chi, since you are willing to use your spiritual power

526
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,148
to purify the evil aura in the Human Realm for a hundred years,

527
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:33,649
I can allow you to return it later.

528
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:36,229
After you strengthen the seal of evil aura in the Underground Palace,

529
00:34:36,229 --> 00:34:39,670
I'll punish you for stealing the tower.

530
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,328
Thank you, Your Majesty.

531
00:34:41,328 --> 00:34:42,949
Your Majesty!

532
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,628
Please allow me to suppress the evil aura with Hou Chi.

533
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:48,570
When it comes to an end,

534
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:51,090
I'll introspect myself in the North Sea.

535
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:54,449
Mother God.

536
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,208
Father God punished Hou Chi lightly for stealing the treasure,

537
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:01,050
but he exiled you to the Netherworld.

538
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,868
It's unfair.

539
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,629
I can't figure it out.

540
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:11,910
Your Father God wants to use Hou Chi's identity to reopen the God Realm.

541
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,749
Ridiculous.

542
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,528
It's just a fool's dream.

543
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:18,149
Mother God.

544
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,509
What are you talking about?

545
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,990
What do you mean by Hou Chi's identity?

546
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,469
Nothing.

547
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,729
You don't need to know.

548
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:40,689
Yang'er, I want you to go to the Human Realm again.

549
00:36:40,689 --> 00:36:44,089
Before Hou Chi suppresses the evil aura,

550
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:47,729
release evil auras from the Underground Palace.

551
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:49,349
Mother God!

552
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,249
If evil auras come out of the Underground Palace,

553
00:36:52,249 --> 00:36:54,248
the Human Realm will be in a mess.

554
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:57,249
Hou Chi's guilt must be severe!

555
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:02,350
Then all the immortals will blame Qingchi Palace.

556
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,269
Do you want to see your Father God and I lose trust in one another?

557
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,288
Do you want us to be bullied by Qingchi Palace?

558
00:37:07,288 --> 00:37:09,908
The existence of Qingchi Palace is threatening the Heavenly Palace.

559
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,600
The future of Heavenly Palace and the life and death of mortals in a mere city

560
00:37:15,629 --> 00:37:20,249
which one is more important?

561
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,109
I understand.

562
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,448
Hou Chi, since we've gathered the three treasures,

563
00:37:42,448 --> 00:37:43,990
you can go to Qingchi Palace.

564
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,509
I'll strengthen the seal of the evil auras in the Underground Palace.

565
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,828
We can't let the Human Realm be involved.

566
00:37:48,828 --> 00:37:50,248
I'll go with you.

567
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:51,628
Okay.

568
00:37:51,629 --> 00:37:54,230
You asked me to go back to Qingchi Palace.

569
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,109
What? You're jealous of Bo Xuan?

570
00:37:58,589 --> 00:37:59,649
Yes.

571
00:37:59,649 --> 00:38:02,030
I'm a little jealous of him.

572
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:04,989
Enough.

573
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:09,229
Hou Chi, I really treasure the days with you.

574
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,409
Me, too.

575
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:33,589
A'Qin.

576
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,168
I told you already,

577
00:38:40,168 --> 00:38:42,929
I'm in a bad mood, don't come in and bother me.

578
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:45,210
It's me.

579
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,829
Emperor Father?

580
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:51,230
Sorry for being rude, Emperor Father.

581
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:54,629
How long have you been drinking?

582
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:01,729
Since Chang Qin left,

583
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:04,130
I've been sitting here.

584
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,449
I don't know how long it has been.

585
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,929
For a total of two full hours.

586
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:18,409
I'm in pain.

587
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:21,148
I don't want to do anything except drink.

588
00:39:21,149 --> 00:39:24,328
Father, I can't live without Chang Qin.

589
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,269
Bastard!

590
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:29,550
Don't you know the Demon Gathering Flag is gone?

591
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,389
What did you say?

592
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:34,309
Who was it?

593
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:37,129
Who dared to steal the treasure of the Demon Clan?

594
00:39:37,129 --> 00:39:39,148
You've been keeping the Demon Gathering Flag.

595
00:39:39,149 --> 00:39:41,390
And you are asking me?

596
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,148
It's my fault.

597
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:45,790
Please punish me.

598
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,449
According to our spy in the Luocha Region,

599
00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:52,148
Feng Ran took the Demon Gathering Flag away.

600
00:39:52,149 --> 00:39:53,829
Feng Ran?

601
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:56,729
When... When did she come here?

602
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,309
As the Prince of the Demon Clan,

603
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,668
how can you be blinded by love?

604
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:04,868
You've been drinking in sorrow.

605
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,510
No wonder Chang Qin doesn't like you.

606
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:16,789
Father, I'll gather an army in the Luocha Region

607
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,029
and bring the Demon Gathering Flag back.

608
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,669
It's a draw.

609
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:48,200


610
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:57,569
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

611
00:40:57,569 --> 00:41:04,682
