1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,010


2
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:21,340
   

3
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,997
   

4
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:30,400
No matter which guesses we take, we need to get the spear first.

5
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,760
Now, there is a commotion happening at Observation Mountain,

6
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,499
I'm afraid the demons might also go there.

7
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:37,620
Dong Hua,

8
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,300
send out my order immediately.

9
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,800
Immortals and Upper Immortals can challenge to take the spear.

10
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,439
Whoever gets the spear and masters it, this spear will belong to him.

11
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,380
But, Your Majesty, if the immortals and demons all go there, I'm worried that there might be trouble.

12
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,539
Don't worry. When the time comes, I'll be there in person.

13
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:57,180
If there's any trouble, I'll deal with it myself.

14
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,439
Yes, Your Majesty.

15
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,280
Why would the Tai Cang Spear suddenly appear?

16
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,960
Fire Qilin...

17
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,340
Is Bai Jue still alive?

18
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:20,900
No matter what, you were too impulsive this time.

19
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,220
That was the Demon Emperor, Sen Jian.

20
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:27,120
Luckily, you're still alive.

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,659
I did so to save you.

22
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,539
You had many ways to save me.

23
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:35,999
If you do such a thing regardless of your life again, I'll abandon you forever.

24
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:37,700
Understand?

25
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,439
Yes.

26
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,099
Can I talk now?

27
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,760
Father God gave me this life-saving elixir.

28
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,500
Take it.

29
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,140
Feed it to me.

30
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,659
So cruel.

31
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,040
If I choked, you would have regretted it.

32
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,379
Lord of the North Sea, when we were fighting just now, I thought you overstepped your bounds a little.

33
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:12,440
If you continue doing such ridiculous things, our life is long,

34
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,520
I don't mind letting you be a mute for tens of thousands of years.

35
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,199
Hou Chi.

36
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,880
Since I met you on Observation Mountain,

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,279
I felt like I already knew you.

38
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:29,420
I know you don't believe this.

39
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,200
And you were annoyed that I followed you.

40
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,359
But we went through many difficulties together.

41
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,880
What do you want to say?

42
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,760
I want to say...

43
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,680
this is the first time that I have fallen in love with someone.

44
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,439
I like you.

45
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:12,020
Lord of the North Sea, I have no feelings for you.

46
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,579
I have many things to do.

47
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:17,039
I have no time to fall in love.

48
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,300
I know. You're looking for Bo Xuan.

49
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,620
But I will never take back what I've already spoken.

50
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,099
If you are still annoyed about this, I'll stay here.

51
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:31,680
Who's annoyed about it?

52
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,060
Then why are you looking at me this way?

53
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,599
- Are you trying to deceive me now? 
 - Yes.

54
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:40,920
You said so. I'm a dogskin plaster. I should be attached to you.

55
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,100
What if I didn't change my mind?

56
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,900
Then I'll learn from Xiaoli, pretend to be sick and attract your attention.

57
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,359
I'm not as soft-hearted as Sen Yu. Take your medicine on time.

58
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,840
Hou Chi.

59
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,319
Why is he still here?

60
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,459
Didn't you hate people from the Heavenly Palace?

61
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,139
I was careless and fell into their trap.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,259
Upper God Hou Chi, you can treat me like I don't exist

63
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,459
Upper God Hou Chi.

64
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:44,779
You don't need to do so, Lordess. Please take a seat there.

65
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,840
Thank you for your help this time.

66
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,239
You also arranged for Qing Mu to cultivate here.

67
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:57,499
I'm very grateful.

68
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,019
Goddess, your words are too much.

69
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:00,739
I wasn't much help.

70
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:04,819
Since you're Feng Ran's friend, you can call me Hou Chi.

71
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,219
Then I'll do that.

72
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:11,419
How is Lord Qing Mu's injury?

73
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,259
He is fine. Don't worry.

74
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,260
It is really rare for Lord Qing Mu to treat you with deep affection.

75
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,059
This kind of marriage should be cherished by Your Royal Highness.

76
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:27,559
You think too much. We're just friends.

77
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,019
After this incident, my view of this person has changed a lot.

78
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:36,659
I think he's a gentleman, and he also treats you well.

79
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:40,760
In this heaven, many men may say they love you,

80
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,600
but how many people can be so protective of each other at the juncture of life and death?

81
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,499
I didn't have any luck with the prince.

82
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:51,219
I can't meet such a man who would love me that much.

83
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:55,879
Chang Qin, I heard that the fox has admitted she was pretending to be sick.

84
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,819
Sen Yu asked her to guard the Luocha Region.

85
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,159
Even you learned the news of Xuanjing Palace so quickly.

86
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:04,859
- I have many friends. 
 - They often gossip.

87
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:06,479
Hou Chi.

88
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,559
A'Qin, break up with him if you should or you'll suffer from the torment.

89
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:16,380
Maybe it's not that person that you can't forget, it's those years you spent with him.

90
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,640
You're so free and unconstrained, you shouldn't waste your life in Xuanjing Palace.

91
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,080
After finishing those things, talk with us in Qingchi Palace.

92
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,620
Let's drink together and get drunk.

93
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,599
We welcome you to Qingchi Palace.

94
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,479
Goodbye.

95
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,279
Besides, I heard another thing. It's about Bo Xuan.

96
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,419
Tell me.

97
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,319
- Who said I was gossiping just now? 
 - Just say it.

98
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,519
Then tell me first what happened between you and Qing Mu these past few days.

99
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,020
Then you have to tell me what happened between Jing Jian and you recently.

100
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,499
I...

101
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,759
Master, if it were not Wu Huan,

102
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,059
Goddess Yue Mi wouldn't have died in the Swamp of Netherhill.

103
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:14,959
In recent years, Wu Huan has intended to annex the Demon Clan.

104
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,100
She did so many things behind the scenes.

105
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,600
Mu Guang is the same as her.

106
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,739
Why do we negotiate peace with them?

107
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:26,480
Since I woke up, because the divine power is thin in the Demon Realm,

108
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,040
I can't be a True God again.

109
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,640
But they have been cultivating in the Heavenly Palace for sixty thousand years.

110
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,100
Their power is no longer what it used to be.

111
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,519
Don't say that.

112
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,219
If you didn't sacrifice the power of the Purple Moon to the Demon Clan, regardless of your own cultivation,

113
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,700
the Demon Clan would have been annexed by the Immortal Clan.

114
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,039
We wouldn't have today's peace.

115
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,739
I heard Bai Jue's Tai Cang Spear appeared on Observation Mountain.

116
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,240
Yes.

117
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,080
Mu Guang asked his son to negotiate peace with us.

118
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,280
He wants to get the Purple Moon Whip.

119
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,640
By gathering four divine weapons, he can open the God Realm again.

120
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,940
But back then, you launched the Array of World Destruction

121
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,119
and have long been regarded as a sinner of the three realms.

122
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:20,020
Even if the God Realm were to reopen, it would be of no use to you.

123
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,499
I know you're loyal.

124
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:28,020
But if they get the Tai Cang Spear,

125
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,680
the Immortal Clan will have a higher chance to win.

126
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,299
We can take negotiating peace as a chance to take the spear.

127
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:41,139
This is the best solution.

128
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:45,900
Master, you're right. I was short-sighted.

129
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,860
I'll do it now.

130
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,220
Such a huge thing happened on Observation Mountain.

131
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,860
You said Bo Xuan had the power of fire.

132
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,239
Fire Qilin is a beast from ancient times. It also has the power of fire.

133
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:07,911
Bo Xuan and Fire Qilin. One of them went missing on Observation Mountain, the other appeared on Observation Mountain.

134
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:09,340
Are they related to each other?

135
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,779
Whether Fire Qilin is Bo Xuan or not, I can investigate on Observation Mountain.

136
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,680
Jing Jian and you can go to the Heavenly Palace to have the Spirit Lock removed.

137
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,840
As for Qing Mu, he can stay in the Demon Realm and cultivate.

138
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,279
No!

139
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,840
If you're looking for Bo Xuan, I'll go as well.

140
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,439
You just fought with Demon Emperor, so you can't travel long distances.

141
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:31,550
Many things are happening on Observation Mountain. The immortals and demons are all there.

142
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,839
It would be dangerous if you go there alone.

143
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,999
You're seriously injured. Get some rest and take care of yourself.

144
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:40,119
I just had the elixir you gave me. I feel much better now.

145
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,340
The elixir in Qingchi Palace is different.

146
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,199
Enough, go back and cultivate.

147
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:45,580
Lordess Feng Ran.

148
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,979
Don't call upon me, I support Hou Chi. I can't help you.

149
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,479
Jing Jian, say something.

150
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,379
He is asking you.

151
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:03,320
I wasn't supposed to listen. I wasn't supposed to listen.

152
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,660
Why are you looking at me?

153
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:18,059
I heard Fire Qilin hurt Lord Xian Shan who was Dong Hua's apprentice.

154
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:19,379
It was fierce.

155
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,480
I'm worried about you if you go there alone.

156
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,440
What about letting Qing Mu accompany you?

157
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,560
It's because the trip is dangerous that I can't bear to take him with me.

158
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,240
You don't know him. He is a person who loves to fight injustice.

159
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,040
In case of conflict with others again, what if he gets hurt and it affects his cultivation later?

160
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,400
I didn't expect you to care about him.

161
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,200
It's not like that.

162
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,379
Jing Jian.

163
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:53,240
It's a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding.

164
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:57,699
The Spirit Lock just dragged me,

165
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,880
so I opened the door accidentally.

166
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,719
How about me cutting off your hand?

167
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,360
Then the Spirit Lock won't be annoying.

168
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,259
No thanks, Lordess.

169
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,719
I shall leave now.

170
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,080
It's all your fault. Why did you want to eavesdrop?

171
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,359
I was scolded as well.

172
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,159
Remember, you owe me ten bottles of Ice Wine of the North Sea.

173
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,559
No problem. I'll surely give it to you.

174
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,180
This thing is really good.

175
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,100
Do you have a spare one? Give me one and tie Hou Chi to me.

176
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,799
- I haven't seen you for a few days, why are you so... 
 - You don't understand.

177
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,599
Hou Chi and I were a couple before.

178
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,020
Where did you hear that?

179
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,220
Story books in the Human Realm?

180
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,060
You don't believe me?

181
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,119
Of course, I don't.

182
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:51,540
Aren't you the worst at getting close to women?

183
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,300
Do you still remember the sword mound at Observation Mountain?

184
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,859
You can't see it, but I can.

185
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,399
She can also enter that place.

186
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,719
And... this is her bracelet.

187
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,260
It's the same as mine.

188
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,779
The same person made these.

189
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:10,479
So, you fell in love with her because of this fate?

190
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,020
Sometimes she is clumsy, sometimes she is stubborn,

191
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,760
sometimes she is full of ideas.

192
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,479
She is so cute.

193
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,919
I...

194
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,159
After I got along with Hou Chi,

195
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,540
I have done many strange things.

196
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,519
I never would have thought that you, a piece of wood, would like someone in my whole life.

197
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,319
It's worthwhile.

198
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:34,380
Your sister said she likes me before.

199
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,159
And she took all chances to meet me.

200
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,820
I didn't understand, and I felt she was annoying.

201
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,299
But now, I can truly feel how she felt before.

202
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,219
My poor sister.

203
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:51,100
So many immortals like her, but she only likes you.

204
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,720
But about love, I can't force you.

205
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,879
What about Hou Chi? Does she like you?

206
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,199
I won't give up.

207
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,739
I understand. I'll help you.

208
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,380
Lordesses,

209
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,780
can I say something?

210
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Father God went to Observation Mountain.

211
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,480
Lord Feng Ran and I need to unlock the Spirit Lock.

212
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,239
How about the four of us go together? We can take care of each other on the way.

213
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,640
Yes.

214
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,420
What you said makes sense.

215
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,559
I see this Qing Mu character is stubborn.

216
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,560
He won't let you go there alone.

217
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,350
What about just letting him go with you?

218
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,959
Okay. Let's go together.

219
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,520
I've gotten Father God's instruction feather.

220
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,160
He is in Daze Mansion now. Let's go up the mountain.

221
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,299
Feng Ran, go to see the king with Jing Jian first.

222
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,880
Let him unlock the Spirit Lock for you.

223
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,180
I'll wait for you at the back of the mountain.

224
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,740
Hou Chi.

225
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,000
My Father God often says that he once had a good relationship with Upper God Gu Jun.

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,220
The Heavenly Palace wants to mend the relationship with Qingchi Palace.

227
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,039
Jing Jian, meet the king with Feng Ran first.

228
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,680
I'll accompany Hou Chi here.

229
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,400
Okay. Let's meet at the back of the mountain later.

230
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,140
Before this divine spear chooses its owner, the king will be at Observation Mountain.

231
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,739
I guess Jing Zhao will come as well.

232
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:35,119
Till when do you want to stop hiding?

233
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:36,779
Who said I was hiding?

234
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,160
I'm not afraid of Jing Zhao.

235
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,900
Really? Then let's go.

236
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,360
No.  I won't go with you.

237
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,180
I don't want to be the enemy of all the lordesses in the Immortal Realm.

238
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,080
- Okay. Then on this feast, I'll tell all the three realms. 
 - Tell them what?

239
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,840
Except the for the goddess in Qingchi Palace,

240
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,820
I don't like anyone else.

241
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,240
How dare you!

242
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,419
I risked my life for you before.

243
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:05,880
Shouldn't you be looking at blocking the peach blossoms for me in this relationship? 
  (Peach blossoms = other women) 

244
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,460
Stop talking nonsense.  I'll go now.

245
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,300
Okay, don't be mad.

246
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,440
I know. You don't want to meet the immortals of Heavenly Palace.

247
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,880
I have an idea.

248
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,599
What idea?

249
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:19,220
Jing Zhao won't recognize you.

250
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:26,899
How's it? Then I can carry you in my sleeve.

251
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:29,380
 Qing Mu, how dare you turn me into a frog? 

252
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,680
 You... 

253
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,740
- How's this? 
 -  Qing Mu, you've gone too far. 

254
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,139
Okay, I won't play any more jokes on you anymore.

255
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,679
Are you satisfied, Upper God Hou Chi?

256
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,880
Good.

257
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,020
   

258
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,320
Father God.

259
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,960
Father God, Lord Feng Ran and I were locked by the Spirit Lock carelessly.

260
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,080
Please unlock this for us.

261
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,619
Thank you, Emperor.

262
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,020
I haven't been to Qingchi Palace for many years.

263
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,920
Did Gu Jun come back?

264
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,599
Upper God Gu Jun hasn't returned to Qilian Mountain yet.

265
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:33,939
Since you left Qingchi Palace, where is Hou Chi?

266
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:35,560
Is she okay?

267
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,920
She is fine.

268
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,919
Thank you for your caring.

269
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:46,419
Jian'er, you dealt with the thing in the Demon Realm well.

270
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,240
On your way back,

271
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,739
Demon Emperor replied with a letter to Heavenly Palace.

272
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:52,660
He agreed on negotiating peace.

273
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,719
I've spoken to the three realms.

274
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:58,740
I'm allowing the Demon Clan to come to Observation Mountain to win the Tai Cang Spear.

275
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,119
I didn't do much.

276
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,480
I am surprised that the Demon Clan has agreed to negotiate peace.

277
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:08,600
Sen Jian is in charge of the Demon Clan.

278
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,319
How could the hatred before compare to the lives in the three realms?

279
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,320
You're right, Father God.

280
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,440
It's fortunate that the immortals and demons can negotiate peace.

281
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,699
 Why won't they let us in? 

282
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:30,859
 That's right. 

283
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,799
Everyone, calm down.

284
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:37,040
Although our king said that you can enter Observation Mountain to search for the divine spear,

285
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,139
for your own safety, please have some rest here.

286
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:45,599
When the divine spear has appeared, we'll let you in.

287
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:49,779
Feathering Umbrella.

288
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,559
You're Princess Jing Zhao of Heavenly Palace.

289
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,340
It's good that you know me.

290
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,420
You Demon Clan want to win the Tai Cang Spear as well?

291
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,180
I don't think you need to enter the mountain.

292
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,359
Let's have a fight here.

293
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,939
If you lose, it'll be useless to enter the mountain.

294
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:07,810
Princess, the immortals can't argue...

295
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,480
Enough.

296
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,519
Leave here, or I'll take away your demon elixir.

297
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:38,660
Wait here.

298
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,300
I'll have a look.

299
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,360
Qing Mu.

300
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,480
Did you also came here for Tai Cang Spear?

301
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,999
I can't just let you. Let's take it according to our ability.

302
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:53,839
But if I get the divine spear, I'll hold a feast for the three realms.

303
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,319
At that time, you should come to Heavenly Palace and congratulate me.

304
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,359
Princess, why did you hurt these demons?

305
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,580
They spoke insolently.

306
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,660
Demon Emperor will punish them for that.

307
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,679
As the princess in Heavenly Palace, how could you do so?

308
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,880
I...

309
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:12,180
 Thank you for saving us, Lord. 

310
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,439
It's no big deal.

311
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,039
Not everyone in the Immortal Realm is so outrageous.

312
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,360
Qing Mu, what do you mean?

313
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,700
Since the Demon Clan has agreed to negotiate peace, Heavenly Palace should be magnanimous.

314
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,519
If the princess in Heavenly Palace is making trouble,

315
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,139
I'm afraid the king will be laughed at by the three realms.

316
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,059
Lord Qing Mu is right.

317
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:32,360
Really? Why did you just look and not stop her?

318
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,760
People in the Human Realm say that if a lord does a crime, he should be punished as common people.

319
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,839
Even a child knows right from wrong.

320
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,379
But as immortals, you just ignored them. So funny.

321
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:47,100
Qing Mu, although I was arrogant before, you shouldn't treat me like this.

322
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,539
Because these demons were aggressive today,

323
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:53,460
I was so angry that I hurt them like this.

324
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,279
Father.

325
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:06,800
Father, who is this aunt? Why is she so bad-tempered?

326
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,019
- What did you call him? 
 - Father.

327
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,000
Aunt, why are you so close to my father?

328
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,260
Don't you know my father has my mom and me now?

329
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,960
When did Lord of the North Sea get married? How could we not know?

330
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,180
Don't talk nonsense, kid.

331
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,239
Okay, enough.

332
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:29,180
This is Princess Jing Zhao of Heavenly Palace.

333
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,320
Qing Mu, is she really your...

334
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,899
I've been living in the mansion of the North Sea. I have never gone out.

335
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:40,079
Father took me to see the divine soldiers. I didn't imagine it to be so bustling.

336
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,060
You are Princess Jing Zhao of Heavenly Palace.

337
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,000
Nice to meet you, Old Princess Jing Zhao.

338
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,100
Who do you say is old? You naughty kid. How dare you say so!

339
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,540
Am I wrong?

340
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,100
I heard Old Princess Jing Zhao is twenty thousand years old.

341
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,539
But my father is only no more than ten thousand years old.

342
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:01,419
If it's true, if you got married early,

343
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:04,460
your son would be the same age as my father.

344
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,239
You are much older than me, Princess.

345
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:10,039
You...

346
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:13,260
She is innocent. She knows nothing.

347
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,580
Am I wrong?

348
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:17,980
You have grown up now.

349
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,919
You should be polite, so others will respect you.

350
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,159
I saw what you did just now.

351
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,380
I didn't do anything.

352
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,339
My father is righteous. He is so handsome.

353
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:33,339
Relax. I won't be as arrogant as that aunt.

354
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:35,459
That's good.

355
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:43,699
Although you're the Lord of the North Sea's daughter, you don't have any divine power.

356
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:46,800
I guess your mother is just a mortal

357
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,820
who wanted to marry an immortal  by giving birth to his child.

358
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,579
What a good idea.

359
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,260
You're right, Princess.

360
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,160
But you have divine power and are noble.

361
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,780
Why haven't you become a goddess in twenty thousand years?

362
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,780
I heard Upper God Hou Chi in Qingchi Palace

363
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,680
became a goddess before she was born.

364
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,160
You...

365
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:11,180
Naughty kid, you have offended me so many times.

366
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,080
I'll punish you now.

367
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,740
I'll punish her myself, you don't need to worry.

368
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,540
For your father's sake, if you can kneel down and apologize to me,

369
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,340
I'll forgive you.

370
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,560
Okay. I can kneel down.

371
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,219
You want me to kneel down for nine times,

372
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:31,460
or do you want me to kneel down for a long time?

373
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,640
Princess, I can kneel down to you.

374
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,580
But I'm afraid you couldn't bear it.

375
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,259
Your mother is just a humble human.

376
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:42,499
How can I not bear your worship?

377
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,420
Don't regret, Princess.

378
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,099
Who are you? How can you provoke Sky Thunder?

379
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:55,659
I told you. You couldn't bear my worship.

380
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:57,360
You...

381
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:06,479
You're Hou Chi?

382
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,320
You're so imposing, Princess.

383
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,839
This is the first time that I heard someone wanted to bear Upper God's worship in the three realms.

384
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,120
I guess you have forgotten

385
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,200
how it felt when you were punished by Sky Thunder on Observation Mountain.

386
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,400
What's your relationship with Qing Mu? Why are you together?

387
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,580
Princess, this is my personal business.

388
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,400
Qing Mu.

389
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:35,600
Although Qing Mu is cold to me, he has never acted like this.

390
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,460
You must have done something to him.

391
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,259
If you continue to say nonsense,

392
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:42,540
I don't mind giving another divine order and entering Heavenly Palace.

393
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,820
You?

394
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,900
I'll let all the immortals see what this Upper God in the three realms really is.

395
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,400
Princess, Hou Chi is an Upper God.

396
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,200
You can't touch her. If you insist on doing this, then don't blame me for being rude.

397
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,400
You want to protect her? Then I won't let her go.

398
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:09,840
Stop.

399
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,900
Father God.

400
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,579
Are you okay?

401
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,639
 From now on, please select talents carefully 

402
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:30,360
 and cultivate them for the God Realm. 

403
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,039
 I'm Mu Guang, from the Golden Dragon Clan on Tianci Mountain. 

404
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,000
 I, the Goddess of the Stars and the Moon, congratulate you on inheriting the Chief God of Chaos. 

405
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,700
 I'm the Chief God of Chaos. It's my duty to save the world. 

406
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:51,300
Your Majesty the Heavenly King.

407
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:57,519
Hou Chi, I didn't imagine that you were grown up now.

408
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,900
Your Majesty, since you're here, you can deal with all the things here.

409
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,430
Qingchi Palace never interferes with the things between the immortals and demons.

410
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:08,210
I was just helping them a little. I shall leave now.

411
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,880
Let's go.

412
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:25,619
Demon Emperor and I have agreed to negotiate peace between the immortals and demons.

413
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:30,339
From now on, anyone who breaks the peace between us,

414
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:34,219
no matter who he is, I'll punish him.

415
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,579
 Thank you, Your Majesty. 

416
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,580
Who was that man standing next to Hou Chi?

417
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,639
Father God, he is my best friend.

418
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:48,060
You gave him the title, Lord of the North Sea.

419
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,760
His name is Qing Mu.

420
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:36,119
It is such good wine. Where did you get it?

421
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:39,260
Dong Hua asked his apprentice to give it to me.

422
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,580
This lord is such a gentleman.

423
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,920
But we truly need to commemorate today.

424
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,120
"My father is righteous. He is so handsome."

425
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,079
Enough.

426
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:57,340
I saw Jing Zhao's eyes today. It looked like she wanted to bite me.

427
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:03,119
Fruits?

428
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,300
When I was traveling in the Human Realm, I learned some little tricks.

429
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:13,140
Are you trying to make me happy?

430
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,199
You're an Upper God, not a kid.

431
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:18,060
How can I make you happy with these little tricks?

432
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,960
When I was unhappy as a kid,

433
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,539
Bo Xuan would make me laugh with snacks.

434
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,560
If you want to talk about the past,

435
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,400
I'm here to listen.

436
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,199
If you don't, it's good to just sit here.

437
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:46,580
Why did you choose to go with me today?

438
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,419
Do you know that the person you left behind was the King of Heaven?

439
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:54,140
He has the strongest divine power and influence in the three realms.

440
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,580
So what? I just want to go with you.

441
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:02,859
I can see Jing Zhao values you a lot.

442
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:06,819
Others want this kind of power and wealth, you really don't care?

443
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:09,759
We only have three meals and sleep in one bed.

444
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,319
Why should I be so rich?

445
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,660
I accepted the title the king gave me for Jing Jian's sake.

446
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,340
I can't refuse it.

447
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,299
Nonsense.

448
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,839
It's true.

449
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:25,661
After I received the title, I should have gone to the Heavenly Palace to thank the king.

450
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:28,700
But I was traveling in the Human Realm, so I didn't go.

451
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,200
You stood the king up?

452
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,939
There are too many etiquettes in Heavenly Palace.

453
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:38,280
I feel constrained and uncomfortable there.

454
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,120
Why are we talking about me now?

455
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,740
What happened between Jing Zhao and you?

456
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,170
You're not an unreasonable person. The thing had nothing to do with her.

457
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,379
You can live in peace with Jing Jian. Why do you treat her like an enemy?

458
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:54,499
This is not the first time I have met Jing Zhao on Observation Mountain.

459
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:04,600
 You are Hou Chi? Do you know who I am? 

460
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,079
 I'm talking to you. Do you hear me? 

461
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,619
 You're so arrogant, and you dare to yell in front of me. 

462
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:16,400
 You must be Jing Zhao in Heavenly Palace. 

463
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,300
 Hou Chi, you knew I was the princess and you were still insolent? 

464
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,219
 Qingchi Palace doesn't belong to the three realms. 

465
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:27,580
 And my position is the same as your Father God's. 

466
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,560
 Even if I'm insolent, what can you do? 

467
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,219
 Call your Father God to hit me? 

468
00:31:33,219 --> 00:31:35,299
 You're so rude and disrespectful. 

469
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:38,319
 You're so weak, no wonder Mother God abandoned you. 

470
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:40,019
 You... 

471
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,700
 That's all you can do? And you treated me so arrogantly? 

472
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,860
 I can't swim. 

473
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,679
 Aren't you an Upper God? Just use your divine power. 

474
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,840
 What? You can't? 

475
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,460
 Because your divine power is low, Mother God abandoned Qingchi Palace and you. 

476
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,820
 You are the shame of Qingchi Palace, the shame of Mother God. 

477
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:10,079
And then?

478
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,580
Luckily, Bo Xuan came in time and saved me from the water.

479
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,640
Or I'd be the first Upper God who was drowned in water.

480
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,459
Since then, I have been afraid of water. I can't swim till now.

481
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:26,400
I'm not talking about this. I mean...

482
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,199
You mean my divine power?

483
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:31,999
Just as Jing Zhao said, my divine power is low.

484
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:34,559
It took me forty thousand years to be born.

485
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,160
No matter how hard I cultivate, I can't gather divine power.

486
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,779
Father God goes to find treasures for me, so he rarely comes back.

487
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:42,359
Feng Ran wasn't here at that time.

488
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:46,320
Qingchi Palace is quiet and cold. Bo Xuan was the only one to accompany me.

489
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,640
And then Bo Xuan also left.

490
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,379
I never left Qingchi Palace.

491
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:53,180
It's okay that I lose face.

492
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,200
But I don't want to implicate my Father God.

493
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,920
So, you grew up this way in Qingchi Palace these years.

494
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,459
Sometimes I really envy you. You forgot all your memory.

495
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:10,019
Your parents are the most powerful gods in the three realms.

496
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:12,400
You can't be unable to gather divine power.

497
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,919
Is your body sealed by anything?

498
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,859
If there is a seal, how could my Father God not know it?

499
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:20,499
Okay, stop persuading me.

500
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,160
I won't treat Jing Zhao well no matter what you say.

501
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,180
Since she did such a thing to you, she should bear the consequences.

502
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,900
I didn't know before. I won't interfere in the business between her and you anymore.

503
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,500
I thought you would persuade me.

504
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,220
Jing Zhao was little, just forgive her.

505
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,940
Why should I say that?

506
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,119
You are the most important...

507
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:41,819
I won't say it.

508
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,959
I don't want to burden you.

509
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:51,360
Look! Make a wish.

510
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,100
That's just the light when lords are riding the clouds. Why should we make a wish?

511
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,920
If you believe it, your wish will come true.

512
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,519
Haven't you heard of it? Come on.

513
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:05,000
I hope Hou Chi can become a goddess, and be the most powerful one over the world.

514
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,879
Nonsense.

515
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,619
Come on, make a wish.

516
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:14,560
I hope Lord Qing Mu's wish can come true.

517
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,779
I made two wishes.

518
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:22,719
What's your second wish?

519
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,059
I won't tell you.

520
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:27,260
But I have confidence that it will come to fruition someday.

521
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:35,139
Don't think too much.

522
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:50,099
This... The Tai Cang Spear appeared again.

523
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,959
The fire, it must be the Qilin.

524
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:58,400
Qing Mu, if the Qilin is Bo Xuan, he'll surely protect the Tai Cang Spear.

525
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,059
Those people who want to take over the Tai Cang Spear will fight with him.

526
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,780
My divine power is low, I can't protect him.

527
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,040
No matter what happens, you should protect Bo Xuan.

528
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,400
Relax, I won't let anyone hurt him.

529
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,519
It's really Hong Ri.

530
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:29,120
Lord Dong Hua, I saw Hou Chi just now.

531
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,560
She really looks like Master Shang Gu.

532
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,680
I was excited and didn't think carefully,

533
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,819
but now I'm calm.

534
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:39,060
I find this suspicious.

535
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,779
I ask the Old Master to help me distinguish from them both.

536
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:45,999
Emperor, you don't need to say so.

537
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:49,000
I know what you are confused about.

538
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,500
When I first met Upper God Hou Chi,

539
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,740
I was familiar with her because they looked alike.

540
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,299
But no matter if it's from their temperament, Power of Chaos,

541
00:35:57,299 --> 00:36:00,299
or Upper God Hou Chi's family background,

542
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:03,660
maybe she is not Master Shang Gu.

543
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,819
I also think so.

544
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:11,759
But beside Hou Chi,

545
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:16,099
there is Lord Qing Mu who has the same look as Master Bai Jue.

546
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:18,379
I'm afraid this thing is not that simple.

547
00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:23,140
You said, maybe Master Bai Jue came to the Lower Realm.

548
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,999
But if Master Bai Jue is still here, he wouldn't look like Lord Qing Mu.

549
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:33,220
But if Lord Qing Mu is Master Bai Jue's descendent, he has no parent.

550
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,999
We can't find any evidence.

551
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,579
No matter what the truth is,

552
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:43,880
I think we have hope to reopening the God Realm.

553
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:49,619
What about finding a chance to fight with Lord Qing Mu?

554
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:52,779
Then we can see if he has inherited from True God Bai Jue.

555
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:54,919
Maybe I can try.

556
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:58,800
As for Upper God Hou Chi,

557
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,139
Upper God Gu Jun is traveling outside now.

558
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:05,119
Maybe Heavenly Queen can answer your question.

559
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,879
I'm afraid she knows less about it.

560
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:11,720
When she left Hou Chi then, Hou Chi wasn't born yet.

561
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,980
I'm afraid we will be able to figure it out when Gu Jun has returned.

562
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:24,119
- Father God. 
 - Father God.

563
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,059
The Tai Cang Spear has appeared.

564
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:27,980
The Demon Clan have all gone to recover it.

565
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,559
Father God, why didn't you go there?

566
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:32,500
That's a divine weapon from the Immortal Clan.

567
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,819
We can't let the Demon Clan take it.

568
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,659
I've told you many times.

569
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:39,440
There is no distinction between the immortals and demons in the God Realm.

570
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,919
How could True God Bai Jue's divine weapon be owned by the Immortal Clan?

571
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:44,919
Father God.

572
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:48,999
I had a deal with Demon Emperor.

573
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:53,139
The two of us will not intervene in the matter of the Tai Cang Spear choosing its master.

574
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:55,290
You can go with Jian'er.

575
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,719
The divine spear has its own spirit.

576
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:59,319
No matter which clan it chooses as its owner,

577
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,559
as long as two clans can abandon hatred and open the God Realm together,

578
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:07,059
it's a good thing to the three realms.

579
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:08,839
Yes, Father.

580
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:12,219
Jian'er, protect your sister.

581
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:14,020
Okay, Father God.

582
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:26,800
People say the one who can get the divine weapon from ancient times can be an Upper God.

583
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,980
Brother, help me. I want to be an Upper God this time.

584
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,900
Zhao'er, the Qilin is protecting the divine spear.

585
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,760
Let's watch first, don't be impulsive.

586
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:48,739
Lord Xian Shan, did that Qilin appear?

587
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:50,760
No.

588
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,280
You want to take over the Tai Cang Spear?

589
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,979
I want to see who dares to take it from me.

590
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,280
Hong Ri?

591
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,280
That's not Hong Ri.

592
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,500
But, how? That is his spiritual aura.

593
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,660
It's just Hong Ri's soul fragment.

594
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,479
 You commoners, how dare you to come here to True God's cultivating place.  How offensive! 

595
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:31,320
 Leave here! 

596
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,579
What do you think?

597
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,420
He is not Bo Xuan.

598
00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:02,960


599
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:18,520
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫
