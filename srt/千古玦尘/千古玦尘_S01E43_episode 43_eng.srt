1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:09,950


2
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:21,600
   

3
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,399
   

4
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:28,498
At least, in others' eyes,

5
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:31,958
I'm still the closest person to you.

6
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:36,119
So straightforward, you are more sincere than you were before.

7
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,319
I lost all my face at our wedding today.

8
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,138
Now I beg for your mercy.

9
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:44,779
Please don't have me driven out of the Blue Dome of Heaven.

10
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:48,138
Those who cross the river and demolish the bridge are disdainful.

11
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,400
Keep your nose clean and you shall get the honor you want.

12
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,260
Thank you, Master.

13
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,899
So you married me for Master Shang Gu, right?

14
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,638
You have overstepped.

15
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,679
You don't need to take care of me when I am cultivating.

16
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,440
Do what you want.

17
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,279
 Shang Gu, I have taken away all your memories after the Netherworld. 

18
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,059
 By doing so, 

19
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:54,060
 you won't know what the Doom of Chaos is. 

20
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,038
Yang'er, you started the war between the immortals and demons.

21
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:42,438
Go and receive twenty thunderbolts of Sky Thunder outside.

22
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:47,838
As for the God Slayer Flower, those immortals have been appeased by me.

23
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:50,599
Don't mention this in the future.

24
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,299
Okay, Father God.

25
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,499
It's a capital crime if you kill a god!

26
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:16,138
Do you want our kid to die with you?

27
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:18,199
If Zhao'er and I didn't plead for you,

28
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,440
Yang'er would have been dead by now!

29
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,399
Where did you get the God Slayer Flower?

30
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,839
Did you get it from the Netherworld?

31
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,058
As the Heavenly Queen, why would you do so?

32
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:32,540
What are you thinking?

33
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:38,138
I killed Goddess Yue Mi.

34
00:04:38,138 --> 00:04:39,419
What did you say?

35
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,160
You killed my master?

36
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,578
I've been lying to you for sixty thousand years.

37
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:50,820
Now, I can't hide it anymore.

38
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,359
No wonder.

39
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,656
You started the war between the immortals and demons again and again.

40
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:03,779
And you wanted to chase after Hou Chi and Demon God.

41
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,760
However you want to punish me,

42
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,440
I won't escape.

43
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,739
That was my master!

44
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:14,220
What do you want me to do?

45
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,899
How can I protect you?

46
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,519
Sixty thousand years ago,

47
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,759
I wanted to stop Demon God from opening the Array of World Destruction.

48
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,759
But Goddess Yue Mi came and tried to protect Demon God.

49
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,919
I wanted to stop Demon God,

50
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,518
but she...

51
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,300
Was this really an accident?

52
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,460
Goddess Yue Mi treated me well.

53
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,679
And she was your master.

54
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,419
There is no hatred between us.

55
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,760
Why would I kill her?

56
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,119
You know I came from humble beginnings.

57
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:54,699
It was Master Shang Gu who brought me to the God Realm by accident.

58
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,260
Although the immortals didn't talk about it,

59
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,819
they looked down upon my family background.

60
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,319
I wanted to prove I was a useful person,

61
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,420
so I wanted to contribute by stopping Demon God before he destroyed the world.

62
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,359
 Nonsense. It's dangerous. Just go back. 

63
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,519
 I know my divine power is low. 

64
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,579
 But I want to help Her Royal Highness. 

65
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:20,879
 If I just stay here and do nothing, how could I be at ease? 

66
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,500
 And how could I have any face in the God Realm? 

67
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,420
In order to hide this,

68
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,100
I started conflicts again and again.

69
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,199
These hundreds of years, I have been haunted by demons.

70
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,739
I'm tired. And I can't hide it anymore.

71
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,779
I confess my crime and am willing to be punished,

72
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:44,380
it's also a relief to me.

73
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,179
Just do it.

74
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:51,439
You're my wife.

75
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,958
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

76
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,679
If I told you, you would have been involved.

77
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,859
Although it was an accident,

78
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:02,399
I did kill Goddess Yue Mi.

79
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,899
I can't escape from killing a god.

80
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,478
The reputation of the Heavenly Palace, your reputation,

81
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,459
Yang'er, Jian'er, Zhao'er,

82
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:15,160
none of you would be able to escape from it.

83
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,720
Tell the three realms that I became a devil.

84
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,779
The children and you can cut ties with me,

85
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:27,759
only then will you not be implicated. This is the only solution.

86
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,179
What did you say? You became a devil?

87
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,820
You are also responsible for the slaughter of the Phoenix Clan?

88
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:03,160
A'Huan, becoming a devil is a serious thing.

89
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,839
Since you know that I killed Goddess Yue Mi,

90
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:14,380
you look at me in the way you would look at a devil.

91
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,439
My master's death was an accident.

92
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,360
You're not totally responsible for it.

93
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,479
A false move and everything can be lost.

94
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,819
I'm afraid Demon God will tell Master Bai Jue this secret,

95
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:37,139
so I went to the Netherworld.

96
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,118
I got the God Slayer Flower and gave it to Yang'er.

97
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,718
What can I do now?

98
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,480
Master Bai Jue suspects that I am involved with the devils.

99
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:55,039
I'll hide this from Master Bai Jue.

100
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,439
Your confession, I didn't hear any of it.

101
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,900
Mu Guang.

102
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,780
From now on, stay in the Heavenly Palace and do good deeds,

103
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,419
and wash away your sins.

104
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,698
I'm a guilty person...

105
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:17,420
who won't go anywhere else in the future.

106
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,540
From tomorrow,

107
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,818
I'll go to the Swamp of Netherhill every day.

108
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:26,840
I'll plead for my master's forgiveness for you.

109
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,579
If Master Bai Jue pursues the matter,

110
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:34,559
what should we do?

111
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,498
Merits and demerits can offset each other.

112
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:41,679
If it can't, I'll be punished with you.

113
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,158
 You can protect me for a while, you can't protect me forever. 

114
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:56,838
 I won't stop cultivating evil power. 

115
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:58,379
 If Shang Gu comes back, 

116
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,959
 Bai Jue restores his power and I'm held accountable, 

117
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,620
 I'll be a lower immortal again. 

118
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,480
 No. I'll be worse than a lower immortal. 

119
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,739
Don't tell me you're not Qing Mu.

120
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:44,740
Poor Hou Chi.

121
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,904
She didn't know Bo Xuan and you were the same person until she died.

122
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:49,179
   

123
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:51,578
You implied to me when we were fighting,

124
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:54,599
I would regret if I stopped you today.

125
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,678
I said the same sentence sixty thousand years ago.

126
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:03,920
So, I went to the Swamp of Netherhill.

127
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,400
I found the Doom of Chaos which was sealed by you.

128
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,819
I thought I was the only one to act like a villain and deal with Doom.

129
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,280
I didn't imagine you would do such a thing as well.

130
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:20,979
There is some things you still don't know.

131
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,038
My plan failed sixty thousand years ago.

132
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:28,720
Maybe it also can't work out this time.

133
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,100
Why don't we switch roles?

134
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,078
I'll go for the Doom, and you can take care of Shang Gu.

135
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:37,299
Zi Han and Yue Mi are gone.

136
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:39,480
I have nobody to worry about.

137
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:44,918
Unlike Shang Gu and you, you can continue to be together.

138
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,598
When Shang Gu wakes up,

139
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:50,859
I don't want to know how much you love each other.

140
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:53,258
But if you argue with each other,

141
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:55,860
you can tell me in front of my tomb.

142
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:59,819
Do you have the Power of Chaos?

143
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,039
How did you cultivate it?

144
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:11,479
Sixty thousand years ago, I used all my core power

145
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:14,478
to trap the Doom of Chaos in the Swamp of Netherhill,

146
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:17,160
so that I could delay its breaking-out time.

147
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,238
Then, as I was looking for Shang Gu's soul pieces in three realms,

148
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:24,340
I was finding ways to cultivate the Power of Chaos.

149
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,200
Demon aura?

150
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,319
After the Doom of Chaos, I've been analyzing this flower.

151
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,460
I found that the flower relies on demon aura

152
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,060
and immortal aura in the world.

153
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,640
Between these two aurae, there is Chaos aura.

154
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,578
So I venture to guess,

155
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:09,719
if I refine this demon aura and immortal aura to perfection and then merge it,

156
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:12,379
can I also refine it into the Power of Chaos?

157
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:17,839
So you endured the pain of splitting your core power and creating Qing Mu's body

158
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,679
just so that he could absorb demon auras in the world until they were merged.

159
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,938
That's right.

160
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:24,220
But when I was combining with Qing Mu,

161
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,979
there was an accident.

162
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:28,959
I didn't seal his source power immediately,

163
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,938
this led to Qing Mu having his own consciousness.

164
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:35,820
He grew up in the North Sea and fell in love with Hou Chi.

165
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,740
All these things that happened were far from my plan.

166
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,499
Didn't you know that you could have died by separating your core power?

167
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:46,680
Do you know because of your craziness,

168
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,540
Hou Chi lived in pain and regret until she died?

169
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,879
I know.

170
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,280
Qing Mu, Hou Chi, and Gu Jun,

171
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,420
I'm sorry to them.

172
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,558
Many things exceeded my expectations,

173
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:07,779
so I won't let anyone influence me from responding to the Doom for Shang Gu.

174
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,180
Say it. How can I help you?

175
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,478
Wu Huan has been trying to kill you. You should be careful.

176
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,519
Do you think I'm afraid of her?

177
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,620
According to my personality before,

178
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,259
I would have led an army and fought with the Heavenly Palace just to kill that mean woman.

179
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,440
And what about now?

180
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,599
Wu Huan has been governing the Heavenly Palace for sixty thousand years.

181
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,659
She has a solid foundation.

182
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:46,678
If I want to kill her, without clear evidence,

183
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,700
I'm afraid the three realms won't believe me.

184
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,800
You're right.

185
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,799
After all, you've destroyed the world.

186
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,859
You laugh at me?

187
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:59,620
You didn't expose Wu Huan becoming a devil.

188
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:04,619
She can hide evil aura at will.

189
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:07,700
We can't underestimate her.

190
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,879
Before you and I are fully prepared, we can't act rashly.

191
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,939
Forget it. Just let her be arrogant for now.

192
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:21,959
Compared with her, the most important thing is

193
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,500
that the Immortal and Demon Clans live in peace and recover.

194
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,480
I've promised Zi Han that I will no longer be a willful person.

195
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:45,600
If Zhi Yang heard what you said, he would be proud of you.

196
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:53,580
Yes. I miss him as well.

197
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,979
Bai Jue, that child...

198
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:01,699
I've seen that child secretly.

199
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,420
Your son is much cuter than you.

200
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,019
I've been thinking of his name, what do you...

201
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:10,579
His name was settled.

202
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:12,459
His name is Yuan Qi.

203
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:14,779
His mother gave him the name.

204
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,640
It seems I worried too much.

205
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,159
He is the son of Shang Gu and you.

206
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:25,919
Smelly Ice Cube.

207
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,658
Congratulations, you're a father now.

208
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,838
It's inconvenient for him to stay with me.

209
00:16:31,838 --> 00:16:35,859
Just let him stay with his mother in Qingchi Palace.

210
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:37,740
Are you sure?

211
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,239
He has the Power of Chaos.

212
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:43,119
I'm afraid he will be used by Wu Huan.

213
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:47,379
You need to remind him not to use spiritual power outside.

214
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,379
Of course, I know that.

215
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:54,798
Relax. Before you showed up, I had been treating him well.

216
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:56,379
Tian Qi.

217
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,219
Don't waste time. Try hard to cultivate.

218
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:03,819
If there is another Doom of Chaos,

219
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:06,280
it's your turn.

220
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,299
I know that.

221
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,160
And the Demon Clan.

222
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,540
You are governing the Demon Clan for me.

223
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:19,179
Smelly Ice Cube, why do you always like to teach others and be so wordy? Can't get rid of that habit?

224
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,100
Zi Han.

225
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,738
Do you even care about him?

226
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:13,338
Yuan Qi wanted to know how birds fly,

227
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:16,078
as a result, the wings of the spirit animals are all bald on the mountain.

228
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:17,700
His spiritual power is too strong.

229
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,698
If you don't teach him, we can't defeat him.

230
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,680
As the old saying goes,

231
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,139
"Naughty boys are clever,

232
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:29,619
naughty girls are smart."

233
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:33,118
I think he is thirsty for more knowledge.

234
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:34,459
It's good.

235
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:38,620
Don't spoil him, or Master Shang Gu will scold you when she wakes up.

236
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,019
Emperor Sword?

237
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:57,840
This sword looks strange.

238
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:01,140
You want to escape?

239
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:11,940
I'll let Xiao Huang play with it.

240
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,439
Where am I?

241
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,140
There is not a little evil aura.

242
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,200
Was I injured and someone took me out of the Netherworld?

243
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,299
You naughty kid. Why did you turn the Emperor Sword into this?

244
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,780
Do you know it's mine?

245
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,859
You woke up?

246
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:00,239
I thought you would never wake up.

247
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,938
Whose kid are you?

248
00:20:03,938 --> 00:20:05,840
Why are you so impolite?

249
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,498
You are finally awake.

250
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:10,879
Stop crying.

251
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,838
You took my sword apart, I haven't cried yet.

252
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:20,400
 ♫ See the waves come and go with the mountains ♫ 

253
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:24,820
You look just like you were carved out of the same mold as Bai Jue.

254
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,879
You...

255
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:29,100
Who are your father and mother?

256
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,600
- I... 
  - Yuan Qi. 

257
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,779
Don't disturb your aunt.

258
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,980
Third Uncle.

259
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,700
 ♫ Time loaned me the eternal galaxy ♫ 

260
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,280
 ♫ But where's the old friend ♫ 

261
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,059
Third Uncle.

262
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,659
Go back to your room.

263
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:53,118
 ♫ How many years have been reincarnated 
 after thousands of tribulations? ♫ 

264
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,639
I just went to the Netherworld for a few thousand years.

265
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:57,919
Why did your hair turn white?

266
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,979
The Netherworld?

267
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:01,660
Where is Bai Jue?

268
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,520
Shang Gu, it has been sixty thousand years...

269
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,039
since you went to the Netherworld.

270
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,700
   

271
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:27,460
So, the Doom of Chaos has passed,

272
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,198
and you defeated Xuan Yi?

273
00:21:30,198 --> 00:21:31,719
Yes.

274
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:35,718
The God Realm closed and there is a Human Realm.

275
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:41,158
Yue Mi, Zhi Yang, Gu Jun, and Zi Han are managing the God Realm now.

276
00:21:41,158 --> 00:21:45,019
Mu Guang and Wu Huan are managing the Immortal Realm,

277
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:47,078
as well as the Human Realm.

278
00:21:47,078 --> 00:21:51,119
So Bai Jue just abandoned me

279
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,539
and had a kid with an immortal,

280
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:57,139
then the immortal girl died?

281
00:21:57,139 --> 00:22:00,540
Bai Jue is living in the Blue Dome of Heaven,

282
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:07,439
and he is living with Wu Huan's daughter, Jing Zhao.

283
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,199
Yes.

284
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,760
So I've been taking care of this kid.

285
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,380
There is too much information.

286
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,719
I can't believe it.

287
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,739
The kid is impolite.

288
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:33,940
It seems that you brought him up.

289
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,720
I also brought you up.

290
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:42,219
Do you remember Feng Yan and Wu Xi?

291
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:44,358
This is their daughter, Feng Ran.

292
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:45,979
Although you're much older than her,

293
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:49,399
I think you can get along well with each other.

294
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:51,140
Master.

295
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:59,360
Yuan Qi, what does your mother look like?

296
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,480
Just like you.

297
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,739
How could you compare me with an immortal?

298
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:07,839
You really look the same as her.

299
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,638
I told you what you should say. What do you want?

300
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,880
The weapon you gave me is not enough.

301
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,039
I want the Purple Moon Whip.

302
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,520
You are asking too much.

303
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,779
Will you give it to me, Third Uncle?

304
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,880
It's a deal.

305
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:26,079
What are you talking about?

306
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:29,999
He wants to go to the toilet. Go ahead.

307
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,819
Don't break it.

308
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,240
Wait.

309
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:44,258
I want to pee.

310
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:48,300
You said I look the same as your mother.

311
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,079
Is it true?

312
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:57,159
Actually, since I was born, my mother has been gone.

313
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:01,000
So I don't know what my mother looks like.

314
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:05,538
Can I go to pee now?

315
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:07,319
You call Tian Qi Third Uncle.

316
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,660
You can call me "aunt" in the future.

317
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,539
You're so nice, Aunt.

318
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:13,958
You've slept for a hundred years and missed many things.

319
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:16,619
You should ask Third Uncle about them.

320
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,958
Yuan Qi said I've slept for a hundred years.

321
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,358
And you said I've slept for sixty thousand years.

322
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,359
Explain this to me.

323
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,198
Shang Gu, you've slept twice.

324
00:24:29,198 --> 00:24:30,940
You've slept for sixty thousand years first,

325
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,060
then you slept for a hundred years.

326
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,139
I've slept twice?

327
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:40,519
Then why don't I have the memory of waking up?

328
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,120
Why are you still lying to me?

329
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,900
Feng Ran.

330
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,359
Master, you just woke up. I guess you're hungry now.

331
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:51,759
There is porridge in the kitchen. I'll go and check it.

332
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,980
Well, Shang Gu,

333
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,590
I learned a new skill during the one hundred years. Pear blossom cake.

334
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,630
I'll make it for you.

335
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,820
In the sixty thousand years, what did I do?

336
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:17,779
Iron from the White Tiger, feather from the Phoenix,

337
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:20,560
horn from the Dragon, armor from the Divine Turtle,

338
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,719
they come from four sacred beasts from all directions.

339
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,718
They belong to the same clan.

340
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:30,278
The ancient Emperor Sword made of these four materials is infinitely powerful.

341
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:34,718
The iron is the upper jaw fangs of the sacred beast White Tiger.

342
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:38,699
The black armor of Divine Turtle is the armor of sacred beast Xuan Wu.

343
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:40,399
It can resist all attacks.

344
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:43,779
So, the iron becomes the sword's blade,

345
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:47,039
the armor becomes the scabbard.

346
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,378
One can stab all things, one can stop all wounds.

347
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,518
Third Uncle, if I use the iron to attack the armor,

348
00:25:58,518 --> 00:26:00,520
what would happen?

349
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,399
No one has tried this.

350
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,980
Maybe they'll both suffer great losses.

351
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,180
I'll try it.

352
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,719
Yuan Qi.

353
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,219
If the materials are destroyed,

354
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:16,719
Emperor Sword would be useless scrap iron.

355
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:20,160
Your mother treasures it a lot.

356
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,900
Okay.

357
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,219
Yuan Qi, your mother just woke up.

358
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:30,060
There is something I need to tell you.

359
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,000
You want to tell me what I need to say?

360
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,080
It's not like that.

361
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,200
- It's just... 
 - Third Uncle,

362
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,299
a few days ago, I went down the mountain with Sister Feng Ran.

363
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,039
We met Xiao Ba from the Flower Clan.

364
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,958
Third Uncle, you know that.

365
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:48,139
Xiao Ba is fifty years younger than me.

366
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,499
When we walked closer, we saw he was holding a dagger.

367
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:53,739
His birthday was engraved on it.

368
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:54,838
After we asked him,

369
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:59,820
I found out that it was a magic tool that was given to Xiao Ba for cultivation by the elders of the Flower Clan.

370
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,879
Third Uncle, I'm a hundred years old now.

371
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:06,580
I don't have a weapon.

372
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,799
If I don't have one,

373
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,560
others may laugh at me.

374
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:18,440
The divine weapons that I've given you are no less than a thousand, right?

375
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,900
But those are others' weapons.

376
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,198
They were not specially made for me.

377
00:27:23,198 --> 00:27:25,179
They aren't rare.

378
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:27,618
Although Xiao Ba is fifty years younger than you,

379
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:30,358
he took the elder in Flower Clan as his master.

380
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:33,159
Unlike you, you haven't even started seriously cultivating yet.

381
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:35,000
What do you want a weapon for?

382
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,438
I don't care, I want one.

383
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:41,199
No way. Don't say that again.

384
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,079
Third Uncle,

385
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:50,399
you didn't see how Xiao Ba wields that dagger in front of me.

386
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,619
He was so proud.

387
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:56,419
And he didn't want to let me borrow it to play with it for a few days.

388
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:57,939
Borrow?

389
00:27:57,939 --> 00:28:00,299
Then I'm afraid you'd never give it back.

390
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,199
Xiao Ba is not stupid.

391
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,178
Third Uncle, Mother has Emperor Sword,

392
00:28:08,178 --> 00:28:09,899
you have Purple Moon Whip,

393
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:12,159
Sister Feng Ran has Feather Fire Whip.

394
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,238
All the immortals who are cultivating in Qilian Mountain

395
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:18,999
all have a weapon especially made for them.

396
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,100
Even the gopher demon who is shorter than me has divine claws as his weapon.

397
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,118
But I don't have one. I don't care, I want one.

398
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:31,578
It's useless. You asked too much.

399
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:34,900
Why do you say I ask too much?

400
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,319
Because I'm your third uncle.

401
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,198
Forget it. It's okay if you don't give it to me.

402
00:28:40,198 --> 00:28:41,378
I'll make one myself.

403
00:28:41,378 --> 00:28:43,140
Yuan Qi.

404
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,900
I promise you, within a few years,

405
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,339
you will have an exclusive weapon which will be very powerful.

406
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:56,400
It will be more powerful than your friends' weapons.

407
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,240
Really?

408
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,020
You are so clever.

409
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,699
Why would I lie to you?

410
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:07,139
What did I want to say just now?

411
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,000
You said you would buy sugarcoated haws for me.

412
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,459
I want to eat sugarcoated haws.

413
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:21,439
I can satisfy this requirement.

414
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,939
The strawberries at the foot of the mountain are ripe.

415
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:25,940
If we thread the strawberries and haws together,

416
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,180
then wrap it with a thick layer of sugar coating,

417
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,100
it would be deliciously sweet.

418
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:37,039
You gluttonous kid. Help me to stand up.

419
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,880
Where are you going, Third Uncle?

420
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,579
To make sugarcoated haws for you.

421
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:48,000
You're nice, Third Uncle.

422
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,039
 The evil auras I absorbed in a hundred years 

423
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,620
 have made my evil power improve a lot. 

424
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,979
 Even if I were exposed someday, what is there to fear? 

425
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:27,679
Your Highness.

426
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,139
Feng Nv, perfect timing.

427
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:32,660
Taste this jade-like wine.

428
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,799
What? Are you afraid that I'd poison you?

429
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,699
I wouldn't dare.

430
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,519
This wine is sweet and delicious.

431
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,399
Thank you, Your Highness.

432
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:05,880
How is the thing I asked you to do?

433
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,118
Your Highness, when I traveled to the Immortal Realm,

434
00:31:14,118 --> 00:31:17,219
I gathered the spirit of people who died in vain.

435
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:20,180
I've put all of them in this bottle.

436
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,478
With the evil spirits and the evil auras in the Netherworld,

437
00:31:24,478 --> 00:31:28,260
I'm sure they can help you to cultivate and improve.

438
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:33,999
Feng Nv, since having retreated to here,

439
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:38,000
this Fuyao Hall has been left out in the cold.

440
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,420
You are the only one who has never left me.

441
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,759
I'm willing to do anything for you, Your Highness.

442
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,980
You don't need to thank me.

443
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:52,138
But there is one thing, I want to ask for your permission.

444
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,099
What is it?

445
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:56,378
Just say it.

446
00:31:56,378 --> 00:31:58,539
Before I came back here,

447
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:00,579
I went to Wutong Forest.

448
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:03,820
Many young phoenixes have been born.

449
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,879
I want...

450
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,259
Leave the Heavenly Palace?

451
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,319
Wutong Forest is my homeland.

452
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:11,320
The Phoenix Clan needs to be rebuilt.

453
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,900
But you know, I can't leave you.

454
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,258
Even if I go back to the Phoenix Clan,

455
00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:25,319
I'll also obey the orders of Your Highness.

456
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,239
Forget it.

457
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:34,199
Since you really want to leave,

458
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:37,960
I won't force you to stay here.

459
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,959
Thank you, Your Highness.

460
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,359
All those who fall to the devils,

461
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:58,579
regardless of life or death,

462
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:01,359
must follow my orders.

463
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:17,339
Tian Qi told me, there is not a complete weapon in Qingchi Palace.

464
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:19,299
Why do you take them apart?

465
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:23,259
I want to see what are in them.

466
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:27,299
Although these are rare things, there is no mechanism in them.

467
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:33,500
I was just wondering why these treasures have different divine powers when they are assembled together.

468
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:38,260
Why is each treasure assembled made with different materials?

469
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,520
For example, your Emperor Sword.

470
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,039
It is made of iron from the White Tiger, feather from the Phoenix,

471
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,460
horn from the Dragon, armor from the Divine Turtle.

472
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,999
The iron is the sword's blade. The feather is the sword's tail.

473
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:50,478
The horn is the hilt. The armor is the scabbard.

474
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:54,118
Why do we use these four materials to make Emperor Sword?

475
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,438
As hard material, why can't we use iron as the scabbard,

476
00:33:57,438 --> 00:34:00,100
and the armor as the sword body?

477
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,400
I've never thought of this question.

478
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,039
You don't know this? You are a Chief God.

479
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:13,539
I know that. But I've slept for too long.

480
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:16,159
I can't remember much after I waking up.

481
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:21,180
Tian Qi told me. Although your Father God looks cold,

482
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,520
he is a steady and calm person.

483
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,119
I didn't expect him to be less responsible than Tian Qi in your bringing up.

484
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,159
You can stay with me.

485
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,879
I'll take care of you for your Father God, okay?

486
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:34,098
Although your mother is an immortal,

487
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:36,799
you've the posterity of a True God.

488
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:38,399
As long as you behave well,

489
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,539
I'll give you whatever you want. Okay?

490
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,099
Really?

491
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:45,720
I want my mother back.

492
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,839
Change one. For example, I can take you to find your Father God.

493
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,040
Why would I find him?

494
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:56,878
Tian Qi told me, he never brought you to Blue Dome of Heaven.

495
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:58,679
You look like your Father God.

496
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,238
He will be happy when he sees you.

497
00:35:01,238 --> 00:35:04,059
He doesn't come to see me, why would I go to see him?

498
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:07,118
Besides, there is no treasure there.

499
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:09,900
I don't want to go there.

500
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,820
You want to find Bai Jue?

501
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,518
The aunt and nephew are connected with the same disease; they were both abandoned by him.

502
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,419
We should find him and ask him to explain it to us.

503
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,678
How can we do that?

504
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,119
We should ask him face to face.

505
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,719
We can ask him why he is so capricious and ignores others' feelings.

506
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:30,018
If he argues back, we can teach him a lesson.

507
00:35:30,018 --> 00:35:33,660
I've cultivated the Power of Chaos in the Netherworld.

508
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,460
I can beat him up.

509
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,718
No.

510
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,979
Why? You're afraid I'll hurt him?

511
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:40,498
Of course not.

512
00:35:40,498 --> 00:35:42,678
Asking him face to face will be too easy for him.

513
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:45,879
Let's burn down the Blue Dome of Heaven.

514
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,600
We are the same kind of people.

515
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,880
   

516
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,320
Why is your sugarcoated haws bigger than mine?

517
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,720
Third Uncle made it for me.

518
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,860
If I had known this, I wouldn't have gone down the mountain to buy it.

519
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,718
When could Tian Qi make desserts?

520
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:23,479
I forced him to learn it. Let's go. I'll lead the way.

521
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:25,479
You can fly now?

522
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:33,560
 Don't use the Power of Chaos in front of your mother, understand? 

523
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:36,220
 Here. 

524
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,979
No, I won't lead the way, you'll lead.

525
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:43,720
Take my hand.

526
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,998
You should take my hand tightly.

527
00:36:44,998 --> 00:36:47,298
I can't bear the responsibility if you fall.

528
00:36:47,298 --> 00:36:48,979
Take this for me.

529
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,560
Dantian.

530
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,419
I need to use Dantian to gather the Power of Chaos.

531
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,720
I've slept for too long.

532
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:07,140
How did you know that?

533
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,739
I've read books about it.

534
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:11,559
No wonder you're Bai Jue's son.

535
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,220
You can teach me at such a young age.

536
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,879
Let's go.

537
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:28,578
This place is the same as Abyss Hall.

538
00:37:28,578 --> 00:37:31,778
Okay, we can only watch and no talking.

539
00:37:31,778 --> 00:37:33,980
Didn't you say you were going to burn this place down?

540
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,359
Burn this place?

541
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,319
I'm a Chief God in the three realms.

542
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,399
Isn't that going too far?

543
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:43,819
Think about the moment when he abandoned you and me.

544
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:46,219
Be good.

545
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:49,000
So you are not going to ask him face to face?

546
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,339
It has been sixty thousand years. I can't remember many things.

547
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:55,919
I don't know how to ask him.

548
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,819
Let's peep on the roof.

549
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,220
We didn't come in from the front door.

550
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,198
This is already impolite.

551
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:09,799
If we peep on the roof and Bai Jue finds it out,

552
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:12,359
it would be so embarrassing.

553
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,519
Then when he abandoned you and me, wasn't he embarrassed?

554
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,299
You're right.

555
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,399
What are you doing?

556
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,620
Throw it on Bai Jue's head.

557
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,299
You said you were not afraid of him.

558
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:46,599
I'm not afraid of him, I can't explain it to you.

559
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:51,579
Fine. You can peep here.

560
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:55,059
I shall go now. Let's gather at the gate.

561
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:59,340
Come back. You might get lost.

562
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:16,100
 ♫ I really want to know where you are now ♫ 

563
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:21,239
It's deep. I'm a little afraid.

564
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,380
When did you wake up?

565
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,159
Today.

566
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,599
Tian Qi should have told me.

567
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,858
I can go to Qingchi Palace and visit you.

568
00:39:35,858 --> 00:39:37,920
You don't have to bother to come here.

569
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,280
Why do you have to be so polite between you and me?

570
00:39:45,482 --> 00:39:47,700
We haven't seen each other for thousands of years.

571
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,760
Many things have changed.

572
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:53,720
I didn't want to come here. It's Yuan Qi.

573
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,039
Where is Yuan Qi?

574
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,718
I don't know where he went.

575
00:39:57,718 --> 00:40:00,299
Don't worry. He often comes here.

576
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:01,940
He won't get lost.

577
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:04,379
He...

578
00:40:04,379 --> 00:40:05,539
 Why are you here again? 

579
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:07,259
 Why did you throw a rat on me? 

580
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:09,499
 I'll hit you. 

581
00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:12,418
Relax. He is not a pushover.

582
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,600
Your wound...

583
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,699
I need to change my clothes.

584
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:30,600
 ♫ I want to protect our love ♫ 

585
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,560
He sneaked here and played jokes.

586
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,923
It's because he wants to attract your attention.

587
00:40:35,923 --> 00:40:37,559
Even if you married someone else,

588
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,760
you should protect him and raise him yourself.

589
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:45,140
Does Jing Zhao dislike him that much?

590
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,819
I don't know how to face him.

591
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:52,900
Yuan Qi is your son.

592
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,059
He looks exactly like you.

593
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:59,359
How could you abandon him in Qingchi Palace?

594
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,059
You want to raise him, you raise him.

595
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:04,698
If you don't want to raise him, you can send him to learn from someone.

596
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:06,918
Send him somewhere?

597
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:11,039
It seems you are ready to be despised by him when he grows up.

598
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,819
I can tell you now that you are leaving a very bad image in his eyes.

599
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:18,158
Are you done?

600
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:22,539
- It has only been sixty thousand years, why... 
 - I want to live a different life, can't I?

601
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:38,000


602
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:48,719
 ♫ Year after year time goes by ♫ 

603
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:55,624
 ♫ Don't be afraid if our fate comes back ♫ 

604
00:41:55,624 --> 00:42:02,400
 ♫ Rains flood and memories last ♫ 

605
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,380
 ♫ My longing for you won't change no matter what ♫ 

606
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:15,124
 ♫ I have been waiting for so many years ♫ 

607
00:42:15,124 --> 00:42:21,649
 ♫ I never leave despite endless sorrow♫ 

608
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:28,900
 ♫ Love is like a faraway bright moon ♫ 

609
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:35,425
 ♫ I'll wait through my lifetime ♫ 

610
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:52,719
 ♫ I spend years waiting for returning birds ♫ 

611
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:59,299
 ♫ I never regret it and no one can replace you ♫ 

612
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:06,480
 ♫ I hope we'll uncover the past when we wake up ♫ 

613
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:13,500
 ♫ I'll finally bare my heart to you ♫ 

614
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:21,560
 ♫ Along the way, I watch flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

615
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:28,440
 ♫ Maybe we'll meet and part again in the future ♫ 

616
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,824
 ♫ Tears turn into clouds and rain falls in my heart ♫ 

617
00:43:34,824 --> 00:43:41,419
 ♫ When the clouds break, our future will be clear ♫ 

618
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:51,950
 ♫ I'll enjoy a free life with you forever ♫
