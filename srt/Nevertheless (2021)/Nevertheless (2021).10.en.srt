1
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,421
Do you regret it?

2
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,841
You regret what we did?

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,926
Then just say so.

4
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,432
Yeah.

5
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,393
I do.

6
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,442
You, this messed up relationship,
and everything we ever did together.

7
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,111
But I'm not
going to blame you for it.

8
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,447
I brought it on myself.

9
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,203
I already knew from the very beginning
there was no happy ending for us,

10
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,538
but I was a total idiot
for getting my hopes up

11
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,165
and thinking you could be sincere.

12
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,003
You said I had the right

13
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,755
to choose what happens
to our relationship.

14
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,260
Don't you ever show your face to me again.

15
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,306
To be honest, I already knew,

16
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,101
deep down…

17
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,437
that this wasn't love.

18
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,658
I think I get it now.

19
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,121
I'm the one who ruined everything.

20
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,666
It was all me.

21
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,017
I couldn't sleep at all
after that.

22
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,728
I do.

23
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:35,108
You, this messed up relationship,
and everything we ever did together.

24
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,194
That painful expression
Na-bi had…

25
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,531
…and that cracked, sobbing voice,

26
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,409
heavily lingered in my head all night.

27
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,488
Ironically,
what kept me up all night

28
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,241
weren't the bitter words that he had said,

29
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,077
but his warm, yet piercing eyes,

30
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,122
his gentle voice whenever he called,

31
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,958
and his soft, but firm touch.

32
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,919
I'm so pathetic.

33
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,980
-Hey, Na-bi.
-Hey.

34
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,107
No hangover for you?

35
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,026
No.

36
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,322
We drank so much more
after you already left.

37
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,532
I never knew Jae-eon drank that much.

38
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,744
I almost died trying to keep up with him.

39
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,667
So, Jin-su…

40
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,256
I'm thinking you don't actually
have to help me with my piece anymore.

41
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,760
I'll handle the rest.

42
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,220
What's this all of a sudden?

43
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,515
Well, it's our exam period now.

44
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,559
Not to mention,
most of it is done already.

45
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,895
You can tell Jae-eon as well
that I'll take it from here.

46
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:36,896
Hmm.

47
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,940
Sure. Okay, then.

48
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,818
-Hmm. Good. Thanks.
-Mm-hm.

49
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,681
What else are you doing?

50
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,100
-What?
-Hey.

51
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,438
Hey!

52
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,107
-Hey!
-Oh! What is it? What, what, what?

53
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,151
Have you seen Gyu-hyun and Bit-na?

54
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,570
Ahh… Not yet. At least not today.

55
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,864
What is going on with them?

56
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,409
First they were fighting all the time,
now they're leaving me out completely.

57
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,453
BIT-NA

58
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,080
No way. She knew I was talking about her?

59
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,333
What?

60
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,251
Oh! Hey, hey! I heard that

61
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,253
you're at the department office right now.
Is that correct?

62
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,839
-Yeah. How did you know?
-Oh, that's a relief.

63
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,052
Take a look at the shelves and see if you
happen to spot a laptop anywhere near it.

64
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,345
A laptop?

65
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,722
Oh. Yeah, it's here.

66
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,225
Open it. And there should be
a file dated for today on the desktop.

67
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,976
I want you to send that to me.
You got that?

68
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,645
And what's in it for me?

69
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,397
Damn, dude, are you serious?
I'll buy you some fried chicken.

70
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,942
Oh! Let's do this. Hang on a sec.

71
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,823
All right.

72
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,869
You still there?

73
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,539
Which file is it?

74
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,624
Hey, you got a lock screen here.
Password, please.

75
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,833
What?

76
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,337
Oh, that's right.

77
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,132
It's, uh…

78
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,969
What? Is it the pin to your bank account?

79
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,763
I'm not gonna steal your money,
don't worry. Password, go.

80
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,894
"Totally smoking hot Nam Gyu-hyun."

81
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,437
Hang on, I didn't get that.

82
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,399
What did you say? I can't hear you.

83
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,153
I said, it's "Totally smoking
hot Nam Gyu-hyun."

84
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,198
Ugh! Sheesh! Speak up a little.
I can't understand you!

85
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,742
Damn it, dude!
"Totally smoking hot Nam Gyu-hyun"!

86
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,160
You little prick!

87
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,121
What?

88
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,081
What did you just…

89
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,752
So it's "Totally smoking hot
Nam Gyu-hyun"?

90
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,045
She said what?

91
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,631
I don't suppose you mean
the Nam Gyu-hyun that we know, do you?

92
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,508
I can promise you
that if you don't send it to me

93
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,343
within the next five minutes,
you're a dead man.

94
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,845
You feel me? Thanks a lot, buddy. Bye.

95
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,227
I understand. Hmm.

96
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,981
-Your cake is ready.
-I wanna die, please.

97
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,609
Totally smoking hot Nam Gyu-hyun
will go get it.

98
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,736
Stop! Don't you dare!
I'll freaking kill you.

99
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,820
Be right back.

100
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,780
Oh, my god!
Don't use that dumb, cheesy voice!

101
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,240
You shut your mouth! Shit!

102
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,994
Someone kill me right now, please.

103
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,512
YU NA-BI

104
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,060
And you say that you really like me?

105
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,978
That's just bullshit.

106
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,067
Oh! Hey, Na-bi. Hi.

107
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,278
Oh, hi.

108
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:22,116
It almost looks like you've lost
a bit of weight. Are you doing okay?

109
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,576
I didn't get much sleep.

110
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,995
You must be overworking.

111
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,999
Come to think of it,

112
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,835
I haven't seen much of Jae-eon at all
these past few days.

113
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,837
It seemed like he was working
so hard to help you--

114
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,759
I said I'd just finish my piece on my own.

115
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,303
It's almost finished, anyway.

116
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,346
Ah, all right then.

117
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,474
Actually, I thought he was… Uh…

118
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,185
Okay, we'll be heading inside now.

119
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,394
Okay.

120
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,862
What's Na-bi gonna do now?

121
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,322
This is so terrible.

122
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,825
She won't have enough time to fix it.
The exhibition's too close.

123
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,535
This is unbelievable.

124
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,996
Why did this damn thing
have to fall right here?

125
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,040
What the…

126
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,376
How could a ceiling fan
even fall here in the first place?

127
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,341
Hey, Na-bi!

128
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,806
That's crazy!
Good thing no one was here.

129
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,072
-Why would it suddenly fall…
-Let's go. Come on. Stop staring.

130
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,117
Everyone, back to work.
Stop staring and go.

131
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,312
Na-bi…

132
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,193
What just happened here? Why is it…

133
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,035
Na-bi, be careful!

134
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,580
Are you okay?

135
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,462
Did you get that? Okay.

136
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,798
How could such a thing happen? Huh?

137
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,634
This is unacceptable.
Someone could have been seriously hurt!

138
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,303
I can't believe this happened to us.

139
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,140
We're gonna get
everything repaired properly, okay?

140
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,392
-This can't ever happen again.
-Okay.

141
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,521
How's Na-bi doing?
She must be in complete shock.

142
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,941
Yeah, she is.

143
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,611
Looks like there's not
gonna be enough time for her to fix it.

144
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,071
Also, they're in
their exam week right now.

145
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,324
I think it'd be too much
if we ask her to work on it.

146
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,492
It's not like it was her fault
in the first place.

147
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,411
That's right.

148
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,872
Don't push her to do anything right now.

149
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:15,956
Otherwise…

150
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,542
if she suddenly gives up,
we're just as responsible.

151
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,604
It feels like I'm having
these terrible, recurring nightmares.

152
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,378
So, this is the transverse arch?

153
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:45,879
Mm.

154
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,299
And this is the medial longitudinal arch.

155
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,178
-Yeah.
-Lateral longitudinal arch.

156
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,139
Mm-hm.

157
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,227
-What about this?
-Stop it. It tickles.

158
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,645
Come on.

159
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,466
Hello?

160
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,343
Oh, hey, Sol.

161
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,722
What?

162
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,590
Let's get this fixed.

163
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,242
And when we're done, I promise you,

164
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,203
I'll stay away from you.

165
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,168
I promise.

166
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,068
Oh, man! We can't even blame anyone.

167
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,696
Jin-su, give me the gloves.

168
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,788
Cleaning time.

169
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,914
Jae-eon,

170
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,042
I'll never be certain
how I should be feeling about you.

171
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,427
But somehow,
focusing on work together like this

172
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,806
feels comfortable and natural.

173
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,478
As if nothing
had ever happened between us.

174
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,363
I'm sorry I'm late. But look, ta-da!

175
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,954
Here, try this.

176
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,623
Go on, eat up.

177
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,004
-You want some?
-Mm-hm.

178
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,090
-Thank you.
-And some sausage?

179
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,759
-Yeah.
-Here.

180
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,802
Hey…

181
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,672
Jae-eon's still
so kind to me, however…

182
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,573
A lot of stuff there.

183
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,993
Yeah. I called a cab already.

184
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,287
Hmm.

185
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,331
He doesn't even offer
to take me home anymore.

186
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,759
The conflicts that we used to have
whenever we were together…

187
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,179
all gone, now.

188
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,809
So, you guys up for a few beers?

189
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,895
We have to come in early tomorrow.

190
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,146
Next time.

191
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,695
I'll get going now.

192
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,531
See you tomorrow, Na-bi.

193
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,616
Hmm.

194
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,535
Get home safe.

195
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:01,333
Jae-eon, I'll finish up some work,
then I'll go.

196
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,001
Mm-hm.

197
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,534
-I…
-Is it okay?

198
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,869
Yeah. I think it's all done.

199
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,249
I'll move it.

200
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,339
Come on, let me do it. It's heavy.

201
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,118
Jae-eon…

202
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,585
Thank you.

203
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,099
You know,

204
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,769
you look happiest
while working on your piece.

205
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,482
And the prettiest.

206
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,944
Good luck with the exhibit.

207
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,822
And also…

208
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,087
Guess I'll get going.

209
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,548
Jae-eon? What's up?

210
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,761
What's this? Where are you going?

211
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,680
Taking my tools.

212
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:47,934
Uh, I see that,
but why are you taking everything?

213
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,855
They're yours if you want.

214
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,065
But what about you?

215
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,192
Oh, you're getting new ones?

216
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,616
Hey, never mind, then.

217
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,036
Nope, I want them! Thanks, dude.

218
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,362
You know,

219
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,823
you look happiest
while working on your piece.

220
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,535
But why…

221
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,581
How come I don't feel happy, then?

222
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,307
-Uh, are you going now?
-Mm-hm.

223
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,475
Here you go.

224
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,189
What the… This is my sketchbook.
Where'd you get it?

225
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,107
From Jae-eon.
He asked me to give it to you.

226
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,779
Really? Thanks.

227
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,615
-I'll go clean up inside for a bit.
-Mm-hm.

228
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,828
I don't think
I can stay by her side.

229
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,788
Not in a vague relationship like this.

230
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,870
The semester's finally over!

231
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,832
What do you say, guys?
You all up for some celebrations?

232
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,709
Yes! For sure. Definitely.

233
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,378
You really that happy, guys?

234
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,671
-What?
-Seriously!

235
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,631
I feel even more anxious right now.

236
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,883
We need to start preparing
to get jobs now.

237
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,259
Honestly,

238
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,637
I'm so scared about my exam results.

239
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,975
Oh, that's right. Hey, this is Jae-eon's.
Is anyone keeping in touch with him?

240
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,142
-Bye!
-See ya!

241
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,185
Um…

242
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,354
Hey, Jin-su,
can't you reach him?

243
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:05,149
Mm. I guess we're not that tight yet.
I really thought we were getting closer.

244
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,611
Jae-eon even packed up
and took all his tools and stuff.

245
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,822
All his former projects, everything.

246
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:11,990
After that day,

247
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,535
Jae-eon completely disappeared
without a trace.

248
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,704
Must be the young artist's spirit
or something?

249
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,789
Maybe he sold them.

250
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,958
I think he took them apart and threw them.

251
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,711
He did seem
a little strange that day.

252
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,421
Classes weren't even over yet,

253
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,423
but he was all packed up to go somewhere.

254
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,507
Right, Na-bi?

255
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,343
Maybe he really did
go off somewhere.

256
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,387
He did talk about going to the States.

257
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,389
Good luck with the exhibit.

258
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,350
And also…

259
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,358
And what?

260
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,528
What was it that
he couldn't say to me back then?

261
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,654
…just leave like that? What the hell?

262
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,240
Well, with his personality,
it pretty much suits him, actually.

263
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:57,618
I guess, in the end, nobody still knows
that much about Jae-eon the mysterious.

264
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,914
Jae-eon doesn't talk much
about himself on purpose. Respect it.

265
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,583
But you do know something.

266
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,084
-Isn't that right, Bit-na?
-What would I know?

267
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,753
Huh? That's weird.
You really don't know?

268
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,004
-No.
-Didn't you know?

269
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,214
She's retired
from the Bit-na news network.

270
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,424
She's too busy dating!

271
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,551
Hey, Bit-na! She's got a boyfie!

272
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,636
-She's got a boyfie!
-Let's go. Let's go.

273
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,346
-Hey, Na-bi.
-Don't leave me!

274
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,891
We're gonna go for some drinks nearby.
Come on, you ought to join us.

275
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,434
-I'll call you.
-Yeah.

276
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,770
-Come!
-Mm.

277
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:47,919
SHARK

278
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,467
This one.

279
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,469
Hmm.

280
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,683
What's so funny?

281
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,188
You. You're cute.

282
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,557
Didn't you
wanna see me again after?

283
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,896
I felt so relieved…

284
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,649
I was able to see you again.

285
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,205
You dumb jerk.

286
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,722
Sorry, I don't mean to bother you.

287
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,099
But aren't you that
"Grandson of a Noodle Shop Owner"?

288
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,060
Oh, yeah.

289
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,770
Whoa! No way!

290
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,438
It's so nice to meet you.

291
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,981
I'm a huge fan of yours.

292
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,610
I've been watching your videos,
every single one since the beginning.

293
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,611
Thank you so much.

294
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,363
Just ask! Can we get an autograph?

295
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,864
It'd mean so much.

296
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,243
-An autograph?
-Yes, please. Right here.

297
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,915
Oh, I can't believe it! An autograph!

298
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,044
YANG

299
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,389
YANG DO-HYEOK

300
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,601
Thank you very much. Wow.
Can we take a photo as well?

301
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,186
Uh… A photo?

302
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,274
Go on. Do it.

303
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,276
My friend's here, sorry.

304
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,819
Sorry, I gotta go.

305
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,909
-Hey! "Grandson of a Noodle Shop Owner"?
-Shh!

306
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,453
I'm a big fan.
Can I have an autograph too?

307
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,541
Your semester's finally over.

308
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,211
Yeah. Oh, this last semester
felt like an entire year.

309
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,089
Are you planning
on staying in Seoul after all this?

310
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,968
I don't. I'm going to my mom
after the exhibit's over.

311
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,512
She's been nagging at me
to come home for a while.

312
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,640
Um, what about your aunt, then?
You're gonna visit her?

313
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,561
And Do-yeon, too. I noticed that
she seems to miss you a lot.

314
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,110
Too obvious?

315
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,529
That was bad acting.

316
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,364
Yeah, a little too obvious.

317
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,658
But I did tell my aunt
that I'd visit her soon.

318
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,579
Either way, I don't think I can stay
with my mom during my entire vacation.

319
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,583
Um, the exhibit runs until seven, right?

320
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,960
Yeah. But are you even
gonna be able to come?

321
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,296
Didn't you say you were filming something?
Like an interview?

322
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,382
I guess it might be
a little too tight, however…

323
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,135
Then it's fine. Don't strain yourself.
Focus on your work.

324
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,055
No, I don't think so. I have to make it.

325
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,723
It is your exhibit.

326
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,726
I'm excited.

327
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,105
I thought it was amazing
how you found a way to fix it.

328
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,317
Oh, that was crazy.
I wouldn't be able to do it.

329
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,614
My assistants helped me out a lot with it.

330
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,457
Anyway, it was pretty tough

331
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,167
to get it done in such a short time.

332
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,502
Although…

333
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,462
I did gain a few things.

334
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,255
Like what?

335
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,257
Hmm…

336
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,220
I actually like working now.

337
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,056
To be honest,
I wasn't enjoying it for a while,

338
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,766
even when things were going well.

339
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,521
However, someone told me that I looked
happiest when I was working on something.

340
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,817
Hearing that…

341
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,029
made me happy.

342
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,494
It sounds like you really did
enjoy it the whole time.

343
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,663
You just realized it when…

344
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,374
someone finally told you.

345
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,337
I guess.

346
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,012
You must be really grateful.

347
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,433
I guess.

348
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,279
We really should eat now.

349
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,322
Try this, it's really tasty.

350
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,742
Hmm.

351
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,378
Tomorrow it's all over.

352
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,213
Finally.

353
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,841
I thought I'd be
much happier to see it end.

354
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,346
I guess I was wrong.

355
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,060
Jae-eon coming tomorrow?

356
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,021
I don't know.

357
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,806
I'm struggling on how
to define the past few days and…

358
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,600
the feelings that I have left for him.

359
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,522
Lingering…

360
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,066
Care?

361
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,527
Regret?

362
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,947
Hate, or maybe…

363
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,613
I just don't know
if I'll come back, though.

364
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,739
Why?

365
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,158
It's not 'cause I didn't enjoy it.

366
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,579
This place brings back bad memories.

367
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,706
Really?

368
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,419
I remember seeing someone
so beautiful here,

369
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,088
and it was love at first sight.

370
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,008
Sure, I bet it was.

371
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,802
I remember it was snowing.

372
00:43:58,886 --> 00:43:59,970
Spare me the details.

373
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,056
It was an exhibit for a new artist.

374
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,807
What was that artist's name?

375
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,684
It looks pretty erotic, huh?

376
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,102
I know, right?

377
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,856
I got so bored
I was about to leave.

378
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,359
But I saw this girl…

379
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,779
Standing in front of
this piece for so long.

380
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,947
Like you were just now.

381
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,754
Na-bi.

382
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,359
And then one day,
I ran into that girl again.

383
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,568
I was startled.

384
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,029
If I believed fate were real,

385
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,615
I actually would have thought that was it.

386
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,554
PARK JAE-EON

387
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,964
Son of a…

388
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,924
"How are you doing?
It's nice to meet you."

389
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,259
"It's very nice to meet you."

390
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,058
-Jo Min-yeong!
-What?

391
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,101
Your phone!

392
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,978
-You forgot!
-Oh, gosh!

393
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,647
-I would have gotten into huge trouble.
-Just…

394
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,567
stay calm in the interview.
Also, take this.

395
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,860
What?

396
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,988
Sugar. You can get low on sugar
when you're anxious.

397
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,035
YOU CAN DO IT, MIN-YEONG!

398
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,371
Sorry I can't help with the exhibition.

399
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,957
It'll go fine without you, don't worry.
You have an interview.

400
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,834
Make sure you focus on that, huh.

401
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:36,960
Come on, just get going.

402
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,129
Oh, oh, oh! I'll see you later!

403
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,259
Fighting!

404
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,553
Fighting! Fighting!

405
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,745
-Hey, Bit-na!
-Yeah, right.

406
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,038
-Hey!
-Hey, guys!

407
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,706
-Hi!
-Oh, no. I didn't any buy flowers.

408
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:38,707
-I forgot.
-It's fine.

409
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,126
-She got one for me.
-That's right, I sure did.

410
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,920
Hey, guys, are you excited?

411
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,797
Oh, yeah. Yun Sol's piece
is so freaking great!

412
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,508
Hey! We haven't even
entered the gallery yet.

413
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,385
-I just can't believe you two.
-I'm so sure of it.

414
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,553
-You're so lucky.
-Whatever.

415
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,889
She's gonna praise you all day long.

416
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,308
Here, you each
get ten of these.

417
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,935
Make sure to hand them out, okay?

418
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,353
All right. Let's go.

419
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,855
Hey, take a few.
I want you to hand them out.

420
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,649
Mr. An,
can you take a photo of us?

421
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,567
-Come on, hurry. It'll only take a minute.
-Wait a second. Just a minute.

422
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,277
-Hold these.
-Come on. Quick, quick.

423
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,113
-Try to make me look tall.
-All right. Cool.

424
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,116
You got it? One, two, three.

425
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,868
-Mr. An!
-Just one more!

426
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,704
-Oops! That's enough for you guys.
-Look at you!

427
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,748
-Thank you!
-You look good, don't worry.

428
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,833
Can you take one for us too, please?

429
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,211
You know, you look like
a completely different person today.

430
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,004
You look really nice today.

431
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,383
One, two, three.

432
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,343
And one more.

433
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,303
-Okay. Close-up shot.
-Focus on Sol in the center.

434
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,639
All right. One, two, three.

435
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:36,807
YU NA-BI, YUN SOL…

436
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,476
-Hey, you guys!
-Hey!

437
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,728
How come none of you
bothered to bring some flowers?

438
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,271
Hey, you look so pretty!

439
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,565
-Where were you guys?
-Why would we need to bring flowers?

440
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,150
-I'm a flower.
-I'm a flower, too.

441
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,860
-Okay, okay.
-Look at this face.

442
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,822
-Isn't this your debut exhibit?
-You guys are so late. Keep it down!

443
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,032
Hey, guys…

444
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,244
-Whoa, Mr. An!
-Gosh, you're handsome.

445
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,371
Be quiet, guys. Get in. Get in. Get in.

446
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,581
Come on. Everyone get inside.

447
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,211
-Wow.
-There's so much art. It's so cool.

448
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,170
Look who it is.

449
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,296
-Congratulations.
-Hi!

450
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,136
-Hello.
-Hey!

451
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,722
Congratulations, guys.

452
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,099
Congratulations.

453
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,809
-Hey, this is my friend.
-Congratulations.

454
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,019
You did a good job.

455
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,270
Oh, you come with us.

456
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,231
Oh, look!
That's the one Sol made!

457
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,858
It feels different
when you're looking at them

458
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,735
being exhibited like this. It's cool.

459
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,029
-You're right, it does.
-Sol's really talented. Nice one!

460
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,072
-Thank you.
-Hey, Sol, what's this one? Got a name?

461
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,198
-Cool.
-"Union," huh?

462
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,908
-Yup.
-"Onion"?

463
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,452
-"Union."
-Stop making jokes about it.

464
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,371
-I love it, Sol. You really are the best.
-It's so cool.

465
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,749
Sol, I always said you were awesome.

466
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,710
Amazing.

467
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,754
I actually had a hard time
assembling it here.

468
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,839
-I thought I wouldn't get it done on time.
-Se-yeong.

469
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,511
It's a good thing she managed
to finish that in a short time.

470
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,013
-Whoa.
-Hey, look at this.

471
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,681
Na-bi's piece is something else.

472
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,476
-It looks amazing.
-Exactly.

473
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,228
Maybe the accident
actually helped her make it better. Ugh!

474
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,064
No, I'm an idiot for saying that.

475
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:08,857
You know…

476
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,777
Na-bi could really go to Paris
at this rate.

477
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,944
No way.

478
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,654
-I don't think so.
-This is incredible.

479
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,615
Where's Na-bi?

480
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,658
Right. Where is she?

481
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,577
There she is. Hang on.

482
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,801
What are you doing?

483
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,553
I was just…

484
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,764
I was tired. Just trying to rest.

485
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,433
Na-bi.
The professor is calling you.

486
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,601
Oh, okay.

487
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,273
Poor girl.

488
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,610
Professor.

489
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,575
It must've been tough
getting it fixed just in time.

490
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,828
But it was worth it, wasn't it?

491
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,956
Yeah. I enjoyed it.

492
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,585
I know you did.

493
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,838
I could feel that emotion
looking at your piece.

494
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:13,880
Good work, Na-bi.

495
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,926
Thank you so much.

496
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,636
Listen.

497
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,346
You should go to Paris.

498
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:23,890
Yes.

499
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:25,934
I'd love to.

500
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,479
That's it. That's the spirit.

501
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,023
Seems like you've finally
spread your wings.

502
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,568
There's no need to overthink right now.

503
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,237
You should eat whatever you want,
and do whatever you wanna do.

504
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,572
Like whoever you wanna like.

505
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,949
That's it. That's all that's left.

506
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,161
All right.

507
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,997
YU NA-BI, YUN SOL,
KIM NA-YEON, YUN GEON-UNG

508
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,584
You're taking
everything down today?

509
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,918
No, tomorrow.

510
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,379
That's too bad.

511
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,924
Na-bi, how come you've been
looking so down today.

512
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,384
Everyone's been praising your work.

513
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,720
I'm fine.

514
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,097
It's all right.

515
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,850
Come to think of it,
have you seen Jae-eon anywhere today?

516
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,646
Hello. Excuse me.

517
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,149
-Oh, hey, Do-hyeok.
-Hey there, guys.

518
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,693
Sorry, I'm late.
It took a lot longer than I thought.

519
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:19,112
It's fine. You're not really late.
Thanks for coming.

520
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,697
Thanks for inviting me.

521
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,332
I'll show you my piece.

522
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,374
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

523
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,792
It was nice seeing you.

524
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,045
They're all so talented, huh.

525
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,724
How is it?

526
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,644
Wow. As expected,

527
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,021
it's breathtaking. Great work.

528
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,649
I'm really glad to hear you say that.

529
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,192
You're so talented and pretty.

530
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,152
Okay, stop it.

531
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,363
Hey, Na-bi. Come on, let's eat.

532
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,615
Oh, hey. It's been a long time!

533
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,284
-This is awesome.
-You know you're famous now, right?

534
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,702
Yeah, you're a superstar now.

535
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,828
Hey, how much do you earn?

536
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,747
I mean each month
just from your channel alone?

537
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,915
What? I'm just curious. Relax.

538
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,166
Maybe I can be
in one of your videos?

539
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,167
-Me too.
-Why?

540
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,711
How would that even help him? Ridiculous.

541
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,380
Have you seen that piece yet?

542
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,467
-Excuse me.
-What?

543
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,511
Come on.
Just let me join your video.

544
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,962
You like Jae-eon.

545
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,215
You always did.

546
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:05,927
I think so.

547
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,018
You were right about one thing.

548
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,772
Deep down I know that he's not someone
who's gonna make me happy.

549
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,283
This is gonna sound ridiculous
after everything that's happened,

550
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,201
but I was really happy

551
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,996
during all the times
that we've spent together, Do-hyeok.

552
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,582
Thank you.

553
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,625
Mm.

554
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,544
And I'm sorry.

555
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:41,921
Na-bi.

556
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,887
When it comes down to it,

557
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,931
I'm glad I was able to feel
this way about you.

558
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,101
I'm grateful,
so you don't need to feel sorry.

559
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,366
It'd mean a lot, if you accept this.

560
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:21,878
I'll get going.

561
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:38,186
Min-yeong! Sorry I'm late.

562
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,608
Your feet are all swollen, huh.

563
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,360
Here. Put them on.

564
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,698
What?

565
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,451
Uh, nothing.

566
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,037
I got it.

567
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,291
What? What is it? What happened?

568
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,376
Huh?

569
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,004
Interview go badly?

570
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,173
I'm just…

571
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,636
really glad how lucky I am
to have someone like you.

572
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:26,151
And, also, can I keep staying
at your place?

573
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,238
Sure.

574
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,247
Oh, god! I feel much better.

575
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,708
My feet were killing me. It was agony.

576
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,835
Yeah, I bet they were.

577
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,671
I'm starving.
Wanna go for tteokbokki, huh?

578
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,632
Sure. Maybe a bit of beer?

579
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,800
Why not?

580
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,887
How'd the interview go?

581
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,264
No idea…

582
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,600
I was so nervous,
I just started blabbering.

583
00:57:58,683 --> 00:57:59,851
I don't even remember.

584
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:02,562
That's how people always feel
right after any interview.

585
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,148
Try to get used to it. Forget about it.

586
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:06,649
Hey.

587
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:10,111
So which one of you
liked the other one first? Huh?

588
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,155
Gyu-hyun! Was it you?

589
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:15,200
Hey. Doesn't matter
whoever had feelings first

590
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,119
or whoever confessed first,
it won't matter in the long run.

591
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,163
If they like each other
and they start dating,

592
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,080
then who cares. All good.

593
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,665
-True.
-Listen,

594
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,126
especially at the beginning,
those things matter.

595
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,086
It's about who likes the other one more.

596
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:30,048
Se-hun, this is exactly why
up till now you're not dating anyone.

597
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,925
-It's not!
-Se-hun! You're wrong.

598
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,302
What? You think
it's some kind of sincerity race?

599
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,846
They'll end up trying to outdo
each other, it's not gonna be fair.

600
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,264
So what?

601
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,184
Shouldn't you always
like the other person more?

602
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,561
It's a waste of time
being with someone you're not certain.

603
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,648
That's how you know for sure.

604
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,110
Oh, Sol…

605
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,238
What about you?

606
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:56,824
I don't want any philosophical shit.
Which one of you liked the other first?

607
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,119
To tell you the truth…

608
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,288
I was the one who said it first.

609
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,707
What?

610
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,752
Are you serious?
I thought it would be Bit-na for sure.

611
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:08,670
Excuse me?

612
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,672
When did you start liking her?

613
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,425
Uh… Since our workshop in first year.

614
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,554
There is no way.

615
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:18,680
Bullshit, man! Don't lie to us.

616
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,974
Hang on, it's been years since then.
That means…

617
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,267
You're kidding me.

618
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,228
So you've been hiding these feelings
while fooling us for years?

619
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,313
Like everyone said,
maybe you were just clueless.

620
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,983
-Exactly, he's almost adorably clueless.
-Poor guy.

621
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,319
Well, so if you started liking me
back then,

622
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,154
then it turns out
that I actually beat you to it.

623
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:39,450
A long time ago,
I was attending my freshman orientation,

624
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,828
when suddenly, this smoking hot guy
appears from far away.

625
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,871
And as soon as I saw him,
my whole body came alive.

626
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,124
And I knew then and there
I had to make him my boyfriend.

627
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,417
Bit-na.

628
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,626
Come on, just stop lying.

629
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,295
-Too obvious?
-Too obvious.

630
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,547
Okay, I was just kidding! Sorry.

631
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,882
Hey, Gyu-hyun.
Sorry, but can I have some of that?

632
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,050
Only a little bit, I promise.

633
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,885
-I love you.
-I know, and I love you too.

634
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,764
I'd give you
the moon if you asked me.

635
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,601
Aw. Come on,
honeymuffin. Eat up.

636
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,209
I miss him.

637
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,098
I said I stopped believing…

638
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,268
in tired old tropes like fate and love,

639
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:32,855
but this is just…

640
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,443
way too unrealistic.

641
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,926
What are you doing here?

642
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,347
Sorry.

643
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,515
"Sorry"?

644
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,937
-You really are the worst. You know that?
-Na-bi.

645
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,773
From the beginning,
when you decided to be a jerk,

646
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,900
why couldn't you
have just stayed that way?

647
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,485
What do you even want from me now?

648
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,838
Can I have another chance…

649
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,217
with you?

650
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,261
I thought we were
gonna completely cut ties.

651
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,223
I couldn't bear the fact that you…

652
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,225
hated me so much.

653
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,644
That's right. I hate you.

654
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,649
I really do hate you.

655
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:42,026
And I know that you're an unfeeling jerk
who loves toying around

656
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,653
with other people's feelings.

657
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,663
But I feel so much better seeing you here.

658
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,721
So don't go anywhere
and just stay by my side.

659
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,314
Why are you smiling?

660
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:22,900
Just thinking…

661
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,695
about what to say to you makes me smile.

662
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:27,697
So damn much.

663
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,699
You really like me that much?

664
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,576
Mm-hm.

665
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:33,619
More than you know.

666
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:37,999
Jae-eon.

667
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:39,959
You wanna go out?

668
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,005
Sure you won't regret it?

669
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:45,590
Of course I'll regret it.

670
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,425
It's pretty obvious I will.

671
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:52,430
I'll still do it anyway.

672
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,286
Love.

673
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,999
You're burning up crazy hot.
What's wrong? Are you sick?

674
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,500
I'm fine.

675
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:25,171
I don't feel sick at all
now that you're with me.

676
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:28,174
Deep down, I know that it's
gonna cause me pain once again.

677
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,468
I know. But nevertheless…

678
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:02,291
EPISODE 10: NEVERTHELESS, I STILL…

679
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:07,713
You don't already have
a girlfriend, do you?

680
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,715
-Can I have your number?
-Me too!

681
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:10,841
Want my number?

682
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:16,847
Sorry, but I have plans.

683
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,981
-Did you get it?
-Mm-hm.

684
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,528
Wanna go eat something nice?

685
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:31,487
Okay.

686
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,114
Like what?

687
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,742
Hmm. What should we have?

688
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,661
Not sure…

689
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:50,256
-What is it?
-Hmm?

690
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,260
Nothing. Let's go.

691
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,022
How about…

692
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,774
remember that pasta place
that you mentioned?

693
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:10,317
Okay.

694
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,987
Bit-na said it was pretty good.

695
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,072
All right.

696
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,407
See that cat?

697
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:19,618
Cute cat.

698
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:23,289
We should get a cat. I want one.

699
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,750
No deal.
That's enough pets for you.

700
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,835
Even butterflies?

701
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,003
No.
