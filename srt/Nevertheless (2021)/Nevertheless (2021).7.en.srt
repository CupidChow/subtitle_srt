1
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,221
This silent treatment of yours
ending any time this year?

2
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,311
Forget it.

3
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,270
Just carry on, then.

4
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,938
So what? Are we through, then?

5
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,317
Huh? No! What?

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,943
You actually wanna break up?

7
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,570
You haven't called me
or anything since then.

8
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,697
-You haven't said boo to me, either.
-I did. I tried.

9
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,865
What are you going on about?

10
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,117
You didn't try.
You never talked to me sincerely.

11
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,245
Hey, we're here now, guys.

12
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,916
-Oh. Urgh. My shoulders.
-Fine.

13
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,753
Wait, why were you two together?

14
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,339
Oh, we ran into each other.

15
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,341
That means, only Ji-wan's left, then.

16
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,885
She's so damn late all the time. Always.

17
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,763
Uh, she'll get here soon. I'm sorry.

18
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,350
-Why is she apologizing?
-Yun Sol!

19
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,187
Uh, what…

20
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,817
I guess the rest of us are ghosts.
Apparently, she can only see Yun Sol.

21
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,819
Hey, can you still see any of us?

22
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,862
I'm so sorry, guys.
I didn't come late on purpose.

23
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,698
It wasn't my fault, I even woke up early.
But somehow, I missed the bus.

24
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,284
Same excuse as always, different season.

25
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,454
So who's missing? Where's Jae-eon?

26
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,666
-He's not coming.
-What? Why? Oh, no, that's not good…

27
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,960
Why is that a problem?
Do you have a crush on him too?

28
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,545
Oh, it's not like that…

29
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,880
Hey! I don't have a crush on Jae-eon!

30
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,091
All right, then.
Since you sounded so convincing just now.

31
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,885
Just forget about it. Let's go already.
Everyone's already left.

32
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,180
-Let's go.
-Oh, Na-bi's coming along with us, though.

33
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,397
Who's driving?

34
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,524
I'll do it.

35
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,734
Move your butt, then!

36
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,571
They left.

37
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,657
Why do I feel lonely?

38
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,160
Hey, wait up, guys!

39
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,824
They look really good.

40
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,161
I got hungry just looking.
Can we have two of those to go, please?

41
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,412
-You want two?
-Yeah.

42
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,623
What about these? You want some as well?

43
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,708
-We can try them later.
-Okay.

44
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,418
Thank you so much.

45
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,129
Here you go. Thanks. Thank you very much.

46
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,797
-You two enjoy that.
-Yup.

47
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,802
-Thank you again!
-Have a good day.

48
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,976
Isn't that a little heavy?

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,478
-It's fine.
-Just let me carry the other ones.

50
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,480
-So it's one each.
-It's fine. I'm good.

51
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,320
You still good to go?

52
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,949
Mm-hm. I'm not tired at all.

53
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,579
Let's go.

54
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,123
Right…

55
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:16,756
EPISODE 7: I KNOW THERE'S NO
TURNING BACK. NEVERTHELESS,

56
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,855
Excuse me. Do you know
where's the Mansari Temple is?

57
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,565
-The temple?
-Yeah.

58
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,360
-You need to go all the way over there.
-You have to keep going that way.

59
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,278
Oh.

60
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,095
So, are you going to sleepover
with your friends?

61
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,806
No, I'm staying at my aunt's.
Maybe drop by, or whatever.

62
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,810
Okay, I'll just take you home, then.
I have something to tell you.

63
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,187
What is it?

64
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,563
Relax, I'll tell you later.

65
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,622
Hey, where do you want me
to put all these?

66
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,333
Over there. You know what?
I'll take care of those.

67
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,956
Hey, how are you? My name's Park Jae-eon.

68
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,043
I'm good, how are you? I'm Yang Do-hyeok.

69
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,468
The weather is so nice today!

70
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,388
What the… I thought you said
you weren't coming here.

71
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,931
-Hey, Na-bi!
-Oh, Na-bi's here.

72
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:15,184
Hi, nice to meet you. I didn't know
Na-bi was gonna be here with a friend.

73
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,812
-I'm Bit-na.
-Oh, it's nice to meet you too.

74
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,441
Also, I'm enjoying those videos
you've been making recently.

75
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,234
-I'm glad. Thanks.
-Really cool.

76
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,695
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

77
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,655
-Oh, it's nice to meet you all.
-Hello there. My name's Se-yeong.

78
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,116
That's weird,
I thought you said you two weren't close.

79
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,200
When did you even get here?

80
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,995
It's not what you're thinking.
My aunt lives nearby, that's all it is.

81
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,914
Now I know why this girl
has been so out of touch lately.

82
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,542
-I said, it's nothing like that.
-Come on, just play along.

83
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,586
Nice place.

84
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,006
-Oh, where do we sleep?
-Where do we put our stuff down?

85
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,215
Interesting.

86
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,302
She's going around so casually
almost as if she felt right at home.

87
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,428
Let's go in there.

88
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:52,972
Wow!

89
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,141
-I'm taking the big room!
-It's mine!

90
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,684
It takes forever
to take off these shoes.

91
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,186
Let's sit here for a bit.

92
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,439
Out of the way.

93
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,774
I thought you had them?

94
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,568
Oh, shit.

95
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,822
Are you okay?

96
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,534
-What do you mean?
-I'm sorry I lied to you.

97
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,497
I thought you'd say that you wouldn't come
if I told you that he was coming.

98
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,041
It's fine, no worries.

99
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:25,963
But, yeah…

100
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,760
What's really going on?
I mean, between you and Jae-eon?

101
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,054
You two seemed
to be getting along so well.

102
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,433
-Well…
-I bet he did something wrong again.

103
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,143
Like the last time at the station, right?

104
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,562
I can totally imagine it.

105
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,897
He didn't.

106
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,402
Actually, I'm the one who messed up.

107
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,282
He's probably pretty upset.

108
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:54,992
Oh.

109
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,913
Uh, here, let me help you with those.

110
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,672
I got two rooms prepared
for your entire group.

111
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,507
Here, have a look at the first one.

112
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,095
And now, over this way.

113
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,680
-It's so nice.
-Would you look at that.

114
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,015
-Girls' room it is.
-Give me my bag.

115
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,851
-What about the guys' room?
-Let's see the other one.

116
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,814
Wow, this place is pretty, isn't it?

117
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,066
-Hey, let's sleep here!
-Is this the room for the guys?

118
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,820
Now, if you'll follow me this way, please.

119
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,114
Right this way.

120
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,159
-Ji-wan.
-Yeah?

121
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,454
All right, let's go in.

122
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,625
So if you're hungry, tell me around
an hour before you want the barbecue,

123
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,586
-and I'll get everything prepared.
-Okay.

124
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,588
-Oh, what are you doing later on?
-What?

125
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,798
I thought,
since we're all Na-bi's friends here,

126
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,300
-you should hang out with us later.
-That's right!

127
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,801
We're going to the amusement park.

128
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,344
I can't, I have to prepare the food.

129
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,389
Come on. We can all just prepare it
together when we come back.

130
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,600
You can help us take some photos
and hang out with us.

131
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,685
Oh, right.
You have a YouTube channel.

132
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,312
You'll be a natural photographer.

133
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,942
-Please hang on for a second.
-Sure.

134
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,278
-Is he gonna talk to Na-bi?
-Think so.

135
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,657
What are you doing here?
I can take care of all this.

136
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,243
I've got nothing to do, anyway.
Did you talk to everyone?

137
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,703
Mm-hm.

138
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,372
They're going out to the amusement park,
and they want me to go.

139
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,126
You don't have to go.
I can tell them if you don't want to.

140
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,754
No, don't.
Gives me a chance to hang out with you.

141
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,881
All right, I guess we're going.

142
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,305
Don't you think that was a little rude
to ask him? You put him in a tight spot.

143
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,515
I was only asking him to hang out with us.

144
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,185
Why don't we go all out
and ask him to eat barbecue with us too!

145
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,190
I'm exhausted.

146
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,776
What are you on about?
We literally haven't started.

147
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,235
You can't get exhausted!

148
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,114
-What's up with Na-bi, isn't she coming?
-I know, right?

149
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,450
Let's go on ahead.
We can't all fit anyway.

150
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,327
All right, bye.

151
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,328
Yo, Se-hun!

152
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,705
-Let's go?
-Come on, come on, let's go, now.

153
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,542
Jae-eon, we're going.
Wait for Na-bi and bring her with you.

154
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,757
-You be careful, hm?
-You go on ahead.

155
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,092
Se-hun, hurry up, man.

156
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,718
Get out of my way!

157
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,595
I call shotgun.

158
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,320
Get in. They all went ahead already.

159
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,259
Guess I'm a taxi driver.

160
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,723
Hang on, I'm not the only one.
Do-hyeok can sit at the front.

161
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,010
Gosh.

162
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,474
THE ALARM WILL RING IN 5 MINUTES

163
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,185
How many alarms do you need, dude?

164
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,566
Gyeong-jun. Come on! Get up.
Your alarms are going off.

165
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,319
Why do you even have alarms set
during the weekend?

166
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,409
That's so weird.

167
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,455
Without glasses, he actually looks really…

168
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,551
Good morning.

169
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,014
Why…

170
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,727
Why do you have multiple alarms set up?
I barely get sleep as it is.

171
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,898
I'm worried about snoozing
through them all. I need a lot.

172
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,443
Don't worry, I'll just wake you up, then.
Just set two of them, okay?

173
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,695
Really? Okay.

174
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,118
Yes? Good morning.

175
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,162
You're still looking
for a place, is that right?

176
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,081
I found one for you, you can check it out.

177
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,624
Oh…

178
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,086
May I have the address to it?
I can head right over there.

179
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,007
Over where? What address?
You going somewhere?

180
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,134
Uh, the real estate agent called.

181
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,428
Said she found a decent place
for me to move to.

182
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,936
Good thing. I was only planning
to stay here until I found a place anyway.

183
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,690
-You want me to come with you?
-Aren't you busy?

184
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,026
I'd actually appreciate it,
but it's the weekend, so I'll be fine.

185
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,988
No, I'll go.
I like looking around for a house.

186
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,324
All right, dinner's on me tonight, then.
What will it be?

187
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,534
Hmm.

188
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,452
Tteokbokki?

189
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,912
Again?

190
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,457
Why not? I thought you liked tteokbokki.

191
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,128
Huh?

192
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,256
Why aren't you wearing these?

193
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,259
Because I have to wash my face.

194
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,951
I heard you met Seol-a
at school the other day.

195
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,954
Yeah.

196
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,998
She said that you were very attractive.

197
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,834
And she wanted to talk to you more,
but you suddenly left.

198
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,923
She's really pretty too.
I wish I could've stayed longer to talk.

199
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,615
Was that door locked? It's way too old.

200
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,285
And did you see the mold? It was terrible.

201
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,913
Can you stop that already?
I thought the house was pretty decent.

202
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,498
What do you mean, "decent"?

203
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,042
If you saw something you didn't like,
why not go ahead and say it?

204
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,794
-Enough already.
-I thought you said

205
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,755
it was really urgent? I worked so hard
to find this place on short notice.

206
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,341
Tell your husband
to stop complaining so much.

207
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:08,926
My husband?

208
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,137
-He's not my husband.
-Oh, he's not?

209
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,264
I thought you were a couple,
seeing how picky he was.

210
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,350
So, what are you gonna do?

211
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,477
I'm sure you already know,
but this is a rare chance.

212
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,731
Take your time.
You gotta think about it carefully.

213
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,650
I thought it was fine.

214
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,111
You don't like it either, don't you?

215
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,278
What?

216
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,406
I'm so sorry,
but we need time to think about it.

217
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,616
My goodness. All right, do what you want.

218
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,451
Just keep in mind,
you might lose your chance.

219
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,536
Sheesh.

220
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,749
What the heck, dude! It was totally fine.

221
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,085
You saw the mold in there.
There was way too much of it.

222
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,169
All right, let's go now.

223
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,879
Come on.

224
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,760
-I want that doll!
-That one?

225
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,346
Yeah, that huge one.
Try to get it, I really want it.

226
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,141
SHOOTING RANGE
BASEBALL THROW BALLOON DARTS

227
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,893
See you later.

228
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,895
-I got this.
-Hey, you guys are trying it too!

229
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,772
-Yeah, you gonna watch?
-Just watch and learn.

230
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,482
-Let's make a bet, then. Okay.
-Okay, fine.

231
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,817
Hey, what are you doing here?

232
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,110
I know, right?

233
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,237
Oh my God. This is so fun!

234
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,240
Na-bi, why don't you try it.
I'll take a photo of you.

235
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,201
I'm not… I don't think I can do it right.

236
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,620
Watch this one.
I'm gonna show you something cool.

237
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,539
-Pay attention.
-Really? You sure you can do it?

238
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,670
Hang on.

239
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,257
Lucky strike!

240
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,767
Isn't this fun?

241
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,643
Did you win that, yeah?

242
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,270
Ha!

243
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,275
Are you good? You winning?

244
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,331
-How did you do that?
-I got it.

245
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,833
You actually got it!
Hey, did you guys see that?

246
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,585
I want one!

247
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,005
-Oh, that's so cute. Thank you.
-Thank you.

248
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,175
I want one.

249
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,261
That's my favorite character,
I can't believe you picked that.

250
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,555
I've always loved that character…

251
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,850
All right, why not.

252
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,146
Thank you so much! Oh, my gosh! Sol, look!

253
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,526
Look over here! Take a picture!

254
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,046
Hey, stop! I got you!

255
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,506
Ha!

256
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,925
-We made it! Hi!
-Hey!

257
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,054
Why did you even come with me?

258
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,392
Security is the most important part,
and that place didn't have it.

259
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,352
And the neighborhood, awful.

260
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,854
It seemed pretty dangerous.

261
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,273
Those are things that'll cost you extra.

262
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,151
What if someone suddenly takes that house?

263
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,570
Maybe I should call her
and tell her I'm taking it.

264
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,322
I'm just going to take it.

265
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,867
Hey.

266
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,827
Be honest, you didn't like it, either.

267
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,620
Yeah, compared to your place,
it's not as nice.

268
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,623
Then just keep staying with me
until you find something nicer.

269
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,713
Here you go, enjoy.

270
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,132
Oh. Thank you very much.

271
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,179
Hey, my phone.

272
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,016
Wow! To tell you the truth,
it's actually my first time riding this.

273
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,684
-Wow!
-Me too.

274
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,478
It's gonna be so nice
with the sun's setting down.

275
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,648
Na-bi. Good photo?

276
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,485
Mm-hm. That's a great shot.

277
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,697
I'll bring this photo along
with the other ones from the beach.

278
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,162
Don't worry, it's all right.

279
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,664
We can take a nice selfie
once we're at the top.

280
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,500
-Sound good?
-It's going to be so pretty.

281
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,919
Look behind you.

282
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,051
It takes four people. Hey, why don't you
come with us, you'll be the fourth one.

283
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,762
That's right, that means
you can also take photos for us.

284
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,305
-Come on, let's go. Just do it.
-Just do it.

285
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,015
It's going to be so fun.

286
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,531
Next four, please, get ready.

287
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,825
We'll take the next one with our friends,
if that's okay.

288
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,494
Then you two, come up.

289
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,685
Oh, I'm gonna skip this one out.

290
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,520
-What?
-I'll wait here till you're done.

291
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,688
Why?

292
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,482
See how high that is? You didn't
know this, but I'm afraid of heights.

293
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,859
Oh, really?

294
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,155
Then why not wait together.
I'm afraid of heights just like you.

295
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,450
-All right.
-Oh! What a bunch of scaredy-cats.

296
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,994
Hey, you sure about this?

297
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,787
'Cause I'm pretty certain
you're afraid of heights.

298
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,498
Mm. We came all the way out here,
I should at least try.

299
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,001
Plus, it's not exactly
a scary looking ride, is it?

300
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,128
With them? Sure! Uh-huh.

301
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,046
Makes sense. Okay, I'll ride with you.

302
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,133
Oh, nice. Let's do this together.

303
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,302
Oh, look, there's Jin-su.

304
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,511
Hey, you guys!

305
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,896
We can see
the ocean from here! Whoa!

306
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,859
-Oh! Can you take a photo now?
-Me too!

307
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,570
-Tell us when. On three.
-One, two, three.

308
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,031
One, two, three.

309
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,949
Don't lean back, you cheater.

310
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,036
-I want a solo shot!
-Stop blocking me!

311
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,454
One, two, three.

312
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,122
Move your ugly ass out of the way.

313
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,999
Now I want one of just myself.

314
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,918
One, two, three.

315
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,131
-Hey, let's take one of us together.
-Stop moving around so much.

316
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,049
It's dangerous.

317
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,928
No need to snap at me, Mr. Sunshine.

318
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,923
It's so pretty.

319
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,393
More than you know.

320
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,497
You should see the view out there.

321
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,209
Right. I know. I can see it.

322
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,963
Are you scared?

323
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,343
It's moving a lot slower than
I thought it'd go. It's kind of scary.

324
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,386
Jeez.

325
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,306
Woah! Oh, my God!

326
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,559
Look at that!
Awesome, that view's amazing.

327
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,060
I bet we can see
the guesthouse all the way from here.

328
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,520
Are you serious? I wanna see.

329
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,482
Over there. Looks incredible
from up here, right?

330
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,486
Hey, sit down, guys.

331
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,072
You're right,
we shouldn't move around. I'm sorry.

332
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,077
But if you think about it,
when it comes to Ferris wheels,

333
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,621
the thrill only comes
from when the cabin's shaking around.

334
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,540
Okay, I'm sorry.

335
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,795
But admit it. You're jealous of us.

336
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,131
-Just stop talking.
-Sorry, that's the last one.

337
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,808
We should be getting off soon,
so just hang in there.

338
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,059
Huh?

339
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,479
Right. Don't worry, I'm okay now.

340
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:42,856
Sure you're fine?

341
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,525
Mm-hm. Everything is fine.

342
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:17,265
I thought Ferris wheels were supposed
to have music. Would've been much better.

343
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,976
I guess this one's different.

344
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,025
What are you staring at?

345
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,445
-Look out the window.
-How have you been?

346
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,155
Mm.

347
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,616
So-so.

348
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,326
I haven't been doing so well.

349
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,377
-I'm sorry, I didn't--
-How come you never called?

350
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,753
What?

351
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,550
-Because…
-It was my birthday.

352
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,137
Well, I'm sure a lot of people
greeted you that day.

353
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,227
I'm not gonna falter again.

354
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,396
Anyway, what I wanted to say was…

355
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,483
I'm sorry for being harsh to Seol-a,
I was in a bad mood.

356
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,172
I just…

357
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,342
really wanted to hear you greet me.

358
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,573
That familiar, intoxicating scent

359
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,826
has come to haunt me once more.

360
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,261
You could have just told me instead.

361
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,808
You're making me feel upset.

362
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,687
You really hate me that much?

363
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,296
He should've been back by now.

364
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,590
How long does it
have to take to get some beer?

365
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,800
Oh!

366
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,677
What in the world took you so long?

367
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,054
It's been ages! Did you go
all the way to the brewery or…

368
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,933
-Who are you?
-Likewise, who are you?

369
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,061
Well, I'm…

370
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,523
Mom.

371
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,608
Mom?

372
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,405
Hey.

373
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,032
Do-yeon. What are you doing here?

374
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,076
Starting the fire.

375
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,121
Good job. But is that all you're here for?

376
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,831
Nope. I was feeling a little bored.

377
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,332
So, I thought I'd come and join you.

378
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,585
All right, Do-yeon.
Just try not to bother the guests.

379
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,672
Why are you such a meany?
Were you able to fix the bike?

380
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,798
-What?
-Is there any meat?

381
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,716
-The Ferris wheel…
-Of course, there's meat,

382
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,175
but I have no idea how to grill it.
Don't you need to

383
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,094
-marinate it first?
-Who's the prettiest in the world?

384
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,304
Na-bi, who's that guy over there?

385
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,682
For real, do I look like someone
who grew up cooking every day to you?

386
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,600
-Sol's good at it.
-Yeah, I guess you can say that.

387
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,601
Oh.

388
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,936
He's one of my juniors.

389
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,355
Wow, He's not a theater major?

390
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,692
Oh, I gotta transfer to your university.

391
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,028
Hello, good evening.

392
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,989
Hey, I'm Do-yeon, it's nice to meet you.

393
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,203
Hi, I'm Park Jae-eon.

394
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,082
Nice to meet you.

395
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,667
Hello everyone.

396
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,127
That was weird.

397
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,337
Na-bi, can you help me for a sec?

398
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,090
Oh, okay.

399
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,051
Have you had dinner yet?

400
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,304
Are you literally
unbuckling your belt?

401
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,264
That's way too uncomfortable.

402
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,224
I'm unbuckling my belt, whatever.

403
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,726
No, I haven't had anything to eat.

404
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,603
That's great,
then we can eat together.

405
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,229
Hey! Where did those two go?
I'm hungry.

406
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,273
My belly's all prepared and everything.

407
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,653
-Alcohol? Yeah, I drink.
-Have a shot.

408
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,323
-Do you drink?
-Yes. What kind do you like?

409
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,159
Well, I like… soju.

410
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,411
Oh,
would you like some right now?

411
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,455
Sure. Why don't we?

412
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,503
-Let me pour you a shot.
-Thank you so much.

413
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,379
Just a little.

414
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,132
-Cheers everyone!
-Hey, cheers everyone!

415
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,385
Down the hatch!

416
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,970
That's your last one, okay?

417
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,229
Seriously…

418
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,439
Dude, how are you so good
at taking photos? Honestly.

419
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,565
He ain't lying.

420
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,902
Hey, Do-hyeok, can I see
the photos you took of me earlier?

421
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,696
You're such a good photographer.
But I look awful in this one.

422
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,115
I look good.

423
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,201
Hey, this one looks nice, right?

424
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,702
Wow.

425
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,539
I'll just email the photos to all of you
later on if you want.

426
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,833
-You're the best.
-Thanks very much.

427
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,417
Can we take a look at the other ones?

428
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,585
Sure. Go ahead.

429
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,004
Look at this one.

430
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,173
-Oh, if you want.
-Oh, this photo's nice.

431
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,468
Here. I got two of these,
and I can share the other one.

432
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:46,970
Here, take it.

433
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:50,723
It'll… make you refreshed.
No headaches the next day.

434
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,183
Oh.

435
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,561
Ah! This one.
This one's my favorite.

436
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,648
-This one's better, right?
-You look pretty.

437
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,150
-He's such an amazing photographer.
-I know, right?

438
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,571
-Good or bad?
-Best I've seen you.

439
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,240
I remember, Do-hyeok
took this photo at the Ferris wheel…

440
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,492
That one's on me. Think of it as a favor.

441
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,829
Let's have a toast.

442
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,499
Hey, you went straight to drinking
without eating anything.

443
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,335
-Come on. Another shot, let's go.
-Ooh.

444
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,676
There you go. Jeez.

445
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,764
That was so nice.

446
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,685
Hey, Sol. Meat, please!

447
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,895
It's almost done.

448
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,856
You didn't even help.
This is not a restaurant.

449
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,399
I'm so hungry.

450
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,901
Hey, Sol. Need help with that?

451
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,029
-No, it's fine, really
-It's fine?

452
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,363
Need help with that?

453
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,282
Just back off, you're being a pain.

454
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,868
"Just back off, you're being a pain."

455
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,747
Hey, just stay quietly
and don't bother Sol.

456
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,165
But the meat…

457
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,710
She's right.
Just sit down and relax.

458
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,378
You're so kind.

459
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,047
Chopsticks.

460
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,887
Anyone here wanna drink with Ji-wan? Hm?

461
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,513
All right, nobody?

462
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,308
So lonely, I'm so alone.

463
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,571
There's no alcohol…

464
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,703
-Where's mine? What about me?
-Jeez.

465
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,372
His photos are amazing.

466
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,676
-Here you go.
-No, it's okay. Keep looking.

467
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,052
-Okay…
-I'll take that.

468
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,936
Do you like the moon?

469
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,230
Yeah.

470
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,900
Which one, the crescent moon
or the full moon?

471
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:06,859
-I just like…
-Come on!

472
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,946
…I mean, if it's pretty.

473
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,038
Cheers… Cheers!

474
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:25,712
He really doesn't want
anything to do with me anymore, but why…

475
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,130
Aren't you jealous?

476
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,132
Show them to me next time.

477
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,466
I will. Just come and visit.

478
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,301
What are you on about?

479
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,806
Looks like Jae-eon has set his sights
on a new target now.

480
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,100
I don't care about any of that.

481
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,816
What are you glaring at me for?

482
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,277
What are you… you avoiding
and ignoring Jae-eon for?

483
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,323
-I'm not avoiding him.
-You're a shit liar.

484
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,951
Hey, I'm like,
the one keeping things in order.

485
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,078
So, I need to know what it is, huh?

486
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,914
We went all the way out here
to relax and have some fun for a change.

487
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,250
You two keep ruining the vibe
for everyone.

488
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,962
Okay, I get it.

489
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,840
So tell me. Did something happen
with you and him at the Ferris wheel?

490
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,885
Nothing. We were just
looking at the view, that's it.

491
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,136
Like I said, you're a shit liar.

492
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,639
Nothing happened, so can you please
stop jumping to conclusions?

493
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,185
Does it have
something to do with Do-hyeok?

494
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,271
'Cause, he is charming.

495
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,232
Now, if you went after him,
I wouldn't mind that at all.

496
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,698
Jae-eon already has a girlfriend.

497
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,617
-What?
-Shut up.

498
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,202
Really?

499
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,412
Wh… Who?

500
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:46,250
I don't know. But he really does, so now
you can stop talking about us like that.

501
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,795
What? That's impossible.

502
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,963
You're really sure about that?

503
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,257
But he's not the type…
so there's just no way that's true.

504
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,384
That's enough of that.
Take this over there.

505
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,514
For real? A girlfriend?

506
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,518
-What?
-Here. Get over here.

507
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,685
Excuse me for a minute.

508
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,438
Hey, I got it.

509
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,274
Looks like there were a lot of leftovers.
We can just put them back in the kitchen.

510
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,986
Hm. You know, for some reason,
those two look like newlyweds.

511
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,281
Have a happy marriage!

512
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,953
Hey, Yu Se-hun!
You stop embarrassing yourself right now.

513
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,788
-What?
-There's no way you can be that clueless.

514
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,498
I'm not clueless.

515
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,958
Are you drunk?

516
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:32,004
Hey, Do-hyeok. How about telling me
how you and Na-bi met each other?

517
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:32,964
Hm…

518
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,926
You could say that we were friends
since we were kids.

519
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,930
I love it when two people
have that kind of backstory.

520
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:44,934
Friends since childhood,
falling in love like that.

521
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,602
It's like a drama movie!

522
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,271
You guys are way off.

523
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,772
I know, right?

524
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:57,113
To be honest,
Na-bi is really my first love.

525
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,574
What?

526
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,951
-Marry her!
-I'm jealous.

527
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,996
Marry him, Marry her!

528
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,250
Marry her! Marry him!

529
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,626
Are you drunk? What was that?

530
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,044
It's true, though.

531
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,087
How cool was that?

532
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,256
It's a perfect match
if you think about it.

533
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,383
Why don't you two ask each other? Come on!

534
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,426
I'll take it in.

535
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,117
She's your… girlfriend?

536
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,119
Uh-huh.

537
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,164
Well, we haven't been dating
for a long time.

538
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,209
Around two or three… Yeah, three months.

539
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,587
You're both already living together
after three months?

540
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,342
Well, I begged her to move in.

541
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,011
I really like her a lot.

542
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,409
Thanks for this.

543
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,663
Right. Just enjoy the food. I'm going.

544
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,373
Actually, I'm moving out soon.

545
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,083
Already?

546
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,795
Oh, my goodness.

547
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:40,049
Look, I know that it's not easy living
with someone else.

548
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,467
Especially this one.

549
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,511
Always sticking his nose
up other people's affairs,

550
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,596
yet he doesn't even know
how to take care of himself.

551
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,556
-Plus, he snores.
-Mom.

552
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,311
You know, ma'am. He's been…
as a boyfriend, he's been really good.

553
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,523
I felt that he must have received
a lot of love since he's so kind.

554
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,857
I guess I was right.

555
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,987
My goodness.
You are way too sweet, darling.

556
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,001
Now, for Bit-na's favorite random game!

557
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,716
The Whisper Game.
I'll start up for everyone.

558
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,092
-What?
-I have no idea.

559
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,808
-It's Ji-wan.
-Really?

560
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,852
-Me?
-Hey, she already knew!

561
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,437
No, I didn't expect him to choose her.

562
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,147
What is it? What?

563
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,356
Well, what is it?

564
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,152
-I had no… This is really shocking to me.
-I wanna know. Quick!

565
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,112
This is tough to say.

566
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,617
The question was,
"Who's the ugliest here?"

567
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,161
Come here, jerk.

568
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,331
Hey! You want to die?

569
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,959
Those two are gonna fall in love
if they keep teasing each other.

570
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,044
What was the question, anyway?

571
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,670
It's pretty obvious they will.

572
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,131
-You're not uncomfortable?
-Mm. It's fine.

573
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,800
Take back what you said!
Say, "Ji-wan's not ugly."

574
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,135
I'll just reveal the question.

575
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,512
I asked him who he thought
was the ugliest one here.

576
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,140
That's what I was thinking!

577
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,018
-So childish.
-Look, grandpa.

578
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,728
The game's supposed to be childish.

579
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,068
All right. I guess it's my turn now.

580
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,111
She's so damn drunk.

581
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,408
Hmm…

582
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,620
The grandson noodle shop.

583
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,665
Really? There's no way.
I can't believe it! Wow!

584
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,293
What? What was the question?
Just tell us already.

585
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,421
Honey. It's obvious. No need to think.

586
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,049
Come on, guys,
there's no point in even drinking.

587
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,426
-It's way too easy now.
-Exactly. That's what I mean.

588
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,136
-It's too obvious now.
-Huh?

589
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,139
Gyu-hyun, are you that curious?
Why would you wanna know the question?

590
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,559
That's right. Why would you even
drink for that. You know it's nothing.

591
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,395
Why not? I'm just curious.

592
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,899
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
the question that I asked Bit-na was…

593
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,571
"Who's your ideal type
among the ones in here?"

594
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,328
Okay, now.
Anything you want to know, Do-hyeok?

595
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,165
Uh…

596
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,466
Out of everyone,
who makes you happy or smile the most?

597
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,469
You.

598
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,307
I knew it!
I knew it! I already know!

599
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,770
What is it? What's the question?

600
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,731
-What is it! Tell me what it is!
-I already know. I already know!

601
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,775
Let me hear the question!

602
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,402
-What is it?
-Hmm.

603
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,737
Hey, Let's just
let this one slide.

604
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,324
-You wanna go next, Se-yeong?
-Oh, I can go?

605
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,161
Okay, I'll do it.
Thank you very much, you're so nice.

606
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,746
My question is,

607
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,749
"Who is the prettiest
out of everyone here?"

608
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,918
Ah, Se-yeong, of course.

609
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,670
My turn again.
Who's the loveliest

610
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,672
-out of everyone in the entire world?
-I'll be leaving for a bit.

611
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,383
I want you to bring the others
to the beach later on.

612
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,594
-Jeez.
-Excuse me.

613
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,138
-Just stop it.
-Where are you going?

614
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,307
Is there anything
you want to ask, Do-yeon?

615
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,184
Hmm…

616
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,336
Yu Na-bi.

617
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,065
What is it?

618
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:06,982
Tell us.

619
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,944
-Well, what's that reaction?
-Exactly.

620
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,363
Maybe she's drinking
out of complete jealousy?

621
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,281
I should drink for this one too.

622
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,866
-Me too!
-Me too.

623
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,159
Me too.

624
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,290
What was it?

625
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,294
Tell me! Hey, hey, hey!

626
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,841
Why not? I'm just curious.

627
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,844
Hey, hey, enough.
Game time's over now, people.

628
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,805
Let's just chat instead, talk.

629
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,516
Why? Everyone's having fun, right?
Keep going.

630
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,434
Come on, guys.

631
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:46,272
Hey, Sol. Why is Ji-wan acting like she's
tough? Even though she gets drunk easy?

632
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,315
It only happens
when she drinks outside.

633
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,692
Give it back to me, come on.

634
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,485
You've had enough, sorry.

635
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,155
You two are such close friends.
You know everything about each other.

636
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,951
Well, that's 'cause we've been
close friends ever since middle school.

637
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,871
Hey, was Ji-wan really
that popular back in middle school?

638
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,958
'Cause according to her, boys were
practically lining up to date her.

639
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,085
Mm-hm. She was popular.

640
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,796
She is pretty.

641
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,381
Right!

642
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,967
Shit! You're drunker than I am.

643
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,053
Oh, well, she does have
a little bit of charm

644
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,848
if we're being absolutely generous.
Face seems normal.

645
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,768
No, it's true. Guys constantly hit on her,
even when she had a boyfriend.

646
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,814
I told you, Bit-na!
And you thought I was lying!

647
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:32,026
I'm telling you,
I was as beautiful as you can imagine.

648
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,528
Yep, one of the prettiest girls in school!

649
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,696
-Hey!
-Hold on.

650
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,906
She's the hottest one.

651
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,742
Oh! What's with you? Just stop it.

652
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,535
-What?
-Jeez.

653
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,038
I can tell you're all looking down on me.

654
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,914
Hey, Sol. You ever date anyone?

655
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,625
Yu Se-hun,

656
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,045
you should just stop while you can.
Enough is enough.

657
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,214
Sol doesn't like you!
Get it through your head!

658
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,258
Shut up.
Why do you have to be so mean to me?

659
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,968
-Time for bed.
-Me?

660
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,304
God, she's so loud.

661
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,640
-I want to hang out with you!
-Let's go inside.

662
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,683
Jeez, those lungs.

663
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,853
I wanna keep
playing games with them.

664
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,315
And, guys!
I wanna go shoot some fireworks too!

665
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,151
Why do you have to drink so much?

666
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,654
Do you want a hangover again,
like last time?

667
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,657
My mistake.

668
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,368
Just get some sleep.
Close your eyes, okay?

669
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:26,830
-Sol! My super friend Sol!
-Hey! Not too hard!

670
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,999
-All right, you can let go!
-My beloved, precious friend.

671
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,210
You can stop choking me.

672
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,557
What's with you? No more drinking for you.

673
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,184
Hey, Sol.

674
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,607
Hold my hand again, will you?

675
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,836
You're the one that I like the most.

676
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,214
I like you more than my mom or my dad.

677
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,758
You're my favorite person in the world.

678
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,594
And you?

679
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,347
Who's your favorite person?

680
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,476
Can you stop messing around and just--

681
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,062
Tell me, do you
have feelings for Ju-hyeok?

682
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,317
Or Yu Se-hun? I don't want you to.

683
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,986
Because I…

684
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,656
I just don't like it.

685
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,786
I can't stand you liking anyone else.

686
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,206
I should be the only one you like, hm?

687
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,878
Just me. And no one else. Please.

688
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:01,175
Please, Sol.
I wanna be the only one you need.

689
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:05,721
Hey, Ji-wan.

690
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:13,145
Stop getting my hopes up like this.
It's hurting me.

691
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,700
-Oh, come on, why aren't you joining us?
-No thanks.

692
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,119
What's gotten into you, Jae-eon?
Is something up?

693
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:14,665
He's right! This whole time, it's like
you've become different. You've changed!

694
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,251
It seems like he's become
a lot more sentimental.

695
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,711
Are you going for a new look?

696
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,839
Why is that? What was he like before?

697
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,675
Oh, Jae-eon has always been
incredible. As you can see.

698
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,552
Do I really need to point out his looks?

699
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,512
What are you up to?

700
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:34,601
Perhaps… after all this time,
he has finally found his soulmate?

701
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:46,029
Oh! Ah, look who's finally
decided to be part of our group.

702
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,703
Let's stop with all this.
Let's go to the beach.

703
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,496
-You wanted to watch fireworks.
-Come on.

704
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,206
Everyone was just getting curious.

705
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,417
The gossip line was
just about to get juicy

706
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,044
with the revelation
of Jae-eon finally meeting his soulmate.

707
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,548
Just tell us, Jae-eon.
Put aside any layer of bullshit away.

708
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,925
Have you finally
met a girl who has captured your heart?

709
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,427
-Have you found her?
-Have you found her?

710
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,803
Have you found her?

711
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:14,808
Mm-hm.

712
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,271
So then, perhaps you would
like to show her

713
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,398
how much she means to you by kissing her.

714
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,733
-You're gonna kiss her?
-You're gonna kiss her?

715
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,109
You're gonna kiss her?

716
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:30,032
Are you guys drunk?

717
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,579
Hey, Bit-na, maybe you should drop it now.

718
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,374
Let's just keep playing other games.

719
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,127
Come on. This is all a game too.

720
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,087
All right, Jae-eon,
next question.

721
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,214
So you've met that special someone
to tame your heart.

722
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,841
But is that special someone here now?

723
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,801
-Is she here now?
-Is she here now?

724
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,595
Is she here? Is she here now?

725
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,975
Ah! Oh-oh.

726
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,854
-No, don't pick it up.
-Don't move. Don't move.

727
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,105
You okay?

728
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,359
-Go get a broom.
-She's hurt.

729
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,488
Oh, my goodness, she's bleeding.

730
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,157
The cut's deep. Let's get this treated.

731
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,159
-Oh, no.
-That cut looks pretty deep.

732
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,744
Are you…

733
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,871
What do we do about this?

734
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,042
-The pieces are all over.
-Hey careful, don't step on it.

735
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,002
That must really hurt.

736
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,630
So, how bad does it look?

737
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,298
I'm okay.

738
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,134
Can you see her?
See if she's okay.

739
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,096
Looks like the cut
isn't as deep as I first thought.

740
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,847
But we should still disinfect it.

741
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,687
Hey, Gyu-hyun, can you take the others
to the beach for now?

742
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,230
We'll just catch up in a bit.

743
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,856
Why? We'll just wait for you to finish.

744
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,526
How do you think Do-yeon feels
with everyone gawking at her?

745
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:48,819
Don't worry.
Just go on without us.

746
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,988
Do-hyeok's already at the beach
getting things ready

747
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,406
and setting up the fireworks.

748
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,492
So that's why he left.

749
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,578
Yeah. By the way, you don't have to
tell Do-hyeok about any of this.

750
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,955
We'll head over soon.

751
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,749
All right, then.
Be careful on the way there.

752
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,584
-Okay.
-Hey, Na-bi.

753
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:08,296
I ruined all the fun.
If it wasn't for my clumsy ass.

754
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,632
You didn't ruin anything. It's all fine.

755
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,719
You're gonna need to take antibiotics,
just in case.

756
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,180
By the way…

757
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,098
Hm?

758
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,268
…what's your relationship to Jae-eon?
Are you two close?

759
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,771
There's nothing between us.

760
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,481
It kinda seemed like there was something.

761
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:30,235
I really mean it.
My friends just like teasing us both.

762
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,486
Really?

763
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,531
Somehow, it seemed like
he had feelings for you, though.

764
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,870
And what is it that makes you think that?

765
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,663
If you remember, during the Whisper Game,

766
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,833
Jae-eon chose you as his answer
just like that.

767
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,210
The question I asked him was,

768
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,130
out of everyone there,
who did he want to kiss tonight.

769
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,603
Sounds right. He's always like that.

770
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,980
It's like he's never been sincere
in his life.

771
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,524
You don't need to pay attention
to any of that.

772
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,820
And we're all done.

773
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,905
Thank you.

774
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,116
Well, let's go
catch up to everyone at the beach.

775
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,535
Uh, I'll pass.

776
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,246
I'm going straight
to my aunt's house instead.

777
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,998
What for? You should come with us.

778
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,167
Do-hyeok's probably
been waiting for you at the beach.

779
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:31,171
Actually, I'd really love to go.
It's just that I'm so tired.

780
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,882
You go on and have fun with everyone.

781
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,885
Okay, then. Get some well-earned rest,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

782
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:37,803
Mm.

783
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,514
And don't forget about the antibiotics.

784
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:00,367
Stay back! Stay back!
Do you know what you're doing?

785
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,912
Everyone, let's all
dance around it like this.

786
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,999
Why are we doing this?

787
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,460
-Come on!
-I hate this so much!

788
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,295
Go faster!

789
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,422
Why the hell are we doing this?

790
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,468
-Am I doing this right?
-I've got the hang of it.

791
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,805
This is so stupid!

792
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:22,806
NA-BI

793
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:26,017
Hold on! Hey, can you take a photo of me?

794
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,394
Sure.

795
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,646
Hey, I got an idea.
Let's write "love" with these…

796
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,523
-Hey, come on. Come on!
-Let's go.

797
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,949
-Thank you so much!
-I'll write "love" in the air.

798
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:44,327
Hey, can you take a photo of us too,
while we do this? Go, draw the heart.

799
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,037
You have to get the heart as well,
not just me.

800
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,623
Yeah!
We have to write the word "love" too.

801
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:52,085
All right. Get ready. One, two, three.

802
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,680
Ah. Why are you sitting
down here all alone for?

803
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,975
I thought I'd chill with you,
so I bought these. Take one.

804
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:13,023
Jeez, what is it? I don't get it.
Everyone is having a good time,

805
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,150
so why have you been
looking so upset the whole day?

806
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,360
-So you call that fun?
-What now?

807
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,530
You think it's a good time teasing people
and making them feel uncomfortable?

808
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,032
I don't. What are you talking about?

809
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,241
Like earlier tonight.

810
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,037
You talk about others, right
in front of them. Purely out of enjoyment.

811
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,331
You're like making other people
feel uncomfortable.

812
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,458
It's insensitive
and you should stop doing that.

813
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,126
It's not like that.

814
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,878
Everyone was already whispering
behind his back.

815
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,130
All I did was ask them to say it out loud.

816
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,424
Plus, it's obvious
that Na-bi and Jae-eon like each other.

817
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,551
It's sad to see them like that.
And you know it.

818
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,514
All right. Fine, I'll chill.

819
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,016
I promise. No more of that stuff.

820
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,810
Now hold onto this. Come on,
I brought it so we could make up.

821
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:52,812
You hold it…

822
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,690
and if we light the end,
let me just get this.

823
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,568
Pretty, right?

824
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,199
Look.

825
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,040
You can keep justifying yourself
all you want.

826
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,042
You know exactly what you did.

827
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:21,633
I think it's about time
you stop playing games with me.

828
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,595
Stop playing games? What do you mean?

829
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,057
I went into this knowing full well
that you thought of me as a total joke.

830
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,725
But I can't go through this.

831
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,435
What do you really mean?

832
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,524
It's time for us to end this.

833
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,072
Just wait. Hey!

834
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,956
Hey, Do-hyeok!

835
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,628
Hey, you made it.

836
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,547
Hey, what happened here?

837
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,674
-I just got hurt just a little.
-How? Is it bad?

838
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,009
Do you need to get checked?

839
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,803
It's all good, so don't worry.
Na-bi already took care of it.

840
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:10,432
Gosh, it must have hurt.
You should have been more careful.

841
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,309
Uh, where's Na-bi? Isn't she with you?

842
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,812
Uh… She said that she was
way too tired to come tonight.

843
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,897
-She's not coming?
-Are you that upset?

844
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,110
Um, so she went back
to her aunt's place, right?

845
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:24,279
Hm, yeah, probably. What's wrong?

846
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,157
It's nothing.

847
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,827
By the way,
have you seen Jae-eon anywhere around?

848
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,420
This is just the worst, isn't it?

849
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,464
What is the worst?

850
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,929
Didn't you go to the beach
along with the others?

851
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,224
I came 'cause I was worried.

852
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,022
Don't worry. I treated her properly.

853
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,649
Do-yeon just left a while ago.
Didn't you see?

854
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,405
Something funny?

855
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,456
What are you doing?

856
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,833
I meant for you.

857
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,002
You got hurt as well.

858
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,630
That's none of your concern, though.

859
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,882
It hurts, right?

860
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:32,222
No more drinking for you.
You've had more than enough already.

861
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,979
Why would you care whether I drink or not?

862
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,900
It's fine. I got this.

863
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,112
-Here, let me do it.
-Quit it. I said, "I got it."

864
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,284
You're always getting angry at me
for some reason.

865
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,161
At least, compared to the others.

866
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,256
Why is it
that I can't ever refuse him?

867
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:15,390
I get the feeling…
I'll be crumbling again.

868
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,852
You saw me get hurt out there?

869
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,020
Of course, I saw it.

870
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:26,192
But I didn't do anything about it.
You would have gotten angry.

871
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,988
Ridiculous.

872
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,369
I can't say
I didn't have other intentions, though.

873
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,462
-Stop it.
-What?

874
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,091
This whole thing. I don't like it.

875
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,596
What exactly am I doing?

876
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,224
-Stop smiling.
-I can't even smile?

877
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,351
You enjoyed playing around
with me that much?

878
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,937
Why did you have to say that
earlier tonight in front of everyone?

879
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,314
Who knows what they'll think.

880
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,443
You know.

881
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,778
You don't need me to tell you why.

882
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,449
I kept thinking about you.

883
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,702
I've missed you more than you'll know.

884
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,872
Didn't you ever miss me?

885
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,343
Do you hate me that much?

886
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,136
You already have a girlfriend.

887
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,888
That's not the issue.

888
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,974
That's right.
It's got nothing to do with me.

889
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,310
Can you at least be honest with yourself?

890
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,354
Let go.

891
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:52,612
Running away again?

892
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,491
I never ran away.

893
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,618
You really want me to let go?

894
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,998
All you have to do is tell me…

895
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,667
that you don't want any of this.

896
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:09,629
And I will stop forever.

897
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,648
YANG DO-HYEOK

898
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,828
Is it really okay?

899
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,335
If we keep going,

900
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,921
I don't think I'll be able to let go.

901
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:43,199
All I know is… I care about you a lot.
So much that I don't know what to do.

902
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,451
I know exactly why I was crying.

903
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,369
Did you sleep well?

904
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,121
We didn't get to finish what we started.

905
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,872
You really like her, don't you?

906
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,125
Yeah. And I don't play games.

907
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,252
And you and Do-hyeok,
you guys dating?

908
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:55,503
He's such a coward.

909
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,296
Did you find an assistant?

910
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,215
Yeah, I thought I told you.

911
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,676
Why do I feel
like I'm cheating on him?

912
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:04,011
You got scouted? Good for you.

913
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,012
You're going to the US?

914
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,723
I've given this some thought.

915
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:10,518
I remember seeing someone so beautiful
here and it was love at first sight.

916
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,270
I like you. I really do.

917
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,732
No matter what happens,
I don't want to let Do-hyeok down.

918
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,401
Do I have
that much of a hold on her?
