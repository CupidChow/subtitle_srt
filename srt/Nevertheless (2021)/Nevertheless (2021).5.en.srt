1
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,870
Oh. There it is.

2
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,538
Ah!

3
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:22,832
Hey, listen.

4
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,127
Do you think there's something
going on between Na-bi and Jae-eon?

5
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,714
Well, how could someone
like Na-bi date Jae-eon?

6
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,633
Why? Na-bi's so pretty.

7
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,385
That's not what I meant.
Jae-eon is the problem.

8
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,263
He never gets real with anybody.

9
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,557
That's why I end it with him
after a few dates.

10
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,810
Are you serious?

11
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,561
You're really the one
who ended it with him?

12
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,233
Yeah. I got away from him,
but I guess Na-bi didn't.

13
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,734
The rumors say so.

14
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,903
Jeez! What a way
to end her time at school.

15
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,614
I know.
Did you get everything?

16
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,865
Yeah. We can go.

17
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,047
Are you working?
I'm almost at school now.

18
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,554
Tell me, is there another girl
you're seeing other than me?

19
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,931
There's none.

20
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,267
Really?

21
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,242
Hey, excuse me.

22
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,370
Are you, um…
Are you Park Jae-eon, by any chance?

23
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,247
Yeah.

24
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,373
Ah.

25
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,001
So it's you, huh.

26
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,130
You fucking bastard!

27
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,216
Stop! Don't hurt him!

28
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,634
What are you doing?

29
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,098
You know, honestly,
I don't understand why you're so upset.

30
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,726
You didn't have to leave me hanging.

31
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,441
Well…

32
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,276
I was…

33
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,986
Get out of the way!

34
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,029
What was that?

35
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,741
Na-bi!

36
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,495
Get up, you prick!

37
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,666
Stop! Jae-eon!

38
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,919
Stop it.

39
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,214
Stop, sir. Please, stop it!

40
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,423
-Move!
-That's enough!

41
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,091
-Out of the way!
-Sir, please!

42
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,177
-How could you?
-What's going on here?

43
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,678
Why did you do it? Why?

44
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,931
-Ji-wan, hurry. Come on!
-Okay.

45
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,391
-Police, we need help.
-Why did you do it?

46
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,102
I'm at Hongseo University, and a man has…

47
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,270
Sol, hold him back.

48
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,313
Why did you do it?

49
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,773
-Are you okay?
-I don't know who he is,

50
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,150
-but you have to hurry up. Okay, thanks.
-Why?

51
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,236
Jae-eon…

52
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,237
Calm down.

53
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,619
EPISODE 5: I KNOW NOTHING WILL CHANGE.
NEVERTHELESS,

54
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,249
We should get going.

55
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,210
What? But why? I want an update on…

56
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,673
I mean… of course I'm worried about them.

57
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,259
Call me if anything happens here. Okay?

58
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,135
Yeah. I will.

59
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,096
-Hmm.
-You take care.

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,349
-See you. Bye.
-Make sure to call if anything happens.

61
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,341
Just who do you think you are
messing around with someone

62
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,260
who you know is already with someone else?

63
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,971
If you ever go near my sister again,

64
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,932
I'm gonna kill you,
you disgusting scumbag. You mark my words.

65
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:10,977
Hey, miss.

66
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,604
Here's an important advice
before you commit to someone.

67
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,941
Make sure they're a good person
because if you don't, you'll regret it.

68
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,985
Your life is gonna be ruined

69
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,195
if you end up dating an asshole
like this guy.

70
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,337
Anything you wanna say to me?

71
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,838
Go on.

72
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,424
We can talk later. I'm going home.

73
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,594
You okay? Did you get hurt?
Let's get you checked.

74
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,137
I said I'm fine.

75
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,106
I wonder what they're talking about
right now. I bet they're arguing.

76
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,902
I think I made things worse
all because I called the police.

77
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,363
You did the right thing.
Don't worry about it.

78
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,115
If you didn't,
Na-bi could have gotten hurt.

79
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,742
Really?

80
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,161
Did you see her?

81
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,789
Na-bi was yanking that man
off of Jae-eon herself.

82
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,540
I thought it was pretty cool.

83
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,459
-She wasn't scared at all.
-That's true.

84
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,837
I thought she'd be angry.
I mean, after what Jae-eon did to her,

85
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,964
I'm surprised she still took his side.

86
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,510
I guess, but maybe she likes him a lot.

87
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,477
I should get going.

88
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,896
Later, Sol.

89
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,316
Wait, I can take you home.

90
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,693
You've been acting strange.

91
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,278
You wanna tell me something?

92
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,908
It's just we didn't get to finish talking.

93
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,327
Oh, that's okay.

94
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,330
I mean… that's how
it's always been with us.

95
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,707
We act like nothing happened.

96
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,336
I feel like this is too important.

97
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,423
I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was done…

98
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,050
as a student.

99
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,593
It's not that, Sol.

100
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,972
I was upset because you said that
that was all our relationship was to you.

101
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,348
Hey, you're the one who…

102
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,812
Right. I'm sorry.

103
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:23,067
And remember? At the flea market,
I'm sorry about how I acted.

104
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,361
And you, aren't you sorry
you didn't tell me about him?

105
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,321
Hey, that's not fair at all.

106
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,365
There's nothing going on
between Ju-hyeok and me.

107
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,034
Okay, if you're not dating
then what is he to you?

108
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,853
It's for your lip.

109
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,402
Thank you.

110
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,489
You know, I don't want you
to see me like this.

111
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,325
You took care of me when I was sick.

112
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,784
So now, we can call it even.

113
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,453
I'm going home, all right?

114
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,039
Won't I see you again?

115
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,545
I'd like for us to stay friends, Na-bi.

116
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:25,963
"Friends", huh?

117
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,383
Just how do you expect me
to stay friends with you?

118
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,512
-What do you mean?
-Why did you lie to me? Answer me.

119
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,514
I thought you wanted this to be exclusive.

120
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,098
What's the big deal?

121
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,266
Hey.

122
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,645
What's the point of all this?
What do you really want from me?

123
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,480
I see.

124
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,859
You just want someone stupid enough
so you can get inside her pants.

125
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,528
-That's enough.
-I'm sure it is.

126
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,781
You always pull back when it matters most.

127
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,159
Right? You want me there when you need me,

128
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,203
but when I'm the one who needs you,
I can't count on you.

129
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,454
So don't worry.

130
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,123
Because it won't happen again.

131
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,584
It's not like that!

132
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,927
Okay, tell me, what are we?

133
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,349
I thought you were okay with everything.

134
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,560
-But suddenly, you--
-Yeah.

135
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,938
I'm sorry if I pretended
I was okay with what we have.

136
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,148
And if I'm being honest here,

137
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,526
I've been having such a hard time
since I started seeing you,

138
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,695
but I chose to pretend it was okay
with you not being committed

139
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,613
because I knew that I…

140
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,741
Because I…

141
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,244
Because I like you.

142
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,089
But it's too much.
I have to put an end to this.

143
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,383
What?

144
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,467
It's weird, right?

145
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,887
To end something that wasn't really there
in the first place.

146
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,391
But Na-bi…

147
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,143
Thanks for giving me a reason
to end things

148
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,103
with this fucked-up whatever with you.

149
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,860
All right. Let's end this.

150
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,988
If you think that's really
what you wanna do.

151
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,038
Wow, you're unbelievable.

152
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,794
Still an asshole until the end.

153
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,489
Park Jae-eon
and Na-bi were having an affair,

154
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,909
and then, they were caught
by that woman, it's crazy.

155
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,620
No way. You're saying
they were really caught in the act?

156
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,996
Yeah.

157
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,957
You're saying Jae-eon
was actually hit by a woman?

158
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,084
-That's why his face is so busted up?
-Mm-hm.

159
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,585
I heard it was a guy, though.

160
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,631
-So was he…
-No.

161
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,133
Are you sure that's what you heard?

162
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,803
I heard it was Na-bi
who did that to Jae-eon's face.

163
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,638
Someone saw them fighting that same night.

164
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,598
Hey, Na-bi wouldn't hit him.
It doesn't sound like her.

165
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,309
-Because she found out he was cheating.
-Ah! That's not it.

166
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,477
Listen, Se-yeong.

167
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,480
If Na-bi could hit Jae-eon that hard,
she should just go join the UFC.

168
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,859
Na-bi should have been happy
after leaving me.

169
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,737
-Shut up.
-Come on, you guys.

170
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,281
-Wow!
-Not a big deal.

171
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,699
I just dyed my hair.

172
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,951
I don't know, it's a lot.

173
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,119
What are we gonna do with you?

174
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,204
Well, you will get
the attention you want.

175
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,040
-She looks great.
-You hate it?

176
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,501
People at the salon liked it.

177
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,628
It's beautiful. It's just surprising.

178
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,131
The color's really nice too.
Did you have to bleach it?

179
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,133
Mm-hm. I almost lost my hair.

180
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,387
Hey, Bit-na.

181
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,766
Have you heard anything about
what happened with Na-bi and Jae-eon?

182
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,143
-I wish I could stay home.
-Quiet. Na-bi's coming over.

183
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,978
Hey, guys.

184
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,773
-Sol's here too.
-Hey!

185
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,275
Why aren't you going to be
at the workshop?

186
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,861
Ah, you changed your hair. It looks great.

187
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,905
Thanks, but don't change the subject.

188
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,532
I can't believe
you both decided not to come.

189
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,868
How could you? You've abandoned me.

190
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,411
She's right. You should come.

191
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,246
The professors won't be there.

192
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,916
It would be fun
to just hang out there on our own.

193
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,125
-I don't know.
-Hmm?

194
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,336
I think
you should both go there.

195
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,463
Maybe you can even ask Jae-eon
to come too?

196
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,590
Everyone will show up
if he's there, I'm sure.

197
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,801
Ask him yourself. Don't make her do it.

198
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,011
But they're closer than we are.

199
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,139
Speaking of Jae-eon,
what happened to his face?

200
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,725
What do you mean?

201
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,393
You heard about it?

202
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,521
-Who was he fighting when he got hurt?
-Hey.

203
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,233
Please don't ask me.

204
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,735
I don't know what happened to Jae-eon.

205
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,030
I don't know anything, either.

206
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,115
-Stop.
-Aww.

207
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,160
I, I got it.
Let's get back to work. Stop hitting me.

208
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,508
Hey there.

209
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,389
I'm so sorry.

210
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,018
I don't know what he saw.
He must have misunderstood.

211
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,396
He just lost it.

212
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,650
You must be really upset.

213
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,987
Please tell your girlfriend
I'm sorry about what happened.

214
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,446
My girlfriend?

215
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,365
Well, I heard that
you're seeing someone now.

216
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,659
Are you guys serious?

217
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,453
Call me if anything happens.

218
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,915
Even if it isn't anything special.

219
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,085
That won't happen.
It's what's best for both of us.

220
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,087
I understand.

221
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,439
Gyu-hyun?

222
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,696
Thank you.

223
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,538
How is it?

224
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,958
Is that… is that mint chocolate?

225
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,586
ICE CREAM DELIVERY

226
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,922
-What about chocolate and cashew nuts?
-Okay, wait.

227
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,591
-Hi!
-Hi.

228
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,593
Hey, what ice cream do you want?

229
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,512
-Let me see…
-Oh, perfect.

230
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,766
I think I'm gonna get myself
a mint chocolate for the third scoop.

231
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,310
What?

232
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,438
-You don't like mint chocolate?
-It's gross.

233
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,066
-It's gross. It's like eating toothpaste.
-I know, right?

234
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,362
-It's good.
-Mm-hm.

235
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,829
This isn't that simple,
Na-bi, you should know.

236
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,914
Art has never been easy. Right?

237
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,834
Listen to me. Just because you
create something, doesn't make it art.

238
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,127
I've told you before.

239
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,462
I've never seen
his face like that.

240
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,756
-…put your soul into it.
-Was he hurt by my words?

241
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,385
-No way. Is that even possible with him?
-…use your inspiration to create art.

242
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,805
Hey, Na-bi. Were you listening at all?

243
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:55,723
Huh?

244
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,771
You need to work on this.
Look at it. This isn't looking good.

245
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,273
You really think
you can make the deadline?

246
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,316
Sorry, ma'am.

247
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,871
How could he do that?

248
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,923
You know, Bit-na, I was wondering
what made you show up

249
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,425
to the studio for once.

250
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:32,843
You were dumped too?

251
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,345
Of course not, Professor.

252
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,890
I'm the one that dumps guys.
Nobody would ever dumped me.

253
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,893
And I do come to the studio often,
Professor.

254
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,811
-Oh, is that so?
-Mm-hm.

255
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,064
Will I be seeing your work
sometime soon, then?

256
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,025
Yes, Professor, I promise
that I'll show you my work in no time.

257
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,370
Sol.

258
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,915
Yun Sol.

259
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,918
You haven't been able
to focus on your work lately.

260
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,755
Have you already given up on this
because you decided you're not leaving?

261
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,843
No. Sorry. I'm sorry.

262
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:23,018
Oh, Sol, why didn't I know about this?

263
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,983
Everything here is a mess. Look!

264
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,361
What has gotten into you all?

265
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,614
You should be pouring all you have
into your work.

266
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,159
I told you to look for inspiration,

267
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,078
and not throw all of it away.

268
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,000
You may be thinking,
"There she goes again."

269
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,628
Am I talking to a brick wall here, huh?

270
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,132
Oh, my goodness.
Am I just wasting my time here?

271
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,299
We're sorry, ma'am.

272
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,968
We're sorry, ma'am.

273
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,643
Hey, Sol. Here.

274
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,769
-What?
-Take this.

275
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,771
-Thanks.
-Try not to take it personally.

276
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,231
I think your piece looks great.

277
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,942
-All right. Thanks.
-Hey, wait.

278
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,444
So is it true you're staying?

279
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,988
You won't be an exchange student?

280
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,621
Yes.

281
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,710
Why? Did anything happen?

282
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,421
Well…

283
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,840
I wanted to stay.

284
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,220
SPICY TRIPE

285
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,197
Mm. You said your tongue gets numb.

286
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,140
But it's too much.
I have to put an end to this.

287
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,478
All right.

288
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,687
Let's end this.

289
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,815
If you think that's really
what you wanna do.

290
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,731
Get out of the way!

291
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,067
Na-bi!

292
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,163
PARK JAE-EON

293
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,170
The number you have dialed
is not in the directory.

294
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,672
Please check the number and call again.

295
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,593
The number you have dialed
is not in the directory.

296
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,887
Please check the number and call again.

297
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,589
I miss him.

298
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,311
Na-bi hasn't been the same
since dumping Jae-eon.

299
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,981
The professor was really hard on her.

300
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,024
She's been behaving strange, lately.

301
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,860
She's been working late,
but has no progress to show.

302
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,321
I know. They shouldn't have dated.

303
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,659
If it were a real relationship,
it might have been better for her.

304
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,119
There's no difference.

305
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,246
I mean, why would you even start?

306
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,791
Once it falls apart,
you are just going to be miserable.

307
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,086
You be careful too.

308
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,799
We're totally fine.

309
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,350
Oh, there he is. Another victim of love.

310
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,064
Him? Gyu-hyun?

311
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,817
Why? What happened to him?

312
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,695
Do you remember
how I set him up on a blind date?

313
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,781
I thought it was going well,
but then my friend rejected him.

314
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,703
Look at him. He's so sad.
I feel so bad for him.

315
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,289
So, wait, are you telling me
that he's like that

316
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,875
-because your friend turned him down?
-Mm-hm.

317
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,043
What?

318
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,211
How pretty does that girl think she is?

319
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,213
You know, I don't think
she's even that good-looking.

320
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,258
What? Did you get to see
the girl yourself?

321
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,845
No, I didn't.

322
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,222
I was just trying to say that…

323
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,975
Gyu-hyun's not bad-looking.
Why would she dare do that?

324
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,852
You're right. He's kind of cute.

325
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,730
But I shouldn't set up
any more blind dates.

326
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,320
Shit.

327
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,046
How come you never leave
your hair down?

328
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,175
Would you leave it down just for me?

329
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,806
Oh. I was…

330
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,517
going to return the necklace.

331
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,018
Oh, you can just throw it away.

332
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,731
It's so easy for you to say that.

333
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,988
SEOL-A

334
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,084
Hello, Seol-a.

335
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,045
What?

336
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,300
I'm going there.

337
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,942
The fee can be about 50,000 each,

338
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,653
so we can still go with the place
that we decided on.

339
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,656
Hey, are you taking note of this?

340
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,618
Mm. Yup, he's done.

341
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,579
Then, that's it for today.

342
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,373
What should we get?

343
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,667
-Vodka?
-Yes!

344
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,960
Are we going out for drinks then?

345
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,003
Let's go!

346
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,297
Right. Should we ask the others
to join us too? What do you think?

347
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,050
Who else will go?
Last time, you invited too many people.

348
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,177
Hey, Gyu-hyun, where are you going?
Aren't you gonna come with us?

349
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,428
No, thanks.

350
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,514
I knew it.
He must have really liked her.

351
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,225
Maybe I should go
and talk to my friend about it.

352
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,189
EMERGENCY ROOM

353
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,192
How do you feel now? You better?

354
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,112
Uh-huh. Thank you.

355
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,574
-How much was it?
-It's fine.

356
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,369
Doctor said you have severe anemia.

357
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,872
So please take your meds.

358
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,000
-It's no big deal.
-You know you could pass out if you don't.

359
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:41,214
You put your hair down. It looks good.

360
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,800
Really?

361
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,718
I should keep it down, then.

362
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,722
Something wrong, Jae-eon?

363
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,271
You changed your number,
now you changed your hairstyle.

364
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,356
Is there something going on with you?

365
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,611
Nothing.

366
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,738
I'm just sick of it.

367
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:07,949
Of what?

368
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,535
Of myself.

369
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,792
It can't be any material.

370
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,378
It'll have to be on a narrow
but firm base.

371
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,214
That's it.

372
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,468
Hey.

373
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,563
Is it okay that you're here?

374
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,398
For a little while. Yeah, sure.

375
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,612
Is that for your presentation?

376
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,864
Well, yeah.

377
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,450
Could you show me?
I'd really love to see it.

378
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,411
Of course. Here.

379
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,915
It's nothing special, though.

380
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,417
It's what I'll be using
to explain to everyone

381
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,461
what kind of piece I'll be making.

382
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,715
But, you know, honestly,

383
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,051
I don't really know
if I can make it like that.

384
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,428
Wow. This is--

385
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,512
This is good.

386
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,188
So how'd you come up with this?

387
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,441
You're really talented.

388
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,152
I don't know. It's not much really.

389
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,488
There are so many others
way better than me.

390
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,824
So would you say that
there's good art and bad art too?

391
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,242
Hmm. I'd say that.

392
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,746
I guess you can say
it's not all too different from cooking.

393
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,915
Different people
have different tastes, right?

394
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:42,794
But it's pretty clear when food is good
or when the food is bad.

395
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,757
Well, I don't know much about art,

396
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,219
but I like yours. It's impressive.

397
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,848
Uh…

398
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,225
Really?

399
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,028
It's so good.

400
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,656
Could you maybe explain
the taste to me in detail?

401
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,245
I can say that these noodles taste similar

402
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,163
to the noodles that
your grandpa used to make,

403
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:23,668
but the soup, I like that it's so light
and actually quite savory.

404
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,464
Anyway, I like this one more.

405
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,968
That's nice.

406
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,804
Ooh, I can't wait to brag about this
to my grandpa.

407
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,723
I don't think you can brag just yet.

408
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,392
Right.

409
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,353
Here. For you.

410
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,314
I just got it. I thought of you.

411
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,317
It's for… for good luck.

412
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,529
What is this?

413
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,574
Is it lipstick?

414
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,703
This is for me?

415
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:00,747
Mm-hm.

416
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,877
Wow.

417
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:15,928
Well?

418
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,639
Mm. It looks good.

419
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,769
Thanks, Do-hyeok.

420
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,606
Promise. I'll do my best tomorrow.

421
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,191
Do-hyeok!

422
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,609
Oh, right.

423
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,277
Enjoy your food.

424
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,160
Hi, everyone. We're here again.

425
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,037
-Hello. Welcome.
-Hello.

426
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,038
Yes?

427
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,125
You look really happy, huh?
You like her that much?

428
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,543
What?

429
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,921
Mmm!

430
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,091
Really? You can tell?

431
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,467
Yes. It's obvious.

432
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,053
She'll figure it out soon enough.

433
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,097
Here.

434
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,226
On the house.

435
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:04,769
No, I couldn't.

436
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,354
Don't worry. Just give it to her.

437
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,440
I don't know, this heart's a bit…

438
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,026
Stop making excuses
and just do what I tell you.

439
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,197
-Oh.
-I'm running out of patience. Just go.

440
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:24,956
Here.

441
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,083
-Complimentary…
-No, no, it's no problem.

442
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,793
Enjoy, enjoy. Thank you.

443
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,192
YU SE-HUN

444
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,866
Hey, Gyu-hyun.
You know where Bit-na lives, right?

445
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,826
Text me her address, will you?

446
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,411
What do you need it for?

447
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,206
She's totally wasted,
so I'll be getting her a taxi.

448
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,749
-All right.
-On the count of three…

449
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,585
-What?
-What?

450
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,545
If that's a problem, you pick her up.

451
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,629
Really?

452
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,464
Where are you right now? I'll be there.

453
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,426
Huh? Really?
I thought you weren't feeling well?

454
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,678
I'm fine. Just send me your location.

455
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,036
What… What's that?

456
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,542
Who… Who's there?

457
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,800
Who's there?

458
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,349
Darn it!

459
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,730
Oh!

460
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,316
Why did you do that?

461
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,860
You scared me to death.

462
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,656
Okay. Who wants more drinks?

463
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,740
Me!

464
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,158
-I'm down.
-Me!

465
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,953
-No, we have to take her with us.
-Wake up, Bit-na.

466
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,413
-Bit-na, wake up already.
-Wake up, okay?

467
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,957
-Come on.
-So where are we going, guys?

468
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,542
No way. He rode a taxi here?

469
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,836
-Oh. Hey!
-All this way?

470
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,755
That's expensive.

471
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,013
Go on, then. I can be the one
to give Bit-na a ride home.

472
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,392
No way! I will not let Bit-na go alone.
I'll come with you.

473
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,061
No, you're not. You're coming with me.

474
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,397
-Ew!
-Of course, I'm going with you.

475
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,357
You can go.

476
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,443
Hey. Thanks for handling this.

477
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,404
Oh, you smell like alcohol.

478
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,155
Get our friend home safe

479
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,700
and send us a picture
when you drop her off, okay?

480
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,410
-Send us a picture.
-Okay. Go on.

481
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,412
-Bye!
-Stop that.

482
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,337
Hey, Bit-na.

483
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,965
Come on. Get up.

484
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,682
So who are you?

485
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,142
It's me. Come on.

486
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,396
Hop on.

487
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,947
What is it? Are you crying?

488
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,951
How can you do something
like that to me, you jerk?

489
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,162
No, don't you dare touch me!

490
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,873
I don't wanna be anywhere
near a liar like you.

491
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,374
What did I do?

492
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,378
You're too drunk to make sense.

493
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,881
Just get on my back, come on.

494
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,426
-You're a jerk.
-Ow!

495
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,554
-What's wrong with you?
-You said you hated mint chocolate!

496
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,598
All this time,
I thought you hated mint chocolate.

497
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,267
-But I guess you like her that much.
-What?

498
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,644
You're a big jerk.

499
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,397
And you said that
you wanted to go out with me.

500
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,193
I'm glad she dumped you
even after you ate mint chocolate for her.

501
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,986
That must suck for you.

502
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,197
Hey, who told you that? I wasn't dumped.

503
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,575
Get lost! I refuse to talk to a guy
who eats mint chocolate.

504
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,244
And what about you? You were
getting close with Mr. An, weren't you?

505
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,496
What? No, I wasn't.

506
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,165
You totally ignored me
at the bar last time?

507
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:40,044
Don't be ridiculous. You were
with another guy back then too. Right?

508
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,130
Fine. Whatever.

509
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,176
That's enough.

510
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,599
I didn't eat it because of her.

511
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,144
I tried it because I heard

512
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,605
that it's good for stress,
and it helps with insomnia.

513
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,524
But it didn't help at all.

514
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,736
I can hardly even sleep most nights
because of you.

515
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,781
That's nonsense!
Why would that be my fault?

516
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,201
Well, because…

517
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,039
I can't stop thinking of you.

518
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,377
What?

519
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,673
How could you be hitting on me right now?

520
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,971
Come here.

521
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,651
Stop crying.

522
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,280
We should get going. It's late.

523
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,616
Let's go.

524
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,035
Come on.

525
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,046
There you go.

526
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,799
Get on.

527
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,804
Okay.

528
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:21,604
Hey. I want you to stop seeing other girls
and just go out with me, okay?

529
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,023
What a way to ask me out.

530
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:27,193
Give me a break.
I've never asked anyone out before.

531
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,280
Do you really mean that
or are you taking this back tomorrow?

532
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,406
I don't know.

533
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,077
You know, I was wondering
what made you dye your hair like that?

534
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,414
You're already pretty.

535
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,709
Also, you should stop
drinking so much. Please.

536
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,086
I'm sure you know by now
how dangerous it can be

537
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,713
to get wasted like this late at night?

538
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,465
-Hey, stop it!
-What?

539
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:53,135
Everything coming out
of your mouth is just boring me to death.

540
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,262
But you're a damn good kisser.

541
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,973
So, I'm a good kisser, huh?

542
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,351
-Let's go.
-Hmm.

543
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,187
Let's go!

544
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,669
It's leaning towards the left.
Move it a little more.

545
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,254
A little more to the right.

546
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,172
-All right!
-Hey. Just a little more.

547
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,969
What? What's funny?

548
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,679
I find it so hard to believe.

549
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,514
How can you live
with that kind of pitiful--

550
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,432
Hey, stop it!

551
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,433
12TH HONGSEO GALLERY EXHIBIT
PRESENTATIONS

552
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,934
Oh, is anything wrong?

553
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,937
No, it's fine. Thank you for this.
It's looking good.

554
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,649
I'm only there till tonight.

555
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,192
Don't tell. Okay?

556
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,946
Really? But where will you go?
We both know you have no friends. I know.

557
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,574
Excuse me. Have you thought about
minding your own business?

558
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,160
-You know, Min-yeong, you could always--
-No, shut up.

559
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,911
I don't wanna ask my parents for help.

560
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,246
You can stay with me.

561
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,126
My roommate left for the military.

562
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,669
I actually have a spare room.

563
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,215
What… What are you suggesting?
That I live with you?

564
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,343
Just you and me?

565
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,719
That's crazy.

566
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,304
Why? What's the matter?

567
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,890
Lot of people know that countries do it,
you know.

568
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,478
Hmm. You're right, that's true.

569
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,314
Think about it, okay?

570
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,525
Whatever you paid at your old place,
that can be your rent.

571
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,446
The right side, you need to raise that.

572
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,739
Raise the right side.

573
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,366
My gosh.

574
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,785
He's too nice.

575
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,457
Hey. Are you nervous?

576
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,918
Way more than I thought.

577
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,047
Tell me something, Ji-wan.

578
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,217
Here. Do I look better with my hair up?

579
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,262
Um…

580
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,641
-I think they look the same.
-Of course.

581
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,393
Yeah. They're both pretty.

582
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,104
Oh. Do you have an assistant?

583
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,647
I heard the others talking,

584
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,692
and they were deciding
who they'd get as an assistant.

585
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,694
I don't.

586
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,405
But maybe I should've done that too.

587
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,323
Wait, what if nobody ends up volunteering?

588
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,951
-I'm sure that someone will.
-Hmm.

589
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,039
By the way, I ran into Sol.
She was looking for you.

590
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,541
Have you talk to her?

591
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,669
Oh, no, I haven't.
I don't wanna talk to her.

592
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,463
Why not? Did something happen?

593
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,050
You knew about it, didn't you?

594
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,928
You knew all along
she had decided to stay. Answer me.

595
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,304
No.

596
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,224
No, I, I didn't know that.
Did she say that?

597
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,308
You're lying to me.

598
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,522
I'm holding back
until she's done with her presentation.

599
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,734
That's why I've been I'm ignoring her.
Gosh, this has been driving me crazy.

600
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,319
Good thinking.

601
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,113
Just yell at her when she's done.

602
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,365
Does she have to be so annoying?

603
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,410
If she's treating me this way,
she shouldn't be calling me bestie!

604
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:50,539
She makes me feel like
maybe I'm obsessing over her too much.

605
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,252
I'll be going.

606
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,629
Fighting.

607
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,215
Fighting.

608
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,552
-You're the best, Na-bi.
-Thanks, Ji-wan.

609
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:31,121
I have to ace the presentation
and get an assistant.

610
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,915
I'm sure you'll do just fine,

611
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,793
but if you can't find one,
I can help you out.

612
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,795
I'm good
at taking orders, you know.

613
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,630
Are you sure?

614
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,882
I'll hold you to it. Promise me.

615
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,385
But what do I do if nobody volunteers?

616
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,264
I'm worried.

617
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,439
Do-hyeok, sorry. My friend's here.
Sorry, I have to go.

618
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,899
I'll call you later, okay?

619
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,486
What did you do that for?

620
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,737
'Cause I was jealous.

621
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,072
Hmm?

622
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,616
I think you look better with your hair up.

623
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,377
Are you still avoiding me?

624
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,379
You're one to talk.

625
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,341
You're the one who ignored me
when I ran into you, remember?

626
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,052
At the stairs?

627
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:29,680
Did that bother you?

628
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,391
I guess it worked, then.

629
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,812
Whatever.

630
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,566
Good luck today.

631
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,122
Welcome
to the Hongseo Gallery Exhibition.

632
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,915
Let us start the presentations.

633
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,375
Welcome.

634
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,215
There will be nine students
who will be representing on the stage.

635
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,468
When they're done, we'll be asking
for volunteers to assist them.

636
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,596
The volunteers will help them
finish their pieces.

637
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:14,099
The volunteer assistants will be with them
through the entire process

638
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,350
working with them until they're done.

639
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,645
And they will all be working together
from the start until the end.

640
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,273
They'll build the pieces together
until the day of the exhibit.

641
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,942
Since it's required for each piece
to be unique,

642
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,277
the faculty strongly advised

643
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,822
that each student have
at least two or three assistants.

644
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:29,781
That's it.

645
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,243
Uh, because there's a limit to the number
of volunteer students,

646
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,329
even if your piece calls
for more assistance,

647
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,539
you should just make do
with whatever you have.

648
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:41,668
The theme of my piece
is "observation of objects."

649
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,588
Through my piece,
I wanted to be able to showcase

650
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,965
the depth of genuine human desire.

651
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,680
I'm Yun Sol.
I'm from the Department of Sculpture.

652
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,474
HONGSEO GALLERY EXHIBIT PRESENTATION

653
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:58,894
The primary theme of my piece is "union."

654
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,606
The main material that I want to use
are railway sleepers.

655
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,734
I've always been attracted
to its rigid structure and durability.

656
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,403
I believe it's the perfect material
for my piece.

657
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:12,366
I decided that I will also emphasize
on the material's natural flaws.

658
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,451
Like the oil stains made over time.

659
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,120
With all that,
I want to make the material…

660
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,960
exude beauty.

661
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,379
Thank you.

662
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,591
You're the best, Yun Sol!

663
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,221
You did great.

664
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:40,477
From the Department
of Sculpture, up next, we have Yu Na-bi.

665
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,861
Hi, everyone, my name is Yu Na-bi.

666
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,072
The theme I chose for my piece is…

667
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,285
Uh…

668
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:03,083
The theme I chose for my piece
is called yeoji.

669
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,628
These Chinese characters
mean "left over" and "land".

670
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:10,132
Used together, the characters refer
to an empty area of land.

671
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:14,052
It eludes the possibility or the hope
for something happening.

672
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:19,057
Cho Seong-sik from Sculpture,
with his piece "coexistence."

673
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,310
Raise your hand
if you volunteer as assistant.

674
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,645
Me, I wanna do it.

675
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,273
-I volunteer too.
-I'd like to volunteer.

676
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:30,027
Now, Cho Seong-sik.
Do you accept them as assistants?

677
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,445
-Yes.
-Come on up.

678
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,666
Yu Na-bi from Sculpture
with the piece yeoji.

679
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,544
Who would like to volunteer
to assist Na-bi? Raise your hands.

680
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,799
You?

681
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,645
Ooh!

682
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:11,777
So, Na-bi, will you take
Jae-eon here as assistant?

683
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,450
Yeah.

684
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,329
-All right. If that's everyone--
-Me!

685
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,706
I want to volunteer.

686
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:27,709
Will you accept Hwang Jin-su
as your assistant?

687
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,794
Yes, sir, I'll accept.

688
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,337
Yes!

689
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,633
All right. Come on up.

690
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,779
All right.
Make sure you all agree on work schedules

691
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:59,616
and carefully discuss with your assistants
all the materials that you need

692
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,118
before we wrap this up.

693
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,871
You can check our school website
for the uploaded report format.

694
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,040
-Don't forget.
-Okay.

695
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,041
Good job.

696
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,377
Thank you!

697
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,713
You tied your hair.

698
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,382
Yeah.

699
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,884
It was getting hot.

700
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,221
So are you sure about this?

701
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,098
What do you mean?

702
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,433
You really don't have to do this,
you know.

703
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,602
Why not? We could have a lot of fun.

704
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,521
I really like your ideas.

705
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,314
And I think they're amazing
and interesting.

706
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,150
You know, to work with metal.

707
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:40,157
Honestly, I've never worked with metal
as a medium. I'm new to this.

708
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,283
I'll help you with that.

709
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,201
That's what assistants are for.

710
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,581
Should I not help?

711
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,127
It's not that at all. It's… just…

712
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,211
What?

713
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,046
Truth be told that
I'm embarrassed that

714
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,424
I can't believe
you actually like my piece.

715
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,800
-Hard to imagine.
-Na-bi.

716
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:03,763
Thanks for having me.

717
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,807
Thanks too.

718
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,642
We'll make a great team.

719
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,146
I think so too.

720
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,277
Yeah. Me too.

721
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,038
Thanks for volunteering to assist.

722
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,250
The materials.

723
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,550
Oh! Are you guys both free tonight?

724
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,512
Drinks to celebrate our team?

725
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,389
I know a great metal working studio.

726
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,600
Wanna go?

727
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,228
Got it.

728
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,525
Ooh. Oh…

729
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,348
JAE-EON

730
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:44,823
Come in.

731
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,374
There's no one here. What is this place?

732
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,543
The owner's already gone home.

733
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,630
He lets me use this studio,
once all the work for the day is done.

734
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,674
I live upstairs.

735
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:04,676
Oh.

736
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,847
I didn't know you were this hardworking.

737
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,474
Don't you get tired at all?

738
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,018
I still got a lot to learn.

739
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:17,063
It's impressive. His passion.

740
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,656
Sorry, I'll be about
30 minutes late. See you later.

741
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,701
Jin-su's going to be late.

742
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,453
Have a seat.

743
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,845
-You want a drink?
-Sure.

744
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,446
It's been a while since we last talked.

745
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,573
Really? It hasn't been that long.

746
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,248
What?

747
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,087
That night with the police…

748
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,508
I'm sorry.

749
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,719
You didn't deserve that.

750
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,681
-Now you're sorry?
-You were right, you know.

751
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,892
I crossed the line.

752
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,231
And when people end up
crossing a certain line,

753
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,901
it might end up not seeing
how it hurts others.

754
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,529
But now…

755
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,532
I'm totally ready to change.

756
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,246
I shouldn't read
too much into this.

757
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:00,542
What kind of changes? Like dating again?

758
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,295
I'm not sure.

759
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:09,384
I'll work on the changes bit by bit.

760
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,095
And then maybe who knows?

761
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,347
I could meet my soulmate one day.

762
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,686
I'll be rooting for you, then.

763
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,314
But I hope you mean it this time.

764
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,016
You can adjust the fire

765
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,854
by turning this knob right here,
just like this.

766
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,156
Be careful. It gets really hot.

767
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,993
You just work going outward, all right?

768
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,794
Start here,
and straighten it, bit by bit.

769
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,302
-It's not working.
-Hit harder.

770
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,481
-You see that?
-Whoa.

771
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:53,279
-It's like that.
-Oh, it's getting flat. It's working.

772
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,198
Mm-hm. That's so much better.

773
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,876
Weird. Jin-su said he'd be
30 minutes late, but he never showed up.

774
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:12,507
So what do you think about metal working?
Not too hard, right?

775
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,092
Mm.

776
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,011
I can do better with more practice.

777
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,680
Feel free to call me
anytime you wanna work.

778
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,474
-I'm sure you'll make a masterpiece.
-Don't mock me.

779
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,892
I'm not mocking you.

780
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,143
I like your pieces.

781
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,355
Especially this one. It's awesome.

782
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,402
I'm surprised. I didn't know
you liked it that much.

783
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:36,322
I should go.

784
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,076
Na-bi, wait.

785
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,417
That's my new number.

786
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,678
See ya.

787
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,650
MISSED CALLS, SEOL-A

788
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,134
-Hey, Seol-a.
-Hmm.

789
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,469
Were you waiting for me?

790
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,639
No, no.

791
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:45,600
Don't worry, I was just calling
'cause I wanted to say,

792
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,226
sorry, I can't make it today.

793
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,520
-That's a relief.
-Were you busy?

794
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,315
Just a little bit.
I was working.

795
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,651
Okay.

796
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,695
It's cool. Forget it.

797
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,211
I like your pieces.

798
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,505
Especially this one.

799
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,132
It's awesome.

800
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:13,331
So is it in the process of collapsing

801
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,124
or is it coming together?

802
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,252
It's open to interpretation.

803
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:25,885
It's good.

804
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:29,806
Good job.

805
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,099
I'm happy to see that
Na-bi is back with us again.

806
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:33,935
Thank you, ma'am.

807
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:37,355
It's so cool. Just days ago,
there was nothing there.

808
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,861
So, Bit-na, when are you
showing me yours? Hmm?

809
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,784
You might wanna focus on your work, right?

810
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:52,328
Bit-na,
I wanna see your work. Okay?

811
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,580
Where is she going?

812
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:56,582
So good.

813
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,800
Keeper, do your job!

814
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,231
Look at Jae-eon.
He seems different now.

815
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,733
It's like he's lighter somehow.

816
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,361
Yeah, something's changed about him.

817
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,488
I heard he's been avoiding girls.

818
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,657
I wonder what's going on with him.

819
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,326
Do you know if he's dating anyone?

820
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:36,247
Oh! Will we ever understand the life
of a good-looking guy?

821
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:38,708
-Good game.
-Good game, guys.

822
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,669
What's wrong with him?

823
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,255
-You have more?
-Mm.

824
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:46,382
-Here. Then you can play.
-For you.

825
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,176
You should try this, you know.
I think you'll like it.

826
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,428
Okay.

827
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:03,107
-You wanna put wings on it?
-Mm.

828
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:07,403
Although I'm not sure what shape
I'll be going with just yet.

829
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,993
I think I'm gonna print this one.

830
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,856
FOR REFERENCE

831
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,275
I really wish
I could see their work in person.

832
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,736
-Well, it is possible.
-How?

833
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:52,448
The artist will have an exhibit.
It opens next week.

834
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:53,574
You wanna go?

835
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,286
Sure. Let's go.

836
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,829
Hey, Jin-su, get up.

837
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,585
He's asleep again.

838
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:07,922
Our relationship
took an unexpected turn,

839
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,383
and within our friendly relationship,

840
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,843
I was finally able to find
some peace of mind.

841
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,848
Yup, I'm here.

842
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:19,809
Just because.

843
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,482
I was thinking of cutting my hair.

844
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,693
I didn't go to a salon in the States,

845
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,153
so now my hair is a big fat mess.

846
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,991
Really? So should I cut it shorter, then?

847
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,954
I guess I could. Tomorrow then.

848
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:41,288
See you.

849
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,547
Oh. I'll get it.

850
01:06:58,639 --> 01:06:59,640
Thank you.

851
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,106
Wait, hold on. Are you Yu Na-bi?

852
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,316
Do… I know you?

853
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,361
Jae-eon said you were a friend
in the same department.

854
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:14,947
Ah.

855
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,365
Right.

856
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,785
Uh, sorry to ask.
Are you here to see Jae-eon?

857
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,289
Yeah. I came all the way here
just so I can see him.

858
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:26,917
He's probably really busy
'cause we have a lot of work to do.

859
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,210
Really?

860
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,713
He told me he'd come to meet me.

861
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:32,089
That really sucks.

862
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:40,097
Hello, Jae-eon.

863
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,558
Oh, really?

864
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:45,770
It's all right. Take your time.

865
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,898
I don't smoke that much.

866
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,151
Yeah, sure. No problem.

867
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,199
Excuse me.

868
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,826
What exactly is your relationship
with Jae-eon?

869
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,287
You could say we used to go out.

870
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,540
Ah.

871
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:12,046
But lately…

872
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,133
we've been hanging out together again.

873
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:27,728
Listen. Are you just really friends
with Jae-eon? Answer me.

874
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,072
Yeah. We're just friends.

875
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:40,449
That's a relief.

876
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,452
I was beginning to get worried
I said too much.

877
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:55,798
You know what…

878
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,676
don't cut your hair.

879
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:00,761
What?

880
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,472
It's Jae-eon.

881
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:06,100
He likes it doing with your hair tied.

882
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:05,784
Close enough to be with her
and keeping enough distance,

883
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,620
cannot risk ever hurting her.

884
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,914
It's Jae-eon.
He likes it doing with your hair tied.

885
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,625
-So Na-bi is not coming?
-Of course, it was.

886
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,084
She just disappeared.

887
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,587
Isn't that
what you've always hated?

888
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,380
Clingy girls all over you.

889
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,090
I just wanna
be assured of what we have.

890
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,551
So what should one do
to be certain of that?

891
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,720
If I knew you were coming,
I would have done otherwise.

892
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:27,223
You see, truth is,
I've always wanted to come here. Really.

893
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,557
-Cheers!
-So now,

894
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,893
can you honestly say
that it's over with him now?

895
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:32,728
It must be
somebody you really like.

896
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,396
Well, no, just someone annoying.

897
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,941
I know very well that a person
who can't love himself

898
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,859
and can't love someone else
can never be happy.

899
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:41,153
-You're coming here?
-How are you?

900
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,655
I'm Park Jae-eon.
