1
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,062
You taste like cigarettes.

2
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,610
Should I go brush my teeth first?

3
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,320
What? I…

4
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,823
The others must be waiting. Let's go back.

5
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,577
I can't believe I did that.

6
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:14,843
EPISODE 3: IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN.
NEVERTHELESS,

7
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,035
What is this I'm feeling right now?

8
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,422
Could I actually be in love with him?

9
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,176
Or did I do that 'cause I was jealous?

10
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,192
I'm telling you,

11
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,110
there's something going on
with Na-bi and Jae-eon.

12
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,403
You think?

13
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,906
Last night, they took off,
just the two of them, alone.

14
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,701
And something must have happened
in the time they were gone.

15
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,828
She had this look on her face.

16
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,624
Then early this morning, I saw them
by the door, whispering to each other.

17
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,293
I couldn't really make out
what they were saying.

18
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,711
And no one else saw?

19
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,172
Mm, and I didn't tell Bit-na. I mean, duh!

20
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,423
Good thinking.

21
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,883
Where is the food?

22
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,593
I'm starving.

23
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,178
Yay, noodles.

24
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,515
It looks so good!

25
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,059
-There you go. Enjoy.
-You bet. Thanks.

26
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,228
Hey, don't say anything to Na-bi.

27
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,854
Of course not. Duh!

28
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,648
I really love this. I'm gonna take one.

29
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,526
Mm!

30
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,902
Mm.

31
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,449
You think it's okay, though?

32
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,034
What is? Your waistline?

33
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,121
Shut up! Na-bi, I mean.

34
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,833
You know I get it. She must be having
a really tough time getting over her ex.

35
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,793
But if she keeps hanging out
with that guy,

36
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,545
people are gonna start talking.

37
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,297
Park Jae-eon.

38
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,840
She should just stay away from him.

39
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,841
Really?

40
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,262
I mean, at least compared to her ex,
he's actually an improvement.

41
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,098
What? You think so? But why?

42
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,018
Hmm.

43
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,854
I don't know. Just a feeling.

44
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,981
They'd make a cute couple.

45
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,903
Got too drunk

46
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,113
and kissed…

47
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,906
RECENT SEARCHES
KISSING SOMEONE BEFORE DATING

48
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,617
I GOT DRUNK AND KISSED MY FRIEND
WHO I HAVE NO FEELINGS FOR

49
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,912
I MADE A MISTAKE WHILE DRUNK
EVERYONE THINKS WEIRDLY OF ME

50
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,123
I GOT DRUNK AND KISSED MY FRIEND
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

51
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,251
WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT THE KISS AFTER,
BUT WAS IT JUST A DRUNKEN MISTAKE?

52
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,754
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
ONCE YOU'VE TOUCHED FIRST BASE

53
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,922
YOU'LL END UP BECOMING SP
OR DRIFTING APART

54
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,924
"SP"?

55
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,429
"SP"? What is that?

56
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,058
"Sex partners"?

57
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,393
Na-bi.

58
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,438
You startled me.

59
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,898
What were you just looking at?

60
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,817
Just some references.
You know, for class and stuff.

61
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,615
Hey, Sol.

62
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,078
If you were into someone, and let's say
that you wanted to kiss them,

63
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:14,957
does that also mean that you're actually
wanna sleep with that person?

64
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,252
Hang on. Is this about me?

65
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,130
Or about you?

66
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,341
Huh? What?

67
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,177
No, not me. Definitely not about me.

68
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,220
Nope.

69
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:32,183
Just everyone. People in general,
you know. I'm just curious.

70
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,895
'Cause it might be a concept I could use.

71
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,147
Hard to say.

72
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,484
I guess it depends who you're kissing.

73
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,570
Interesting.

74
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,525
SEOL-A

75
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,987
I just got on the plane!

76
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,119
One night…

77
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,248
Hard to say.

78
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,376
It depends who you're kissing.

79
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,961
Why does that matter?

80
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,422
Well, sometimes,
you may want to kiss someone

81
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,548
and have sex with them too.

82
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,301
And there are other times,
there are people you kiss

83
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,594
who don't mean anything to you.

84
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,848
So there, it really depends
who you're kissing.

85
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,933
So the question is…

86
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,936
what do I really mean to him?

87
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,148
ONE-NIGHT STAND?

88
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,168
PARK JAE-EON

89
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,546
SHOULDN'T WE TALK ABOUT YESTERDAY?

90
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,049
Am I gonna sound too clingy?

91
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,311
Hey, guys.

92
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,313
-Hey.
-What's up, guys?

93
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,565
Hey, what's up, Na-bi?

94
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,692
-Just sit already.
-Oh.

95
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,362
Ugh! My phone's dead again.
I should just get a new one.

96
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,572
Where's Ji-wan?

97
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,657
She's out with someone.

98
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,367
-What are you doing?
-Charger, please.

99
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,744
She's at the movies
with some guy, a blind date.

100
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,538
She doesn't really care about school.

101
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,374
All right. Let's see…

102
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,627
I really wanna know.

103
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,421
But what I should say?

104
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,841
How can I get Jae-eon
to tell me how he really feels about me?

105
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,885
You really like that guy
you swept right on?

106
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,679
-Hmm.
-You don't seem too excited right now.

107
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,138
Do you do a happy little dance

108
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,891
whenever you're liking a post of a girl
you're interested in?

109
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,060
Of course not,
but that's totally different.

110
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,607
I mean, come on,
why would you even sleep with someone

111
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,861
if you're not… going out with them?

112
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,072
Don't you find it all meaningless?

113
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,657
Oh, give me a break!

114
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,159
You know women can choose to have sex
just 'cause they want to.

115
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,119
Lighten up, grandpa.

116
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,996
-Hey, would you watch your mouth.
-Take it easy. Keep your voice down.

117
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,539
Someone might hear you so cut it out.

118
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,083
Well, I'm not saying anything wrong.
In fact, I can say it even louder!

119
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,668
Well, should I?

120
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,503
Class starts now.

121
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,089
Okay, settle down, everyone.

122
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,926
Hey, Professor.

123
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,636
-Hi, Professor.
-Hello.

124
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,394
You've gotta try this.

125
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,355
You're not with that girl
you're usually with today.

126
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,732
Yeah. She had other plans.

127
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,984
To be young and free.
I'll be back with your food.

128
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,486
Okay, great. Thank you. Make ours large.

129
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,738
Mm-hm.

130
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,240
You must be a regular here.

131
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,826
Yeah. My friend loves this place.

132
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,455
And actually, it's a popular spot
in this neighborhood.

133
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,291
When I was in school,
the hottest spot was Danpunggol.

134
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,294
-Oh. So you went to school here?
-Yeah.

135
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,629
Economics major.

136
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,256
-Graduated two years ago.
-Oh.

137
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,556
Well, sorry again
for what happened last time.

138
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,933
I estimated how much it would cost.

139
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,311
So, just let me know if it's not enough.

140
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,979
Just forget it. It's fine.

141
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,232
I mean it. It's okay. Keep it.

142
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,575
This really isn't why I asked you
to meet me.

143
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,036
What? So why did you then?

144
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,875
Okay. Here you go.

145
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,961
Careful now, it's hot. Enjoy, guys.

146
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,129
Great. Thank you.

147
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,217
-What? Something wrong?
-You're a lot stronger than you look.

148
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,885
You work out or something?

149
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,221
Well, I'm a sculpture major.

150
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:24,225
So, I'm always working with my hands,
molding clay. That's probably why.

151
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,651
You can just pay for lunch.
Then, we'll call it even.

152
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,611
No, please. Look.

153
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,907
-I would still feel bad. It's not enough.
-Hmm. How about…

154
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,868
-you buy me coffee, too?
-And maybe something for dessert?

155
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,705
-You're on.
-Mm.

156
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,581
-Like this, Professor?
-Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

157
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,291
-Is this right?
-Yeah. Keep it up. Good.

158
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,376
-Thanks, Professor.
-Okay.

159
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,469
That's all for today, everyone!

160
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,638
Thank you, ma'am.

161
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,474
Guys! Look at that.
It's so nice out today.

162
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,143
Perfect weather for a date.

163
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,270
Can't argue with that. Right?

164
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,523
Listen. I'm serious, okay?

165
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,400
Don't tell me you guys are all single.

166
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,485
Come on, guys. At your age,

167
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,822
all of you should have had at least
one serious relationship by now. Hmm?

168
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,490
Don't buy all that nonsense
you've been told

169
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,951
about great art
being born out of loneliness.

170
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,494
If you want real inspiration,

171
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,080
you'll only get it once you know
what it's like to be in love.

172
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,374
I'm sick of hearing all this crap.

173
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,251
I thought she said class was over?

174
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,170
Love is the only thing in the world

175
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,131
that can take even the roughest person
alive and transform them,

176
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,049
make them finer
than the smallest grain of sand.

177
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,470
I can't believe you guys, huh.

178
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,930
You guys are art majors. Be inspired.

179
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,515
That's the key to true art.

180
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,353
Hey, let me tell you something
one student told me. Hmm?

181
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,773
He said that he doesn't do relationships.

182
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,733
Sure, he'll flirt and even date,

183
00:12:56,233 --> 00:13:00,571
but basically, he just wants to have fun,
no commitment, no promises, nothing. Hmm?

184
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,240
Then, he should just have
one-night stands. Right?

185
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,743
Don't you guys think that's sad?

186
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,495
Tragic.

187
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,582
So be inspired.
Keep looking for inspiration, okay?

188
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,001
-That's what art's about.
-Yes, ma'am.

189
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,503
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

190
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,214
-Bye, everyone.
-Thank you for today, ma'am.

191
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,894
PARK YE-SONG, KIM SEO-YEON, LEE YE-HWA

192
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,020
YU NA-BI

193
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,028
I'M BUYING ART SUPPLIES.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

194
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,870
Hi, Jae-eon.

195
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,959
Welcome back.

196
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,127
You look hotter than I remember.

197
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,219
So I guess you liked it then.

198
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,556
Yeah, I did. It was so much fun.
Better than I expected.

199
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,267
-I wanna watch it again with my friend.
-With your friend?

200
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,979
-It's not a guy, right?
-No. It's a girl, of course.

201
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,606
Her name's Sol. We've been BFFs
since middle school.

202
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,733
I think she'll like it, too,
so I want her to see.

203
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,193
-Hmm.
-I'll watch it with her.

204
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,738
Ji-wan, I have an idea.

205
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,658
If it's all right with you,
we could watch it again.

206
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,827
Yeah. Sure, why not.

207
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,621
But you didn't seem to have enjoyed it
as much as I did.

208
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,582
That's not true. I enjoyed it too.

209
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,503
-I guess, it just wasn't what I expected.
-What do you mean?

210
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,922
Well, I thought it could be about romance,

211
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,008
but it was more about friendship.

212
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,677
Oh. You think so?

213
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,264
I thought it was pretty clear about love,
you know. At least for me.

214
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,391
But I get it
how you might think otherwise.

215
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,019
-Still, I thought it was good.
-Mm.

216
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,981
So anyway, you hungry?
We could grab a bite.

217
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,025
Oh, that sounds good. I could eat a horse.

218
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,321
I said I was buying lunch.
Why'd you pay for it?

219
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,992
I gave it some more thought,
and it's not enough to call things even.

220
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,953
I figured you'd say that.

221
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,795
Buy me lunch next time?

222
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,381
I'd really love to see you again.

223
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:26,842
Why?

224
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,554
I like listening to you
talk about your arts,

225
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,513
so I wanna hear more.

226
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,100
-You ate a lot. Hmm. Oh.
-I always do.

227
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,311
Oh! That's Sol.

228
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,271
She's the friend
that I was telling you about.

229
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,189
That's funny.

230
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,483
I've always thought
that I pretty much suck at small talk.

231
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,194
Well, you're wrong. You held my interest.

232
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,572
I wonder who that is.

233
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,407
Where are you headed now?

234
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,576
Oh, just here.
I'm gonna catch the bus.

235
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,788
-I'll wait with you.
-No, I'm good. You really don't have to.

236
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,292
Wanna go over there and say hi?

237
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,961
Uh, no, it's okay.

238
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,881
You two must be really close.

239
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,092
Yeah.

240
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,386
Let's go.

241
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,683
SCULPTURE STUDIO 3
HONGSEO UNIVERSITY

242
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,716
I'm starving.

243
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,182
Big surprise. Still no word from Jae-eon.

244
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,649
I wish I knew if he was toying with me
or just doesn't care.

245
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,652
Doesn't matter either way.

246
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,113
This sucks.

247
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,832
Fine, I'll admit it.

248
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,211
I can't take my eyes off him
whenever he's around.

249
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,505
I can't help myself.

250
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,689
What's up, Seol-a?

251
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,901
I had a feeling it was you.

252
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,904
Wait for me. I'll be right over.

253
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,681
Who the hell is Seol-a?

254
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,018
Seol-a.

255
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,902
Sorry, I took so long.

256
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,362
It's cool. No biggie.

257
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:16,947
Who is she?

258
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,906
Wanna get a drink?

259
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,449
-Okay.
-And why does she make you smile

260
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,868
-like that?
-Let's go.

261
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,632
You're so pathetic, Na-bi.

262
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,385
You're starting to sound like a stalker.

263
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,894
I could just tell right away.

264
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,981
She's the one.
The girl Jae-eon's in love with.

265
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,403
Good evening, ma'am.

266
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,447
Oh. Hey, Na-bi.

267
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,911
Uh, I sat next to you last night.

268
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,621
You took my water, remember?

269
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,581
Oh, that's my water.

270
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,421
Oh, right. Yeah, you're a freshman.
It's Kang Eun-han, right?

271
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,048
Close enough. Kim Eun-han.

272
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,258
You're not too good with names, are you?

273
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,886
Sorry. Last night's kind of a blur.

274
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,095
So you work here, huh?

275
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,223
Yeah. Just part-time. I'm still kinda new.

276
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,600
-Hmm.
-Did you have fun last night?

277
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,812
I wanted to stay and hang out,
but I had to come here.

278
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,857
It's kinda late for dinner, isn't it?

279
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,859
I know, but I got caught up
in my assignment.

280
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,571
Well, in that case,
I was saving this for later,

281
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,615
but I think you should have it.

282
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,909
Oh. No, I couldn't.
You should hang on to it.

283
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,285
No, it's yours.

284
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,579
Go on. Please, take it.
I want you to have it.

285
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,414
Thank you.

286
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,833
Thanks again for this.
Well, have a good shift.

287
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,168
Na-bi.

288
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,087
Uh, could I borrow your phone?

289
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,257
-Borrow my phone?
-Yeah.

290
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,935
Do you know them?

291
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,063
You've been staring at them.

292
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,483
I know he's a freshman.
I guess he works there.

293
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,734
What about her?

294
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,198
Is she a freshman, too? Like he is?

295
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,117
That's my number.

296
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,202
-Talk to you later.
-Okay.

297
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,913
She's not. She's a senior.

298
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,292
We're friends. Sort of.

299
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,382
-Well, bye.
-Mm. Take care.

300
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,925
-See you around.
-Good night. See ya.

301
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,642
You still have that, huh?

302
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,188
-Where is yours?
-Mine?

303
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,151
I lost it. Can't even remember when.

304
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,570
Oh.

305
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,196
That's disappointing.

306
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,951
Your butterflies, they still doing good?

307
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,202
Mm-hm.

308
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,123
But I'm gonna set them free soon.

309
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,333
Why?

310
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,210
I feel guilty keeping them cooped up.

311
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,298
I mean, they're supposed to be free,
and they're not…

312
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,050
'cause of me.

313
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,012
You've really grown up.

314
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,600
That girl just now…

315
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,520
Her name's Na-bi.

316
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:41,401
So you haven't grown up.
You just found a new butterfly.

317
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,111
It's not like that.

318
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,655
She's a friend. That's all.

319
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:48,950
You're a bad liar.

320
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,120
Even her name means butterfly.

321
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,498
Is she your destiny?

322
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,291
Of course not.

323
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,252
I only have one. You, silly.

324
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,050
THE GRANDSON
OF THE NOODLE SHOP OWNER

325
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,399
NEW MESSAGE FROM KIM EUN-HAN

326
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,234
What's up, Na-bi?

327
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,860
It's me Eun-han from just a while ago.

328
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,987
I can't believe he texted right away.

329
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,698
Right. What's up?

330
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,992
Are you gonna come to the flea market?

331
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,536
I'll be helping out at our booth.

332
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,622
So maybe I'll just see you there
or at the after-party.

333
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,959
I really hope you can make it.

334
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,752
Yeah, sure.

335
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,131
Really? Great. I'll see you there!

336
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,430
I gotta admit, this feels kinda nice.

337
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,526
Oh, by the way,
what days don't you have class?

338
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,362
Oh. Jeez, that was totally nosy.

339
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,780
Sorry about that.

340
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,991
Well, good night then. I'll see you soon.

341
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,952
I have class every day, sadly.

342
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,079
Okay. Good night.

343
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,670
PARK JAE-EON

344
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,926
Hey, Jae-eon!

345
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,931
You can make glass art, too?

346
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,390
What are you working on?

347
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,476
Hmm?

348
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,312
-Oh, I'm making a suncatcher.
-Hmm.

349
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,773
Wow, it's really pretty.
Another butterfly.

350
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,983
You've got a thing for butterflies, huh?

351
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,990
Hey, are you sick?

352
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,909
Stay away from me.

353
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,745
Oh, I don't really know.
I don't feel too good.

354
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,958
Maybe it's 'cause you haven't gotten
your fix of Jae-eon.

355
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,000
You're in withdrawal.

356
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,544
What are you talking about?

357
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,879
I know that you two have stopped
hanging out.

358
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,339
So there's nothing? Zip?

359
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,093
I just don't think that we'd click.
That's all.

360
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,056
Well, that totally bums me out.

361
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,559
It's always the quiet ones
you really have to watch out for.

362
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,227
Why the heck are you bummed out?

363
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,231
'Cause obviously I wanted some drama.
It's such a drag here.

364
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,568
So you actually wanna watch me
go through hell

365
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,653
just for your entertainment, don't you?

366
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,406
Hey, chill out. It's not that serious.

367
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,324
And that night we were all at my place,

368
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,077
why'd you make us play
that stupid game and egged him on?

369
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,161
Egged him on?

370
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,207
Wait. Did something happen
between you guys that night?

371
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,512
Nothing happened
but that's not really the point.

372
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,847
The point is it's useless.

373
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,599
You saw what happened.

374
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,020
Na-bi, do you wanna know what it actually
takes for you to catch a big fish?

375
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,856
-Don't tell me it's patience, right?
-Hmm.

376
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,275
And he's not even a great catch.

377
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,818
You mean that?

378
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,030
Well, I don't know.
I mean, it depends, I guess.

379
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,907
You said he doesn't date.
You sure about that?

380
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,243
Hmm. As far as I know.

381
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,872
Why? Did he ask you out?

382
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:08,543
Well, no. It just seems like
he's seeing someone. I could be wrong.

383
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,795
Hi, Na-bi! How's it going?

384
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,255
-Hey there, girl.
-Hello.

385
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,550
Good. Hi, Eun-han.
Are you going for lunch?

386
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,635
Yeah.

387
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,178
All right then, enjoy!

388
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,471
Enjoy your lunch too!

389
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,555
Mm.

390
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,728
Hang on. Am I missing something here?

391
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,897
-Spill it.
-We've just been talking. That's all.

392
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,398
Hmm.

393
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,067
Why? Is there something wrong with him?

394
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,153
Oh, no. Well, at least as far as I know.

395
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,739
See that, I was right, Na-bi.

396
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,908
You put yourself out there,
and now they're lining up.

397
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,328
Though I do think
you could do better than him.

398
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,498
If you wanna play matchmaker,
leave me out of it.

399
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:51,252
So, you mean,
you seriously wanna go out with him?

400
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,796
Oh, I didn't say that.

401
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,841
Man, what a bummer.

402
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,268
Surprise!

403
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,355
Vitamins. You could use them.

404
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,941
Oh…

405
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,900
Thanks.

406
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,610
How is that coming along?

407
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,656
It sucks. I think
I can kiss the school goodbye.

408
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:20,782
No way.

409
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,659
You're way too good.

410
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,411
Oh, please. You don't know that.

411
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,204
I do. I do know that.

412
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,999
I know because I saw your piece
when I was here last year

413
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,251
for the entrance exam.

414
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,002
Wait. Last year?

415
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,214
Then, that would have been…

416
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,267
LOVE BY YU NA-BI

417
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,518
"Love"?

418
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,104
"Yu Na-bi."

419
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,317
-The one that was about love?
-Yeah.

420
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,821
That didn't go over well.
They said my work was repetitive.

421
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,990
Well, I loved it. I even took a picture.

422
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,533
Let see it.

423
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,661
Not many pieces show love as it really is.

424
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,829
Warts and all.

425
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,707
Most people present
that idealized version.

426
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,210
Now, where is it?

427
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,380
Right. It's on my old phone.

428
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,841
But hey, you could show it to me again.

429
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,551
I'll back up my photos this time.

430
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,511
Well, I…

431
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,763
Yeah.

432
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,598
I already threw it out.

433
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,434
Because it was inspired by my ex.

434
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,435
Really?

435
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:34,981
Thanks anyway.

436
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,608
For what?

437
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,570
To be honest, I'd given up on the piece
I was working on,

438
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,655
I thought I knew where it was going
but I didn't.

439
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,408
But you helped cheer me up.

440
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:53,458
Fine, I'll admit it. He is kinda cute.

441
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,003
But do me a favor and relax
when you're around me, okay?

442
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,004
You're always so stiff.

443
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,216
Well, it's not just you.
I'm like this with anyone older than I am.

444
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,509
Oh, really?

445
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,177
Well, okay then.

446
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,806
-Then I guess, it's no big deal.
-No. I can loosen up more.

447
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,808
Promise. Starting now.

448
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,185
-Okay.
-Okay.

449
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,814
So, everyone's saying this movie is great.
Have you seen it yet?

450
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,359
I haven't.

451
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,070
Actually, it's been a while
since I've gone to the movies.

452
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,780
You wanna go see this movie with me then?

453
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,535
-A rom-com?
-Yeah.

454
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,165
What's up?

455
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,875
Hey, good to see you.

456
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,963
Oh. Hi, Jae-eon.

457
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,174
What are you talking about?

458
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,594
Just this movie we're gonna see.

459
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,431
Unless maybe you wanna watch
something else?

460
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,643
-Oh…
-Dude.

461
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,645
Don't you think you're being fresh?

462
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,108
You barely know each other, right?

463
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,447
No. Not true.

464
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,283
He knows me better than you do.

465
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,705
This one sounds great.
I really like rom-coms.

466
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,124
Yeah. I mean, great.

467
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,876
Hey.

468
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,920
There's a lot of sex in this movie, right?

469
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,755
Well, that's even better then.

470
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,091
Let's watch it.

471
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,052
Right. Maybe you can pick up
some pointers.

472
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,137
Pointers from who?

473
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,763
The lead actor.

474
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,765
I hear he's a good kisser.

475
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,227
Na-bi's very particular, you see.

476
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,148
If you don't kiss her
exactly the right way, she'll dump you.

477
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,357
Outside. Now.

478
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,121
-What the hell was that?
-What was what?

479
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,457
All the talk about kissing.
What is it with you, huh?

480
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,209
I don't wanna play your games.

481
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,755
Oh, I'm playing games.
You're the one who pushed my hand away.

482
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,465
I didn't like you
putting your hand on my shoulder.

483
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,592
Stop acting like we're a thing, okay?

484
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,470
-Why are you so upset?
-I'm not upset! I'm calm!

485
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,559
I'm not upset at all.

486
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:21,481
You do realize I haven't heard from you
since that night. Right?

487
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,733
I haven't heard from you
since that night either.

488
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,734
So, what?

489
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,569
No big deal.

490
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,285
I'm sorry,
but I'm just not that kind of girl.

491
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,997
What's that supposed to mean?

492
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,668
I thought you like having fun.

493
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,629
Well, don't worry.

494
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,131
I'll back off from now on.

495
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,094
Good luck with Eun-han.

496
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,768
Thanks.

497
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,986
You… you left your phone.
I thought you might need it.

498
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,322
Oh. Thank you.

499
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,408
Na-bi.

500
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,450
Uh…

501
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,369
Still wanna watch that movie with me?

502
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:21,791
Yeah.

503
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,643
Na-bi.

504
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,687
You know, I really like your name.

505
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,063
I've always loved butterflies.

506
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,481
You're hungry, right?

507
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,860
The food's amazing here.
I know you'll love it. So dig in.

508
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,070
And honestly, I can tell
you're in a bad mood.

509
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,572
Eat. You'll feel better.

510
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,741
Believe me, this will cheer you up.

511
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,117
Okay, that's enough already.

512
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,748
-Have some water.
-Thank you.

513
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,916
Hey, wait. That's my water.

514
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,919
Hey, would you cut that out?

515
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,796
-I almost had you there for a second.
-Stop.

516
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,841
This is nice. A nice normal date.

517
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,718
No complications.

518
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,311
Look at me! Hang on!

519
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,188
Be careful.

520
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,606
Hey, what's that?

521
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,234
-"Miracle"?
-"Past"?

522
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,237
Wow! You got it! Whoa!

523
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,947
-It's open.
-Oh! It's open!

524
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,366
-Right.
-We can go. Oh, yeah!

525
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,745
Could you take our picture, please?

526
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,747
Thanks a lot, sir.

527
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,249
All right, ready? One, two…

528
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,295
Yeah. Make it a combo meal.

529
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,214
Which flavor would you like, sir?

530
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,007
Oh.

531
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,218
Um…

532
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:03,392
Eating out and watching
a movie together. Nice and normal.

533
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,603
The kind of date I've always wanted.

534
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,700
Come on, just one.

535
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,328
One, two, three.

536
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,334
It's a great photo.
I'll take one of you by yourself.

537
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,212
One, two, three.

538
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,924
Let's eat. Okay.

539
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,426
There.

540
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,557
I hope you like the food here.

541
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,855
Mm. It's so good.

542
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,231
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hm.

543
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,566
What gives?

544
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,318
Why do I still have this on my phone?

545
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,737
Na-bi.

546
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,575
I wasn't sure what kind of snacks
you wanted, so I got them all.

547
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,702
Oh. Great.

548
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:06,164
-Unless you want something else?
-No, it's fine. That's good. Thank you.

549
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,168
This one's my favorite.

550
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,422
I wonder if he'll always
keep treating me this way.

551
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,425
I was a loser who was always running away.

552
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:24,473
But I can't run away from you.

553
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,978
I like everything about you,

554
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,190
and I can't stop thinking about you.

555
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,402
I…

556
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,407
I love you.

557
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,709
Na-bi, is something bothering you?

558
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,047
No, nothing. I'm perfectly fine. Why?

559
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,926
Well, you've been acting kind of weird
since we were at the movies.

560
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,471
-So I thought maybe you didn't like it.
-Oh.

561
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,806
I just don't feel too good.

562
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,227
And come on, it was kind of cheesy, right?

563
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,937
You think so?

564
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,773
Well, I thought it was pretty good.

565
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:18,236
I mean, it made me wish
I could fall in love like that.

566
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,113
It really gave me
a different kind of rush!

567
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,163
Fine, I'll be honest.
I overheard you talking to Jae-eon.

568
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,376
Ah. You heard that, huh.

569
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,130
-Well, look, things between us--
-I know. It's all over now, right?

570
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,507
"It's all over"?

571
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,557
You should know
all he does is hurt people.

572
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,894
And you should never let anyone
take you for granted or hurt you

573
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,312
because you don't deserve that.

574
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,650
I know. I've been there before.
No one deserves that.

575
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,319
And most of all,
he's just not good enough for you.

576
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,491
All right.

577
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,870
Okay.

578
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,884
Sorry about that.

579
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,094
It's just I…

580
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,555
I felt a sneeze coming.

581
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,390
Forget it.

582
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,853
I swear I did! Eun-han!

583
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,843
I guess he's cute.

584
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,517
Are you here with someone?

585
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,852
You. You're cute.

586
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,407
But I don't feel the same spark
that I do with Jae-eon.

587
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,881

592
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,668
Wait. What do you mean?

593
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,461
You heard what I said, hmm.

594
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,965
Cough up the money. The landlord says
he's not gonna give you an extension.

595
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,716
Why are you springing this on me now?

596
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,553
You know, you really should've given me
a heads up about this

597
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,929
at least three months ago.

598
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,639
Yeah, whatever. Well, now you know, okay?

599
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,057
Wait a sec--

600
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,227
She did not!

601
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,979
That little…

602
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,689
What the hell?

603
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,364
-Hey, Na-bi!
-Come, milady.

604
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,783
Oh. Oh, wow, that's a great costume.

605
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,410
Thank you, fair maiden.

606
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,619
You'll swing by the booth, right?

607
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,996
You better.

608
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,249
No, thanks, I'm good.
Are you guys all set?

609
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,710
Yeah, probably.
Jae-eon's been helping out.

610
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,463
But my friends said they're coming,
so we might not have enough seats.

611
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,923
-You? You have friends?
-Of course, I do!

612
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,342
What are you gonna do?

613
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,886
Can you find a house in a month?

614
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,681
If I can't find a house, I'll rent
a small apartment or something.

615
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,475
Or crash with friend.

616
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,102
Now what are you gonna do
with all your stuff?

617
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,815
I don't know. I guess I'll just have
to rent a storage space.

618
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:29,111
How am I gonna do this?

619
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,405
Rent is so expensive around here now.

620
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,449
There's no way
I'll find a cheap place in time.

621
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,160
Oh, I'm so screwed!

622
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,954
Calm down. Whoa, whoa.

623
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,040
Hang on. How much did she say you owe?

624
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,710
-Hi, you two.
-Hello, hello!

625
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,836
-Hey.
-Good morning, guys.

626
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,796
We need more butane
and folding chairs too.

627
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,257
-Do you know where we can get some?
-Just check the club room.

628
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,675
-Oh.
-Oh, right.

629
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,886
Oh! Tell Sol not to come tonight.

630
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,680
Professor Lee is gonna be there.
She'll nag her again.

631
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,599
Huh? What would she nag her about?

632
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,975
So you don't know?

633
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,977
The exchange student program.

634
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,480
To be honest,
I'm tired of dealing with that too.

635
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,316
They are offering her a full scholarship,
and she's not gonna take it?

636
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,194
Doesn't she know people
would kill to be in her shoes?

637
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:13,280
It's not an easy decision
to make. Here.

638
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,700
-Exchange student what?
-What? You didn't know?

639
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,453
-No.
-But why not?

640
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,497
All the professors are gonna be there.

641
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,290
-Let's take these.
-Okay.

642
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,795
-See you later!
-Let's go.

643
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,967
What's going on?
We've got everything we need.

644
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,635
Let's go.

645
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,240
What are you doing here?

646
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:57,908
Nothing.

647
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,078
So are you going tonight?

648
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,371
You going to see Eun-han?

649
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,123
Huh?

650
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,458
You see, words been getting around
about the two of you.

651
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,794
-I know it all.
-Bit-na told you.

652
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,921
I'm happy for you.

653
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,590
I mean, I don't know him that well,

654
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,050
but I'm sure he's way better for you
than Jae-eon.

655
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,933
Listen, when the professor asked
to see you and Sol last time,

656
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,061
that was because
of the exchange program, right?

657
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,271
Mm…

658
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:31,859
It was.

659
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,613
I figured as much.

660
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,032
But Bit-na didn't hear about it
from Sol, either.

661
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,869
I'm sure that Sol wanted to tell you
before anyone else.

662
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,663
And me, I only knew
'cause I was there too.

663
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,540
I don't know.

664
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,210
I bet she kept it from me
because she knew I would be upset.

665
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,588
Did I ever tell you?

666
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,840
The only reason I got into art was her.

667
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,008
For real?

668
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,635
I never knew that.

669
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,597
She's always wanted to be an art major
since we were in middle school.

670
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,641
And I worked so hard to get in with her.

671
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:08,312
I guess I thought if I did my best,
I could at least keep up with her.

672
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,650
But I guess there are things
you're not cut out for.

673
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,277
I'm barely even passing my classes.

674
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,990
And now I'm not even sure
if I'll graduate.

675
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,120
I'm so jealous of her.

676
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,457
That kind of talent? It's really rare.

677
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,209
I know.

678
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,337
Some people are just gifted.

679
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,677
Let's go to the flea market.

680
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,179
Okay. Let's go.

681
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,389
Come on.

682
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,226
SCULPTURE DEPARTMENT FLEA MARKET

683
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,484
Everything okay?

684
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,407
-Yeah. All right.
-Okay, next two, go in.

685
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,784
I'm not into girls who are too skinny.
She's not my type.

686
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,916
He's not even paying.

687
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,710
Ugh! Yeah. I know, right?

688
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,628
It's not like he came over here
to help out.

689
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,672
-Yeah. And he's not even paying.
-You said it.

690
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,674
He just came here to watch us.

691
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:19,758
That looks good.

692
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,429
-Here you go. Enjoy.
-Sit beside me.

693
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,472
-I've been great. Thanks.
-Okay. Let's go.

694
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,390
Sorry. No.

695
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,809
What was that? Namaste?

696
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,729
-I should start using that, too.
-What would you ever use it for?

697
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,274
Hey, let's bounce.

698
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,942
Why? We just got here.

699
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,611
I can't stand all this noise,
and I hate crowds.

700
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,989
-There are no cute girls. Let's go.
-But there are--

701
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,616
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

702
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,119
Hey, look, they're leaving already.

703
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,787
-Well, thank God.
-Why did he go?

704
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,164
-Leaving so soon?
-Yeah, we are.

705
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,417
Hey, hey, hey. Great, they're gone.
Help serve the food.

706
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,545
Ugh! What kind of festival
doesn't serve drinks?

707
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,797
God, this is so totally lame.

708
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,092
He is one popular guy, isn't he?

709
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,762
-You must be so tired.
-Thank you. Thanks a lot.

710
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,639
-Can I get your number?
-No. Sorry.

711
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,308
Look at their stupid smiles.

712
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,018
Are you two together?

713
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,519
What? Of course not.

714
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,481
It was just a question.
Kids like you always date.

715
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,025
Oh, Professor, that's never gonna happen.
Trust me.

716
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,360
Don't say that
'cause you can never know for sure.

717
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,280
Ugh! No. No way.
Hey, Jin-su. Come over here.

718
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,324
Professor, please meet…

719
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,575
-What's up?
-Wait a sec.

720
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:30,662
That student over there,
that's Park Jae-eon, am I right?

721
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,331
-Yeah.
-That's right.

722
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,251
Yeah, that's right. I remember him.
He's very good at what he does.

723
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,212
Oh, wow.

724
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,632
-Anyway, I gotta go.
-Oh.

725
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,258
-You kids have fun, okay?
-Yeah.

726
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,259
Stay out of trouble.

727
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,677
-Okay.
-Be sure to clean up after.

728
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,845
Jin-su will walk you out.

729
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,013
-I'll escort you.
-Okay.

730
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,515
I got some work to finish,

731
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,682
so I'll get going, all right?

732
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,559
-Sure. Sure, no problem.
-See you later.

733
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,269
-Have a nice night.
-You too.

734
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,313
-Bye.
-Good night. Bye.

735
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,774
I'm so exhausted.

736
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,777
I thought she'd leave three hours ago.

737
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:06,240
So she really remembers Jae-eon
because he's good at what he does?

738
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,157
Yeah, whatever.

739
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,619
I bet the only reason she remembers him
is 'cause of the way he looks.

740
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,496
-Whoa! Where'd hell did you get this one?
-Oh!

741
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,081
We don't sell alcohol here.

742
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,833
At the convenience store. On the way over.

743
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,709
Just give me a break.

744
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,045
You're gonna be drinking
at the after-party, right?

745
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,588
Can't you wait till then?

746
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,592
You know what, I hate to tell you this,
but you nag me more than my mom.

747
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,263
If you get drunk tonight, dude,
I'm not gonna drag your ass home.

748
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,099
Hmm.

749
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,100
Ahh!

750
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,813
Let's go.

751
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,731
Oh, that looks good.

752
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,317
-Ji-wan, over here!
-Oh!

753
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,612
Hey! Wow, you guys got really good seats.

754
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,906
Why don't you sit with us?
I'll introduce you to them.

755
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,700
It's okay, I'm good. You guys have fun.

756
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,201
Well, if you get bored, give me a call.

757
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,703
Yeah, for sure.

758
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:53,787
Have fun tonight.

759
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,122
-See you.
-Thank you.

760
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,167
Have you guys been waiting long?

761
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,377
You should've called me.

762
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,920
This is really good.

763
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,506
Hey, you'll really love this, I swear.

764
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,430
Usually, there's this much.

765
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,766
But see, I added a bit more
'cause you seem to like it.

766
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,318
Eun-han.

767
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,033
You… you actually came.

768
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,411
Yeah. It's a great turnout, huh.

769
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,164
-Our department's the most crowded.
-Yeah, it's great.

770
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,458
Uh, so, you here with someone?

771
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,418
-Hmm?
-It's just… it's so crowded.

772
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,170
I didn't think it was gonna
get packed like this.

773
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,589
You can go somewhere else if you want.
I'll catch up with you.

774
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,841
Oh, no. I just came here
to hang out with you for a bit.

775
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,051
Like I promised.

776
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,639
Okay, sure.

777
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,640
Eun-han!

778
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,062
You almost done?

779
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,022
We wanna get drinks after this?

780
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,441
Hmm?

781
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,405
Uh, who's she? Y-Your friend?

782
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,575
Yeah, kind of. She's a senior.

783
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,747
Oh. Nice to meet you.

784
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,542
Yeah. Nice to meet you too.

785
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,797
So, uh, you guys go ahead
without me. I'll catch up later.

786
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,091
Oh, okay, sure.
Call me when you're done, okay?

787
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,342
-Hmm.
-Hmm?

788
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,933
-So see you then.
-Let me explain.

789
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,978
The thing is I've been
into her since high school

790
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,688
but back then, she turned me down.

791
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,564
Then yesterday, she called me.

792
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,989
I'm really sorry.

793
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,448
All right.

794
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,207
There she is.

795
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,252
-Let's start the game now. Se-hun?
-Okay.

796
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,170
-It's time to spin the wheel!
-Spin the wheel!

797
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,297
-Spin the wheel!
-Let's try that later.

798
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,092
Is it only for couples?

799
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,176
I don't think so.

800
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,096
By the way, that guy's into Sol, right?

801
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,723
Oh, let's check.

802
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,349
Is it right or wrong?

803
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,601
How am I supposed to know?

804
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,520
I swear he is.

805
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,606
I just mentioned we were Sol's friends,
and then he gave us so much food.

806
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,484
He and Sol aren't really that close.

807
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:32,029
You know, you guys
have always been inseparable.

808
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,613
Ever get sick of each other?

809
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,784
Well, we don't hang out like we used to.
At least not as much as before.

810
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,078
Right. I get it.
You've been dating a lot more.

811
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,581
-Spin the wheel! Spin!
-Let's spin the wheel!

812
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,292
You know, I feel sorry for that guy.

813
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,877
When Sol leaves for the US, man,

814
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,087
she'll have hot American guys
just lining up.

815
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,630
Don't you mean British?

816
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,799
In England, she'll have a European buffet!

817
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,593
Is she really going, though?
Do you know when?

818
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,386
Wait. How do you guys know?

819
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,221
What do you mean "how do we know"?

820
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,766
Can I have this one? Thank you.

821
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,852
Oh, there's Sol now!

822
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,353
And she's with someone.

823
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,521
Oh. Hey, Sol!

824
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,940
Hey, isn't he the guy
from the café the other day?

825
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,859
-Oh.
-Yeah, I think that's him.

826
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,361
Nice to meet you. I'm Ju-hyeok.

827
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,864
Hi. Nice to meet you.

828
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,616
Tell us, Sol. Your boyfriend?

829
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,326
No, he's not.

830
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,287
So you have just been going out then.

831
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,414
I had some business nearby,

832
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,416
and then I asked her
to show me around your school.

833
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,627
-Ahh…
-Come with us.

834
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,504
Couple's game! Let's play couple's game.

835
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,548
-It's game time, couple. Game time.
-Okay. Time for our next couple.

836
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,467
-So, who wants to play next?
-Sol, Sol.

837
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,886
-Sol!
-Hey, Sol. You guys wanna play?

838
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,138
So, uh…

839
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,390
Are you two a couple?

840
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,769
Ah! Well, this game's
just perfect for you.

841
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,687
-They look good together, right?
-Scoot over.

842
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,774
So just throw this dart, and then
you have to play the game it lands on.

843
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,734
It's as simple as that, okay?

844
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,027
-You take the shot?
-Hmm?

845
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,362
-You sure?
-Yeah.

846
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,363
Game over.

847
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,698
-You're no match for that guy.
-Hey.

848
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,326
Okay, you guys, it's game time now.

849
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,912
So, Se-hun, spin the wheel.

850
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,831
It's… it's time to spin the wheel.

851
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,291
And round it goes.
Round and round it goes.

852
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,336
Oh, you got the "Pop the Balloon"!

853
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,421
Great. That's the most exciting game
of all!

854
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,257
-What's that?
-Step right up, you two.

855
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,885
I can't believe Sol's here
with that guy. He's so dreamy.

856
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,554
I'm gonna put this balloon right here

857
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,638
-in the middle.
-What?

858
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:25,100
And then you guys squeeze together tight
and just pop it with your bodies.

859
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,727
If you pop the balloon in five seconds,
you win the game.

860
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,855
Okay, now get real close. Ready?

861
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,731
And go!

862
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,651
-Oh.
-Good job!

863
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,695
Congratulations, guys! You did it!

864
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,071
Okay. Take your prize.

865
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,865
-There's a prize?
-Yeah. You can choose any price you want.

866
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,992
Has Sol ever mentioned him to you?

867
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,828
Yeah, sorta.
She told me he's just a friend.

868
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,788
Sheesh… I'm not buying it.

869
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,791
Come on, just look
at the guy's face. He's into her.

870
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,669
Why else would he have come?
It's so obvious.

871
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,796
Maybe he just wanted to check things out.

872
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,800
Lucky Sol. Honestly, I'm so happy for her.

873
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,927
I mean, they always say
you'll find a good guy

874
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,929
after you've been single for a long time.

875
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,140
Yeah. It happens all the time.

876
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,018
-Honestly, it does.
-She told me they're just friends.

877
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,147
What is this for?

878
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,940
It's yours. You like that character.

879
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,068
I used to, but not anymore.

880
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,029
What's up with you?

881
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,824
I thought we were gonna hang out.
Why'd you bring a guy along?

882
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:23,909
Oh…

883
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,411
Uh…

884
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,206
Well…

885
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,960
Sorry. Uh, I didn't think you would mind.

886
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,671
You could have told me. If I'd known,
I would have brought someone too.

887
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,882
Did you two had fun
playing the couple's game?

888
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,470
I'm gonna smoke.

889
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,597
Hey, Ji-wan.

890
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,026
Lime?

891
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,904
I just think you're gonna like it.

892
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,449
-Really?
-Because at what you said at the club.

893
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,578
So you remember that?

894
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:24,427
So I know you're all exhausted.
Good job, everyone.

895
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,972
But right now,
it's time for the after-party,

896
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,390
so let's have lots of fun!

897
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,187
You're all getting wasted tonight!
You got that?

898
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,149
-Here you go, guys.
-That's what I came here for.

899
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:41,194
Oh!

900
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,133
Oh, this is torture.

901
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,442
I should get some medicine.

902
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,534
The thing is,
I've been into her since high school,

903
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:30,952
but back then, she turned me down.

904
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,538
Then yesterday, she called me.

905
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,248
I'm really sorry.

906
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,168
So I was just his rebound?

907
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,837
Whatever. I don't care anymore.

908
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,464
But then…

909
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,467
Then yesterday, she called me.
I'm really sorry.

910
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,096
Oh.

911
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,348
I'm mortified.

912
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:10,533
Who is this?

913
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,083
Yeah? Hello?

914
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,417
You busy?

915
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,295
Park Jae-eon?

916
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:23,963
Hang on.

917
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,299
Did you delete my number?

918
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,426
Uh…

919
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,104
What's up?

920
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,648
You don't sound too good.

921
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:43,942
Are you sick?

922
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,861
Yeah, I'm not feeling very well.

923
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,324
Okay, well, I'm near your place.

924
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,537
You are?

925
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,793
Why are you in the area?

926
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,337
A friend of mine lives nearby.

927
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,380
Okay.

928
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,340
You guys have fun.

929
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,550
Wait, Na-bi.

930
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,387
Hmm.

931
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,347
You wanna hang out?

932
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,853
Right now?

933
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,046
So cold.

934
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,887
Why don't they have any medicine here?

935
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,029
-Officer.
-The police are here.

936
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,322
Hello?

937
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,450
-Did someone get hurt?
-Did a crime happen here?

938
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,160
-Is there an accident?
-I know a student--

939
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,953
Excuse me, please. Coming through.

940
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:23,875
Hello?

941
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,543
Can you hear me in there?

942
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,545
Please hurry up,
I think something happened to her.

943
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,464
-Sir.
-Hurry. She could be hurt.

944
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,216
-Yes, sir.
-Let them do their job. Come on.

945
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,800
-Please hurry.
-Wait!

946
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:33,968
-Excuse me.
-Open it.

947
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,887
No, wait a minute, sir. Stop!

948
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,848
What are you doing? Who called you?

949
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,732
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

950
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,442
It's fine. We'll go now.

951
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,581
You know you overreacted, right?

952
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,125
Well, you totally freaked me out.

953
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,211
You said on the phone you were sick.

954
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,754
And you live all by yourself.

955
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:19,055
Oh, okay.
Well, as you can see I'm very much alive.

956
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:20,890
So good night.

957
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,725
Are you sure you're fine?

958
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,562
Yeah, I'm sure.

959
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,274
You're burning up. Come with me.

960
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,526
No. I told you, I'm okay.

961
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:32,443
Really.

962
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,154
I just need to get some sleep.

963
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:38,866
Good night.

964
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:01,889
Hey.

965
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,851
Let's go. Come on.

966
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,936
Everyone's gone already.

967
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,359
I'm gonna leave without you.

968
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,529
You need to get a hold of yourself.

969
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,990
Do you know what time it is?
We gotta go, man.

970
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,789
What are you doing?

971
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,377
-Come on, get up. We gotta go.
-Shh.

972
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,212
Just stop talking.

973
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,635
I never noticed before.

974
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,219
You're…

975
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,473
handsome up close.

976
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,556
Was I too harsh?

977
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:28,559
I wasn't.

978
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,687
I did the right thing.

979
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:34,232
I should get some sleep.

980
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,864
Who is it?

981
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,162
Can I come in?

982
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,124
Oh, sure.

983
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,214
All of the pharmacies were closed.

984
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,841
I went to a convenience store.

985
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,387
There's medicine and food.

986
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,765
Oh. Thank you.

987
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,768
Get some more rest. Good night.

988
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,688
You really came back here
just to give me this?

989
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,398
Wait, Jae-eon.

990
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,360
I don't want this.

991
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,320
Take it back.

992
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,287
I am pretty hungry.

993
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,208
It's really late.
You still haven't eaten yet?

994
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,795
I wasn't that hungry
'cause I was around food all day.

995
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,048
But now, I'm starving.

996
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:52,810
Well, if you want to, before you head
back home, you can eat here first.

997
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,610
Mm.

998
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:02,737
That was good. It hit the spot.

999
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,074
I haven't had real food in ages.

1000
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,035
Well, you can thank my aunt for that.

1001
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,870
Is this the same aunt who named you?

1002
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:13,831
Mm.

1003
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:19,462
You must be sleepy.

1004
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,548
Hmm. It must be the medication.

1005
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,467
I can't keep my eyes open.

1006
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,929
-Go on, lie down.
-I'm fine.

1007
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:30,223
I'll sleep once you're gone.

1008
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,684
Well, since I ate your food,

1009
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,355
let me give you a hand.

1010
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,690
What? Hey.

1011
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:42,360
What are you doing? Hey, stop! No!

1012
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:45,947
Put me down. Come on.

1013
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,325
Wait! Careful.

1014
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:11,556
Okay.

1015
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,516
Mm.

1016
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:15,935
"There was a boy

1017
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,979
who worked in the small store
on the edge of the town.

1018
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:21,148
And each day, he would wait,
hoping the girl would drop by."

1019
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,318
What the heck are you doing?

1020
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,070
Just go home.

1021
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:29,323
I'll go once you're asleep. Don't worry.

1022
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:32,743
But I don't wanna wake up
and not see you here…

1023
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:36,581
Want me to stay?

1024
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,961
Um, sorry, they just slipped out.

1025
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:45,548
You're right. I want you to stay here.

1026
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,553
You really confuse me.

1027
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:53,514
The things you say sometimes,
and the things that you do.

1028
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:55,516
Like calling 119 tonight.

1029
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:01,772
Well, I think you wanna believe
that I'm this big jerk,

1030
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,066
but the truth is, I'm actually a nice guy.

1031
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:06,861
I can't stand you.

1032
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,074
If I'm being honest,

1033
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,411
seeing you with Eun-han
really threw me off.

1034
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,415
-Why?
-I don't know.

1035
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,585
Jealousy, I guess.

1036
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,212
And then, you deleted my number,

1037
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:27,757
and he seemed to make you happy.

1038
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,554
You must have loved
seeing the look on my face

1039
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:36,349
when he flat-out humiliated me tonight.

1040
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,732
Save my number again, okay?

1041
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:48,277
Think about it.
I'm not such a bad guy, right?

1042
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,699
I don't know
if it's 'cause of the fever or him,

1043
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,785
but my head is spinning.

1044
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:01,290
Why are you doing this to me?
Because my name means "butterfly"?

1045
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:04,877
'Cause from the moment we met,
I was drawn to you.

1046
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,382
Oh, I get it now.

1047
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,178
You're funny.
Has anyone ever told you that?

1048
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,180
So I'm just a joke to you then?

1049
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:18,516
Why ask me these things
if you won't believe me?

1050
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,851
I know guys like you.
You can't be trusted.

1051
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,271
If I show you that I'm different,
will you trust me then?

1052
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:21,203
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he is different.

1053
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,721
Your fever's broken.

1054
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,934
You nursed me the old-fashioned way.
What are you, my mom?

1055
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,312
The old ways are still the best.

1056
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,690
Yeah. You're right.

1057
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,571
I should get ready for school.

1058
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:18,844
How come you never leave your hair down?

1059
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:21,889
I'm not used to it.

1060
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,057
It's cute.

1061
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,434
Would you leave it down just for me?

1062
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,211
Okay, you're on.

1063
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:57,591
But you wear yours up for me.

1064
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,180
You look pretty.

1065
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:21,206
That familiar intoxicating scent
has come to hunt me once more.

1066
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,042
I really want to keep
seeing you. What about you?

1067
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,836
Jae-eon is so smooth with everything.

1068
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,045
I want you
to be my girlfriend.

1069
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,338
You're overreacting.

1070
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,382
-Do… do you like me?
-Yu Na-bi?

1071
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,427
The channel name really made me
think of you because of your grandpa.

1072
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:34,720
Wait, you really thought about me?

1073
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,305
I caught you.

1074
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:37,931
I have a gift for you.

1075
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,851
We're much more compatible
than I thought,

1076
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:43,812
and I enjoy our nights together.

1077
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:46,148
Is there another girl
you're seeing other than me?

1078
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:48,233
Aren't you going overboard?
We're not even going out.

1079
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:49,610
We should end it, Jae-eon.

1080
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:51,236
I don't want to let go.

1081
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,196
Not yet.

1082
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:55,616
Even at this moment,
I'm still attracted to him.

1083
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:57,409
Like crazy.
