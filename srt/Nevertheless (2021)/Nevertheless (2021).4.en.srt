1
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,519
This is crazy.

2
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,313
But it was so good.

3
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,606
I couldn't stop it.

4
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,110
I want to keep sleeping like this.

5
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,737
Me too.

6
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,115
Should we just skip school today?

7
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,746
At least if I was drunk,
I could have used that as an excuse.

8
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:11,381
EPISODE 4: I KNOW IT ISN'T LOVE.
NEVERTHELESS,

9
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,887
Ouch!

10
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,307
-Are you okay?
-Oh yeah, I'm fine.

11
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,434
Uh, do you know where's the hairdryer is?

12
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,103
Damn it.

13
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,521
Could we talk for a second?

14
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,441
Oh! Hey, hey, put a shirt on!

15
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,781
Whoa, I must have
alcohol-related dementia.

16
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,701
I don't remember anything
that happened yesterday.

17
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,162
-So maybe--
-It was all a mistake?

18
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,079
What?

19
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,292
Oh…

20
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,337
Yeah. Honestly, we both
made a mistake. We were drunk, right?

21
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,341
Since we made a mistake,
nothing has to change between us.

22
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,177
Don't you think?

23
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,761
I'm gonna go now.

24
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,097
Hey! Wait!

25
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,765
Hey!

26
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,190
Oh! Damn it! What have I done?

27
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,360
I must have lost my mind!
Why did it have to be him?

28
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,495
Wait, is that mine?

29
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,666
Yeah. I, uh, washed it for you.

30
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,127
It's fine, you can have it.

31
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,296
Or just throw it away.

32
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,383
Oh, I'm going out to have breakfast.

33
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,219
Out?

34
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,511
By myself.

35
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,891
Oh, right. I totally get it.

36
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,602
I should get some more sleep.

37
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,520
Go ahead.

38
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,818
I really want to keep seeing you.

39
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,738
What about you?

40
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,823
This is it, Na-bi.

41
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,741
What do you mean?

42
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,701
Can we meet up again sometime?

43
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,703
Okay, so let me get this straight.

44
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,872
Even if we're not dating right now,

45
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,917
he's asking me if I want to meet up and…

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,710
sleep with him from time to time?

47
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,004
I'm not sure.

48
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,548
Think about it and tell me.

49
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,636
I'll be off. Go to the hospital
if you feel sick. Okay?

50
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,305
Mm-hm.

51
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,331
Park Jae-eon?

52
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,726
-Last night wasn't a mistake for me.
-What?

53
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,979
And things won't be the same
for me, either. Not anymore.

54
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,815
I don't think I can just pretend
it didn't happen.

55
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,114
So what's going to happen now?

56
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,908
I really don't think that I can just
stay friends with you now,

57
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,076
after everything we did.

58
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,536
What are you…

59
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,957
-You don't mean…
-I want you to be my girlfriend.

60
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,173
Hey!

61
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,467
You…

62
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,554
You want me to be your girlfriend
because we slept together once?

63
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,723
Don't you think you're overreacting?

64
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,016
Do… do you like me?

65
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,230
There. See? You can't even answer that.

66
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,233
Besides, I really don't want to date
within such a small department,

67
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,277
because rumors
are going to spread so fast.

68
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,029
And it's going to be really annoying.

69
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,659
All right.

70
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,206
I understand how you feel,
so I'll take care of my feelings.

71
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,708
Hmm… What do you mean? Hey!

72
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,627
Hey!

73
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,425
The guy Sol brought over last night,
was he her boyfriend?

74
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,594
I don't know.

75
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,266
You're the only one here
who'd know! Come on!

76
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,519
Just who is that guy? And is it…

77
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,065
Is it serious?

78
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,026
Why don't you go and ask her yourself?

79
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,862
I don't care who she dates.
So stop asking me.

80
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,863
It's so annoying.

81
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,033
Wh-what happened? Did you two fight?

82
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:55,164
Oh, right. You also didn't know
Sol's going to be an exchange student.

83
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,126
We didn't fight. That's just
the extent of our relationship.

84
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,169
I'm leaving.

85
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,309
Seo Ji-wan.

86
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,938
Ji-wan. Ji-wan!

87
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,149
Let me talk to you.

88
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,529
Fine. Let's talk.
So, where do you wanna start?

89
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,407
Going abroad? Or maybe your new boyfriend?

90
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,701
Everyone knew about it, except me.

91
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,411
Come on, I was going to tell you.

92
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,913
Oh. And when were you going to tell me?

93
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,666
The day before you leave?
The day before you get married? When?

94
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,544
What's with you? You said
you don't care who I date, remember?

95
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,963
Right. I couldn't care less.
I'm just angry with you,

96
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,798
because you're leaving me
out of everything like this.

97
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,801
-Oh, when did I ever leave you out of--
-You're always doing this, Sol.

98
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,721
You never tell me about
the important things in your life.

99
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,014
You know that?

100
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,100
Like what, Ji-wan?

101
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,201
I guess this is really the extent
of our relationship.

102
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,393
Thank you.

103
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,688
What's your next class?

104
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,275
Human Anatomy. It's really hard.

105
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,945
I actually got an A in that class.

106
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,363
-Wait, really?
-Mm.

107
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,739
Then help me study for the exam.

108
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,157
What will you do for me?

109
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,497
What should I do for you?

110
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,000
Jeez…

111
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,966
Oh, uh… by the way…

112
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,052
Um…

113
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:18,391
I don't want, uh, anyone to know about us.
So can we keep this a secret?

114
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,229
All right. My lips are sealed.

115
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,231
-Mm.
-Hmm.

116
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,359
And, also…

117
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,152
Um…

118
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,488
You don't, uh…

119
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:38,536
have any… di… diseases, do you?

120
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,040
Do you?

121
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,296
Hey, don't laugh! I'm really serious.

122
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,382
No, I don't, so don't worry.

123
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,594
Mm.

124
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,306
Do you have time later?

125
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,935
Yes, I, uh… I have some time.

126
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,438
Oh, no, wait. Should we meet on Saturday?

127
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,733
You need to rest the next day, right?

128
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,485
Oh, no.

129
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,113
It's totally fine, I'm all right.

130
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,359
Why in the world did I do that?
I was so impulsive.

131
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,945
I must've lost my mind.

132
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,286
I should just tell him not to come here.

133
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,721
-Come in.
-Hmm.

134
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,480
-What's with the beer?
-Uh…

135
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,982
I thought it'll be nice to drink together.

136
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,359
You know, to spice things up.

137
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,779
Oh, I already drank some earlier.

138
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,532
I couldn't do this sober.

139
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,868
This is cheating, you know.

140
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,328
What do you mean?

141
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,082
We, uh, didn't really decide on anything.

142
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,501
Decide on what?

143
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,797
Weren't we… going to study
human anatomy together?

144
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,967
Oh.

145
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,470
Right. Human anatomy.

146
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,099
Yes. We should study.

147
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,064
Stop laughing already.

148
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,359
I have a gift for you.

149
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,788
Jae-eon is so smooth with everything.

150
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,668
It's like everything
just comes so naturally to him.

151
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,754
There, all done.

152
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,842
Do you like it?

153
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,428
Mm.

154
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,015
It's so pretty.

155
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,269
When the sun shines through it
in the morning, it'll be much prettier.

156
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,448
Here we go again.

157
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,367
Like this was always
going to happen between us.

158
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,500
You got me once again.

159
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,215
Hang on a second.

160
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,597
PARK JAE-EON

161
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,601
You saved my number.

162
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,729
Mm.

163
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,901
I should stop this right now.

164
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:44,698
Because there are so many reasons
why I shouldn't do this.

165
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,538
But…

166
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,272
Did you know you have a mole here?

167
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,148
Really? Where?

168
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,150
Right here.

169
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,197
No, I didn't know.

170
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,038
Today you look… so much prettier.

171
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,916
Even at this moment,
I'm still attracted to him.

172
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,295
Like crazy.

173
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,651
And that one simple reason,

174
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,614
buries all my worries
and makes me forget them.

175
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,748
Didn't it hurt when you got
that tattoo behind your neck?

176
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,461
Yeah, of course it hurt.

177
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,005
I almost died that day.

178
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,884
I thought of quitting in the middle of it.

179
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,098
I'm gonna get another one soon.

180
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,392
Where?

181
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,106
Somewhere here.

182
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,985
Another butterfly?

183
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,612
Mm-hm.

184
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,909
It'll be a butterfly
with lots of black spots on its wings.

185
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,410
The name's pretty long.

186
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,665
Taiwanese black-star hairstreak butterfly.

187
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,210
Taiwan…

188
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,879
That is a long name.

189
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,593
You know, when they're still caterpillars,

190
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,680
they don't actually eat leaves,
they eat flowers instead.

191
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,099
Pretty unique, right?

192
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,977
Mm.

193
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,356
Since that day, a lot of things
have changed between us.

194
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,402
And just like that,
Jae-eon slowly seeped into my life.

195
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,158
Go take a shower.

196
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,919
I'm starting my job at the department.

197
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,922
You decided to do that? Aren't you busy?

198
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,967
I'm not gonna work that long.
It's just for a little while.

199
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,969
Hmm.

200
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,555
It's all because of you.

201
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,976
Why? What did I do?

202
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,271
Come visit me, okay?

203
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,189
And why should I?

204
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,524
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

205
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,610
Just come visit me.

206
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,363
Just do it, okay?

207
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,282
Why should I?

208
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,036
All right, I will.

209
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,462
Jae-eon, where's the suncatcher
you made last time?

210
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,049
-The butterfly-shaped one.
-Oh, that thing?

211
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,551
I gave it to someone.

212
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:36,096
Aw. That's too bad. I wanted to see it
when it was finished.

213
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,015
Hey, Jae-eon,
tell us how to make the suncatcher.

214
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,183
Yeah! Tell us!

215
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,435
Just talk to Ceramics and Glass students.

216
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,479
Learn that from them. Jae-eon is mine now.

217
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,688
Right?

218
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,399
What are you going on about?

219
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,817
You're so nosy!

220
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,696
If you're done, and have nothing
to do here, please leave.

221
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,949
Did you hear me? Huh? Get out.

222
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,451
-Okay!
-We're leaving now.

223
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,786
-Bye-bye.
-See ya!

224
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,333
I heard that he doesn't date,
but I guess he has a girlfriend.

225
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,752
I wonder who it is.
She must be really pretty.

226
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,938
-It's been raining a lot.
-Hmm.

227
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,865
-Don't do it.
-I have to do this!

228
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,119
All right, stop working. Let's just sleep.

229
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,995
-Already?
-Mm-hm.

230
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,958
-Really?
-I'm sleepy.

231
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:58,720
Our relationship
only exists at night, but…

232
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,932
Are you washing the dishes?

233
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,227
Yeah. It looks like you don't do
the dishes when I'm coming.

234
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,062
You caught me.

235
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,940
Although, I think you're actually
pretty good at housework.

236
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,900
Will you do the laundry too?

237
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,279
-Should I do it?
-Yes.

238
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,905
Let's do it together.

239
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,408
No, I don't want to.
I don't wanna do it.

240
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:23,120
It sometimes felt like
he and I were lovers.

241
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,414
What's your goal today?

242
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,001
Ooh…

243
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,544
Can you really do it?

244
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,089
Don't strain yourself, okay?

245
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,096
What was that, Jae-eon?

246
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,643
Whenever I eat this,
my tongue would always feel numb.

247
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,645
That's why I kissed you first.

248
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,815
Jae-eon is still a mystery to me.

249
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,192
You're crazy.

250
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,568
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

251
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,404
Here.

252
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,699
Mmm.

253
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,704
You said your tongue goes numb
when you eat this. But it's good.

254
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,997
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

255
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,880
Just eat.

256
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,385
-Mmm.
-It's good, right?

257
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,554
It's tastier today.

258
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,120
I can't tell if he's kind or cold,

259
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,958
or whether he's serious or joking.

260
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,556
Are you done with assignments?

261
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,976
Not yet.

262
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,728
You should go home and sleep there.

263
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,858
I can't just leave now.

264
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,375
My worries about Jae-eon
hasn't disappeared at all, but…

265
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,596
We're much more compatible than I thought.

266
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,563
So the transverse arch

267
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,732
can be best seen from the front.
You see that?

268
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,983
Mmm…

269
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,193
You're right.

270
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,530
So, this is… the transverse arch?

271
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,073
Mm-hm.

272
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,493
And this is the medial longitudinal arch.

273
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,372
-Yeah.
-This is the lateral longitudinal arch.

274
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,333
Mm-hm.

275
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,628
-What about this?
-Stop it.

276
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,297
It tickles. Stop it.

277
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,716
I can't stop, I'm studying right now.

278
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,135
What about this?

279
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,179
Hey, it really tickles.

280
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,813
And I enjoy…

281
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,274
our nights together.

282
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,409
Thank you, Jae-eon.

283
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,329
Wow!

284
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,914
-It looks so good.
-I want corn.

285
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,374
I thought you were on a diet.

286
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,626
Yes. That's why
I'm only eating the shrimp. See?

287
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,668
Oh, is that right?

288
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,173
-Na-bi?
-Hmm?

289
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,466
Are you dating someone right now?

290
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,093
Me?

291
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,305
Um, I'm not. Why?

292
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,392
You just… seem to be
in a good mood these days.

293
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,770
Also, I've been noticing
that glow in your skin.

294
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,315
I've just been sleeping well.

295
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,197
Uh, I mean, sleep.
I've been getting lots of sleep.

296
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,990
-I see.
-Oh.

297
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,743
Sleeping is the best way
to improve your skin's complexion.

298
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,786
Mmm.

299
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,454
Oh, yeah, that's right.

300
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,915
Hey, Gyu-hyun, wanna go on a blind date?

301
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,920
A blind date? With who?

302
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,338
Oh! With a high school friend of mine.

303
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,091
She saw a photo of you on social media,
and she wants to meet you.

304
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,469
It's been a while since she's dated anyone
so she's always saying she's lonely.

305
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,971
You should tell your friend

306
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,849
that seeing any guy just because
she's lonely won't end well for her.

307
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,018
Lonely people will still be lonely
even if they date someone.

308
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,437
I don't think they have to be.

309
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,938
-I think--
-Mm…

310
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,314
If you're in a relationship,

311
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,651
you have a kind of unspoken responsibility
not to make the other feel lonely.

312
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,111
You're right.

313
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,321
Today?

314
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,115
Se-yeong, let me see her picture.

315
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,908
Sure, all right.

316
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,785
-Oh! She's really pretty.
-Let me see.

317
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,036
-Yeah, she is.
-Really? Think so?

318
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,038
-Do you like her?
-Introduce me.

319
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,583
Should I give you her number,
my high school friend?

320
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,251
She really likes you, you know.

321
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,963
I'm not going to give you
what you want, Jae-eon.

322
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,425
She's pretty.

323
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,260
So are you interested?

324
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,304
Mm.

325
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,306
Give me her number.

326
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,433
No way. She's going to be so happy.

327
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,352
-Just eat one slice.
-I don't feel like it.

328
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,314
BRING ICE CREAM
OKAY

329
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,316
-Bit-na, can I eat the shrimp, then?
-Just eat it.

330
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,277
Will you call her?
Or should I tell her to call you?

331
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,031
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

332
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,408
-Bow.
-Hello there, sir. And then…

333
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,995
-All right, take one step forward. Oh.
-One step forward.

334
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,997
-Oh. I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

335
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,042
-Are you really okay?
-Yes. I'm all right.

336
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,044
Let's try it again.
Let's start with the bow.

337
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,423
Grab each other's hands. Come closer.

338
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,176
-And go.
-Go.

339
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,512
-One, two.
-One, two.

340
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,305
-Turn. There.
-Three, four.

341
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,766
-One, two.
-One, two.

342
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,393
-Turn again. Oh.
-Now? Oh!

343
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,939
You okay?

344
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,149
At this rate,
you're gonna break my feet soon.

345
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,736
Should I just give up then?

346
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,613
Oh, I was totally scammed.

347
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,865
Bit-na told me this class was really easy.

348
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,744
Do you really think it's her fault
you took this class?

349
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,665
Let's try it one more time.

350
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,459
From what I saw at the club,
trust me, I think you have potential.

351
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,545
Just forget it. Stop teasing me.

352
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,340
Speaking of dancing,
why are you so good at it?

353
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,134
Did you learn this before?
Or are you a natural dancer?

354
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,011
I'm not sure.

355
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,930
Well, my mom's a dancer.

356
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,766
Oh, really? Does she still dance?

357
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,359
Are you gonna be busy this Sunday?

358
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,946
Sunday? Uh…

359
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,407
Today is Friday, though.

360
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,201
Hmm?

361
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,788
Do you think I'm a sex maniac,
or something?

362
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,373
Then what's on Sunday?

363
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,875
Well, there's an exhibit
that's gonna end this weekend.

364
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,544
I thought maybe we could go.

365
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,920
Oh, that?

366
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,424
I guess I did want to go and see it…

367
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,758
Should we go?

368
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,930
Uh, I'll think about it first,
and then I'll tell you.

369
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,015
Let's go.

370
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,600
Hmm?

371
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,876
He probably
doesn't even know what day it is.

372
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,046
I'm really weird for thinking about this.

373
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,301
AUNTIE

374
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,976
Hello, Aunt. Pulling an all-nighter again?

375
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,811
I should work as hard as you.

376
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,897
Oh, I'm used to it anyway.

377
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,983
I wanted to ask you
if you're going to your mom's this Sunday?

378
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,402
I was thinking of visiting
since it's your birthday.

379
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,988
You don't need to come.
You'll get tired.

380
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,240
I'll go there when we have our break.

381
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,826
Then what do you want?
I should at least get you a gift.

382
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,204
Come on, I'll get you anything you want.

383
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,458
You know, Aunt,
I wish you were my mom instead.

384
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,002
You're a very lucky girl

385
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,254
because you have both
your mom and your aunt.

386
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,718
It's your special day.

387
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,263
You should be spending it with
the person you want to be with the most.

388
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,144
The person I want to be with?

389
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,706
Mm-hm. Yeah, I just finished.

390
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,207
I'll be there soon.

391
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,422
This looks really good.

392
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,760
Oh, hello.

393
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,971
Oh, looking for Jae-eon? He just left.

394
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,725
What? Oh, I just came to apply
for the night-shift job.

395
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,185
Have you eaten yet?

396
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,187
Come sit down. Eat with us.

397
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,064
-We ordered three servings of food.
-Uh-huh.

398
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,023
All right.

399
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,278
Here.

400
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,660
Cheese.

401
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,290
Is there something you wanna say?

402
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,918
Well… I, uh…

403
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:18,798
Would it be weird to spend your birthday
with someone you're not really dating?

404
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:22,010
Then you're getting to know each other?
Is that what you mean?

405
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,221
It's not like that.

406
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,891
But if you do everything else…

407
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,643
Do everything else?
What do you mean by that?

408
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,187
Hmm…

409
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,064
Oh, then I say no.

410
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,859
A birthday gift would be fine,
but spending the day together…

411
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,944
I think that's a bit too much.

412
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,989
You think it's a bit too much?

413
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,159
-Do you love him?
-What?

414
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,369
No, I mean…

415
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,831
I wasn't talking about myself.
It's about my friend.

416
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,749
Does she love him?

417
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,667
You're always going on about love.

418
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,628
That's not a good relationship, you know.

419
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,547
Reality will hit you.
You're going to regret it.

420
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,592
And tell your friend
to use birth control. Okay?

421
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,179
Okay.

422
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,146
Do you still have the butterflies?

423
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,231
Mm-hm.

424
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,817
We're actually getting along very well.

425
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,028
You said you'd let them go.

426
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,907
Did I really say that?

427
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,540
Listen, I thought about it,
and I think you're right, Jae-eon.

428
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,876
About what?

429
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,963
About your butterflies.

430
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,717
You told me before you were keeping them
from flying away to freedom.

431
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,887
And I think you're right.

432
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,184
There's a huge world outside the glass
waiting for them to explore.

433
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,854
You're just giving them false hope.

434
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,357
Did I say that?

435
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,485
But what should I do?

436
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,114
I don't want to let go. Not yet.

437
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,157
Then at least be good to them.

438
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,784
You know what your problem is, right?

439
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,744
You torment the things you like.

440
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,668
Hang on for a second.

441
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,086
YU NA-BI

442
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,673
Hey, can you talk right now?

443
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,551
Mm-hm. Why, what's up?

444
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,344
I just called to say,

445
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,181
that I'm afraid I can't come with you
to the exhibit this weekend.

446
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,893
I'm going back home to see my mom.

447
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,227
Really?

448
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,813
That's too bad.

449
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,940
Sorry.
You can go with someone else.

450
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,609
All right then.

451
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,445
Is there anything else?

452
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,490
That's it. Bye.

453
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,768
Na-bi?

454
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,231
Yu Na-bi?

455
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,277
Yang Do-hyeok?

456
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,696
Yeah.

457
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,658
Is that really you?

458
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,578
Hey, it's been so long
since I've seen you!

459
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,373
Has it been about ten years?

460
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,751
That's right.
I thought I'd never see you again.

461
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,254
Yeah, me too.
What are the chances we'd meet here.

462
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,839
Are you living in Seoul?

463
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:47,924
Yeah.

464
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,718
After military service,
I came here to learn how to cook.

465
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,679
You're cooking now? Like your grandfather?

466
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:57,141
I'm working at a noodle place
on the intersection of Hongseo University.

467
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,769
Hongseo University?

468
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,188
Oh! I know that place.

469
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,314
What?

470
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,609
Well, I never went there before,
but my friends said it was good there.

471
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,986
Oh, really?

472
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,405
You should come sometime.

473
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,865
All right. I promise to stop by.

474
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,577
This stop is Hongseol Elementary…

475
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,496
Sorry, Do-hyeok, I have to get off here.

476
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,081
Oh. Wait.

477
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,624
Here you go, Na-bi.

478
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,377
Uh, could you give me your number?

479
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,254
Oh.

480
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,631
Of course.

481
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,053
Here.

482
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,263
Oh!

483
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,472
Oh!

484
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,185
Oh, no.

485
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,858
Are you getting off?

486
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,194
-Uh, just a minute, sir!
-It's all right. Just go.

487
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,864
I'm really sorry. I should get off now.

488
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,680
It's raining, you know.

489
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,768
You're gonna get wet.
I can walk you to where you're going.

490
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,188
But what about your potatoes?

491
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,948
What the heck is that?

492
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,206
How are the others doing now?
I'm curious.

493
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,917
Well, some of them
went to Seoul like you.

494
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,169
I only keep in touch
with a few of them, though.

495
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,255
Oh, I see.

496
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,384
I thought we'd all stay in touch
back then, you know?

497
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,512
Yeah, I know.

498
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,640
It would've been really nice
if we had kept meeting up often.

499
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,018
Oh, and what about the noodle place?

500
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,521
I love your grandpa's noodles.
They're so good.

501
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,482
He's not really doing so well,
so it's closed for now.

502
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,443
I'm learning how to cook
and getting ready to reopen it.

503
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,404
Then you're going to run it by yourself?

504
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,447
Yeah, for now.

505
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,492
Just until my grandpa feels better.

506
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,079
I mean, I can't open
the restaurant right away,

507
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,123
but I'm learning. Slowly but surely.

508
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,833
Wow. You're so cool.

509
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,751
You made such a big decision.

510
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,670
I'm sure your grandpa will be so happy.

511
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,966
I'm not sure. He always nags me
about how unreliable I am.

512
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,884
Still, I'm sure
your grandpa's proud of you.

513
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,224
Uh, you should come when I open it.
We have a guest house, and, uh…

514
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,769
and… I think it'll be fun
to hang out together.

515
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,770
Oh…

516
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,773
Sure, of course. I will.

517
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,276
We're actually here.
I just have to turn that corner.

518
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,361
Oh, really?

519
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,285
Oh, no. You're all wet now.

520
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,786
-You must feel cold.
-It's all right.

521
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,164
You should have said something.

522
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,918
You know…
it's really nice to see you again.

523
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,253
I'm glad I ran into you.

524
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,679
Thanks for walking me home.
I should go inside now.

525
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,640
Right. Oh, uh, take this.

526
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,309
-Oh, no, it's fine!
-Take it. It's all right.

527
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,310
I can just use my hood.

528
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,940
Uh, hey, Na-bi. Is it…

529
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,986
Is it okay if… I message you?

530
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,030
Oh, sure.

531
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,324
Go inside now.

532
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,309
Ttoli!

533
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,186
Ttoli!

534
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,940
Hey there, cutie. It's been a long time.
I missed you.

535
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,289
Hey, Mom?

536
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,209
Mom?

537
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,506
I thought you'd be here in the evening.

538
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,424
Why'd you come home so early?

539
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,596
Stay in your room first, okay?

540
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,139
Or maybe you can…

541
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,976
Oh, why don't you go out
and take Ttoli for a walk? Okay?

542
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,144
Come on. Hurry up, go on now.

543
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,397
Ttoli, wanna go for a walk? Huh? Go on.

544
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,691
Go! Go for a walk, Ttoli. Come on.

545
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,112
You're ditching me again.

546
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,655
What are you…

547
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,491
Come on, he's going to leave soon.

548
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,660
Just stay in your room for now.

549
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,960
You went
to the signing event, right?

550
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,962
-Did you take photos?
-We're so jealous.

551
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,048
I wanted to take photos,
but I couldn't.

552
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,592
Of course, they're all in my computer…

553
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,012
-You should have shown it to us.
-We're so jealous of you!

554
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,638
You went to the concert, right?

555
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,724
Yeah.
I watched from the front row.

556
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,351
I think it was a birthday gift…

557
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,065
There was a time
when all I cared about were my friends.

558
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,233
Happy birthday!

559
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,120
Hey, stop! Hey, hey, stop!

560
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,831
Make a wish! Make a wish!

561
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,506
-Wow!
-And when I started dating,

562
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,759
I thought love was everything.

563
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,889
Now it's been almost two months
since the day…

564
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,933
my crazy first relationship ended.

565
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,079
I have friends
who I keep in touch with

566
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,372
and have meals together with…

567
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,749
sometimes.

568
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,716
And also a friend I have sex with.

569
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,270
Is there anything special
you want for your birthday?

570
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,522
Um, I want you.

571
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,066
Anyway, where are we going?

572
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,193
-It's a secret.
-Oh, come on.

573
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,905
-Why isn't the train here yet?
-It's late.

574
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,323
Wanna go to the amusement park?

575
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,827
However, to have someone
to spend my birthday with,

576
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,787
there's no one.

577
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,718
THE TRAIN FOR GUJA
WILL BE ARRIVING SHORTLY

578
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,176
I caught you!

579
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,153
That's it! Smile!

580
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,824
-Can I see?
-You look great in it.

581
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:47,041
I thought our relationship
only existed at night.

582
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,215
So, do you like your gift?

583
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,470
I've never been forced to receive
a gift like this in my life.

584
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,890
Oh, come on. Can't you express
your happiness so I can feel proud?

585
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,018
Oh, I love it.
Thank you so much for the gift!

586
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,478
Wear it tomorrow.

587
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,396
Mm-hm.

588
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,149
But weren't you going to the exhibit?
What happened?

589
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,609
Today's the last day, right?

590
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:18,197
How could I think about that
on a special day like this?

591
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,657
He's getting my hopes up again.

592
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,325
Well, since…

593
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,371
you got me a birthday gift,
let me treat you to a meal, all right?

594
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:26,955
Oh…

595
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,918
Oh, do you have plans?

596
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,504
-Then maybe next time.
-Oh, no.

597
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,922
Today is your special day.

598
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,093
INSTANT SEAWEED SOUP

599
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,225
I thought it was going to be
the worst birthday ever.

600
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,436
But I guess life is full of surprises.

601
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,023
Just wait a little bit.
I'll make this right away.

602
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,905
You're saying it
as if you're really cooking.

603
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,117
It's the heart
that really matters, all right?

604
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,538
You know, it's been a while since I had
seaweed soup for my birthday.

605
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,666
Wait, really?

606
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,211
I thought everyone had it except for me.

607
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,588
That's comforting to know.

608
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:28,809
What?

609
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,061
You've never told me
something like that before.

610
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,523
You don't talk about yourself much.

611
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:36,859
Well…

612
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,449
That's because I don't need to.

613
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,993
You know me so well already.

614
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,748
Actually, I don't know anything about you.

615
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,630
I really don't.

616
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,550
You're still such a mystery to me.

617
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,270
All right, come on. Stop fooling around
and make the soup already.

618
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,480
No, not that.

619
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,108
Then what?

620
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:25,259
I don't get it.
Why can't you be my boyfriend?

621
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,932
So when are you going to make me
the seaweed soup?

622
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,561
I'll go make it now.

623
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,146
Why aren't you getting up, then?

624
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,108
I have no energy. Five more minutes.

625
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,373
SEOL-A

626
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,544
Let me take this call.

627
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:02,963
Hang on.

628
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,803
So, should we have a drink first?

629
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,598
Or just… do it?

630
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,392
I don't know. Whatever you like.

631
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,567
You know what? Let's drink here.

632
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,740
So, tell me, what's your type?

633
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,033
-Me?
-Yeah.

634
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,872
Are you all right?

635
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,334
Yeah, I'm okay.

636
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:53,055
Oh, on second thought,
this place is actually… pretty lame.

637
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,142
Let's drink somewhere else.

638
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,602
-What?
-Come on, let's go.

639
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,562
Somewhere else?

640
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,991
You okay? Do you know that girl?

641
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,243
Uh, no, I don't know her.

642
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,663
Excuse me.
Can I have a cold glass of water?

643
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,878
Sorry. Something urgent came up
with a friend.

644
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,674
Okay. You should go, then.

645
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:30,801
Make sure to eat, all right?

646
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,303
And don't ignore your mom when she calls.

647
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,057
I'll get going.

648
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,267
Mm.

649
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,134
I'm really hungry.

650
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,234
Do-hyeok…

651
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,203
Come in.

652
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,668
Sorry. You're already closed, right?

653
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,462
No, we're not. We're still open.

654
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,172
Uh…

655
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,470
What?

656
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,847
You have 3,000 subscribers?

657
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,974
But you only started
three months ago, right?

658
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,684
You have so many views.

659
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,728
Hold on. Do you edit the videos yourself?

660
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:50,482
-Yeah.
-Oh…

661
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,275
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER
VIDEOS

662
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,611
I actually saw this channel before.

663
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,073
The channel name really made me
think of you, because of your grandpa.

664
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,658
Wait, you really thought about me?

665
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,077
Mm-hm.

666
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,831
I can't believe
this is actually your channel.

667
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,374
And a culinary arts major?

668
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,043
The Yang Do-hyeok I know…

669
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,170
always played with food.

670
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,965
I never expected that one day
you'll be making it yourself.

671
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,554
I always knew you'd major in art, though.

672
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,390
You were so good at drawing
when we were younger.

673
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,810
Oh…

674
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,230
I'm not that good at it.

675
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,816
I just like drawing, that's all.

676
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,613
Your videos are really good.

677
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,785
-Oh.
-Here you go.

678
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,206
Uh…

679
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,209
Weren't you making noodles for me?

680
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,919
I'll make it for you next time.

681
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,797
Today is your birthday, isn't it, Na-bi?

682
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,508
Yeah, it is.

683
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,973
You have a good memory.
You actually remembered my birthday?

684
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,683
Yeah, of course, I…

685
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,647
I have a good memory.
So of course I would.

686
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,149
Oh, right.

687
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:17,110
-Uh, do you still like chocolate?
-Mm-hm.

688
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,281
Did you also make this cake yourself?

689
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,034
-Yeah.
-You're so talented.

690
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,452
It looks delicious.

691
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,245
Oh, wait.

692
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,541
What?

693
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,212
Go on, make a wish.

694
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,130
A wish?

695
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,591
Mm.

696
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,320
Happy birthday, Na-bi.

697
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,532
Thank you for this. I can't believe
I'm spending my birthday with you.

698
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,534
Life is indeed full of surprises.

699
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:10,372
Yeah, I know.
I never imagined this would happen.

700
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,459
-It's so good.
-Really?

701
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,169
-Yeah!
-That's a relief.

702
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,672
You know, I also felt this way last time.

703
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,967
We've not seen each other for a long time,
but it's not awkward.

704
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,135
Is it because we're childhood friends?

705
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,095
I guess?

706
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,056
What's that response? Do you feel awkward?

707
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,768
I feel kind of nervous.

708
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:41,361
Oh! Uh, remember that time we had
a birthday party at the beach?

709
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,530
Oh, yeah.

710
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:44,990
Of course I remember.

711
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,867
We set up a tent and cooked some ramyeon.

712
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,162
That's right. We played with fireworks.

713
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,164
That's right.

714
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,958
It was so much fun.

715
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,420
I wanna go back to that moment.

716
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,793
So, do you like your gift?

717
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,048
I've never been forced to receive
a gift like this in my life.

718
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:44,758
Wear it tomorrow.

719
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,997
-Yes. Hello?
-Are you at school?

720
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,040
Yeah. Why?

721
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,459
I'm on my way there now.
I'll be there soon.

722
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,295
Oh, yeah, me too.

723
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,522
It looks good on you.

724
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,319
That's because you bought it, right?

725
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,905
And, I guess,
the model herself is pretty too.

726
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,450
You're right.

727
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,454
Right. I already made up with my mom.

728
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,914
Well, okay, it was more like,

729
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:00,875
I just listened to her talk
and hung up without saying anything.

730
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:03,837
Good job, Na-bi.

731
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:08,716
What about you?
You went to see your friend, right?

732
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,926
How was it?

733
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:11,761
Mm-hm.

734
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,722
It wasn't anything good.

735
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,560
He's drawing the line again.

736
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,608
Why didn't you get me a lollipop?

737
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,236
What flavor is that?

738
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,041
Are you crazy? We're at school!

739
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,671
A pretty girl was longingly gazing at me,
asking me…

740
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,048
for the flavor of my lollipop.

741
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,432
I was only looking at your lollipop,
not you.

742
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,729
-You mean this?
-Yes, that.

743
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,149
It's good, right?

744
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,985
-Is it good?
-It's not.

745
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,487
-It's not?
-No.

746
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,199
There's something between them.
And a friend of mine told me

747
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:18,244
that she saw Jae-eon several times at the
convenience store near Na-bi's house.

748
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,914
Come on.
She lives near the school.

749
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,957
But Jae-eon never goes
to that convenience store, ever.

750
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,503
Honey, you really know
so many things about Jae-eon, don't you?

751
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,129
Did you just call me "honey"?

752
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,672
Hey, come to think of it,

753
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,884
they were giving each other
these weird looks before they disappeared!

754
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,677
Then, are they secretly dating?

755
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,678
Hmm?

756
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,514
Park Jae-eon doesn't date, you know.

757
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,724
If not, are they just…
sleeping with each other?

758
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,268
Hey, listen, you can gossip
amongst yourselves later.

759
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,855
We still have to discuss the venue
and the budget of our workshop.

760
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,440
Didn't we decide to finish this
in an hour?

761
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,025
Oh, come on.

762
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,777
Don't be so serious, Gyu-hyun.

763
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,237
It's all right, guys.

764
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,531
I guess he's in a hurry to go on a date.

765
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,699
Let's finish up.

766
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,414
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's fine. Sit down.

767
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:08,169
Uh, before we choose, the professor
wants us to see the venue.

768
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,171
So, we should all go this weekend
and check it out.

769
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,507
Those who can't make it, raise your hands.

770
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,346
What?

771
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,181
You can't make it, Jae-eon?

772
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,808
Mm-hm.

773
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:24,686
Why not?

774
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,652
Huh? Hey, Na-bi!

775
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,113
Wow! Why are you all dressed up today?

776
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,782
-Is it okay?
-Yeah, it looks great on you.

777
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,412
Why weren't you at school?

778
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,331
I was a little sick. Look at me,
don't you think I lost weight?

779
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,084
Yes, it looks like you did.
Are you okay now?

780
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,962
Yeah, I'm fine. Oh! How was your birthday?

781
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,589
I'm sorry I couldn't contact you.

782
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,299
You don't need to be sorry.

783
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,303
Uh, did you talk to Sol already?
She seemed pretty worried about you.

784
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:02,265
Oh, just look at the weather today,
it's so nice!

785
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,392
It's the perfect spring weather.

786
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,685
Yeah, it is.

787
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,188
I don't want to work
on assignments.

788
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,566
Oh, hey, you look so pretty, Na-bi.

789
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,026
-Are you here to work?
-Oh, yeah. So pretty.

790
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,486
-We're just having a short meeting.
-They look so pretty.

791
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,572
Yeah,
the dress looks good on her.

792
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:18,781
Okay.

793
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,659
Go on.

794
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,756
And me? What about me?

795
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:37,050
It's been a while
since we saw you, Ji-wan.

796
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,593
Why did you suddenly go off the grid?

797
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,261
Well, I was a bit sick.

798
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,141
How does a fit girl like you
suddenly get sick?

799
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,685
I know.
Ji-wan is built like a rock.

800
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,228
What were you sick with, Ji-wan?

801
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,107
All right. Well, Jae-eon can't come
with us since he has plans this weekend.

802
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,692
Anyone else who can't come?

803
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,736
Hey, Na-bi.

804
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,530
We're going to check out the venue
for our workshop. Want to come with us?

805
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:01,658
Uh…

806
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,456
Sorry, I also have plans.

807
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:12,669
Right. If you have plans,
then I guess not.

808
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,046
Hmm.

809
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:32,689
Did you see Na-bi and Jae-eon?
It looks like they're dating, right?

810
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,024
I really thought Na-bi had a crush on me.

811
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,402
Really, Jin-su?
You're still on about that?

812
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,861
You gotta give up on her.

813
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,489
Hey, you guys free today?
Want to go out for drinks?

814
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,032
-Hmm.
-I have plans.

815
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,283
Jerk.

816
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,245
Yeah, me too. I also have plans.

817
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,551
Not you again.

818
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,519
What are you doing here?

819
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:14,397
Na-bi, I'm absolutely
heartbroken right now.

820
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,232
And I know you're in a lot of pain after--

821
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,775
What are you talking about?

822
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,821
I heard the rumors.

823
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,781
A lot of my students
attend your school too.

824
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,826
I keep hearing rumors about you,
even if I try hard not to.

825
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:27,869
What do you mean?

826
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,747
-What rumors?
-I heard you're seeing

827
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,459
some jerk named Park Jae-eon or something.

828
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,336
I heard that he sleeps
with everybody he meets.

829
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,839
I was so shocked when I heard
that you were seeing him.

830
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,263
I don't like hearing
about my ex's new dating life.

831
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:50,808
Let go of me.

832
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,228
You're really giving me advice?
Who do you think you are?

833
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,148
What? So it's true?
You're seeing that bastard?

834
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,108
Who are you to call him a bastard, huh?

835
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,735
-Yu Na-bi!
-What?

836
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,365
Listen, you're not that kind of girl, huh!

837
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,117
You must've been lonely after we broke up.

838
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,787
But still, seeing a guy like that?
There are much better guys out there.

839
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,371
-You can be--
-Shut up and get lost.

840
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,755
Hey. Hey, Na-bi…

841
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:27,303
LAUNDRY

842
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,274
Asshole. Who does he think he is?

843
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:07,009
I feel like I'm doing
something wrong, but I don't know what.

844
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,137
Oh, hey,
don't you know any hot girls?

845
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,099
Go ask Jae-eon, I'm sure he knows a lot.

846
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,059
Park Jae-eon?

847
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,271
To be honest,
I don't really feel comfortable with him.

848
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,607
Why? Did something happen between you two?

849
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,819
Don't you feel like he's been showing off
his popularity too much?

850
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:27,280
When I asked him
to introduce me to a hot girl,

851
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:31,075
he said something about feeling guilty
towards her. It totally pissed me off.

852
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:34,495
Seriously?
Jae-eon really said all that to you?

853
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,205
He did, I'm telling you.

854
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,124
He's so rude just because he's popular.

855
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,084
We don't really think of him
as a real friend.

856
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,336
And the others
don't consider him a friend, either.

857
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,339
They just keep him close
since he's so good-looking.

858
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,634
His target is Yu Na-bi these days.

859
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,887
They seem to be getting close.

860
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,471
I could totally tell.

861
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,474
Yeah, I heard about that rumor.

862
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,351
So the rumors
are spreading already.

863
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,395
In any case, Jae-eon has nothing to lose.

864
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:00,605
He must be very proud.

865
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,901
I didn't think Na-bi would be like that.
She must be pretty open-minded--

866
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,777
Open-minded?

867
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,447
Come on. That's just a nice way to put it.

868
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:13,492
Listen to me, you really
can't judge a book by its cover.

869
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,203
Well, I should get going now.

870
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:18,289
Okay. I'll go with you.

871
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:24,754
Yu Na-bi?

872
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,967
Uh… Hello there, Professor.

873
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,138
Is this piece for the exhibit?

874
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:38,017
Uh… Yeah, I'm thinking of handing
this sculpture in.

875
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,152
Is something troubling you?

876
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:49,737
Because it's in pretty bad shape.

877
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,781
Right hook.

878
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,203
But still, if you focus well
and keep working on it,

879
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,497
it could turn out to be a decent piece.

880
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,124
Okay. I'll work harder on it.

881
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,517
Listen to me, Na-bi.

882
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,520
It's so easy for people
to gossip about others

883
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:24,855
and criticize them
for the choices they make.

884
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,900
It's especially worse in Korea,
since it's a small country.

885
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:32,655
That's why when you're young,
you should be careful about what you do.

886
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,075
You might think that all
your reckless behavior can be forgiven

887
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:37,034
because you're young.

888
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,832
However, from what I experienced,
that's not the case.

889
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:44,625
There are consequences.

890
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:47,878
You'll get hit with the aftermath
at any crucial moment.

891
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:49,422
Left hook.

892
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,258
No one else will take responsibility
for your life.

893
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:55,886
So keep your head on straight.
You're graduating soon, you know.

894
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,389
Nowadays, everyone finds a job
before they graduate.

895
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,725
And there's the uppercut.

896
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,643
Right.

897
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,895
I know how you feel, Na-bi.

898
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:08,190
So I'm giving you advice since
I care about you. Keep that in mind.

899
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:09,692
Yes.

900
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:13,904
-Focus on your work.
-I will, Professor.

901
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:21,996
K.O.

902
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,802
It feels like,

903
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:40,389
the entire universe is telling me
to end it with Jae-eon once and for all.

904
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,266
Na-bi.

905
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:48,064
Are you okay?
You could've fallen in the trash.

906
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:51,233
Yeah. Oh, I'm okay.

907
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:54,111
Uh, I'm actually glad you're here.

908
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:57,198
I was wondering,
if you and I could meet after school.

909
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:02,369
Well, I… like the fact
that you're asking first,

910
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:05,164
but I have a lot of work today,
so I'll be a bit tired.

911
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:09,335
What are you saying?
I'm not talking about that.

912
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,672
I just want us to talk, that's all.

913
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,593
All right, then.
Can we meet later tonight?

914
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:18,803
Yeah, it's fine.

915
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,555
I'll call you when I'm done with work.

916
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,058
Hmm.

917
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,613
Let's send it
to the professor tomorrow.

918
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:38,531
Okay.

919
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,658
She won't read it
until tomorrow anyway.

920
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,668
-Aren't you leaving yet?
-What?

921
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:56,090
Oh, well… I'll just finish reading
the paper I was looking at earlier.

922
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,093
Where is it?

923
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:02,138
All right. Um, I'll go ahead, then.

924
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,223
Yeah, okay. Bye.

925
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,476
I thought about it,

926
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,229
and I guess I must have lost it
after breaking up with that jerk.

927
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,148
I don't know why I'm doing this

928
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,150
with someone like you.

929
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:18,821
What do you mean by that?

930
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,993
I want to focus on my work
and education from now on.

931
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,497
This is a very important time for me.

932
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,209
I guess I'm talking too much, aren't I?

933
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:35,296
Mm-hm. Aren't you going overboard?

934
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:36,881
We're not even going out.

935
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:42,595
We should end it, Jae-eon.

936
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,644
Does that sound like I wanna cut ties?

937
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,693
Whether I say this or whether I say that,

938
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:00,988
I know that Jae-eon won't even bat an eye.

939
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,246
He's always so calm
and I'm always so anxious.

940
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,833
I mean, my ex cheated on me,
a guy who liked me rejected me,

941
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:16,545
and rumors are spreading around
about me casually dating a guy I like.

942
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,130
Whoa!

943
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,134
It sounds even worse
when I put it all together.

944
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:32,478
We should end it.

945
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,855
That's all I have to say.

946
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,958
I need to talk to you, Ji-wan.

947
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,668
What else is there to talk about?

948
01:10:57,294 --> 01:11:00,506
To be honest, I don't even get
why you're so upset.

949
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:03,842
You didn't need to ghost me like that.

950
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:10,307
I said I'll see you at your house.

951
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,520
Uh, well, I thought
you'd take a long time.

952
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:18,941
I thought I'd finish by 10:00 p.m.,
but it's taking longer than expected.

953
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:20,567
Right.

954
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,487
I see.

955
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:27,199
I ran thousands of simulations
of this moment inside my head.

956
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:29,702
You look pretty serious.

957
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:33,247
What did you want to say?

958
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,457
But the moment
I looked into his eyes…

959
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,211
my mind went blank.

960
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,046
Well…

961
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,926
My ex-boyfriend
came to my house the other night.

962
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:48,846
It looks like he heard rumors
about us from his students.

963
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,891
He said I should just date him instead.

964
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,062
And what did you tell him?

965
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,815
I said his opinion doesn't matter to me.

966
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,067
Really?

967
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:05,029
"Really?" Is that it?

968
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,869
Is that what you wanted to say?

969
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:19,168
Is there another girl
you're seeing other than me?

970
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:20,669
What's wrong with me?

971
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,714
Why am I asking this
when I'm about to end everything?

972
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:29,928
There's none.

973
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,264
Really?

974
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,573
Excuse me.

975
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,785
Are you, uh…
Are you Park Jae-eon, by any chance?

976
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:54,661
Yeah.

977
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,165
So it's you, huh?

978
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:04,338
You fucking bastard!

979
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:06,924
Sir, stop it! Please, calm down!

980
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:09,051
-What are you doing?
-Move.

981
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,552
-Are you crazy?
-Move it!

982
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,554
-Why are you doing this?
-Get out of the way!

983
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:16,350
Na-bi!

984
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,241
Jae-eon has never been mine
to begin with.

985
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:15,784
But it feels like I've lost him.

986
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,537
How could Na-bi
date a guy like Jae-eon?

987
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,664
-My girlfriend?
-Call me.

988
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:22,207
Even if it isn't anything special.

989
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,252
My entire house is filled
with traces of Jae-eon.

990
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:26,170
That jerk.

991
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,380
I guess it worked, then.

992
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,048
Are you still avoiding me?

993
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,468
It's just that,
we didn't get to finish talking.

994
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:35,762
That's how it's always been with us.
We act like nothing happened.

995
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:37,556
I just got it. I thought of you.

996
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,600
-This is for me?
-Mm-hm.

997
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:41,393
'Cause I was jealous. Good luck today.

998
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,896
Who would like to volunteer
to assist Na-bi? Raise your hand.

999
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:46,064
We could have a lot of fun. And I think
they're amazing and interesting.

1000
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,025
Hello, Seol-a. I'm going there.

1001
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:50,402
How can he not even call once?

1002
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,945
I miss him.
