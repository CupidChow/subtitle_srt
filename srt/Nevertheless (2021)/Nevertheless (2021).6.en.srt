1
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:59,476
GYMNASIUM

2
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,020
One, two, three. Here we go.

3
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,293
Being apart…

4
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,213
was never an issue in a relationship.

5
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,173
I'm content with how it is.

6
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,925
No way! They dance with girls?

7
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,302
Oh, I wish I took this class.

8
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,763
Check out the guys without partners.

9
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,139
Poor little wallflowers.

10
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,100
They kind of remind me of you, really.

11
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,572
I think he likes Na-bi.

12
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,284
I bet he'll ask her out
when classes are over.

13
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,286
-Let's go.
-Okay.

14
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,580
Come on.

15
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,586
Yay! We got it all right!
I did good, yeah? I did!

16
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,171
We're gonna get an A+ for sure. Right?

17
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,355
Pretty good dancer.

18
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,900
-You saw?
-I passed by and watched.

19
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,071
I knew you'd be good at it.

20
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,407
I'm just glad I didn't step
on my partner's feet.

21
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,368
-Thanks, though.
-That's all I get?

22
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,203
And a free meal.

23
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,080
Cool.

24
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,836
You stayed up again?

25
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,422
I think you're working yourself too--

26
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,757
Thanks to you, I'm changing that.

27
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,010
Remember you asked me to?

28
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,389
That was about dating, you idiot.

29
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,018
Look, I tried applying lacquer on glass.

30
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,436
It didn't work.

31
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,813
It didn't stay on. It keeps slipping off.

32
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,483
-How do you fix that?
-Well, you know…

33
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,527
You'd have to roughen up
the surface first.

34
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,904
How do you know?

35
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,241
From my aunt, she does pottery.
I picked up a few things.

36
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,787
Well, I wanna learn, too.

37
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,165
I tried putting glaze on glass
and baking it.

38
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,875
It changed colors every single time.

39
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,876
It was so cool.

40
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,754
I can give you tips.

41
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,757
But I'm sure I'll always be better
than you at it.

42
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,887
Close enough to be with her,
yet keeping enough distance,

43
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,263
to not risk ever hurting her.

44
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,474
-You like that?
-No.

45
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,017
Is that bad?

46
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:48,978
Isn't it pretty?

47
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:58,196
EPISODE 6: THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS LOVE. NEVERTHELESS,

48
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,368
Listen, are you really just friends
with Jae-eon? Answer me.

49
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,288
Yeah. We're just friends.

50
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,915
That's a relief.

51
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,709
I was beginning to get worried
I said too much.

52
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,262
You know what? Don't cut your hair.

53
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,721
What?

54
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,515
It's Jae-eon.

55
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,476
He likes doing it with your hair tied.

56
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,462
Everyone,
look at what I just gave you.

57
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,090
What you have
is a list of commonly used colors,

58
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,343
and the different images,
and keywords that people, through time,

59
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,637
have seemed to associate
with these colors.

60
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,264
In varying shades and hues.

61
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,226
You may have noticed
that some colors are associated

62
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,395
with images that are total opposites.

63
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,275
This can simply be explained
by the differences in culture or country.

64
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,738
And by each individual's preference
and experience.

65
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,114
Good job, everyone.

66
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,742
Thank you, sir!

67
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,827
Finally it's over!

68
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,954
It's finally over!

69
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,081
-So that's it?
-Hand me my bag.

70
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,877
Where is Na-bi? Has anyone seen her today?

71
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,671
Na-bi? I haven't seen her today.

72
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,256
-Not me.
-Me, too.

73
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,550
-Have you?
-And no messages, too.

74
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,762
-Did she call you, Jae-eon?
-Mm.

75
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,305
Did something happen to her?

76
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,766
I'm trying to call her,
but she's not picking up.

77
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,101
I'm sure she's fine,
maybe she just skipped school.

78
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,228
-She's not you, Bit-na.
-What?

79
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,064
Well, we have to go.
Great job today, guys.

80
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,398
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

81
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,233
Hey, where are you going?
Where are you going?

82
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,194
-See ya!
-I'll buy you two bowls.

83
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,071
-I'll be back after lunch.
-Come on, Jin-su!

84
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,281
-Coming!
-How about some tteokbokki?

85
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,824
You up for tteokbokki?

86
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,327
-Sure.
-Great, did you bring your wallet?

87
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,329
Yeah, my treat.

88
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,872
Okay.

89
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,542
-Let's go.
-Let's go. Let's go.

90
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,318
NOODLE SHOP

91
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,808
I'm worried.

92
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,936
About what?

93
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,814
It's Na-bi. I can't seem to reach her.

94
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,609
Really?

95
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,736
Well, she was probably shocked.

96
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,780
-What?
-Nothing.

97
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,781
I think she's pretty.

98
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,577
You only saw her for a minute,
and you felt that?

99
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,245
I can see why you fell for her.

100
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,872
What are you talking about?

101
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,750
It isn't like that.

102
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,878
Chris and I broke up, by the way.

103
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:25,963
Why?

104
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,969
Don't act like you don't know. Seriously?

105
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,558
He said he thought he was okay
with me seeing other guys,

106
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,977
but, as it turns out, he really wasn't.

107
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,273
But I think I know how that feels now.

108
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,027
So that's it? You guys are over?

109
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,531
Mm-hm. I just had to let him go.

110
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,658
I did the right thing.

111
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,289
What? Isn't that what you've always hated?

112
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,875
Clingy girls all over you.

113
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,382
Ms. Yun Seol-a,
could you follow me, please?

114
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,886
You can go if you're busy.

115
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,638
I'm not. You go ahead.

116
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,697
WHERE ARE YOU?

117
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,701
YU NA-BI

118
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:45,960
The person you're trying
to reach is currently unavailable…

119
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,988
She just disappeared.

120
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,916
Thank you so much!

121
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,835
Hi, Na-bi!

122
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,588
Aunt Jeong-suk!

123
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,010
Oh, Na-bi, come here, dear.

124
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,055
It's so nice to see you again.

125
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,892
-Can I ask for a favor?
-Mm?

126
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,603
Could you not tell my mom
that I'm here visiting?

127
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,605
Why, are you in trouble with the law?

128
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,359
No, it's nothing like that.

129
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,943
Well, it's fine, then.

130
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,071
How long will you be staying?

131
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,324
Maybe… a week?

132
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,451
Oh? That long, huh?

133
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,580
What? Don't you want me around that long?

134
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,040
No, it's fine.

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,752
You know I can help out and do chores.

136
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:14,090
All right. I guess we can do the chores
that I've been putting off for so long.

137
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,341
We'll finally get it done.

138
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,677
For sure. You can count on me.

139
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,470
Ooh?

140
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,606
POTTERY WORKSHOP

141
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,820
This feels so great.

142
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,739
-Nice weather's today, huh?
-Yeah, it is.

143
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,617
Oh, by the way,
I saw Do-hyeok at the market.

144
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,411
What a fine young man he is.

145
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,287
Didn't know he was still around.

146
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,957
I remember it so well.

147
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,501
Before you went back to Seoul
when you were little,

148
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:54,380
all your friends came to see you off,
but Do-hyeok didn't come, did he?

149
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,297
No, he didn't.

150
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,299
Never was a child so blue.

151
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,094
You were just crying
and whining the entire trip.

152
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,971
What? No. That isn't true.

153
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,307
Of course, it was, and expected,
since you two were very close.

154
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,185
Yeah, that's right.

155
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,021
I guess, I really did
like Do-hyeok back then.

156
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,983
-Maybe more than like.
-It wasn't like that, stop teasing!

157
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,235
-It's not what I saw.
-Stop it!

158
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,574
-Oh, my, let me get that.
-No, it's okay, I got it.

159
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,161
-To the workshop first, right?
-Yes. Come on.

160
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,914
Let's go!

161
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,376
-Come down after you unpack.
-Yep, I will.

162
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,378
-See you later!
-I'll see you later.

163
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,303
You are so cute.

164
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,639
-What's gotten into you?
-You are!

165
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,141
-We better eat.
-No.

166
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,561
-No!
-Hey, lunch time is almost over.

167
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,816
I wanted to ask you.

168
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,985
Don't you think it's time
we tell the others about this?

169
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,029
-About what?
-About me and you.

170
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,991
Why? It's not like
we're getting married, dude.

171
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,952
But we're dating, and I want them to know.

172
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,787
Why keep it any longer?

173
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,247
Hmm…

174
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,375
No, I don't want to tell anyone yet.

175
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,335
Why don't you want to?

176
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,589
'Cause they're not gonna quit
talking about us when they find out.

177
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:05,302
Okay. Let's stop arguing
and just keep making out, huh?

178
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,472
You're just trying to change the subject,
but it's not going to work.

179
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,100
-No one's here, come on!
-Hold on a second. Let go of me first.

180
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,643
What are you two doing here?

181
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,728
We're having lunch!
What are you guys doing here?

182
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,814
Are you planning to make out
or something? Don't lie.

183
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,900
What are you talking about?
We're just friends, you know, platonic.

184
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,027
Wait. Let me ask you something.

185
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,197
I heard from someone
that Ms. Jo and Mr. An were seen

186
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,908
coming out of a motel
somewhere together. Is that true?

187
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,078
Nope. Not a motel, rather a house.

188
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,455
What? They were together in a house?

189
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,958
-Mm-hm.
-Wait, are they living together?

190
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,002
Well, even if they weren't,
it definitely means

191
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,504
there's something going on with them,
dating at the very least.

192
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,673
-Ugh, that's gross.
-Why is that gross?

193
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,383
'Cause they're so not right
for each other!

194
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,843
They're so different.

195
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,969
Yeah, that's ridiculous.

196
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,804
That's why I don't want
to believe the rumors.

197
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,558
But they… they spend
so much time together.

198
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,393
Maybe they just fell for each other.

199
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,741
YUN SOL

200
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,287
-Sol, hi.
-Hey, Na-bi!

201
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,497
-Why are you ignoring my calls, but…
-Hey!

202
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,250
…but answered Sol's?

203
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,378
Hey, Ji-wan.

204
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,089
You coming to the workshop?
Everyone's going, even Sol.

205
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,552
Um, I don't think I can.

206
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,637
Why not?

207
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,639
I thought we changed
the location because of you.

208
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,432
What? To where?

209
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,060
Yeah, you know the place
your noodle shop friend runs?

210
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,478
The guest house.

211
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,480
-You're coming here?
-"Here"?

212
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,398
Is that we're you're at right now?

213
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,818
No, I'm not.

214
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,072
But I know my aunt lives
near the guest house.

215
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,950
Are you staying at her place?
Until when, the weekend?

216
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,078
Yeah, but you know what…

217
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,455
I still can't come.

218
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:01,251
How come? You're already nearby.
Just come and hang out with us, please?

219
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,503
Well…

220
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,173
Would you know if Jae-eon is coming?

221
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:10,427
Huh? No, I think he said
he had other plans.

222
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,012
Oh, I see.

223
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,848
I'll try dropping by if I have time.

224
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,726
But I'd appreciate it
if you don't tell anyone I'm here.

225
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,728
I won't. My lips are sealed.

226
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,814
Just don't ignore my calls anymore.

227
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,525
Okay, great. It's a deal. Bye!

228
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,322
But didn't Jae-eon tell everyone
that he was coming, too?

229
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,533
-Yeah, he did.
-Then why did you lie?

230
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,160
Oh, my god. Did I really?

231
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,414
Whatever. I had to say that
to get Na-bi to change her mind.

232
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,500
I think you're just begging for trouble.

233
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,837
No way, it would be awesome
if they get back together because of us.

234
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,005
"Us"?

235
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,840
You're on your own.
Don't drag me into this.

236
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,759
But you're here and you heard everything,
so you don't have a choice.

237
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,928
She doesn't even like the guy, you know?

238
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,681
Yeah, I know that.

239
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,808
But seriously, when she asked me
if he was coming,

240
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,102
it sounded like
she really wanted him to be there.

241
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,730
But don't you dare tell Na-bi
that I said that, okay?

242
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,231
That's between us.

243
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,775
-All right.
-So, you wanna see a movie?

244
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,527
I have plans today.

245
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,114
Huh? What plans?
With whom? You didn't tell me.

246
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,283
With Se-hun. He just asked me to lunch.

247
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,869
I wonder what he's up to this time?

248
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,413
Well, nothing, I'm sure.

249
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,374
He just said something
about… asking help for work.

250
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,168
And a phone call can't do that?

251
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,013
You have to come to the workshop.

252
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,559
PARK JAE-EON
WHERE ARE YOU?

253
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,730
It's Jae-eon.

254
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,149
He likes doing it with your hair tied.

255
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,696
That's it, you're crazy.

256
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,326
Why are you so pathetic?

257
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,455
No, no. No.

258
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:11,965
I can't do this.

259
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,681
POWER OFF

260
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,797
Hey, Na-bi.

261
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,466
I heard you were in town.

262
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,594
Yeah. I just… I just got here today.

263
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,931
Are you going somewhere?

264
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,851
Huh? Yeah, I was going to see you.

265
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,893
Huh?

266
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,897
-I'm the reason you drove out?
-Mm-hm.

267
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:13,318
Well, you should've called first.
Good thing I was just walking around.

268
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,946
I did try to call you,
but your phone was off.

269
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,781
So I got worried, you know.

270
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,785
Oh, yeah, right.
I did turn it off before I left.

271
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,497
So, are you going anywhere?

272
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,833
Um, just walking, really.

273
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,794
Okay.

274
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,006
Then… wanna go to the beach?

275
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,670
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER

276
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,548
Why isn't he showing his face
when he's so handsome?

277
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,842
I'm sure he'd get
way more viewers if he did.

278
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,180
I'm starting to think you didn't change
the workshop venue because of money.

279
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,349
You just wanted
to see the guy, didn't you?

280
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,935
Of course not! Well, maybe I did.

281
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,770
But, look, it's not the only reason,
I swear.

282
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,815
Don't pout. I'm really just a fan.
I promise you.

283
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,944
Come here.

284
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,403
-My head!
-Why did you do that?

285
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,114
Seriously, it hurts. Hold me, come on.

286
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,534
Come on.

287
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,912
-Come on, why don't we go out?
-Huh?

288
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,164
We're always just cooped up
inside like this.

289
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,834
-It's getting pretty stuffy?
-No, it's not. Stop being silly.

290
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,462
Now, come on! Come here.

291
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,840
MYEONGWON-DONG, 26, DIMPLES

292
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,469
Why are you so heavy?

293
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,930
What? Who is it?

294
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,524
-Who was that?
-I don't know. Some random guy I met.

295
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,984
He was… Oh, gosh!

296
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,528
I can't even remember his name, really.

297
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,405
Kim…

298
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,158
What? I just dropped the call.

299
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,035
That's a lot weirder to me.

300
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,870
Why is a random guy calling you?

301
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,998
Well, beats me. If you want, I can ask.

302
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,794
The dating app, you deleted it?

303
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,007
Oh, the drama!

304
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,677
You… Could you please stop
trying to change me?

305
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,928
I feel so suffocated.

306
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,555
Oh, you do? I'm suffocating you?

307
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,266
Yeah, you just did,
by making a fuss over nothing.

308
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,519
What do you think
being in a relationship is, huh?

309
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,813
Why are you even dating me, anyway?

310
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,523
'Cause I like you, that's why.

311
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,108
-Oh, yeah, you like me?
-Yeah.

312
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,861
-You're not just saying that?
-I like you, yeah.

313
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,699
Or is it just when I'm in bed with you?

314
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,743
Seriously, is there really any difference?

315
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,829
Come on, Gyu-hyun, don't give me that.

316
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,584
We're having fun, right?
Why do you have to make it so complicated?

317
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,002
It's not complicated.

318
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,047
There's just nothing about you
that changed since we started dating.

319
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,757
Now you're talking nonsense.

320
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,218
I don't understand what's going on.
Why should I be the only one to change?

321
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,148
What are you doing?

322
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,453
I knew you'd be like this,
ugh, boring jerk.

323
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,179
It's been a while since I came here.
It's so nice.

324
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,934
You sure it's okay to hang out here?

325
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,812
-Don't you have a shop to open?
-Don't worry about it.

326
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,440
Actually, the noodle shop
and the guest house aren't opening yet.

327
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,818
So no problem, then.

328
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,361
Well, can I help you with anything?

329
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,655
'Cause I'm good at chopping and cooking.

330
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,073
I can assist you.

331
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,450
It's all done.

332
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,413
There's nothing else to do
but wait right here.

333
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,332
All right.

334
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,626
Okay.

335
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,676
Do you see this?

336
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,719
Yeah, I did.

337
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,847
I can't believe it. It's amazing.

338
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,516
Wait. Hold on,
I wanted to go somewhere else.

339
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,435
-This place is popular, too. You'll see.
-Where?

340
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,063
Here, look. Here it is, Sol.
It's nice and I think it's nearby.

341
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,191
-I reserved a table for two.
-That's cool.

342
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,819
If I knew that you were coming,
I would have done otherwise.

343
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,406
You see, the truth is,
I've always wanted to come here, really.

344
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,784
So when I found out you were meeting here,
I just got so excited.

345
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,744
It's like, how could I not come, right?

346
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,831
But then, if you're gonna talk
about something serious,

347
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,332
I can leave you alone.

348
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,877
So, is it, then?

349
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,712
Huh?

350
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,132
Oh, well, I think, um…

351
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,552
It's not. Nothing serious.

352
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,638
-I just, you know, wanted to grab a bite.
-Well, I'm paying for our meal, then.

353
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,224
No, no, no! My treat.
I asked you after all.

354
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,770
And yours, too, Ji-wan. It's my treat.

355
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,189
-Mm.
-Enjoy.

356
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,815
-Thanks so much.
-Thank you.

357
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,567
Look at that!
Hold on, let's take a pic.

358
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,823
This is awesome.
When did you prepare all this?

359
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,745
Honestly? When they told me
that you were coming to town.

360
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:00,832
You really don't wanna have this on video?

361
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,669
-I shouldn't be the only one seeing this.
-Well, I only care that you saw it.

362
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,674
What? How did you suddenly
get so good at sweet talk?

363
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,551
You dated a lot, huh?

364
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,262
No, no dating.

365
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,889
No dates at all?

366
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,724
Mm. Is that so wrong?

367
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,810
No, not wrong.
And I don't think it's weird, really.

368
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,145
Surprised, though.

369
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,356
I mean, you're, like, popular, you know?

370
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,442
Unless it's the image you want.
Like gentle and pure.

371
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,489
Well, I really don't know why.

372
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,826
But you see, I still can't get over a girl
who had a boyfriend.

373
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,162
Oh.

374
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,750
I get it.

375
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,128
Oh, I can't drink. I'm driving.

376
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,421
Yeah, right.

377
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,049
Then I'm drinking alone?

378
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,762
Oh, I know.
I can just drink water with you.

379
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,061
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

380
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,442
This is nice.

381
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,494
Are you… with someone?

382
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,538
Mm? What?

383
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:26,334
I… I mean, do you have, um…
a boyfriend now?

384
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,632
Not at the moment.

385
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,724
Eat up.

386
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,892
Yeah, let's. Looks good.

387
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,056
So I dated a jerk for a while,
longer than I should have.

388
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,558
And early this year, I called it off.

389
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,109
What? Why are you smiling?

390
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,486
Do you think that's funny, huh?

391
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,363
No, not at all.

392
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,699
Remember before?
You had a boyfriend here, too.

393
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,534
Did I?

394
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,996
What are you talking about?
The jerk was my first.

395
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,790
Huh? No, he wasn't.

396
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,710
It was the reason I backed out,
you said you were already dating someone.

397
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,754
"Backed out"?

398
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,471
Hey.

399
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,516
Aren't you driving? What's wrong with you?

400
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,309
You were actually my first love.

401
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,109
You serious?

402
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,115
I've always liked you secretly.

403
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,827
But suddenly, you were leaving for Seoul,
so I decided to tell you.

404
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,831
But you said you were dating someone,
so I decided to back out.

405
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,715
I told you I was dating?
I said those words?

406
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,469
Yeah, you said those words. But not to me.

407
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,973
Why can't I remember?

408
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,684
I guess I just blurted it out,
so I wouldn't get teased

409
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,477
about not having a boyfriend.

410
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,648
Hold on.

411
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,026
Is that the reason why you didn't come
to see me off when I left for Seoul?

412
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,779
Mm-hm.

413
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,824
What? I was really upset
about that, you jerk!

414
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:09,038
So then, would you have accepted me
if I confessed my feelings to you?

415
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,169
Well, I don't know.

416
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,296
But at least I would've stayed in touch.

417
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,883
We were best friends after all.

418
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,930
I guess everything would have been
different then, huh?

419
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,228
Well, we'll never know, will we?
Such an idiot.

420
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,572
-Keep your eye on the red dot.
-Okay.

421
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,283
One, two, three.

422
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,285
Whoa! See? Good job!

423
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,661
Now it's my turn.

424
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,849
You mind if I sit here?

425
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,269
You're already sitting there, though.

426
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,773
Are you here with someone?

427
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,067
I'm not with anyone.

428
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,127
Could you, uh, pass me the menu?

429
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,505
Sure.

430
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,565
Butterfly tattoo, it's pretty.

431
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,484
What meaning does it have?

432
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:06,573
The ugliness and pain of happiness,
and lack of freedom.

433
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,700
That's what the tattoo means.

434
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,034
Ahh.

435
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,246
But the truth is,
I just really like butterflies.

436
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,332
Oh, no judgement.
I also think butterflies are pretty.

437
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,334
But I heard some people say

438
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:22,005
that butterflies can actually blind you,
if you touch the wings and rub your eyes.

439
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,050
That really isn't true.

440
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,721
Um, butterfly wings
have peculiar powdered scales,

441
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:33,725
but it really can't be harmful to anyone,
it causes allergies, though.

442
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,729
-That can't be true.
-Funny, isn't it?

443
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,650
-What do you mean?
-What people know.

444
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,987
Butterflies are the ones that get hurt.

445
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,031
If they lose the scales on their wings,

446
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,867
they will also lose
their pretty patterns and colors.

447
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,661
And they won't be able to fly.

448
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,585
Do you want to see some now?

449
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,186
On my last vacation from the military,

450
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,731
my friend asked me to come with him
to some sort of exhibit.

451
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,568
To be honest, I didn't know
a single thing about art.

452
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,779
It was my first time
going to an art exhibit.

453
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,781
Hmm…

454
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,075
When we got there, I thought…

455
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,954
I saw… I saw someone
who looked just like you.

456
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,680
I was almost sure it was you,

457
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,225
but I froze, because I hadn't seen you
for a long time.

458
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,435
I regret it now.

459
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,815
But then… I saw you again on the bus.

460
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,151
That was when I knew for sure
it was really you back there.

461
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,155
Suddenly, my heart
was just beating like crazy.

462
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,241
Wasn't that stupid?

463
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,712
Hey, Do-hyeok.

464
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,800
-Do-hyeok!
-Na-bi. Did you sleep well?

465
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,762
Why did you give me the blanket
when you're the one sleeping outside?

466
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,473
No, it's fine. Mm!

467
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,270
-Yes.
-The thing about YouTube is…

468
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,564
-That's right.
-It's no joke.

469
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,274
You're talking
about views, right?

470
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,027
Getting one million views
is amazing.

471
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,613
-It's already uploaded.
-That's amazing.

472
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,157
-Do you have a channel?
-Our couple number 12.

473
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,408
Gyeong-jun?

474
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,077
When Jae-joon ordered noodles…

475
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,038
Gyeong-jun! Hey, can you hear me?

476
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,420
CELEBRATION DANCE

477
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,005
GETTING IN THE ZONE

478
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,219
You startled me.

479
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,054
And you know
the famous line of Hyeon-suk.

480
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,722
What the…

481
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,064
-I see you're not wearing your glasses.
-Mm.

482
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,860
What?

483
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,028
What… What is it?

484
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,455
-My glasses.
-What?

485
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,168
-Those are mine.
-What do you mean, they're yours?

486
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,795
Oh, they're yours. Jeez.

487
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,297
But where are my glasses?

488
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,048
Yours?

489
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,592
Oh.

490
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,302
Oh, right.

491
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,096
No wonder you looked a little weird.
I had the wrong ones on.

492
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,557
-Here.
-Thank you.

493
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,898
What? What now?

494
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,692
-Good thing it wasn't a stinker.
-What?

495
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,570
I heard it, you know.
You have always farted that loud.

496
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,946
What?

497
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,240
What are you talking about?
That's wasn't me!

498
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,659
But I heard it loud and clear.

499
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,661
-It was like a fart machine.
-I said it wasn't me!

500
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,872
-Why are you angry at me?
-Will you stop it?

501
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,373
-I told you, it wasn't me!
-Ooh!

502
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,835
How dare you?
God! Stop being an idiot, you jerk!

503
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,610
YU NA-BI

504
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,183
What are you doing here alone?

505
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,393
Mm.

506
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:36,939
By the way, did you see Na-bi anywhere?

507
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,190
No. No, I didn't.

508
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:39,984
Oh.

509
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,529
Are you coming with us?

510
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,365
-No. Not going.
-How come?

511
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,285
Everyone is going to wonder
why you skipped the workshop.

512
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,872
Is Na-bi going?

513
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,541
She's not coming either.

514
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,461
-You didn't know?
-Mm.

515
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,672
We're not talking much these days.

516
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,802
You did something wrong, didn't you?

517
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,847
Honestly…

518
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,266
I'm not sure.

519
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,437
Come on. You know what you did.
Don't lie to yourself.

520
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,399
But she still likes you, whatever it is.

521
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,194
And just asking, dude.

522
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,904
Can't you just be real with her?

523
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,538
Na-bi, please be careful
taking them out.

524
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,374
I will, Aunt Jeong-suk.

525
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,640
My tummy hurts.

526
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,850
Probably had too much to drink.

527
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,520
I guess you had fun last night.

528
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,315
-For starters, the food was delicious.
-I'm sure.

529
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,442
And the beach was just beautiful.

530
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,407
But I have to go back to Seoul soon.

531
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,033
I can't relax too much.

532
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,786
That's why you came, though.

533
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,580
Oh, would you mind
fixing that shelf before you go?

534
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,541
Sure, I can fix it.

535
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,128
Oh, look, they're turning out so pretty.

536
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,131
Yeah, but isn't this a little weird?

537
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,509
How come the colors turned out different?
It's the same glaze.

538
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,386
Well, it was a little windy earlier.

539
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,388
Even with the same glaze applied,

540
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,599
the color will always vary depending
on humidity or temperature.

541
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,102
So once you start baking them,

542
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,896
you don't get to decide
what colors they turn out to be.

543
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,774
But doesn't that annoy you or something?

544
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,028
Annoy me how? It's actually fun,
because it's unpredictable.

545
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,656
It's why I've been doing pottery
for so long.

546
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,033
I tried putting glaze
on glass and baking it.

547
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,036
It changed colors every single time.
It was so cool.

548
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,711
You both seem to agree on something.

549
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,422
Sorry, dear, what's that?

550
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,634
It's nothing.

551
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,803
It's getting really scary
sculpting, though.

552
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,223
It's like one single mistake
can ruin everything you've done.

553
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,269
I'm thinking maybe it would be better
if I went digital, you know.

554
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,605
Where I can easily save and undo my work.

555
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,774
Oh, no, you won't be living up
to your name, then.

556
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,943
You do know
why you were named Na-bi, right?

557
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,738
Mm-hm. You said you named me
after your favorite author--

558
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,366
No. You only said that for a school report
when you were little.

559
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,410
I made the whole thing up.

560
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,328
You did?

561
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,413
So the real story is,

562
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,916
your mother named you,
so your life would be as sweet as honey.

563
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,043
But butterflies don't always eat honey.

564
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,297
Smaller insects and poop
also give them the nutrients they need.

565
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,883
So whatever it is
that's happening in your life,

566
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,843
I'm sure you need it to grow, dear.

567
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,387
So you shouldn't fear it.

568
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,354
To be honest, I don't know if I can go on.

569
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,563
Whenever we're together,

570
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,316
she acts like I'm the only guy for her,
and no one else.

571
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,819
So it got me thinking,
"This girl might really care about me."

572
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,572
But when another guy catches
her attention,

573
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,324
she totally ignores me.

574
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,494
It really bums me out,
even when we're together.

575
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,288
She often tells me that she likes me.

576
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,166
And frankly, dude, I want to believe that,

577
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,834
But I can't help but doubt her.

578
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,130
And this really isn't me.

579
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:35,469
Maybe, you know,
the two of us should just be friends.

580
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,305
It's the first time
I've heard you talk this much.

581
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,476
Makes me wonder
why I opened up to you like that.

582
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,020
Have you tried being honest?

583
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,231
Telling her what you just said, you know?

584
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,774
No way, it won't work.

585
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,360
Being completely honest
to a person like that is difficult.

586
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,947
-Hm?
-It's more of a question of pride.

587
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,784
I already feel like a loser,
liking her more than she likes me.

588
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,160
It's pathetic.

589
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,371
Then what is it exactly
do you want from her?

590
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:06,667
I just wanna be assured of what we have,
and for her to be honest.

591
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,545
A bit unrealistic.

592
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,965
Having that certainty
can only weaken a relationship.

593
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,052
So, what should one do

594
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,263
to be certain of that?

595
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,932
Are you sure it'll help
whatever relationship you have?

596
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,977
You have a twisted way
of looking at things, you know?

597
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,062
You're the one who's twisted.

598
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,608
I'm sure she has her reasons
for staying with you at least.

599
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,169
SONG SEO-YEON: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
KIM EUN-JU: IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY TODAY?

600
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,019
KANG SEO-YEON: SHOULD'VE TOLD
ME IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY!

601
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,900
Do-hyeok. Come inside.

602
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:55,943
Yes.

603
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,776
This place is really pretty.

604
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:41,989
Wait.

605
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,617
I remember this place.

606
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,661
-Really?
-Yeah.

607
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,665
Some people say,

608
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,960
if you catch a falling leaf
and make a wish here in the wood,

609
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,587
your wish will come true.

610
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:01,633
No way! You believe that stuff?

611
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,260
I think it's romantic.

612
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,345
Why? Don't you?

613
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,347
Hm…

614
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:09,558
Actually, I don't.

615
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,143
Why?

616
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,438
Just because… There's no evidence.

617
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,107
For me, though, it's the mystery I like.

618
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,651
Because all you have to do is believe.

619
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,697
Is that so?

620
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,758
-I caught one.
-Go on, make a wish.

621
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,516
I don't believe in stuff like that.

622
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,310
Forget it. Give me that camera.

623
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,276
Hey, Do-hyeok.

624
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,071
You know, you should really try
making vlogs of your day-to-day.

625
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,740
You can film stuff like
how you open your restaurant,

626
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:10,410
or something that doesn't only show
your hands while cooking.

627
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,412
I bet you'll get way more views with that.

628
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,873
Do you think my videos are boring?

629
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,417
It's not that.

630
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,299
Look, all I'm saying is
you look good on camera.

631
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,761
If you show everyone what you look like,
subscribers will come pouring in.

632
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,806
-Stop it.
-No, come on! Let me take just one.

633
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,683
Just one. Please?

634
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,026
What on earth is that?

635
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,363
One, two, three.

636
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,031
See? You look really great!

637
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,826
-Now it's your turn.
-Oh, no, not me.

638
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,328
No, I don't look good in photos.

639
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,080
No, you're really pretty.

640
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,916
Hm?

641
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:03,338
Well, to be honest,
I've been taking pictures of you.

642
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,923
-Sorry.
-Like when?

643
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,467
-When we went to the beach.
-Do you have it now?

644
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,219
-Mm-hm.
-Let me see.

645
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,388
Go ahead.

646
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,932
Mmm.

647
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:20,731
Pretty, right?

648
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,358
Sure.

649
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,319
They do look pretty nice.

650
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,575
Really nice.

651
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,348
Surprise! Happy birthday.

652
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,724
Thank you.

653
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,227
-Do you have a gift for me?
-A gift?

654
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,231
Of course, silly.
Though I'm not really sure you'll like it.

655
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,705
-Did you want this that badly?
-I admit, I kinda lost my mind.

656
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,166
Wanted to take it from you.

657
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,838
And here's a confession. I lied to Na-bi.

658
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,216
Lied about what?

659
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,259
When I saw her,
she asked if you and I were dating.

660
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,220
And I said yes.

661
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,432
She believed me right away.

662
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,060
But I didn't expect her
to disappear like that.

663
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,688
So I'm sorry.

664
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:50,946
For what it's worth,

665
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,323
she left me with strong words.

666
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,013
We're here.

667
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,348
You should go.

668
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,309
You know,
I can come to pick you up tomorrow.

669
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,477
Oh, no, you don't have to.

670
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,938
I'll see you at the market.
I can go there on my own.

671
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,815
It's dangerous to go there on your own.

672
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,109
Well, bye. I'll see you tomorrow.

673
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,486
Okay…

674
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,496
PARK JAE-EON

675
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,922
PARK JAE-EON
WHERE ARE YOU? LET'S TALK.

676
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,152
Na-bi, have some apples.

677
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,613
Okay. Just finishing up.

678
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,874
"Where are you? Let's talk."

679
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,669
That means you're angry, right?

680
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,214
Why? What's with that random question?

681
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,176
I promised myself I wouldn't date.

682
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,345
Not after seeing
how my mom's life turned out.

683
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,931
When did you make that decision?

684
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,057
When I was little.

685
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,684
Actually, it was the day I left for Seoul.

686
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,270
I remember she came here crying and all.

687
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,605
Oh, that day.

688
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,483
She was really head over heels
for that guy.

689
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,569
It was intense, to say the least.

690
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,821
I tried warning her.

691
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,406
Told her he was a scumbag,
and she should break up with him,

692
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,117
but she didn't listen.

693
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,494
Yeah, and my mom just kept dating the guy.

694
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,831
But my guy, we're not even together.
I'm such an idiot.

695
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,749
This is really embarrassing.

696
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,876
I'm worse than her.

697
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,089
Look, dear, I believe there is always
something between two people.

698
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,596
To be quite frank,
I still respect your mother.

699
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,807
Because even if she gets hurt,

700
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,935
she never loses her passion
and can fall in love again.

701
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,689
That's ridiculous.

702
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,442
Your mom once told me, that dating someone

703
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:37,487
isn't about trying to find
the nicest person out there.

704
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,823
It's about meeting someone
who's special to you.

705
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,078
And that's why I think she failed
every single time.

706
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,288
You're wrong about that.

707
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,498
If it's true she failed every single time,

708
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,001
then how could she have gotten
such a precious daughter?

709
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,464
Here.

710
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,803
The shelf's a bit crooked.

711
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,848
What, no. I already drilled the holes in.

712
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,019
Oh, jeez, it is crooked.
What's wrong with this thing?

713
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,792
You look handsome, as always.

714
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:33,877
Come in.

715
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,175
Happy birthday, dear.

716
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,762
I heard that art's students carry
a lot of things around,

717
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,306
especially those who major
in sculpture, like you.

718
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,517
This is too much.

719
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,228
Just let me do this for you.

720
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,111
Thank you.

721
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,037
Mom.

722
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,958
Did your performance go well?

723
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,293
Yes. I'm performing in Paris next.

724
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,547
What is Paris like now?

725
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,300
Paris is… quite nice.

726
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,178
Wanna come with me?

727
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,140
I know someone who wants to go.

728
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,768
It must be somebody you really like.

729
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,563
Well, no.

730
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,025
Just someone annoying.

731
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,867
Jae-eon, dear.

732
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,121
Have you ever wondered
what I regret most in my life?

733
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,333
Not knowing how I really feel.

734
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,668
No, wait.

735
00:54:58,586 --> 00:54:59,838
It's pretending not to know.

736
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,261
How can somebody
who neglects himself and his heart

737
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,388
expect any love in return?

738
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,594
Done.

739
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,087
How can somebody
who neglects himself and his heart

740
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,172
expect any love in return?

741
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,135
I know very well that a person
who can't love himself

742
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,929
and can't love someone else

743
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,180
can never be happy.

744
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,349
Isn't that what you've always hated?

745
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,434
Clingy girls all over you?

746
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,228
What's the point of all this?

747
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:41,064
You always pull back when it matters most.

748
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,609
Right? You just want me there
when you need me,

749
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,694
but when I'm the one who needs you,
I can't count on you.

750
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,363
So don't worry.

751
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,782
Because it won't happen again.

752
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,562
MISSED CALLS
PARK JAE-EON

753
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,036
PARK JAE-EON

754
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,586
YANG DO-HYEOK

755
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,895
You made all these for me.

756
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,900
You kept them all this time?
I'm touched.

757
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:13,072
Of course, I did.
They're from you. Good night.

758
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,951
Good night to you, too.

759
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,342
Hey, Na-bi.

760
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,677
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

761
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,729
Did you sleep well?

762
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:47,815
-Yeah. And you?
-Me too.

763
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,234
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

764
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,096
Careful.

765
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,490
Here, let me.

766
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,496
-Uh, excuse me, sir?
-Yeah?

767
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,747
Would you mind watching these?

768
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:45,832
No problem.

769
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,333
-Thank you.
-Go ahead.

770
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,585
Thank you very much, sir.

771
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,094
Hey, why don't we try these?

772
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,847
These look good.

773
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:03,808
-Excuse me?
-Yes.

774
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,602
-Could we have some sweet potatoes?
-Sure.

775
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,769
Good morning.

776
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,688
Oh, my, you brought
a girlfriend this time?

777
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,149
Oh, goodness!

778
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:13,693
You look like such a sweet couple.

779
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,403
Oh, we're…

780
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,489
-Thank you.
-Why aren't you saying anything?

781
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:20,408
Almost ready.

782
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,579
-That will be 8,000 won.
-Oh, thank you. Put them here.

783
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,539
-Here.
-Thank you.

784
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,499
-Potatoes?
-Yeah, just a few will do.

785
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,584
All right.

786
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,086
You look so happy, kid.

787
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,255
That's 13,000 won.

788
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,340
Thirteen thousand, huh?

789
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,716
I'll give you a discount.

790
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,344
And thank her.
I like her, she's so pretty.

791
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,888
-Ten thousand will do.
-Thank you, ma'am.

792
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,973
-Such a pretty girl.
-Here you go.

793
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,185
-You got a discount 'cause of me.
-I'll cook something nice.

794
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,228
-Thank you, bye.
-Thank you.

795
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,064
It's so pretty.

796
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,231
How much for the flowers?

797
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,484
Those? Twenty-three thousand.

798
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,486
-These are 23,000?
-Yep.

799
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,363
-We'll get some.
-Okay.

800
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,782
-Wait.
-What?

801
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,034
Thank you, we'll just come back next time.

802
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,000
Looks like it's broken.

803
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,713
Oh, Do-hyeok, what did you do?

804
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,924
-I didn't do anything.
-Jeez. Look at this.

805
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,426
Oh! Hey, Na-bi.

806
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:25,139
Wow, is this really our Na-bi?

807
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,017
-Who is…
-Oh, sorry.

808
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,435
I guess you don't remember her.

809
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,437
She's my cousin, Do-yeon.

810
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:37,151
Oh, I see. Yeah, Do-yeon.

811
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,403
It's been a long time.

812
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,823
-Wow, you really are unbelievable.
-Don't say anything weird.

813
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,242
What? I'm surprised! She looks so pretty!

814
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,202
-That's true.
-No.

815
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,496
You're all grown up.
I didn't recognize you.

816
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,916
By the way, your bike, it's broken.
And you have a flat.

817
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,377
-You better not ride it.
-Oh, did I break the bike?

818
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,503
Oh, no, no.

819
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:58,256
Someone must have messed it up
while we were shopping.

820
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:01,134
-Let's go get it fixed.
-Mm.

821
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,468
No need for that.

822
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,262
I mean, you can ride on one together.

823
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,764
While I have this broken one fixed.

824
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,936
Go on. Oh, come on. You two go ahead.

825
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,646
See you guys!

826
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,567
-See you later, Do-yeon.
-Thank you!

827
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:32,498
What's that?

828
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,835
Oh, I just want you to be comfortable.

829
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,010
Get on.

830
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,148
Let's go.

831
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:24,091
So, are you going to sleep over
with your friends?

832
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,844
No, I'm staying at my aunt's,
maybe drop by, or whatever.

833
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,515
Okay. I'll just take you home, then.
I have something to tell you.

834
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:31,891
What is it?

835
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,267
Relax, I'll tell you later.

836
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,038
Hey, where do you want me
to put all these?

837
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:56,958
Over there. You know what?
I'll take care of those.

838
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:46,674
Hey, how are you? I'm Park Jae-eon.

839
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,969
I'm good, how are you? I'm Yang Do-hyeok.

840
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,324
How have you been?

841
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:56,494
-Mm. So-so.
-Haven't been doing so well.

842
01:05:56,577 --> 01:06:00,498
That familiar intoxicating scent
has come to haunt me once more.

843
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:01,540
He is charming.

844
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,626
Now, if you went after him,
I wouldn't mind at all.

845
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,670
For some reason,
those two look like newlyweds.

846
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,172
To be honest,
Na-bi really is my first love.

847
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,217
What's your relationship to Jae-eon?
Are you two close?

848
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,094
There's nothing between us.

849
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:16,722
I kept thinking about you.
I've missed you more than you'll know.

850
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,224
You already have a girlfriend.

851
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:19,141
Is that the issue?

852
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,394
I think it's about time
you stop playing games with me.

853
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,020
It's time for us to end this.

854
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,397
-Stop it.
-What?

855
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,273
-This whole thing.
-Where's Na-bi?

856
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,526
-She's too tired to come.
-She's not coming?

857
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:31,445
All you have to do is tell me
that you don't want any of this.
