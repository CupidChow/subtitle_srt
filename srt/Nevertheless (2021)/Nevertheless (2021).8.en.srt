1
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,596
Na-bi's really gonna love this.

2
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,181
Hey, Do-hyeok!

3
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,475
Hey, you made it.

4
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,062
Hey, what happened here?

5
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,023
-I got hurt just a little.
-How? Is it bad?

6
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,316
Do you need to get checked?

7
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,152
It's all good, so don't worry.
Na-bi already took care of it.

8
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,904
Gosh, it must have hurt.

9
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,697
You should have been more careful.

10
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,450
Where's Na-bi? Isn't she with you?

11
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,953
Uh, she said that she was
way too tired to come tonight.

12
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,038
She's not coming?

13
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,623
Are you that upset?

14
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,085
Um, so she went back
to her aunt's place, right?

15
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,420
Hm, yeah, probably. What's wrong?

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,714
It's nothing.

17
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,511
By the way, have you seen Jae-eon
anywhere around?

18
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,101
Do-yeon, take care of the guests for me.

19
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,436
What? Wait, where are you going?

20
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:53,363
EPISODE 8: I KNOW IT'S A LIE.
NEVERTHELESS,

21
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,097
YANG DO-HYEOK

22
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,859
Is it really okay?

23
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,572
If we keep going,

24
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,826
I don't think I'll be able to let go.

25
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,153
Oh, there you are.

26
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,113
I was with Do-yeon, she said you left.

27
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,448
Oh.

28
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,450
I was about to.

29
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,536
-I'll drive you home.
-No, it's fine. You don't have to.

30
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,955
I know I don't. I want to.

31
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,500
Okay, sure.

32
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,063
Na-bi?

33
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,981
Hm?

34
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,443
Feels like the timing
is all messed up now.

35
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,946
Timing?

36
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,197
Uh…

37
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,140
What is all this?

38
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,910
It's a flower called lisianthus.

39
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,578
And it means…

40
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,793
Will you accept them?

41
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,174
Do-hyeok.

42
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,887
I think you're a really great guy.

43
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,934
-So--
-But you were right

44
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,478
when you said that the timing
is all messed up.

45
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,317
I don't think I can be
in a relationship right now.

46
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,241
Because of Park Jae-eon?

47
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,122
Honestly, I can't say that it's not.

48
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,292
He's kinda why I wanted
to come all the way out here.

49
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,211
So you wanna be with him again, then?

50
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,509
I don't know what I want.

51
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,639
Have I disappointed you?

52
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,516
Yeah.

53
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,230
But I already knew
what I was getting myself into,

54
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,149
so this is nothing.

55
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,487
I still got to be with you.
It was worth it.

56
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,739
Don't say that.
You deserve so much better.

57
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,990
You deserve someone--

58
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,825
Don't say anything else.

59
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,745
It might just hurt me more.

60
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,500
All I know is I care about you a lot.

61
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,669
So much that I don't know what to do.

62
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,177
I like you. I really do.

63
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,437
And I understand how you feel.

64
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,775
Believe me, you shouldn't be
so hard on yourself.

65
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,242
Sorry.

66
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,870
I don't even know why I'm crying anymore.

67
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,670
Can I give you a hug?

68
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,422
Please don't.

69
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,215
Just cry it out.

70
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,426
You'll feel much better after.

71
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,137
No, I seriously doubt that.

72
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,754
I lied.

73
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,717
I know exactly why I was crying.

74
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,062
It's 'cause I felt pathetic.

75
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,495
Did you get her home safely?

76
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,966
You really like her, don't you?

77
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,593
Yeah.

78
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,094
And I don't play games.

79
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,640
Unlike somebody else I know.

80
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,354
Whatever we've got going on,

81
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,731
it's none of your business.

82
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,404
Do I have that much of a hold on her?

83
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,247
You don't. You're wrong.

84
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,749
And she actually told me

85
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,668
you guys were a mistake.

86
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,586
She wants to just forget all about it.

87
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,300
Hey, Aunt?

88
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,894
What the…

89
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,614
Hmm… Hmm…

90
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,909
It's still gonna take a while.
Let's go wait outside.

91
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,035
Okay.

92
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:07,792
Hey, tell you what.

93
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,919
I can finish up the rest,
and you can wash up there.

94
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,920
Right.

95
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,073
It was your idea to get Na-bi
to come here, wasn't it?

96
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,124
-Hey, Aunt?
-Oh, you're up.

97
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,793
Did you sleep well?

98
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,253
Why are you here?

99
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,548
A pottery lesson.
Your aunt just gave me one.

100
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,551
Well, this morning, he came,

101
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,553
and he told me
he was a good friend of yours.

102
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,681
He said he wanted to learn pottery,
so I showed him some

103
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,725
of my special techniques
while you were asleep.

104
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,144
But you only just met him today.

105
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,438
You should've
at least asked me first.

106
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,023
Isn't he your friend?

107
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,237
-Well, yeah, he is, but--
-Then it's fine.

108
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,573
So we can eat now. Want some breakfast?

109
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,953
Sure.

110
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,079
What are you doing?

111
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,581
You two can catch up.

112
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,374
Where are you going?

113
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,229
What are you doing here?

114
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,691
I wanted to meet your aunt, that's all.

115
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,818
Please stop kidding around.

116
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,529
I didn't get to finish what we started.

117
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,740
What are you talking about?

118
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,871
Listen, just forget about yesterday.

119
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,459
So, should I take that to mean…

120
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,713
that what happened last night
was… just for fun?

121
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,509
It was just a mistake.

122
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,638
We were both drunk, you know that.

123
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,600
Okay.

124
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,727
If that's how you feel about it.

125
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,146
He's such a coward.

126
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,399
And you and Do-hyeok?

127
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,068
Are you guys dating?

128
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,696
You know, even if we were,
it's none of your business.

129
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,412
Man, you're so cold as ice.

130
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,832
You really know how to hurt me, Na-bi.

131
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,294
Na-bi.

132
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:58,838
Excuse me.

133
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,382
Is there something specific you like?

134
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,925
I gotta go. I'm so sorry.

135
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,969
Oh, you won't join us anymore?

136
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,054
Why? It won't take that long.

137
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,597
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

138
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,059
I really loved your jangjorim.
It's too bad.

139
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,936
You've tried
my jangjorim before?

140
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,062
But how?

141
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,523
The only one I've sent that to is Na-bi.

142
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,946
Can I come here again?
For more pottery lessons?

143
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,447
Of course, you can.

144
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,828
He's really talented.
He's got a knack for it.

145
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,581
If I train him right,
he could be my new assistant.

146
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,540
No way.

147
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,626
I should get going.

148
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,378
Okay.

149
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,591
See you in Seoul.

150
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,093
Take care now.

151
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,853
Let's go eat.

152
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,786
I thought I was done
with the past,

153
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,997
but it keeps coming back.

154
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,167
-Ta-da! Enjoy your food, guys!
-Awesome, thanks!

155
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,252
-Thanks a lot! Thanks!
-Thank you.

156
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,338
Hang on, isn't Jae-eon gonna join us?

157
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,465
I don't know.
I guess he's not up yet.

158
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,091
He said he had other plans today.

159
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,177
-You mean he's gone?
-What kind of plans?

160
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,307
Uh, I don't know, he didn't really say.

161
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,977
-And Na-bi?
-She went over to her aunt's.

162
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,646
Oh.

163
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,316
Hm…

164
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,611
Hey. What about Gyu-hyun? He's not eating?

165
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,491
I don't know. Guess he's not hungry.

166
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,204
I feel like I've been hit by a bus.

167
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,790
Do you even remember
anything from last night?

168
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,752
I remember that we decided
to play a bunch of drinking games.

169
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,837
Everything after that's a big blur.

170
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,799
Well, duh. Why did you have to drink
so much on your own?

171
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,842
-Jeez, girl.
-Yeah, and poor Sol.

172
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,304
She even had to drag you to your room,
and get you all cleaned up, you know?

173
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,516
Look, Sol's not always
gonna be there to save you, you know.

174
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,643
It's time for you to learn
to stand up on your own

175
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,311
-and get it together.
-Oh, wow.

176
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,271
That's really rich, coming from you.

177
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,982
-If you didn't have Gyu-hyun--
-Shut up.

178
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,149
Right.

179
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,195
Mm…

180
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,201
Darn it.

181
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,397
CENTRAL BUS TERMINAL

182
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,455
Na-bi.

183
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,457
Hey, Do-hyeok.

184
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,419
I'm glad that I caught you just in time.

185
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,297
You caught me off guard.
Were you waiting long?

186
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,174
I wanted to see you off this time.

187
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:32,843
Oh.

188
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,557
Have a safe trip.

189
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,559
Mm-hm.

190
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,770
I hope the restaurant's a huge success.

191
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,648
I plan to experiment more with content
like you said to,

192
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,525
-change things up a bit.
-Mm.

193
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,693
Sounds like a great idea.

194
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,947
Maybe you could check them out,
once I'm done?

195
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,115
Yeah, sure thing.

196
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,576
I'll watch them,
and I'll tell you what I think.

197
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,500
Here, don't expect much,
but I made those for you.

198
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,881
Well, thanks a lot.

199
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,467
I feel like you're always giving me stuff.

200
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,594
Don't sweat it.

201
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,766
I should go now. Take care, okay?

202
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,644
-Mm-hm, you take care, too.
-Mm-hm.

203
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,490
They look so great.

204
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,926
Na-bi? I've given this some thought.

205
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,848
And I'm not gonna give you up so easily.

206
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,268
Not until you tell me
you found someone better,

207
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,312
or that I really don't stand a chance.

208
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,734
I'll call you later.

209
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,862
Bye, for now.

210
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,523
It's so pretty.

211
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,845
Go on. I'll bring the car
back to the rental place.

212
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,555
-Thank you.
-Thanks!

213
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,140
-See you later.
-Bye.

214
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,433
-Take care.
-Where are you going?

215
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,351
We're going home.

216
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,978
-Home?
-See you, Se-hun!

217
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,021
-Going to the studio, bye.
-Bye.

218
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,487
Aren't you going?

219
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,828
Oh, I'm melting.
It's super hot today, right?

220
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,330
I know! Wanna get some bingsu?

221
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,958
I wanna go straight home.

222
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,419
I don't wanna eat all by myself.

223
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:39,965
Is it true?

224
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,842
You don't remember?

225
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,261
Huh? Last night?

226
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,429
Mm.

227
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,180
When I brought you back to your room.

228
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,933
And then, after that…

229
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,769
You know, it's such a blur,
I really must have blacked out.

230
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,856
Oh, I should really
quit drinking for good.

231
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,984
So, did I say something bad
to you last night?

232
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,152
Yeah.

233
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,654
Oh, really?

234
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,867
Whatever I said,
I'm really sorry about that, Sol.

235
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,870
If I try to drink again,
you have my permission to knock me around

236
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,456
till I come to my senses,
till I get a grip.

237
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,544
I was kidding. Nothing happened.

238
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,214
Oh, I hate you! You really had me there!

239
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,344
I'm going home now.

240
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,095
I'm beat.

241
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,473
Oh, okay. Get home safe.

242
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,231
Get out of the car.

243
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,025
Hey.

244
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,112
Have we broken up?

245
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,364
If that's what you want.

246
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,950
It is, right?

247
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,415
Listen.

248
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,836
From the very start, you and I both knew
what we were getting into--

249
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,796
Yeah, I know that.

250
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,384
But I think we were better off
just being friends.

251
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,805
You said it yourself,
it's tough dating someone like me.

252
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,186
Dude, is that what this is really about?

253
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,481
-I thought you'd be over that by now.
-Honestly, it's been tough for me, too.

254
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,777
We've been fighting a lot
since we started going out.

255
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,655
Do you even wanna be with me?

256
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,948
It's only been a while.

257
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,742
Don't you think it's too early
to ask me something like that?

258
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,580
Well, obviously, neither one of us
is willing to change or compromise.

259
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,917
So I think it's for the best
if we just end things here.

260
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,420
Yeah, sure.

261
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,464
Let's just be friends.

262
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,465
Are you serious?

263
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,051
You were the one
who said we were better off as friends.

264
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,388
We were friends for so long,
before we started going out.

265
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,181
What's the problem? I don't get it.

266
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,976
I mean, yeah.
I guess we could be friends again.

267
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,979
But I don't know.

268
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,732
You might just ask me
to be friends with benefits.

269
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,652
I'm not gonna do that, I swear.

270
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,571
Let's just be friends from now on.

271
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,824
No one knows about the two of us.

272
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,868
I'll do my best
to keep it on the down-low.

273
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,412
You don't have to worry.

274
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,002
Here I am…

275
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,713
back to where it all began.

276
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,608
Are you out here to work?

277
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,446
No, I'm just gonna have a quick smoke.

278
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,198
I gotta return the car.

279
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,951
You must be beat.

280
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,744
I'm sure you're pretty beat, too.

281
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,704
From what?

282
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,666
I should never have told you
that Na-bi was coming along, too.

283
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,338
Well, something good still came out of it.

284
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,256
Like what?

285
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,259
A new perspective.

286
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,429
Things are over with my girl.

287
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,348
Why?

288
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,183
I just feel so worn out.

289
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,018
And she does, too.

290
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,562
I guess it's true.

291
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,438
There are just some people
who never change.

292
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,149
I guess.

293
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,534
It's been a while.

294
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,871
Oh, hey, Dimples.

295
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,665
Hello!

296
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,542
Hey, how come you were ignoring me?

297
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,920
What? When? Oh, yeah, right.

298
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,339
I was with my boyfriend then.

299
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,341
Boyfriend? You've got a boyfriend?

300
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,262
Mm. I mean, I used to, but he dumped me.

301
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,140
For real? What? Why'd he do that?

302
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,143
I don't know.

303
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,063
Hey. What do you think
makes relationships last?

304
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,899
For me?

305
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,944
I guess it's just spending quality time
with the one you care about.

306
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,905
Like going out, or spending hours
just talking on the phone.

307
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,866
Oh, you're kidding.
What's wrong with you guys?

308
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,161
Why? What does make a relationship last?

309
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,831
Lots of kissing and having sex
with that one person.

310
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,917
Hang on.

311
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,086
You didn't say that
to your boyfriend, right?

312
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,212
No, I…

313
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,381
I guess.

314
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,425
Yeah, I guess I did.

315
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:17,469
Ah.

316
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,179
Now I get why you were dumped.

317
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,394
What's up, gorgeous?

318
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,022
I'll be right over.

319
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,107
Okay.

320
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,085
I kept thinking about you.

321
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,172
I've missed you more than you know.

322
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,597
And I still don't hear from you.

323
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,683
You're so predictable.

324
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,070
I'M THROWING AWAY ALL YOUR STUFF

325
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,825
But at least this time,
it doesn't hurt as much.

326
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,039
Have I gotten used to feeling this way?

327
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,299
YANG DO-HYEOK

328
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,848
-Hey, Do-hyeok.
-Hey, Na-bi.

329
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,099
You get home okay?

330
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:49,144
Yeah. I was just about
to text you, actually.

331
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,230
-Oh, and the brownies were great.
-Oh, good.

332
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,773
I had never made brownies before.

333
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,401
You're so good at everything.

334
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,405
The cake you made for my birthday
was really great, too.

335
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,782
Well, I know how much you love chocolate.

336
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,242
So I worked hard on those.

337
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:07,412
And, you know, 'cause of you,
I wanna be a pastry chef.

338
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,831
What? Seriously? You're kidding, right?

339
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,834
Obviously.

340
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,628
All right, it's not that funny.

341
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,218
It's really nice to hear your voice.

342
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,054
It's so quiet here now.

343
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,099
This whole town seems empty without you.

344
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,019
Your neighbors
won't appreciate you saying that.

345
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,395
They'll understand.

346
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,689
All I have to do is tell them how I feel.

347
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,736
You're being a little overdramatic.

348
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,614
So, what are you up to right now?

349
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,116
Well…

350
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,701
Getting ready for the exhibit.

351
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,329
I have spent the past couple
of days just resting.

352
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,581
Lots to catch up on.

353
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,418
Well, I might be going to Seoul very soon.
Wanna meet up?

354
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,340
Yeah, sure.

355
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,259
-Can I bring you anything?
-You don't have to do that.

356
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,263
You're coming all the way here,
so it's my turn to treat you.

357
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,483
EMOTIONAL LABOR
IS HARDER THAN PHYSICAL LABOR

358
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,068
What the…

359
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,196
That's so much better.

360
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,697
They're so loud, right?

361
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,699
Are you kidding me?

362
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,952
I was actually just about to turn it up.

363
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,579
-What? It's not loud to you?
-It's too loud for you?

364
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:35,083
Wow, your hearing is terrible.
You play music loudly, don't you?

365
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,709
That's not good for you, you know?

366
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,002
You might go deaf doing that.

367
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,255
You turned it down way too low.
I can't hear a thing.

368
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,675
Okay. Bring it up to three.

369
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,593
-Huh? No.
-Just to three. It won't be that loud.

370
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,679
-My ears hurt. What's with you?
-Bring it up to ten, then.

371
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,347
-Just bring it up to ten.
-It's fine now.

372
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,390
-Give me the remote, please.
-Hey!

373
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,641
-Give it to me!
-Will you stop…

374
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,612
Are you okay?

375
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,823
Are you hurt?

376
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,578
No. I'm okay.

377
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,038
I'm all good.

378
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,587
This is my work.

379
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,297
Wow.

380
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,513
So you made this? To represent insects?

381
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,850
-Yeah. Butterflies.
-Oh, wow.

382
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,728
What is it about the butterfly
that inspired you?

383
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,313
That they crave freedom.

384
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,315
Well, I can really see it.

385
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:49,741
-I'm just so drawn to them.
-Oh, yeah, I understand why.

386
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,245
Thanks for this.

387
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,538
-Sure.
-Thank you.

388
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,541
Wow. This place makes the best tteokbokki.

389
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,792
-Oh, yeah?
-Do they really?

390
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,547
-Oh, Na-bi!
-Hi.

391
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,632
You been working late?

392
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,216
Yes.

393
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,760
Come have some tteokbokki.

394
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,763
-Where are the chopsticks?
-Come on, sit down.

395
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,098
There, chopsticks.

396
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,351
-Here you go.
-Thanks a lot.

397
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,062
How's it coming along?
I'm looking forward to seeing your piece.

398
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,563
Jae-eon volunteered to be her assistant,

399
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,316
so I'm sure it'll be great
once they're done with it.

400
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,443
Speaking of Jae-eon,
I saw him just now.

401
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,363
And he was talking
to some foreigners outside.

402
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,280
Who were they?

403
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,157
They're delegates from VCU.

404
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,284
They saw some of his work,
and asked to talk to him.

405
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,577
Awesome!

406
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,955
So then, they were
scouting Jae-eon just now?

407
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,040
Yeah. It would make sense,
they came all this way.

408
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,042
The symposium gives them
the perfect chance

409
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,170
to check out the students
they can scout and weigh their options.

410
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,840
Hm, wow. He's too good
to just be an assistant.

411
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:51,135
No, that's ridiculous.
It's art, no one's too good.

412
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,055
I don't think so. Some people are gifted.

413
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,850
I think Jae-eon's someone
who's gonna be an artist for sure.

414
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,102
You know, kinda like Su-yeong.

415
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,436
Mm, I think you're right.

416
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,772
You don't have
to be an artist, you know?

417
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,149
There are lots of other jobs
related to our major.

418
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,151
I guess.

419
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,861
But only if you're talented enough.

420
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,365
My parents worked so hard
just so I could come here,

421
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,410
'cause they thought
we'd finally have an artist in the family.

422
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,120
All that money went down the drain.

423
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,831
I feel terrible.

424
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,876
Hey, cheer up, Ji-wan.
I'm sure they didn't expect much.

425
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,378
Excuse me?

426
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,007
Na-bi, you'll hear
from the exchange program soon.

427
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,591
Is your portfolio almost done?

428
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,302
Oh… Yeah.

429
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,138
Uh, I'm working on it.

430
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,598
And my piece for the exhibit,
so we'll see.

431
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,226
"We'll see"? What do you really wanna do?

432
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,103
Uh…

433
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,773
I'm not sure, uh…

434
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,778
I haven't made up my mind yet,
so if I do get it--

435
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,531
You have to make up your mind
about what you want.

436
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,241
Why do you wanna go to Paris?

437
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,496
Are you doing the interview right now?

438
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,083
Working hard is great and all,

439
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,294
but I think that you need
to focus on one thing.

440
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,296
-This is a critical time.
-I know.

441
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,175
I just don't wanna get my hopes up,
and end up with nothing.

442
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,302
Hey, we all feel that too, you know.

443
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,220
Even us grad students have doubts.

444
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,432
There has to be something
that you want more.

445
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,935
It's time you figure out what that is.

446
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,272
Right.

447
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,662
Something that I want more?

448
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,623
I thought I had already found it.

449
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,712
Hey, let me. Where do you want it?

450
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,964
No, it's okay. I got it.

451
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,383
But I'm your assistant, it's my job.

452
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,760
Let me handle it.

453
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,470
I can do this on my own.

454
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,432
Oh, and… I swung by the office.

455
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,017
Gyeong-jun told me everything.

456
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,186
You got scouted? Good for you.

457
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,438
You going to the US?

458
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,440
Well, I'm gonna give it some thought.

459
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,861
Hm… I see.

460
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,492
Oh, and, can I throw out
the stuff you left at my place?

461
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,536
You still have them?

462
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,289
Not for long.

463
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,291
Don't throw them out. I'll go get them.

464
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,669
Okay, great.

465
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,882
Do you have a lot of work left?

466
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,761
Well…

467
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,013
I'm actually done.

468
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,976
Why do you ask?

469
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,270
We gotta be somewhere. Have you forgotten?

470
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,300
INTERNATIONAL ART FAIR

471
00:36:58,841 --> 00:36:59,842
Come on.

472
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,075
You said you wanted to see this.

473
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,335
So tell me. You like it?

474
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,545
I don't really know.

475
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,133
Maybe I can take a closer look.

476
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,218
Mm.

477
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,066
When did you buy a car?

478
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,569
Oh, I got it
as a birthday gift from my mom.

479
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,822
She's so generous.

480
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,158
I haven't lived with her since I was ten.

481
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,451
Guess she just feels guilty.

482
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,873
I enjoyed the exhibit.

483
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,293
I think I'll come back.

484
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,922
I get it. There's just something
about seeing the pieces in person.

485
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,133
I just don't know
if I'll come back, though.

486
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,342
Why?

487
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,845
It's not 'cause I didn't enjoy it.

488
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,266
This place brings back bad memories.

489
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,393
Really?

490
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,023
I remember seeing someone
so beautiful here.

491
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,775
And it was love at first sight.

492
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,695
Sure, I bet it was.

493
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,905
I remember it was snowing.

494
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,657
Spare me the details.

495
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,743
It was an exhibit for a new artist.

496
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,494
What was that artist's name?

497
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,748
I got so bored, I was about to leave.

498
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,166
But I saw this girl,

499
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,084
standing in front of this piece
for so long.

500
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,087
Like you were just now.

501
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,470
And then one day,

502
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,764
I ran into that girl again.

503
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,311
I was startled.

504
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,271
If I believed in fate,

505
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,774
I actually would have thought that was it.

506
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,653
But you don't believe in it.

507
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,072
No, I don't.

508
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,997
Right,
there's no such thing as fate.

509
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:39,085
None of this means anything.
It's all a random coincidence.

510
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,130
Yun Sol!

511
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,097
Uh… Okay.

512
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,225
Hey, what's up, Yun Sol?

513
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,978
Your phone's not working, huh?
Yeah, I thought so.

514
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,356
It works just fine.

515
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,984
Oh, so, did you break your fingers?
They seem okay now.

516
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,323
Hey. What the heck's your problem?

517
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:11,992
Nothing.

518
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,995
You've been ignoring my messages.
What's up with you?

519
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,457
Are you pissed off,
'cause of something I did?

520
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,836
What do you think?

521
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,421
Huh?

522
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,718
It's nothing. I just…
I don't feel so great.

523
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,637
You're sick? Let me check.

524
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,309
So, uh…

525
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,939
I've got a project to finish.
See you around.

526
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,749
Let's go! Come on!
Go, go! Onwards!

527
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,002
Onwards and upwards!

528
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,344

SEONGJU-DONG, 24, HANDSOME

530
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,621
Oh, I'm so screwed! Ugh! What do I do?

531
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,498
Hey, what is it? What's up?

532
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,918
PART-TIME MODEL:
I CAN'T MAKE IT TODAY

533
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,422
I'm gonna cry.

534
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,424
-Enjoy your pizza.
-Yeah, thank you.

535
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,136
Oh, and it's for today's class.
The professor's gonna flip out.

536
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,224
Look, I know we don't pay that much,
but why cancel the last minute?

537
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,435
You know what? We really need
to ask for a bigger budget.

538
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,146
It's not like we can cover
for every model that backs out.

539
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,982
Relax. Let's call everyone that we can.

540
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,067
See who can make it.

541
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,235
Which class is it for?

542
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,986
Oh, hang on.

543
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,620
Jae-eon, wanna make some cash?

544
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,917
I, uh, um…

545
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,127
Jae-eon, here have some.

546
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,255
This looks so good, right?
It'll really hit the spot.

547
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,839
Eat up, go on. Go ahead.

548
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,133
-Yeah, go on.
-You'll love it. Come on, it's good.

549
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,511
Mmm.

550
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,513
-Good, right?
-This is really good.

551
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,807
-You should eat, too. Go on.
-Yeah.

552
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,393
-Mm!
-Good, huh?

553
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,728
-Yeah, so great. Here, have some sauce.
-Thanks.

AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

555
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:53,988
What?

556
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,864
When are you gonna give us a real model?

557
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,785
Even if you can't give us nude models,
you can't keep posing for us all the time.

558
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,787
Yeah, that's right.
We're sick of you.

559
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,455
Everyone, settle down now.

560
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,584
Great. For today…

561
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,129
we're bringing in a very special model.

562
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,213
It's you?

563
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,048
It's probably Ms. Jo again.

564
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,592
Right, come on in!

565
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,600
No way.

566
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,019
I could draw
a hundred sketches of him in a day.

567
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,605
He could be our main model.

568
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,738
Okay, next pose, please, Jae-eon.

569
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,551
I wonder what's gotten
into Jae-eon.

570
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,261
This isn't like him at all.

571
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,722
Why is he doing this?

572
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,016
'Cause Mr. An told him to.

573
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,566
Okay. Good work today, everybody.

574
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,276
Good job, you did really great.

575
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,404
-Thank you for today.
-Thank you.

576
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,114
Your model today was great.

577
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,198
Thank you.

578
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,033
Ooh, she said
the model was great.

579
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,868
You going to the studio?

580
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,412
-Maybe later.
-Okay.

581
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,996
We're gonna eat.

582
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,957
-Are you coming?
-Do you wanna eat, Sol?

583
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,917
-I'll catch up.
-Hey, Jae-eon, wait up.

584
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,211
How do you do that smoldering thing
with your face?

585
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,046
-Huh? Me?
-Yeah.

586
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,340
-I wasn't doing that.
-You were winking at someone.

587
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,883
-No, I wasn't.
-It was so obvious.

588
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,016
Hey,
Jae-eon, help me, will you?

589
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,394
-Jae-eon? Help us.
-I got it.

590
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,187
He's probably beat from posing.

591
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,442
Do-hyeok!

592
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,780
-Was it tough getting over here?
-No sweat.

593
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,074
-What's that?
-Hm? Oh, it's nothing.

594
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,618
Are you hungry? Come on.

595
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,162
-Let's go over there.
-Okay.

596
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,126
Oh, wow. You made this yourself?

597
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,294
Mm-hm.

598
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:57,713
Whoa.

599
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,926
This looks so good.

600
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,347
Delicious.

601
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,435
You know, lately, all I've been having
is take-out and convenience store food.

602
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,064
I'll bring you food more often.

603
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,651
You must've stayed up so late
making all this.

604
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,779
And I know that it was a long trip.

605
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,155
Not long. It was okay.

606
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,449
Oh, and… I brought fruits.

607
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,075
Mm! What's in here?

608
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,494
Open it.

609
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,246
What is it?

610
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,416
Don't be nervous. I promise you,
it's not a heart with beans or anything.

611
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,002
You noticed that, huh?

612
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,341
Oh, my gosh, I love these!

613
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,178
-Dip it in the sauce.
-You should eat, too.

614
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,179
I'm okay.

615
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,102
-Thanks for this.
-My pleasure.

616
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,023
Come on, Jae-eon!

617
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,953
-What's up?
-Nothing.

618
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,832
It's just that… when you told me
that you'd show me your videos,

619
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,794
I assumed that you'd send them
in a text or an email or something.

620
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:19,920
Oh.

621
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,422
Well, I… I wanted to see you too.

622
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,466
Okay. And I'm glad.

623
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,802
And plus, I got a nice meal
out of it, too.

624
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,598
So, let's see it.
I'm curious about your videos.

625
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,691
Here.

626
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,569
Left ear.

627
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,033
Playing.

628
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,828
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER
DIRECTIONS TO THE NOODLE SHOP

629
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,289
The music's so good.

630
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:06,258
Oh, is this the beach
by the noodle shop? Is it?

631
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,926
Mm, it is.

632
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,554
Wow. I wish I could go there.

633
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,644
-It's weird, right?
-No, I think it's great.

634
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,941
How do you do that with your knife?

635
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,491
Cool.

636
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,048
Wow. This is awesome.

637
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,342
Don't look too long.

638
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,802
If you keep looking at it,
you'll see the flaws.

639
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,722
I knew it. I was right about you.

640
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,099
Na-bi, you've got a gift.

641
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,686
I don't think so.
Everyone here can do what I do.

642
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:01,855
Come on. Stop doing that.

643
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,858
Na-bi.

644
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,318
If you were in my place,

645
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,779
you'd see how talented
and charming you genuinely are.

646
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,161
What's with the sudden compliment?

647
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:19,039
You always say stuff like that
out of the blue.

648
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,791
I think you've got it mixed up.

649
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,334
You think you know me, but you don't.

650
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,799
Hey, did you find
that assistant that you needed?

651
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,387
Oh. Yeah, I did. I thought I told you.

652
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,515
I got two juniors from my department,
so they've been helping me out.

653
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,017
Oh.

654
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,854
I can't tell him Jae-eon
is one of them.

655
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,356
I just can't do it.

656
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,277
Why do I feel like I'm cheating on him?

657
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:51,947
Well, that's great.

658
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,992
It's too bad I missed my shot…

659
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,536
to help you with it.

660
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:04,334
I guess your class is starting soon.
Go on inside.

661
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,128
It's fine.

662
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,713
I'll walk you over to the main gate.

663
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,175
You're heading home later today, right?

664
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,177
I'm not sure yet.

665
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,138
I plan to swing by the restaurant later.

666
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,933
Oh, right. The one you worked at before?

667
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,018
Mm.

668
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,603
How about you? Working late again tonight?

669
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,399
I guess so.

670
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,193
Isn't it scary there at night?

671
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,279
Not at all.

672
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,781
I actually focus better at night.

673
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,662
Well, thanks for walking me over here.

674
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,665
Don't sweat it, no big deal.

675
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,375
And thanks for watching my videos.

676
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,627
Your ideas were really helpful,
I'll use them.

677
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,463
Mm, okay.

678
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,590
-Well, I should get back.
-Mm.

679
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,550
I'm going now.

680
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,344
Thanks again for all the food.

681
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,263
You're welcome. Get to class.

682
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,182
Take care, okay?

683
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,602
No matter what happens,

684
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,354
I don't want to let Do-hyeok down.

685
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,281
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN SELECTED
FOR THE EXCHANGE STUDENT PROGRAM

686
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:46,895
MY SOL

687
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,480
LET'S EAT DINNER TONIGHT IF YOU'RE FREE

688
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,397
SURE, I'M FREE

689
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,111
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE ARE YOU?

690
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,029
LET'S WATCH THIS MOVIE.
WHAT ABOUT THIS WEEKEND?

691
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,252
I…

692
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,617
Let's go?

693
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,243
You're leaving?

694
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,038
I've got plans. You? Working all night?

695
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,332
I guess.

696
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,501
I don't know.
Maybe I should call it a night.

697
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:34,961
Is something up?

698
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,132
Mm-mm. Nothing.

699
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,718
Hey, you look really stressed out.
Take it easy, okay?

700
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,888
-Okay.
-See ya.

701
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,015
Good night!

702
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,687
Oh!

703
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,826
Jeez, what even is the point of all this?

704
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,295
You're home late. Have you eaten?

705
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,296
Yeah, I did.

706
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,926
Use a glass, okay?
You know I hate it when you do that!

707
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,719
Oh, yeah, of course.

708
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,897
You look really wiped out.

709
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,732
What's the deal? Your part-time job?

710
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,610
No, my part-time job
is not till the weekend.

711
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,279
It's the exhibit stuff.

712
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,031
Hey, don't wear yourself out.
We still have a thesis to work on.

713
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,660
By the way, who was your roommate
before I moved in?

714
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,288
-My roommate? Yun--
-Ji?

715
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,206
His name was Yun-seok, contemporary art.

716
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,292
-But he joined the army.
-And before that?

717
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,751
Well, before him there was--

718
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,170
Oh, it's fine. Forget it.

719
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,299
I'm still looking for a room.
But I'll move out soon.

720
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,842
But why? What's the rush?

721
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:06,428
Have you been working hard,
so you can move?

722
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,346
-There's no pressure, okay?
-Ugh!

723
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,472
There you go again.

724
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,932
What's up?

725
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,269
I really wish you'd mind
your own business.

726
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,396
I can take care of myself, okay?

727
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,071
Is that a cat?

728
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,700
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

729
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,744
Oh, wait. You're not allergic
to cats, right?

730
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,746
Well, no, I'm not allergic. But…

731
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:33,872
Well, that's a relief.

732
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,208
I found it on the street,
so I decided to take it home with me.

733
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,587
I tried to wait for its mother,
but she never came. I couldn't leave it.

734
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,881
It was raining pretty hard just now.

735
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,550
Poor little thing was helpless,
so I took it.

736
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,469
Wow. So, what?

737
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,304
Is this some kind of animal shelter now?

738
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,056
I can't believe you did that.

739
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,932
-Cute, huh? Wanna hold it?
-Sure.

740
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,604
Wow. Just look
at how tiny this furball is.

741
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,856
I guess it likes you.

742
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,152
Hey, you, I'm glad
I brought you back home.

743
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,780
Have you named it yet?

744
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,698
Not yet. Any ideas?

745
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:09,991
Let's see.

746
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,453
You're so lucky, little one.

747
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,081
You have a home that's safe and warm,

748
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,541
with someone who can be annoying,
but cares a lot.

749
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,796
Do you like that?

750
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,839
Cute.

751
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,842
-What?
-Hm?

752
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,410
Hey, Sol.

753
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,371
Could I talk to you for a second?

754
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,588
I have to meet someone.

755
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,216
We can talk later.

756
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,428
It's already late. Who are you gonna meet?

757
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,640
This won't take long. I'll make it quick.

758
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,230
Uh…

759
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,276
I've been thinking about
why you've been acting kinda weird

760
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,278
these past few days towards me.

761
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:32,031
Uh, and I noticed you've changed

762
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,076
ever since we all got back
from the workshop.

763
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,036
So I figured that…

764
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,082
It's all because of what I did
the night I got so drunk.

765
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,626
What I mean to say is…

766
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,004
I remember it. I remember what happened.

767
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,006
I know what happened
between us that night.

768
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,762
Yeah, so?

769
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,764
Are you done?

770
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,683
No, I'm not.

771
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:03,188
-Uh… Look, that's not all.
-So, what else do you wanna say?

772
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,774
I wanna say…

773
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,653
I don't know!

774
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,491
I thought maybe you'd say something,
once I told you I remember what happened.

775
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,575
Are you sorry?

776
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,911
For everything that you did that night?

777
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,747
Huh?

778
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,874
Oh. Well, I guess…

779
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,334
Yeah, you're right.

780
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,712
I should apologize
for the way that I treated you.

781
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,088
I shouldn't have done that.

782
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,549
So you didn't mean it.

783
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,095
It was a mistake,
and you wanna forget about it.

784
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,641
What? What are you saying?

785
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,019
If what happened that night
meant nothing to you,

786
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,231
then that's what hurts me.

787
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,152
'Cause…

788
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:53,780
I like you a lot.

789
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,244
Uh, samesies,
you're my best friend, right?

790
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,411
I meant something more.

791
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:11,005
Oh, Yun Sol! What are you saying?

792
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,591
I'm not saying I'll do anything.

793
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,470
And I know you don't feel
that way about me.

794
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,888
Trust me, I do.

795
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,771
I guess I thought I could pretend

796
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,982
that nothing happened
between us that night.

797
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,236
But it's too hard.

798
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,790
So, I guess I'm the one
who owes you an apology.

799
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,501
I'm sorry…

800
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,504
for liking you.

801
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,097
I really gotta go. I'll see ya.

802
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,399
What happened meant something to me, too.

803
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,985
I won't apologize for that.

804
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,658
I don't know what I feel.
I'm still so confused.

805
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,363
Hey, guys. I'm here.

806
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,114
Hey, what's up, Do-hyeok?

807
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,325
Not much. How have you been?

808
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:03,910
Can't complain.

809
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,746
-What's all that?
-Oh, it's nothing special.

810
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:10,041
What's up with you?
You're looking pretty happy.

811
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,378
-He does own a restaurant now.
-Oh? Yeah, I know that.

812
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,046
But I don't think that's it.

813
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,090
Look at you,
you're practically glowing.

814
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:21,678
Well, I guess, lately I've been
in a pretty good mood.

815
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:22,970
Yeah?

816
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,724
-I get it.
-Get what?

817
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,645
You finally got a girl,
didn't you, hot stuff?

818
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,188
-Right?
-No, it's not that.

819
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,649
-Is it true? Who is it?
-No. No, it's not true.

820
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:36,943
Is it that girl?

821
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,653
Well…

822
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:46,679
PARK JAE-EON

823
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,993
Wanna see butterflies?

824
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,180
I'll be there soon.

825
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,684
Na-bi keeps looking
somewhere else instead of looking at me.

826
01:04:56,767 --> 01:05:01,022
Na-bi. believe me,
all I really want is for you to be happy.

827
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:02,398
Do you like him?

828
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,650
Let's not make another mistake.

829
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,278
Maybe Na-bi
was already drifting away from me.

830
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,447
Can we meet right now?

831
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,407
If it's not urgent,
let's meet next time.

832
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,492
Did you
eventually lose to Jae-eon?

833
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,953
Maybe this entire thing
was all wrong to begin with.

834
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,788
I can't seem to find a solution.

835
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,123
I miss you.

836
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:21,959
I'm really not used to how I am
when I'm with Na-bi.

837
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:25,087
Have you ever felt, even once,
that he sincerely likes you?

838
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:26,047
Just think about it.

839
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,090
Do you really think
this is a mistake?

840
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,551
-Of course, I do.
-That's a lie.

841
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:32,386
Let's go out, Na-bi.
