1
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,555
Sometimes, the reality
you're faced with seems unrealistic.

2
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,602
Like, for instance, right now,

3
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,730
as I blissfully walk along this street
all covered in white,

4
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,857
as it snows.

5
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,950
METAPHORS OF DAWN
YU HYEON-U EXHIBITION

6
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,175
I guess it's similar
to when you're in love.

7
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,390
That sensation of being
the most special person in the world.

8
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,476
It kinda feels unrealistic.

9
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,280
Your heart…

10
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,407
it flutters.

11
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,596
Looks pretty erotic, huh?

12
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,181
I know, right?

13
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,202
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENT OF A LOVER
VIEW FROM BEHIND

14
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,996
NABI
YU HYEON-U

15
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,165
So why is it called "Nabi", then?

16
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,374
No idea.

17
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,625
Let's go.

18
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,878
What do we look at next?
Let's go check this one.

19
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,087
This one?

20
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,339
-Have you heard of him?
-Of course.

21
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,966
Na-bi.

22
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,927
Wait, did he say "Nabi"?

23
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,943
Pretty, right?

24
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,952
All right. I'll see you too.

25
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,799
Na-bi.

26
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,510
Yu Na-bi!

27
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,929
What is love, anyway?

28
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,810
He was a very serious person.

29
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,479
You wanna know what love is?

30
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,149
It's something
that constantly gives meaning…

31
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,986
to something so abstract and unfamiliar.

32
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,738
That's what I think true love is.

33
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,538
Oh.

34
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,793
-I knew it.
-Hm?

35
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,045
The reason I asked
if we could have pizza today

36
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,630
was so I could take a glimpse
into your feelings

37
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,508
by reading into your actions,
like how you share your food.

38
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,510
-My feelings?
-Mm-hm.

39
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,596
Especially your sincerity.

40
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,269
Tonight, the sincerity
of our relationship depends

41
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,980
on whether this final layer
will come between us.

42
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,317
Almost always…

43
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,527
No, actually…

44
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,862
He was always…

45
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,366
Ridiculous!
Are you being serious right now?

46
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,284
What do you mean?

47
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,664
I just wish you wouldn't make
such erratic decisions out of nowhere.

48
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,583
Oh, do my nails really look that weird?

49
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,127
Everyone said they were pretty.

50
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,006
"Everyone"? You should've asked
for my opinion first

51
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,924
before assuming it was fine with me.

52
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,093
But I guess I'm just nothing to you.

53
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,053
Practically a stranger to small-talk with.

54
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,139
Am I the only one serious here?

55
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,808
He's obsessed with putting meaning
into everything,

56
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,310
an endless metaphor addict.

57
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,564
Was my work that embarrassing to you?

58
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,567
Is that why you're crying?

59
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,653
Na-bi. You can't just look
at the exterior of things.

60
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,031
You have to look at the meaning
hidden inside of it.

61
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,285
You could've at least asked me
about it first

62
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,704
before assuming it was fine with me.

63
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,206
Come on!

64
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,375
You're making me really upset,
you know that?

65
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,503
And here I thought you'd be the one
who'd understand me the most.

66
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,302
At one point, I used to believe
it was all so special.

67
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,512
Ew! I'm not sure if I like that.

68
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,972
It's a little weird for me.

69
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,974
But he said he made it
because he loves you, right?

70
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,186
These artists don't just use
any random model they see.

71
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,479
You know what I think?

72
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,231
I think deep down,
he really cares about you.

73
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,858
You're like his artistic muse.

74
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,984
-No.
-Muse?

75
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,527
He's definitely a weirdo for sure.

76
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,655
-It's art, you wouldn't get it.
-You call that thing art?

77
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,457
It had perplexed me.

78
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,001
The boundaries of art.

79
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,882
Excuse me, hello?

80
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,221
I really hope
you don't mind me asking, but…

81
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,681
Yu Hyeon-U is your boyfriend, right?

82
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,309
Mm. Yeah, he is. Why?

83
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,312
I'm sorry, I'm not sure
if I should tell you this, but…

84
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,774
A friend of mine actually attends
that academy.

85
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,992
It's been going on for a while.

86
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
Suddenly, I realized the truth…

87
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,634
at such an unexpected moment.

88
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,654
But to be honest,
it kinda felt like I already knew it.

89
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,708
However…

90
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,087
Hey, Na-bi.

91
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,928
I've been swamped at the academy,
plus the exhibition.

92
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,723
Imagine it becomes successful,
maybe I'll quit being a teacher

93
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,433
and just focus on my art career.

94
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,603
Although, I'm not so sure
what theme to focus on.

95
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,981
Mr. Baek wants to express the liveliness
and vigor of people in their 20s…

96
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,066
This jerk doesn't know
how to shut up.

97
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,235
I can't believe I almost blamed myself.

98
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:14,952
Na-bi.

99
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,913
What are you daydreaming for?

100
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,290
I'm talking about something serious here.
Pay attention.

101
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,045
God, you're an asshole.

102
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,508
What?

103
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,179
Love.

104
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,599
Something that gets trampled on

105
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,935
while helplessly melting away.

106
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,062
As if it were nothing.

107
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,108
Exactly how my relationship ended.

108
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,494
-Na-bi, where are you off to?
-I'm going to the studio.

109
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,704
-See you around.
-See you later.

110
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,706
What are you up to?

111
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,875
-Nothing, just chilling.
-See you in there.

112
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,054
You guys heading to the studio?

113
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,264
You go on ahead.

114
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,748
-What's up?
-Hey.

115
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,718
-Heya.
-Heya.

116
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,555
-Hey, Na-bi.
-Hi.

117
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,353
Hey, Na-bi, where you been?

118
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,688
Just outside.

119
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,690
Na-bi,
how about a little help here?

120
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,025
You can handle it, relax.

121
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,069
Na-bi,
saw your sculpture trying to build itself.

122
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,196
-It's drying up.
-Hey, I need that yellow.

123
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,449
-Get some more.
-That one? Okay.

124
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,534
-Let me see.
-Oh, yeah. All right.

125
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,702
Coming through, guys.

126
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,746
-Yo! Help me with this.
-Good morning!

127
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,915
Amazing, looks like I won
the jackass lottery.

128
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,125
What is it?

129
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,585
This prick!

130
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,920
He's the one who suggested
a hotel instead of a motel.

131
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,714
And now he wants me to chip in.

132
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,966
Who is it?
That guy from the app yesterday?

133
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,719
Yeah! I mean, I wouldn't be this upset
if he actually had any game,

134
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,804
but it wasn't even worth spending
the night with him!

135
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,389
So why'd you sleep with him, then?

136
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,643
Guess he must've had a hell of a face,
she can't resist handsome guys.

137
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,353
Great, I'm annoyed now.

138
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,562
Smoke break, guys?

139
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,022
Hm, can't, I'm quitting for a while.

140
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,232
Ji-wan won't be smoking for three days.

141
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,610
-Wow, three days!
-Hey, psycho, what's in three days?

142
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,570
A blind date. So I'm quitting until then.

143
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,073
And if I don't start shaking,
I might keep it up.

144
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,659
-Another blind date?
-Girl, you're unbelievable.

145
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,369
Are you that addicted to men?

146
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,079
Look who's talking,
Miss Fell-for-the-Hotel.

147
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,163
Point taken.

148
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,539
So loud in here.

149
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,667
-Going to work?
-Mm.

150
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,502
Hm.

151
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,504
-Bye!
-Are you serious?

152
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,421
See ya!

153
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,591
Whoa! Who am I supposed to smoke with now?

154
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,885
What if I get kidnapped
while smoking by myself?

155
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:18,928
And when my mother gets

156
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,179
-a phone call from them.
-Okay, I'll go with you.

157
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,264
You're the best.

158
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,017
-Come on, girl.
-And just when I got here.

159
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,187
I'm going.

160
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,814
-You don't have to drag me along.
-Just a little bit more.

161
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,149
Don't tell me you climb up
all these stairs

162
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,860
-every time you smoke.
-I really don't mind if it's for a drag.

163
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,239
If he's okay, you swipe right.
If it's a no, then you swipe left.

164
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,450
And if you both end up swiping right
for each other, you got yourself a match.

165
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,327
And then after that?

166
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,954
You two send each other messages

167
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,831
back and forth from the app
and if it's going well,

168
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,582
then maybe you'll decide
to meet up and stuff.

169
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,876
Guess today's not my day.

170
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,421
But nobody actually uses
their real names here, right?

171
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,631
Mm, I don't show my face, either.

172
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,468
But some people go ahead and just reveal
their names and faces for everyone.

173
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,721
Oh, I hate it
when they have tattoos like this.

174
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,180
Tattoos?

175
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,474
Yep, in fact,
the guy I met yesterday

176
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,143
had a huge tattoo on him as well.

177
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,394
You wanna know what it said?

178
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,647
"I will never die."

179
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,150
"Die." How? False advertising.

180
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,943
That thing of his
just kept dying and dying--

181
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,154
-Keep it down, you're crazy.
-It was so ridiculous.

182
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,989
Some tattoos kinda look pretty, though.

183
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,783
Like whose?

184
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,493
Hm?

185
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,247
Are you seeing someone?

186
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,251
Uh… Not what I said.

187
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,336
Like, as if I would.

188
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,470
You wanna join us for drinks later?
It'll be fun.

189
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,055
No, I think I'm fine.
Besides, I'm going to work late.

190
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,183
Again? Wow!

191
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,643
-Your life must be incredibly mundane.
-Whatever.

192
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,400
Look. It's one of our juniors.

193
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,235
Said he wants to buy you a drink.

194
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,154
I'm stuck.

195
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,448
-I haven't slept.
-Sucks, dude.

196
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,951
Unless you have amnesia,
I just got out of a relationship.

197
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,953
Hey, that's not what I meant.

198
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,872
We all know each other except for you,

199
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,999
so I just thought I'd introduce you
to each other.

200
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,336
Um… just not right now.

201
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,588
God, you are so boring.

202
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,215
Oh, my god!

203
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,217
I accidentally swiped left
on a total hottie!

204
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,676
-What the hell did I--
-Show me, show me, show me.

205
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,679
-Let me see.
-Oh! I'll never be able to see him again.

206
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,393
You know, you're acting
a little unlike yourself today.

207
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,230
Well, what do I do? How should I act?

208
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,775
Let's see. Out with the old jerk
and in with the new one. Hmm?

209
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,320
-But this app isn't for you.
-Why not?

210
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,781
You're pretty, I'll give you that,
but you have absolutely no taste.

211
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,699
-You'll only attract the losers.
-Hey!

212
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,826
Hmm?

213
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:49,912
Well…

214
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,541
I don't know yet.

215
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,295
-Final answer?
-Mm.

216
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,964
You girls have fun.

217
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,299
God, you're so boring.

218
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,302
-Call me later, okay?
-Uh-huh.

219
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:31,036
EPISODE 1: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS FATE.
NEVERTHELESS,

220
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,006
THE DAY SHE BROKE UP WITH X

221
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,033
You got here first.

222
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,380
Sorry, who are you?

223
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,342
You're So-ri, aren't you?

224
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,596
Uh, no, my name is Yu Na-bi, actually.

225
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,222
Na-bi.

226
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,016
Na-bi?

227
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,771
Oh.

228
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,607
I guess I mistook you
for someone else, then.

229
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,566
Terribly sorry.

230
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,360
No, it's fine.

231
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,905
It's silly,
but right at the moment our eyes met…

232
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,928
Suddenly, the pain of the breakup

233
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,098
that had been weighing down on me
just a minute ago…

234
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,186
You mind if I sit here?

235
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,107
You're already sitting there, though.

236
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,780
Are you here with someone?

237
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,409
I'm not with anyone.

238
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,619
…melted away like snow.

239
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:40,541
But then, what about… You sure?
Aren't you here to meet with someone?

240
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,711
What about whoever it was you said
that you mistook me for?

241
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,671
I canceled on her.

242
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,673
Why?

243
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,300
Because…

244
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,765
I felt like
I didn't need to meet her tonight.

245
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,069
Loser grants the winner
a wish, right?

246
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,279
A deal's a deal.

247
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,448
That's not fair,
you conned me into it.

248
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,365
-Aw.
-All right.

249
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,533
Where was it we left off?

250
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,536
So you broke up today?

251
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,620
Oh.

252
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,040
Yeah.

253
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,167
I flat-out dumped the guy.

254
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,336
Guess he wasn't exactly a stud.

255
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,755
Actually…

256
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,132
he was a complete joke.

257
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,384
I was an idiot for going out with him.

258
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,719
To hell with him.

259
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,679
Nothing's holding me back
from going abroad now.

260
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,639
-Sightseeing?
-As an exchange student.

261
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,685
I've always had this dream
of going to Paris.

262
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,853
Pretty cool.

263
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,606
Not anytime soon, though.
Do you like traveling?

264
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,233
I've never traveled properly before.

265
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,985
-At the end of the year, maybe.
-Who with?

266
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,405
Uh…

267
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,450
With anyone?

268
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,787
Or alone? With a friend? Or…

269
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,622
A girlfriend?

270
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,792
Not sure yet.

271
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,585
With anyone.

272
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,135
Here you go.

273
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,846
So it's my turn now, right?

274
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,482
When I do it, why is it so hard?

275
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,026
You haven't had enough practice.

276
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,029
You keep doing it often enough,
you'll get the hang of it,

277
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,781
just like with everything else.

278
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,951
Don't think about the exact spot
you need to hit.

279
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,748
As long as you try and get it anywhere
near that red dot.

280
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,709
It's simple enough.

281
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,840
Oh!

282
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,554
Well, that's different.

283
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,307
What do you mean?

284
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,603
You look a bit different
when you're smiling.

285
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,610
I have no idea what you're saying.

286
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,737
Move your butt over.

287
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,121
Looks like I won.

288
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,415
Of course you did.

289
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,918
You seem pretty happy for a loser.

290
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,378
Well…

291
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,964
maybe it was more fun than I thought.

292
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,090
It sure is.

293
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,718
Anyway, it's just fun being
with you in general.

294
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,763
This guy…

295
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,225
…is seriously bad for my heart.

296
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,643
Right.

297
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,272
-Simple enough.
-Simple enough.

298
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,698
YU JEONG-RAN

299
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,745
Hi, Mom.

300
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,247
Honey, your aunt made
soy-braised beef.

301
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,291
Want me to send some over?
It's your favorite.

302
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,584
No need.

303
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,794
I still have a lot left over
from last time.

304
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,671
Throw away the leftovers, then.

305
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,590
Then eat the new one she'll be sending in.

306
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,635
You're always telling me
to throw away stuff. Bye.

307
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,054
Why is my baby
in such a grouchy mood?

308
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,765
I just want my daughter to always have
the freshest stuff.

309
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,183
I'm fine, Mom.

310
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,603
When are you planning
on coming home, then?

311
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:34,358
It's only an hour away by subway,
but for some reason, you never come home.

312
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,611
Because I don't wanna be there while he's…

313
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,033
It's just that the workload at school
is a bit too much.

314
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,785
How's Ttoli doing?

315
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,245
The usual.

316
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,331
Ttoli is always whimpering and whining
because she misses you.

317
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,666
Bring your boyfriend over.

318
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,125
I'll buy you some delicious food.

319
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,086
There is no boyfriend.

320
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,672
What? Did you break up?

321
00:20:58,882 --> 00:20:59,716
Na-bi.

322
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,515
Mom, I need to hang up for now, okay?

323
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,742
What?

324
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,857
Why were you named
after a butterfly?

325
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,444
So that my life would be
as sweet as sugar.

326
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,487
It was my mom and aunt's idea.

327
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,701
I'm just kidding.

328
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,372
Have you ever heard
of Nathaniel Hawthorne?

329
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,917
Well, he's basically
my aunt's favorite author.

330
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,170
He said something that goes like…

331
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,089
Wait, I'm just a little nervous. Wait.

332
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,011
It's cringey, but what he said was,

333
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,057
"Happiness is a butterfly,
which when pursued,

334
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,519
is always beyond our grasp,
but sit quietly, it may alight upon you."

335
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,942
And that's it, my name's back story.

336
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,279
It's nothing special.

337
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:45,822
You're wrong.

338
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,033
Because I loved it.

339
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,638
That tattoo
on the back of your neck.

340
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,306
Is it a butterfly?

341
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,391
Mm-hm.

342
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,728
I like butterflies.

343
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,607
A lot.

344
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,662
We're all done.

345
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,878
It looks cute.

346
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,799
You sure this is
how you want to use your wish?

347
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,760
Seems like a simple thing to spend it on.

348
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,722
Should I…

349
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,268
ask for another one?

350
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,536
This is stupid.

351
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,455
What do you mean?

352
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:18,999
Nothing.

353
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,433
The moon looks so pretty today.

354
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,485
Want one?

355
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,323
Take it, it's my lucky stick.

356
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,867
Uh… Actually, I don't really smoke.

357
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,705
Excuse me.

358
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,332
Would you happen to have a cigar--

359
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,085
Oh.

360
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,005
Whoa! Suddenly, I'm all sober now.

361
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,758
How's it going?
Haven't seen you around here.

362
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,176
Can I borrow a ciggy?

363
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,637
I'll return the favor the next time
we bump into each other.

364
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,389
You can call me if you need it back, yeah?

365
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,310
Yeah, there's one left…

366
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,495
Shit, what the hell, dude? Sheesh.

367
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,725
What?

368
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,104
What are you smiling for?

369
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,123
You all right?

370
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,670
Yeah, I'm fine now.

371
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,235
Do you want to go see butterflies?

372
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,363
See butterflies? What do you mean? Where?

373
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,617
At my place.

374
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,169
Hold on a minute.
I need to go to the bathroom.

375
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,681
What's up?

376
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,851
Yeah, I miss you too.

377
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,520
Are you going to sleep now?

378
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,193
Mmm.

379
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,490
What?
So after that, you just left?

380
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,367
Did you call him after?

381
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,160
Of course I didn't.

382
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,955
I didn't even get his name
after telling him where my name came from.

383
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,375
Just when you finally mustered up
enough courage.

384
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,587
What's that on your arm?

385
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,758
Oh, this? It's nothing.

386
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,134
Just a little doodle.

387
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,844
That's a sign of love.

388
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,390
Ah, no. It's nothing like that. Shut up!

389
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,058
-So what is it then?
-It's lust?

390
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,810
I don't know. It's just…

391
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,105
-It was really fun.
-That's wonderful.

392
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,732
It's hard to find someone that
you feel an instant connection with.

393
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,526
You ought to consider yourself lucky.

394
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,112
Doesn't matter.
You said he already has a girlfriend.

395
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,073
Cheaters are bad news.
You should never hang out with them.

396
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,619
Oh, that's right.
I need to post that part-time job ad.

397
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,788
Or maybe I should ask
some of the kids instead.

398
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:27,706
Go ahead.

399
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,791
How about Jae-eon then?

400
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,377
I'm not sure.
Would he actually even do it?

401
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,171
Just leave it to me.
I'll try to convince him.

402
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,552
-Hello, everyone.
-Oh.

403
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,181
Can you check?

404
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,476
-I have a meeting with the professor.
-Right. Yeah. Go together with Na-bi.

405
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,982
-To… Together?
-Together? Both of us?

406
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,692
It's okay with me.

407
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,569
-Sol can go have her meeting first.
-Uh-huh.

408
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,404
Trust me,
it'll be a waste of time.

409
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,906
It's about
the exchange student program, right?

410
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,368
If you both get on one-on-one,
the prof's nagging will just get longer.

411
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,536
Right.

412
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:07,954
Right.

413
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,750
-I'll be going, then.
-Thank you, bye.

414
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,253
That was funny.

415
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,797
-You're really clueless, aren't you?
-What? How so?

416
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,924
You see Na-bi?
She started feeling uncomfortable

417
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,343
because she didn't want
to be compared to Sol in there.

418
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,595
Oh, I didn't notice that.

419
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,556
You only picked the hard places to get in.

420
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,434
Na-bi, it's hard to get accepted
to any of these.

421
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,187
These schools are very strict.
You know that, correct?

422
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,690
Yes.

423
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,109
I'm not saying you're bad.
In fact, you're doing just fine.

424
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,238
But there are only
a limited number of spots.

425
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,324
You'll have to raise your GPA
to stand a chance.

426
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,867
Work harder, okay?

427
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,410
Yes, ma'am.

428
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,581
Remember, going abroad isn't always
the best course of action.

429
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:54,459
Staying in Korea might be
the better option in the long run.

430
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,961
Our local graduate schools are good.

431
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,881
Besides, you know what they say.
There's no place like Korea for Koreans.

432
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,007
Yeah?

433
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,135
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, that's right.

434
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,721
That's good.
We'll talk about this next time, okay?

435
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,057
And you, Sol? What happened to your list?

436
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,100
I've been waiting
but you haven't submitted it yet.

437
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,061
Yeah, I haven't yet.

438
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,939
You could be starting as soon as
next semester. What are you waiting for?

439
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,566
Something going on
that's holding you back in any way?

440
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,486
There isn't, it's just…

441
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,447
Don't worry,
I'll be making my decision soon, ma'am.

442
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,868
All right. Though I would honestly prefer
you make it sooner.

443
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,620
It's such a waste of time.

444
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,914
You might be thinking it's not gonna be
different from studying here.

445
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,251
But there are a lot of things
you can learn out there, hmm?

446
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,586
This is a great list right here.

447
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,507
So why don't you take a look at this
and make your decision in the near future.

448
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,969
LIST OF PROSPECTIVE UNIVERSITIES

449
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,053
Okay.

450
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,016
What is this gloom and doom
from the both of you?

451
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,185
You two ought to be shining
at this age, right?

452
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,937
You can't stay holed up
in a studio all day.

453
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,982
You should be active in creating
eventful life experiences

454
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,651
because that is the well of inspiration
you must draw from.

455
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,695
Yeah.

456
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,905
Yep.

457
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,496
She must've said the word
"inspiration" over a 100 times.

458
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,417
Keep it, you can have it.

459
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,919
I was gonna give you this file
if you needed it anyway.

460
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,463
Thanks. It'll be helpful.

461
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,050
It was so embarrassing back there.

462
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,176
What was?

463
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,639
I listed up all the great universities
without even thinking about my grades.

464
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,601
I'm jealous of you, Sol.
You can pretty much go anywhere.

465
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,148
I don't think
going abroad is the best idea.

466
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:44,319
Honestly, it kind of feels like
I'm just trying to run away.

467
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,072
-I was kind of feeling the same--
-Yun Sol!

468
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,619
Oh, so you were hanging out with Na-bi.

469
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,371
What did the professor say?
Did you two get in trouble or something?

470
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,749
-Oh, it was about the exchange--
-Oh.

471
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,209
-Assignment ideas for us.
-Assignment ideas?

472
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,961
That's not fair, why'd she leave me out?

473
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,963
That's some A-grade favoritism
right there. Why?

474
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,090
It was only a bit of advice.

475
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,800
Guess we'll be going now.

476
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,178
Oh, okay. Go, go.

477
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,346
Later, Na-bi.

478
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,184
I'm the one who needs advice right now.
I'm literally all out of ideas.

479
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,149
Oh.

480
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,694
You dressed up all nice for a reason?

481
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,614
I look nice? Really? That's a relief.

482
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,908
Is it because
we're going to a gathering today?

483
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,201
Actually, the truth is,

484
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,745
that blind date was supposed to be
tomorrow, right?

485
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,456
Turns out it can't be tomorrow.
He said something urgent came up

486
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,249
and asked if we could meet later today.

487
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,085
Or else next time won't be for a while.

488
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,294
And you know blind dates,

489
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,463
you shouldn't put 'em off for too long
or it's goodbye.

490
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,173
So I just agreed to meet him
later today instead.

491
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,926
What? Then what's gonna happen
to our gathering today?

492
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,427
You're gonna tell the others for me--

493
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,472
Hey, you're the one who made a thing
about all this. I didn't even wanna go.

494
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,724
I know. I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean for this.

495
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,519
But if you don't show up either,
everyone's gonna curse me to death.

496
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,813
Sol, please do this for me? Hm? Hm?

497
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,898
Come on, Sol. I'll owe you one.

498
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,025
-All right, I'll do it already.
-I love you!

499
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,527
Hey, if things go well with my date,

500
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,278
maybe I could set you up
with someone too, okay?

501
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,321
Yeah, there's no need.

502
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,698
Oh, come on.

503
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,526
Oh, hi.
Anything we can help you with? Hello!

504
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,069
-How are you guys?
-How you doing?

505
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,195
Hello.

506
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,947
-Just carry on, everyone.
-Okay.

507
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,507
There, no problem.

508
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,013
All right.
So, you're packing up soon?

509
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,872
You'll have to raise
your GPA to stand a chance.

510
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,344
Really?

511
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,554
You're just gonna stay here working?

512
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,558
If I don't, I won't finish on time.

513
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,018
My progress is slow enough.

514
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,813
That's what alcohol is best for,
when you're stuck.

515
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,273
I'm gonna end up drinking
with a bunch of kids.

516
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,859
You don't know any
of our juniors, by the way.

517
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,320
Don't you need any assistance
for the exhibit?

518
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,697
You know, at this rate,
you'll set the record

519
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,700
for the first one in our department
to slog through everything alone.

520
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,666
Gosh. Never mind, forget it.

521
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,417
You can forget about meeting a new man.

522
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,669
See ya.

523
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,590
Please call if you change your mind, okay?

524
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,300
Okay.

525
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,304
-Have fun over there.
-Damn right I will!

526
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,227
-That will be 14,000 won.
-Here.

527
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,904
It's him again.

528
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,323
Hang on a sec.

529
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,795
First the library, and now this.

530
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,965
I must be really losing my mind.

531
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,056
So you're really not coming?

532
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,689
Bit-na, what's the place called again?

533
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,710
We meet again.

534
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,592
Why are you also here?

535
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,681
You're here.

536
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,724
Mm-hm. I'm gonna head inside now.

537
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,684
Okay.

538
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,274
That's the junior.

539
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,402
He was asking for a drink
with you like I said.

540
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,864
Oh.

541
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,993
Look, look, look!
You're so screwed now, I'll tell you that.

542
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,622
Damn, this place is flooded
with too many seniors.

543
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,540
What?

544
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,458
-You got a problem with that?
-Already sick of your seniors?

545
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,626
Can't stand to look at us?

546
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,253
No one's sick of anything!

547
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,254
-Well, well, well.
-Calm down.

548
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:21,048
-Don't embarrass yourself.
-Everyone, there's a newbie among us.

549
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,884
This is a rare appearance from her,

550
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,220
so you better be nice to her.

551
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,639
This is Yu Na-bi.

552
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,474
And this is Park Jae-eon.

553
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,935
Park Jae-eon…

554
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,353
Oh.

555
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,606
That was his name,
Park Jae-eon. Finally.

556
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,609
Yo, what's with the face?

557
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,988
Do you know each other?

558
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,199
We don't.

559
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,452
It's our first time
seeing each other.

560
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,745
It's your first time meeting?

561
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,621
They each took turns taking a leave.

562
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,707
Plus, Na-bi barely attends
any of the school events.

563
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,125
She's pretty much a hermit.

564
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,918
That's right. She never shows up.

565
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,170
Oh, really?

566
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,671
-You should come often too.
-Hello.

567
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,715
-Order another set of garlic.
-Order new drinks first.

568
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,176
Yeah, I can have some.

569
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,511
Oh, uh… hello.

570
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,014
I got butterflies
in my stomach, that was so cute!

571
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,224
-Did you guys hear that?
-"Oh. Hello."

572
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,018
-Seriously!
-I'm Park Jae-eon.

573
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,770
I'll talk casually, if you don't mind.

574
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,313
He's the same age as us.

575
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,315
He used to be a business major
at K University,

576
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,692
but he took the exam again
to major in sculpture.

577
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,860
Oh, is that so?

578
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,071
I think I've already seen you
before, though.

579
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,531
What?

580
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,330
What… You… Where have you seen me before?

581
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,957
Around school.

582
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,295
Ah…

583
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,005
I said I wanted to have
a drink with her right away.

584
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:43,923
He did.

585
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,884
And now you finally met
each other.

586
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,512
Nice to meet you.

587
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,890
It's nice to meet you, too.

588
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,976
I'd already stopped believing…

589
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,688
-in old tropes like fate or love.
-Cheers!

590
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,485
And when you analyze moments
like this one…

591
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,653
Totally! Sure.

592
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,613
…it's unrealistic.

593
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:12,618
That professor's always giving
us assignments, it's endless torture!

594
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,787
You took that class,
why didn't you warn me?

595
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,623
-Your fault for choosing…
-Ji-wan's still not answering?

596
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:18,666
No.

597
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,752
She hasn't read my messages,
guess she's still with him.

598
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,088
-Ooh.
-Oh. She said she'd make it quick,

599
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,548
but it looks like things
are going really well, then.

600
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,466
Well, as if we couldn't
have guessed that this would happen.

601
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,927
Ji-wan's always been popular with the guys
even way back then.

602
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,595
I'm so jealous.

603
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,306
You know, there was a hoard of guys
asking for her number

604
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,142
-at our high school festival.
-But it seems like this time,

605
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,060
there's a chance
Ji-wan likes this guy as well.

606
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,311
There's no point for the poor dude.

607
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,230
Give her a month
and I bet she'll get sick of him.

608
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,314
I feel bad already.

609
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,192
It's her biggest wish to go on a
couple's trip for a one-year anniversary

610
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,402
for the first time ever.

611
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,112
-That's so cute.
-How cute.

612
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,701
I'll get our order.

613
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,744
It'll be hard to carry it all by yourself.

614
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,371
It's fine, keep talking.

615
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,956
Don't mind me, just carry on.

616
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,208
-Right, so what happened?
-You were saying?

617
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,169
I found out
that he has a girlfriend.

618
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,591
-Oh!
-Oh!

619
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,512
Oh, my god.

620
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,017
Oh, I'm so sorry.

621
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,852
Oh!

622
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,062
Are you okay?

623
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,063
No, it's okay.

624
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,608
-What about you, you okay?
-I'm fine.

625
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,694
I was staring at my phone.

626
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,529
Nah, it's all good.

627
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,326
Three! One!

628
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,368
-Two!
-Wrong. Three!

629
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,788
Hat comes off now, buddy.

630
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,500
-Hey, here. He gets the hair tie.
-Take it off, it's the rules.

631
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,627
Let's make a palm tree
out of you.

632
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,588
Go easy on me, please.
I used conditioner today.

633
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,965
Seeing Jae-eon now, he seems fun.

634
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,842
You look so pretty!

635
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,928
I'm sorry, man.

636
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,515
-Off you go.
-That look really suits you.

637
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,266
Come on.

638
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:08,025
Sorry, I don't mean to bother you, but…

639
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,110
Oh, you wanna have a drink with us?

640
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,320
No, no, but…

641
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,155
If it's okay with you…

642
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,865
Shit.

643
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,284
This won't take long, but could you
please watch me dance for you?

644
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,537
Don't cover your face, it's all good!

645
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,664
-Go, five, six, seven, eight!
-Jae-eon has a way

646
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,667
of making even nasty pranks seem fun
for everyone.

647
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,590
-Twist your body! Twist it!
-What is that?

648
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,681
Good one!

649
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,683
Yeah!

650
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,310
-This is dumb.
-Aw, did that upset you?

651
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,104
It's nice that he smiles a lot.

652
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,855
-Let's play another game.
-Say what?

653
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,774
-Let's just drink up. Come on.
-Oh! Nothing.

654
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,901
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

655
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,486
Too late.

656
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,697
-Oh.
-Come on. Shots, shots, shots!

657
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,324
-Shots! Nice!
-Hey, Jin-su.

658
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,742
-Huh?
-Can you pass me that?

659
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:03,872
Thanks, dude.

660
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,585
Hey, you ate all the entrees.
Not to mention all the meat.

661
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,421
Hey, guys.

662
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,338
Listen up. Listen up.

663
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,339
-I wanna ask you all.
-What is it?

664
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,675
Who did the nasty
in the student council room last sem?

665
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,594
Confess.

666
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,723
Whoa, so it's true that someone found
a condom in the trash can?

667
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,433
Ugh, that's disgusting!

668
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,476
So… so you mean the one on the sofa?

669
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,519
Quiet, shut up.

670
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,229
-Keep it down. All right.
-Seriously? You sure?

671
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,147
All right.

672
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,816
Better confess.

673
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,072
Quit playing detective.
You're barking up the wrong tree.

674
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,408
What was that?
You sound like you know who it is.

675
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,076
-So you really know? Who is it?
-Get the hell off me.

676
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,870
-Please, just tell me.
-We won't tell anyone.

677
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:43,787
Oh, jeez.

678
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,581
Really? So none of you know?

679
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:47,875
It was Choi Min-u.

680
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,918
-No way!
-His girlfriend right now is Jeong-a.

681
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,378
Then it was her and Min-u that--

682
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,173
Of course it wasn't. He was sleeping
with someone else back then.

683
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:59,261
So then he was actually
cheating on her? That freaking asshole!

684
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,348
-How could he even do that to her?
-I feel sorry for her.

685
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,891
There are quite a number
of pretty girls

686
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,893
who balance it out
by having poor judgment.

687
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,353
You'll be surprised.

688
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,272
No wonder you're called
Bit-na News. Bit-na Live! Breaking news!

689
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,857
-Let me pour you a shot.
-Stop overreacting.

690
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,900
Tune in for the scoop now!

691
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,568
-Oh, thank you very much.
-This is boring.

692
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,903
-Is your source even reliable?
-Let's go.

693
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,030
-No way.
-Nah, don't doubt her.

694
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,032
-More drinks over here, please!
-Whose glass is empty?

695
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,326
-Mine's empty! Mine's empty!
-You should take a break.

696
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,786
-But pass them anyway!
-Thank you, my dear.

697
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:24,870
You're the best!

698
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,497
-So how did you find out?
-Find out what?

699
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,748
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

700
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,959
-I think you dropped this.
-Oh!

701
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,252
Thank you very much.

702
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,174
Look at this guy.

703
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,264
You look a bit different
when you're smiling.

704
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,148
I'm just going to the bathroom
for a bit, okay?

705
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,149
Mm.

706
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,455
Why do I suddenly feel so annoyed?

707
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,338
I should probably get back to work.

708
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,519
I felt like getting some ice cream.

709
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,604
Wanna tag along?

710
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,864
Which one do you want?

711
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:43,949
That one?

712
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,659
Not that.

713
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,912
Hmm… that one?

714
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,541
No.

715
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,669
This one.

716
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,677
What's so funny?

717
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,515
You. You're cute.

718
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,394
Shut up.

719
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,568
You have a different style, don't you?

720
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,654
-Gimme that.
-Hey, what are you doing?

721
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,448
Let's just skip study hall
and go play some games.

722
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,991
Just watch.

723
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,159
Oh, sorry!

724
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,582
How come you said you didn't know me?

725
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,668
Uh…

726
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,214
Well, I was kinda caught off guard.

727
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,844
Plus, it would've been weird to tell them
that I knew you.

728
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,515
I didn't even know your name or age
and stuff…

729
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,102
So why'd you just suddenly leave that day?

730
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,567
I was drunk. Really drunk.

731
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,824
So if you don't mind, all that stuff
that I told you that day…

732
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,409
Just forget everything.

733
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,119
That day?

734
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,205
You didn't really say much.

735
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,166
Well…

736
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,293
Should be easier for you, then.

737
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,547
Don't worry.
I won't say anything.

738
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,510
Okay.

739
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,306
You didn't erase it.

740
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,727
Oh, this?

741
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,233
Right, I don't know why…

742
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,443
I tried washing it off,
but it wouldn't…

743
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,779
That's pretty strange.

744
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,365
It was a water-based marker.

745
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,162
Oh, really?

746
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,041
Yeah, that is strange.

747
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,464
Didn't you want to see me again after?

748
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,261
Well…

749
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,639
Not much.

750
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,391
But I guess I had a little regret.

751
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,685
'Cause I thought I'd never actually see
you again.

752
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,689
I felt so relieved…

753
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,734
I was able to see you again.

754
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,501
That's right.
To the left, to the right.

755
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,715
Huh? Stop, stop, stop, stop!

756
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,343
Mm-hm?

757
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,845
What's with you coming in together, huh?

758
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,933
-We thought we'd get some ice cream.
-Wow, ice cream!

759
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,852
Just what I wanted. Wanna try this?

760
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,604
No, not at all. I'm good.

761
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:04,524
Love always begins
with ice cream, you know that?

762
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,817
Come here!

763
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,195
Yeah, yeah.

764
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,822
-Hey! We're going out for a smoke.
-Mm.

765
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,575
-You wanna go with us?
-No, she doesn't smoke.

766
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,411
-Careful! Coming through.
-Really?

767
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,455
Watch out, we're going out!

768
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,082
-All right.
-Come on! Come on!

769
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,929
Damn it.

770
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,812
Here you go. Those are my contact details.

771
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,272
Just text me your bank account number,
and how much it cost you.

772
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,315
I'll wire you the money.

773
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,275
Sure, I'll be keeping in touch.

774
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,446
I'm really sorry about your shirt.

775
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,489
Forget about it.

776
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,159
Your head's kinda turning red,
are you okay?

777
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,577
Uh…

778
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,580
It's okay. My head's pretty tough.
Hard as a rock, you know.

779
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,625
Uh, and you? I ran into you pretty hard.
You don't feel dizzy or anything?

780
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,252
I'm feeling okay, don't worry about me.

781
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,629
That's a relief.

782
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:08,672
Let's go.

783
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:14,636
It's too early. Why don't we
just go for another round somewhere, huh?

784
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,430
Everyone here?
No one left behind?

785
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,390
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

786
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,808
-Hey, let's go.
-See you tomorrow.

787
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,436
-You're going, right?
-Okay, where are we going?

788
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,645
Okay. Stop pushing.

789
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,313
-Come on, we're leaving.
-Let's go.

790
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,898
-Bye, guys.
-All right. Take care.

791
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,859
All right. Bye.

792
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,153
Careful on the way back!

793
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,614
You were putting away
quite a few tonight. Sure you're fine?

794
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,491
Yeah, I feel fine.

795
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,201
I'm not even tipsy at all.

796
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,953
What about you?

797
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,875
Oh, is that your girlfriend?

798
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,418
Hm?

799
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,421
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

800
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,798
I'm taking the bus from here.
Careful going home.

801
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,426
Oh, take care.

802
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,453
We meet again.

803
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,746
I like butterflies.

804
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,333
A lot.

805
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,085
I felt so relieved…

806
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,962
I was able to see you again.

807
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,507
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

808
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,969
Don't tell me this is fate.

809
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,014
Oh, I'm going crazy.

810
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,361
OH BIT-NA

811
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,405
Guys, send me
20,000 won each for the drinks.

812
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:02,244
PARK JAE-EON

813
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,789
Why are you still awake?

814
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:50,834
Right now?

815
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,837
Sure it's okay to come over?

816
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,689
-I SENT THE MONEY
-I SENT THE MONEY TOO

817
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,317
Are you sleeping?

818
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,157
Why would he be asleep already?

819
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,748
What the hell am I doing?

820
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,732
Sleeping?

821
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,193
Come on, not you.

822
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,126
SCULPTURE STUDIO 3
HONGSEO UNIVERSITY

823
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,969
Hey, Sol.

824
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,720
Aren't you going for a smoke?

825
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:26,721
I already did just now.

826
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,390
Okay.

827
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,478
Hey, guys.
Aren't you going out for a smoke?

828
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,563
No, just go. I'm totally busy right now.

829
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,773
Don't bother me.

830
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,276
What about you, wanna go?

831
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,069
No, I'm trying to make
this damn thing stick.

832
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,740
So none of you wanna go?

833
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:46,866
Jeez!

834
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,961
-Hello.
-Hey, Na-bi.

835
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:02,549
-What you up to, Na-bi?
-Oh, hey, what's up?

836
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,515
-Na-bi, what's up?
-What?

837
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,101
Oh, nothing. What's up?

838
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,896
I have to work late,
I need an energy drink.

839
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,401
-Na-bi.
-Hey.

840
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,069
-You looking for someone?
-No, I'm not.

841
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,613
I'm just getting some fresh air.

842
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,370
Professor!

843
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,164
-Prof!
-Professor!

844
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:37,959
Professor!

845
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,628
Professor, can you help me?
Just for a second?

846
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,175
Gyeong-jun! Please help me out!
Over here! Over here! Over here!

847
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,011
No matter how many colors
I try to mix,

848
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,637
I can't get the right color that I want.

849
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,057
Hmm, I'm not helping you
unless you call me Mr. An.

850
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,641
Oh, you're not our senior,
why would I do that?

851
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,894
But I would be really grateful
if you'd just help me out

852
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,604
-with this one tiny coloration.
-Mr. An!

853
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,065
See? He calls me Mr. An.

854
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,192
-Gyeong-jun! No wait, Mr. An!
-I need your help.

855
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,151
But…

856
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:09,115
After you get the surface
all prepared, just apply the second layer,

857
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,493
and then coat it with primer
in the end. Okay?

858
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,453
PARK JAE-EON

859
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,083
He's in the group chat, though.
What's going on?

860
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,960
PARK JAE-EON

861
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,257
-Mr. An!
-What are you doing?

862
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,927
-Gyeong-jun! I mean, Mr. An!
-Hello, ma'am.

863
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,428
Why were you so startled just now?

864
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,306
To be honest, I'm more startled
at the state of your piece.

865
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,724
Why is there no progress?

866
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,977
Well, I… I'm almost…
I'm almost finished with it.

867
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,814
This shouldn't be only "almost finished."
Understand? Yes?

868
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,025
I'll work late today.

869
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,568
Working late isn't going to do
anything for…

870
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,950
-You and I will talk later.
-Yes, ma'am.

871
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,671
-Hey, Bit-na.
-What's up?

872
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,714
Has everyone paid their share?

873
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,925
What? Yeah, everyone chipped in. Why?

874
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,969
I was just curious, just wondering.

875
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:12,303
They all sent it.

876
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:14,889
Hmm…

877
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,852
Jae-eon gave it to me in cash
right before we left..

878
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,272
Oh.

879
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,315
Hmm. Mm-hm.

880
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,943
-Okay, carry on.
-All good?

881
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,279
Focus, all right?

882
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,613
I am focused.

883
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,914
I'm so full.
My stomach's going to explode.

884
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,542
-Not if mine does it first.
-I can barely breathe anymore.

885
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,419
But I can totally still have some dessert.

886
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:45,920
Cake? Now that I can put away easy.

887
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,297
You read my mind.
I could do cake.

888
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,049
I can have a slice and eat it with coffee.
That's a perfect idea!

889
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,093
Look, we still have some time left.
Shall we?

890
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,846
-We shall, my glutton friend.
-Guess our lunch will never end!

891
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,306
-Right on.
-Oh, yeah.

892
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,600
Guess you're really trying
to build that belly, huh?

893
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,810
Why is he always trying to pick a fight?

894
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,979
-I keep waiting for him to jibe with us.
-Yeah, tell me about it.

895
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:05,690
Oh, no. Has anyone seen
by Bluetooth earphones?

896
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,234
Earphones, earphones, earphones.

897
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,361
I left them at the outdoor studio.

898
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,572
You might as well kiss them goodbye.
They're gone now.

899
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,324
There are security cameras
everywhere.

900
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,659
Nobody's gonna take 'em,
they're probably still there.

901
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,827
You sure?

902
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,204
It's too far away.

903
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,706
-I'll just ask in our group chat.
-Hold on, I'll go get them for you.

904
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,750
-All the way back?
-Yeah.

905
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,336
It's fine. You really don't need to.

906
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,047
I was about to go back anyway,
it's not like it's out of the way.

907
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,466
I'll look for them and then just put them
inside your locker.

908
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:34,093
-So just message your passcode.
-I'm so touched right now.

909
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,803
-Thank you.
-It's nothing.

910
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,016
She's so kind.

911
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,018
I couldn't decline.

912
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,063
I'm way too attractive and fine.

913
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:48,066
Keep dreaming.
She'd never fall for your goofy ass.

914
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,859
Well, I was just trying to rationalize.

915
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,611
Why'd she go off
and do that for me anyway?

916
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,655
She was already about to head back,
it's a coincidence.

917
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,323
-Shh!
-Never mind. Let's go and have some

918
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:57,367
-of that cake we wanted.
-Hell yeah, cake!

919
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,418
What do you think this is?
Is it a bat?

920
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,922
It's not a bat,
it's a butterfly.

921
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,298
Hmm.

922
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,883
This piece
sure feels different

923
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,510
from all the other ones
that I've seen here.

924
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:16,761
I agree.

925
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,055
I don't even see him that often
working at the studio.

926
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,807
When did he put this together?

927
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,267
He's probably a genius.

928
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,436
Jae-eon entered and won almost
all the competitions last year.

929
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,106
Plus, he's drop-dead gorgeous.
Life's so unfair, isn't it?

930
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,109
So that was Jae-eon's.

931
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,194
But where did Jae-eon
find the idea to…

932
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,321
Oh, Na-bi, I didn't notice you there.

933
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,447
Hey, hello.

934
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,782
What brings you out here?

935
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:42,370
Uh, Jin-su said he left, like,
a pair of Bluetooth earphones behind.

936
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,455
Have you seen it?
It's probably in a small case.

937
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,999
No.

938
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,293
Oh, okay, I will…

939
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,717
Oh, it's Jae-eon. Hey!

940
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,845
-Hey, Jae-eon.
-What's up?

941
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,763
Hey, I haven't seen you
in a while.

942
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,267
Hey, you.

943
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,686
Oh, heya.

944
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,479
Looking for something?

945
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,523
No, I'm not.

946
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,612
Jae-eon, that's a butterfly, right?

947
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,197
She said it kinda looks like a bat.

948
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,992
So you actually recognized it?
Everybody thinks it's a bat.

949
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,744
I'm guessing you really like
butterflies, huh?

950
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,704
Your last piece was about the same thing.

951
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,205
You wanna see my butterflies?

952
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,248
Yeah, show it to us.

953
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,541
Yes, please.

954
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,670
Wow, they're pretty.

955
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,007
Is that why you got
that tattoo?

956
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,967
Like when people get tattoos
of their pets?

957
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,057
Do you have names for each of them?

958
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,726
No, I call them all the same thing.

959
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:50,647
"Butterfly."

960
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:54,859
I think it's perfect.

961
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,005
I like butterflies.

962
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,217
A lot.

963
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,511
"Butterfly."

964
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,179
I think it's perfect.

965
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,723
Jae-eon keeps making me overthink

966
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,976
about trivial things the same way
my annoying ex used to.

967
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,605
God, I hate reading
into all of this meaningless stuff.

968
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,568
You're such an idiot, Na-bi.

969
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,570
Who's the idiot?

970
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,367
Don't look at it.

971
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,037
So what is it? Is it a bunch of seaweed?

972
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,250
That was rude of you eavesdropping
on my thoughts

973
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,502
and then suddenly surprising me
out of nowhere.

974
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,170
I thought you were insensitive.

975
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,131
You just left without a word.

976
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,757
I was waiting for you to say something.

977
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,012
No, I wasn't planning on saying anything.

978
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,807
I was looking for this thing
my friend left behind at the studio.

979
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:14,313
You know you can get anyone
you look at to like you, don't you?

980
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:18,443
It's exactly why you make that face
and talk like that.

981
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:23,865
Huh?

982
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,118
There's that seaweed you said earlier.

983
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,119
-Come here.
-Sorry.

984
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:30,538
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Stop it.

985
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:32,248
-I'm just kidding, I'll wipe it off.
-Wipe it off.

986
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,333
Here, I'll clean it up for you.

987
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,464
I'm sorry, I'll wipe it off!

988
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:43,384
Hang on. What?

989
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:46,053
When did they get so close? I had no idea.

990
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:48,097
Aw, they look pretty good together. Hey!

991
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,015
-Shh!
-Why?

992
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,099
Let's just go.

993
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,559
-Why?
-Come on. Let's just go.

994
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,483
God, my shoulders are killing me.

995
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,027
I wish they had a high bar at school
so I could stretch.

996
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:32,743
Loosen up.

997
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,330
I noticed you're hunching your back
whenever you're working.

998
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,166
Wait, let go for a second. Hey.

999
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,168
Wait a minute, hold on, stop. Wait!

1000
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,349
I almost fell over because of you.

1001
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:09,906
Bit-na says you practically live
in the studio these days.

1002
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,074
It's not how it sounds, really.

1003
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,994
I like working at night,
so I often stay late.

1004
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,204
I mean, you know what it's like,
don't you?

1005
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:20,207
I might try it more often.
You did make it feel fun.

1006
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,628
As our conversation went on,

1007
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,130
you could make out the different sides
of Jae-eon.

1008
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,258
Hmm. I'm jealous.

1009
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:33,095
There was a time
when it used to be fun for me, too.

1010
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:35,598
You don't think it's fun anymore?

1011
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:39,018
I think the difference is there's
a lot more to think about nowadays.

1012
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,647
And I'm not even sure
what I should be doing.

1013
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,398
You wanted to be an exchange student,
didn't you?

1014
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:46,734
Seems like a good goal to have.

1015
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:49,111
It's not even that big of a deal.

1016
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:53,616
It feels special till you see
other students do it too.

1017
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,205
To be completely honest…

1018
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,251
I just wish I could go somewhere far away.

1019
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:06,671
Why?

1020
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,424
Well, because of my mom and also…

1021
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,928
Let's stop talking about this.

1022
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:15,554
You probably think it's…

1023
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,015
I don't think it's boring at all.

1024
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,018
Especially when you talk about yourself.

1025
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:25,356
He's so different
from that first impression I had.

1026
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:29,110
I wanted to believe I was the only one
who knew this side of him.

1027
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,111
Oh.

1028
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,787
There's that lovely moon you like so much.

1029
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,295
It's pretty, isn't it?

1030
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:52,091
Very pretty.

1031
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:03,853
May I have your number?

1032
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,776
Oh. My number?

1033
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:17,241
Suddenly, it feels like
a new chapter is about to begin.

1034
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,535
I'm probably not mistaken.

1035
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:27,460
Yu Na-bi. I saved your number.

1036
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,671
It doesn't matter
what it says there.

1037
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:31,922
You know that I'm Na-bi.

1038
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:38,304
Do you want one?

1039
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,347
No, thanks, I'm good.

1040
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:45,728
Did you get it customized?

1041
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:47,730
Mm-hm.

1042
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:49,732
Looks pretty, right?

1043
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:53,527
Another butterfly.

1044
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,780
Oh, show me the other ones too.

1045
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,866
-The what?
-Your pet butterflies.

1046
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,286
-Oh, my butterflies?
-Mm-hm.

1047
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,080
You wanna go see?

1048
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:10,044
I meant that… the…

1049
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:13,089
I was talking about that video
you showed your friends earlier…

1050
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,049
With the…

1051
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,022
They're pretty.

1052
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,487
What is it that you like so much
about them?

1053
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,411
Sometimes they approach me,

1054
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,580
then they crawl up around my face
just like this.

1055
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,959
And it would make me feel so good.

1056
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,382
It's lovely.

1057
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,888
That tickles.

1058
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,520
On second thought,
I wanna have a smoke, too.

1059
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,777
I don't feel like going back inside.

1060
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,158
Me neither.

1061
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,873
Except that you don't smoke.

1062
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:31,125
You wanna have drinks instead?

1063
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,293
Drinks?

1064
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:37,089
Oh, if you're gonna work some more,
then I'll just--

1065
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,049
No, no, I'm not. Let's go.

1066
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,051
Just the two of us?

1067
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,015
Well, we can…

1068
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:48,559
Of course we can call anyone else
who wants to go.

1069
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:50,227
Should I call them?

1070
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,479
-Why are you laughing?
-No idea.

1071
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:55,858
You just make me laugh somehow.

1072
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,070
So you're happy to have drinks
with just the two of us?

1073
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,113
Just us.

1074
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:14,418
I'm pretty sure…

1075
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:18,047
We feel the same way about each other.

1076
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:15,646
I'm using my wish.

1077
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:18,899
I'm sure he does this to everyone.
He's so petty.

1078
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,943
Park Jae-eon?
That guy's not the type to date.

1079
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:22,736
So just forget about him.

1080
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,905
-I'm falling! I'm falling!
-Are you hurt?

1081
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:26,949
Park Jae-eon,
he really excites me.

1082
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:29,618
Okay, answer this.
Does everyone have to date?

1083
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,871
Can't just two people have
a special kind of closeness?

1084
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:34,164
Or simply be near each other?

1085
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:36,583
Do they have to care
if there's something in their hair?

1086
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,919
What do I really want
from Jae-eon?

1087
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:42,214
I don't get you.
You're just cold towards me sometimes.

1088
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:45,175
Bit-na and I are planning that
we drink some more at my house.

1089
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,302
Wanna join us?

1090
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,179
And now, the bottle will decide
who will end up kissing.

1091
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:54,768
Right. Maybe I should see it
for myself and maybe move on.
