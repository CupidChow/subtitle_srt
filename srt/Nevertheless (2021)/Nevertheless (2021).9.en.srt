1
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,015
You're drinking a lot.

2
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,978
Is something wrong, Na-bi?

3
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,489
No.

4
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,576
Nothing's wrong.

5
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,705
How's work, is it going well?

6
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,460
No, I went out
because I couldn't focus.

7
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:31,466
Na-bi keeps looking
somewhere else instead of looking at me.

8
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,135
I saw you two together.

9
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,721
At school.

10
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,644
-What?
-I meant Do-hyeok.

11
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,774
Oh.

12
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,739
Do you like him?

13
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,619
Why are you asking me that?

14
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,458
Nothing. I'm just curious.

15
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,881
I do.

16
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,802
He's a good guy.

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,818
What makes you say that?

18
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,991
He's a really good cook

19
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,202
and he's considerate.

20
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,874
He can be cute sometimes, too.

21
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,339
And most of all,
I feel comfortable when I'm with him.

22
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,019
If you like him,
why aren't you dating him?

23
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,320
That's not something
you should be asking, is it?

24
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,115
Probably not.

25
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,502
If I date him,
he'll be disappointed in me.

26
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,218
Because I'm not really the kind of person
he thinks I am.

27
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,016
At least to his eyes…

28
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,980
I want to seem like a good person.

29
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,036
Then what about me?

30
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:24,639
EPISODE 9: I KNOW IT'S OVER.
NEVERTHELESS,

31
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,979
You like her that much?

32
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,022
Yeah, I do.

33
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,608
And I miss her all the time.

34
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,319
Then what are you waiting for, huh?
You have to be bolder.

35
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,490
Well, I can't really do that right now.

36
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,994
Hmm. I feel like I might mess things up.

37
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,079
So frustrating.

38
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,292
Are you having a good time?

39
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,755
DID YOU GO HOME?
ARE YOU HAVING FUN?

40
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,883
Is she home yet?

41
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,636
Hey, don't look at my messages.

42
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,554
Look at what?

43
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,098
Not you. Just keep sleeping, okay?

44
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,725
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,601
Look, Do-hyeok.

46
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,355
Just take my advice,
ask her to meet up now.

47
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,940
You said you forgot to give her that.

48
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,484
Ah, that's a bit…

49
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,570
It's fine, it's not even urgent.

50
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,907
And besides, I'm a bit tipsy.

51
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,076
This is so frustrating.

52
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,455
You're a decent guy, Do-hyeok,
but you're not making any bold moves here.

53
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,880
Love is about timing, you know?

54
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,674
If you keep hesitating like that,
you'll never get her.

55
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,093
It's because…

56
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,721
I really don't want to lose her, you know?

57
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:50,266
If you don't want to lose her, then
why don't you ask to meet right now, huh?

58
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,854
If you're not going to,
then bring us another bottle.

59
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,022
We're all out.

60
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,901
All right.

61
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,666
Well, I'll get going now.

62
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,335
Are you walking home?

63
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,088
Mm-hm. I should sober up a bit.

64
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,048
Good night, see you tomorrow.

65
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,229
Why are you following me?

66
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,189
I'm not following you.

67
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,824
Then where are you going?

68
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,033
To your place.

69
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,952
-What?
-To get my stuff.

70
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,496
Oh.

71
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,934
She's not asleep already, is she?

72
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,079
Just wait out here
while I fix them.

73
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:35,997
Out here?

74
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,040
I didn't pack everything yet.

75
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,917
I didn't think
you'd suddenly come for them.

76
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,171
Then I'll pack 'em with you.

77
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,560
I can go inside, right?

78
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,812
Mm.

79
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,453
All right…

80
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,038
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

81
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,669
What are you talking about?

82
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,300
Hey, just slow down.
We didn't come here to drink, you know.

83
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,593
Yeah, well, I just came here to drink.

84
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,637
You're unbelievable, Bit-na.

85
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,639
Why did we even come here then?

86
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,432
Hey, look at that guy.

87
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,768
-I think all the cute guys are over there.
-… some cute guys I wanna meet.

88
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,229
-Are you lonely?
-Yes.

89
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,904
That guy over there
looks pretty cute, though.

90
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,322
Oh, yeah, he does.

91
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,282
SHARE WITH NAM GYU-HYUN

92
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,914
Hey, girls. My friends
say they want to come here too.

93
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,582
They're three guys. What do you think?

94
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,584
Yeah, that's perfect.
Tell them to come.

95
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,877
Okay!

96
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,712
Are they good-looking?

97
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,464
I'm leaving, girls.

98
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,132
-Huh?
-Hey!

99
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,635
-You two have fun.
-Hey!

100
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,140
Ugh! Just call two guys, then.

101
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,122
Do you like it?

102
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,124
Mm.

103
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,544
It's so pretty.

104
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,506
Under the sunshine, it'll be prettier.

105
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,380
HUMAN ART ANATOMY FOR SCULPTORS

106
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,092
I, uh… I think that's all your stuff.
There's nothing else here.

107
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,218
Yeah, it's all here.

108
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,804
But I'm kinda disappointed.

109
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,473
What do you mean?

110
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,683
I thought you'd have
a late birthday present for me.

111
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,312
I was kinda expecting a surprise.

112
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,815
There's nothing like that.

113
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,526
Anyway, if that's everything,
you should get going.

114
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,278
I'm a little bit tired.

115
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,966
Are you all better now?

116
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,469
Yeah.

117
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,097
Looks like I did a good job treating it.

118
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,992
Let's not make another mistake.

119
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,037
I think you should go.

120
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,858
Do you really think this is a mistake?

121
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,405
Of course I do.
I'm sure you feel the same way.

122
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,782
That's a lie.

123
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,204
I don't feel that way.

124
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,503
I enjoy being with you, Na-bi.

125
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,255
Are you toying with me?

126
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,926
I like that face you make
when you're angry.

127
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,928
Is this fun to you, Jae-eon?

128
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,390
I'm not joking here.

129
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,104
Let's go out, Na-bi.

130
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,609
What?

131
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,578
Think about it and tell me.

132
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,165
I'll go.

133
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,963
Go sleep in the bedroom.

134
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,339
You'll catch a cold.

135
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,801
Oh, no, I can't sleep right now.
I still have a lot to do.

136
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,594
Huh?

137
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,431
What? Hold on.
She got in, but Na-bi got rejected?

138
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,434
The school Na-bi applied to
is pretty tough to get into.

139
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,477
Oh.

140
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,188
I have to make the calls
and prepare the documents.

141
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,692
I'm totally screwed, I won't make it.

142
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,903
Just relax, I can help you make
the calls tomorrow. So go to bed.

143
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,406
It's fine. You have a lot to do, too.

144
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,491
It's all right, I have some time tomorrow.

145
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,786
What?

146
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,707
I feel kind of embarrassed.

147
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,041
Why?

148
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,295
I tell you to stop poking your nose
in others' businesses.

149
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,715
But it feels like
I'm getting the most benefit out of it.

150
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,718
Means you're grateful, right?

151
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,889
Well, I guess.

152
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,685
You're so easy to like.

153
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,313
Huh?

154
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,232
It stays near you all the time.

155
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,156
Oh, I guess you're right.

156
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,098
Let's go out, Na-bi.

157
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,467
I'm really not used to how I am…

158
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,597
when I'm with Na-bi.

159
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,867
Let's go out, Na-bi.

160
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,749
What was that, all of a sudden?

161
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,425
Did Jae-eon really mean what he said?

162
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,193
Can we meet right now?

163
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,423
I just read your message. Sorry.

164
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,676
If it's not urgent, let's meet next time.

165
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,679
I'm a bit tired right now,
so I'm going to bed early.

166
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,897
YU NA-BI

167
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,877
-Nice dig!
-Okay!

168
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,798
-All right. Nice!
-Nice rebound, man.

169
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,677
I guess
you're really not feeling it today.

170
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,637
You seem way too tense.

171
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,055
I'm not improving at all.

172
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,474
I want to be better.

173
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,476
You know, if you start to get greedy,

174
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,687
things won't work out well for you,
Jae-eon.

175
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,856
Do you think I got greedy?

176
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,568
It's not bad if you are.
You tend to try harder if you get greedy.

177
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,280
So do your best.

178
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,492
Come on, let's play another game.

179
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,536
Okay.

180
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,917
-Hey, Na-bi. Hey, Sol.
-Hey there.

181
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:29,835
Hi!

182
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,254
-Hi! Hey!
-Hi.

183
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,384
Hey, Sol.

184
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,888
Wake up, Sol.

185
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,974
If someone tells you "let's go out"
without even saying they like you,

186
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,058
what do you think it means?

187
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,519
It could mean two things.

188
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,022
That person's a jerk,

189
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:54,401
or they thought it was unnecessary
because it's so obvious they like you.

190
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,950
So what time is your progress report?

191
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,077
Progress report?

192
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,830
For the exhibition.

193
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,958
Oh, right.

194
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,711
-When's the exhibit?
-Tomorrow.

195
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,922
You didn't prepare for it?

196
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,716
No.

197
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,760
Why not? What's going on with you?

198
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,220
Nothing.

199
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,515
Oh, hey Ji-wan

200
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,725
Hmm?

201
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,647
Uh, Na-bi,
I'll go ahead to the lecture room.

202
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,273
We can go there together.

203
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,691
Uh, no, it's fine.

204
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,943
I'll see you later.

205
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,656
Hey, what's up with Ji-wan?

206
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,076
I don't know.

207
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,672
It looks like nothing has changed here.

208
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,473
-Hey, Do-hyeok.
-Hm?

209
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,976
Do you remember that spot?

210
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,854
When you and I were kids,
we were playing in there

211
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:57,649
and then I broke a glass cup, and
your grandpa scolded you because of that.

212
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,026
You really remember all that?

213
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,319
Of course I do.

214
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:06,199
You know, back then, it was so fun
to hide somewhere and play in secret.

215
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,370
You're right. It was exciting
when we were in elementary school.

216
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,538
It was.

217
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,593
Whoa, you're pretty good.

218
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,141
Make it tasty for me, all right?

219
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,977
I will. I'll make it tasty.

220
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,690
Hey, Do-hyeok!

221
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,653
The reactions to your video are great.

222
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,116
I can't believe this. Listening to
Na-bi's advice was a great idea.

223
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,384
Can you try this for me?

224
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,307
Mm. Ugh!

225
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,850
That tastes weird.

226
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,769
What's wrong? Is it bad?

227
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,613
Hey there.
Grandson of a noodle shop owner.

228
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,449
What even happened in Seoul?
Why are you acting like this?

229
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,284
Nothing happened in Seoul.

230
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,747
Come on, you were so excited
to go there to see Na-bi.

231
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,708
But now you're acting like a zombie
and you're telling me nothing happened?

232
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,045
In the end, did you lose to Park Jae-eon?

233
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,717
Oh! You know, Do-hyeok,
just give up and find someone else.

234
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,011
You're popular, you know.

235
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,097
Can you make some noodles for me?

236
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,099
I'm really hungry.

237
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,102
Make it yourself.

238
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,537
Should I just give up on her?

239
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,348
Jae-eon.

240
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,934
What are you making there?

241
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,686
I'm making a pendant.

242
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,523
Then what's this over here?

243
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,827
Thanks, Jae-eon.

244
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,734
You like it that much?

245
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,362
What do you mean?

246
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,571
The meat.

247
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,407
Hey, wasn't the barbecue amazing that day?

248
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,117
Oh, man!

249
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,541
What's going on with that guy?
What's he been doing these days?

250
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,834
He works part-time at an internet cafe.

251
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,421
-Part-time job?
-Mm-hm. You didn't know?

252
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,382
I thought you two shared everything.

253
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:54,427
Ugh! The internet cafe he works at
has a really romantic name.

254
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,972
-What is it?
-"Perhaps Love".

255
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,602
Hey, Gyu-hyun,
you wanna have drinks today?

256
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,189
Not me. Um, I have gastritis,
so I can't drink at all.

257
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,108
Hm? Gastritis?

258
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,568
But you're totally healthy.

259
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,486
Whatever!

260
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,198
-It must be because of stress.
-Hey, Bit-na.

261
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,243
What do you want?

262
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,037
Let's go somewhere and talk.
I have something to tell you.

263
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,081
We can talk here.

264
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,541
It's not going to take long.

265
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,046
What the hell?

266
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,353
All right. What is it?

267
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,066
Oh, this is--

268
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,027
Why did send
your package to my house?

269
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,661
"All right. I've made a grave mistake."

270
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,496
Is this what you wanted to hear?

271
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,041
Yeah.

272
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,628
All right, um…

273
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,797
Hey, isn't that mine?

274
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,801
Uh, you gave this to me to wear last time,
don't you remember?

275
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,053
Do you want it back?

276
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,472
No, it's fine. Keep it.

277
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,478
You're actually really petty, aren't you?

278
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,104
Just take it.

279
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,862
Hey, what are you doing
this weekend?

280
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:36,946
Uh…

281
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,994
This exhibition is opening this week.

282
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,038
PARK DAE-SEONG EXHIBITION

283
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,623
I thought we should go together.

284
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,208
Together?

285
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,170
Yeah, that's right. I'm asking you out.

286
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,298
I really like you, Sol.

287
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,510
Since we first met at the cafe.

288
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,346
Oh…

289
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,641
You're not seeing anyone right now,
are you, Sol?

290
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,102
I'm not, but I…

291
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,106
Actually, there's someone I like.

292
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,277
Oh, you have a crush on someone?

293
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,114
Mm-hm.

294
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,909
Then did you…

295
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,330
I guess it's personal. I'm sorry.

296
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,667
I did… say something…

297
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,878
because my feelings kept growing.

298
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,756
I see.

299
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,094
Okay, so let me get this straight.

300
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,596
You're telling me
that your friend said they like you

301
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,056
and you actually like them, too.

302
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,018
But the thing is, you're afraid
of ruining your friendship?

303
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,311
Mm-hm.

304
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,731
If we start dating now
and then break up later…

305
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,026
I mean, my friend is so capable
in every way and has everything

306
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,779
so losing me is not gonna be a big deal.

307
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,573
I'm sure they can find
someone else.

308
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,868
But without my friend,
it'd be the same as losing half my life.

309
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,203
I'm really screwed,
I don't know what to do.

310
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,499
I envy you.

311
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,962
Hmm? But why? I'm so confused right now.
Why would you envy me?

312
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,006
Because your friend
is your other half, Ji-wan.

313
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,799
Actually, you're pretty lucky.

314
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,843
It means both of you
are sure about your feelings.

315
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,138
There's nothing better than that,
you know.

316
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,598
Still…

317
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,226
Plus, from my experience…

318
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,145
I mean,

319
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,772
the way I see it,

320
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:37,025
I think you two can't go back
to the way things were after all this.

321
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,652
Unless both of you
suddenly lose your memories,

322
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,654
you'll never be able
to just be friends again.

323
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,743
Please stop stating cold hard facts,
I beg you, Na-bi.

324
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,954
So don't suffer like this all by yourself

325
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,706
and talk to your friend
about how you feel.

326
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,916
I mean, who knows?

327
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,418
That friend of yours
might be thinking the exact same thing.

328
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,716
But… I'm too scared to tell them, Na-bi.

329
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,261
I know how that feels.

330
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,240
EXCHANGE PROGRAM APPLICATION RESULTS

331
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,953
YU NA-BI
REJECTED

332
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,425
Your sculpture
doesn't look that bad,

333
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,637
but it's definitely not as good
as I expected.

334
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,853
Don't you have two assistants?
Where's the other one, Na-bi?

335
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,979
Oh…

336
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,981
Jin-su's at his part-time job right now.

337
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,733
Are you getting a lot of help from them?

338
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,490
Yes, they're both helping me out a lot.

339
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,783
We often have meetings, too.

340
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:12,871
Really?

341
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,712
I really thought you two
would create a great piece together.

342
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,507
Maybe you two haven't figured out
each other's strengths.

343
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,222
Look, Na-bi. I've told you this
many times before.

344
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,474
You really have talent.

345
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,021
However, I can't feel your emotion
in your works.

346
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,648
It's not just about
finishing your piece, you know.

347
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,609
You have to inspire other people as well.

348
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,319
Pieces that receive compliments

349
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,280
and ones that attract attention
are very different.

350
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,824
Right.

351
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,619
Are you passionate about this piece?

352
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,912
Do you care about it?

353
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,498
Of course, Professor.

354
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,587
I'm sure you'd feel upset
about me saying this when you tried hard.

355
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,214
You may think it's nonsense,
but I know you can do better.

356
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,635
I really think you can make
a great piece with just a bit more heart.

357
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,224
Put your heart into it.

358
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,143
I wanted you to learn that
from Jae-eon, Na-bi.

359
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,319
I'll do my best, Professor.

360
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,157
Let me see yours, Geon-ung.

361
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:43,294
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK TRIPE

362
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,525
Here you go, guys.

363
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,994
Try this. It tastes amazing.

364
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,082
So, how did the critique go earlier?

365
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,377
It was awful, Jin-su.

366
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,797
Come on. Everyone gets criticized
by that professor.

367
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,093
Except Jae-eon, I guess.

368
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,595
Aren't you busy?

369
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,514
Uh, I am.

370
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,601
But as your server for today,
I should take good care of you.

371
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,729
Okay, let's have this and this…

372
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,609
It's good, isn't it?

373
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,486
You're right, it is.

374
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:56,534
I'm sorry for not being able to make it.
I can get you a lot of freebies.

375
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,412
Oh, no. It's all right. Thanks, though.

376
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,914
Eat a lot, okay?

377
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,751
Mm. This is pretty good.

378
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,879
I promise I won't miss anything
or be late next time.

379
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,386
Check this out,
I think they're talking about Gyu-hyun.

380
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,554
What? Let me see.

381
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,766
Just listen
to what they're saying, Bit-na.

382
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,226
"I heard that he's a Sculpture major
and he's totally my type."

383
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,187
"I'm going to the internet cafe
every day."

384
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,148
"Please give me 22 extra minutes
as a sign, if you like me too."

385
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,734
There's no doubt about it,
this is about Gyu-hyun for sure!

386
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,196
"Handsome"?
Are you kidding me? Is that it?

387
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,280
Yeah.

388
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,119
What are they talking about?

389
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,665
What is this? Are… are there
more female customers now?

390
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,585
YOU'VE PASSED THE FIRST SCREENING TEST

391
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,922
I passed! I can't believe it!

392
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,342
Oh! Oh my!

393
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,261
I, uh…

394
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,014
…acted like I got the job already.

395
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,599
I mean, I just passed the first test.

396
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:05,812
Hey, come on. That's a huge achievement.

397
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,355
You should prepare for the interview.

398
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,233
Fighting!

399
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,899
The ocean is so beautiful,
Do-hyeok.

400
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,234
I miss you.

401
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,999
I saw the new video.

402
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,625
It looks great.

403
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,756
Emotions…

404
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,017
Emotions…

405
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:35,610
How the hell am I even supposed
to portray my emotions?

406
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,590
Oh, hey, Do-hyeok.

407
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,885
Can we talk right now?

408
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,845
Or are you busy?
I don't want to bother you.

409
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,849
No, it's fine. I was just spacing out
because the critique earlier went badly.

410
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,768
-Critique?
-Oh, it's when

411
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,437
our professor comes in
to evaluate and critique our works.

412
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,942
And I got in trouble.

413
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,487
This semester really is the worst.

414
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,158
I didn't get accepted
to the exchange program either.

415
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,534
Oh…

416
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,766
Is something wrong, Na-bi?

417
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,934
No.

418
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,937
Nothing's wrong.

419
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,273
Let's not make another mistake.

420
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,151
Maybe Na-bi

421
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,446
was already drifting away from me.

422
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,253
I'm really sorry to hear that.

423
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:20,715
You know what?
That school has a bad eye for talent.

424
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,927
I'm planning to go back to Seoul soon.
Can we meet up?

425
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,264
Of course. When are you coming here?

426
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,724
I haven't decided yet.

427
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,936
I guess you feel really bothered
by the whole

428
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,147
me not getting into
the exchange program thing.

429
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,900
Are you just saying that
to try to cheer me up?

430
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,738
Listen, Na-bi. You're already doing
so well, you're a great artist.

431
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,158
Just keep going at it.
Don't let that discourage you.

432
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,995
Thank you, Do-hyeok.

433
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,830
You know I'm your biggest fan, right?

434
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,707
You can use me as much as you want.

435
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,211
When you need something
to cheer you up, you can always call me.

436
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,131
I'll rush right over.

437
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,342
Thank you for saying that.

438
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,177
I feel a little bit better now.

439
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,140
Anyway, I'll call you again later.

440
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,558
Bye, Na-bi.

441
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,984
Did I go overboard?

442
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,320
I'm getting married, guys.

443
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,614
What? You're sure?

444
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,574
Why are you surprised?

445
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,242
When are you getting married?

446
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,994
Maybe early next year?

447
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,080
I feel like we'd break up
if we don't.

448
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,499
I mean, it's already been over five years.

449
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,126
And we've been working
for three years now.

450
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,337
I wanted some change in my life.

451
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,547
It's like a turning point
in our relationship.

452
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,012
A turning point
in a relationship, huh?

453
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,105
Hey, Sol?

454
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,484
-Yeah?
-Listen, if…

455
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,070
If I, uh…

456
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,407
If I tell you that I don't like you
the same way you like me,

457
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,370
then what do you think
is gonna happen to us?

458
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,626
Then I'll keep liking you.

459
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,003
I'll still like you like I do now.

460
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,258
And I'll accept
that you won't return my feelings.

461
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,304
And what if I say I do like you?

462
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,557
What?

463
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,854
What if we get together now
and then break up someday?

464
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,774
But I don't want…

465
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,402
I don't want us to stay like this, either.

466
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,832
Is that what was troubling you?

467
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,751
What do we do now?

468
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,635
Listen, Ji-wan.

469
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,847
My feelings for you will never change.

470
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,229
So trust me.

471
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,149
You don't have to worry.

472
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,344
You done already?

473
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,514
Yeah, I'm going to head home now.

474
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,642
Let's go. I'll take you home.

475
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,727
It's fine. It's not that far anyway.

476
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,562
I was waiting for you the whole time.

477
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,105
I was hoping I could drive you home.

478
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,443
I heard you stayed up all night.
You must be tired.

479
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,461
Thanks a lot for the ride.
I'll get going now.

480
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,422
Hold on a second.

481
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,724
A present.

482
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,658
Did you make this yourself?

483
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,160
Mm-hm. While I was working.

484
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,162
It's so pretty.

485
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:07,042
You could actually sell this, you know.

486
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,878
Why does it sound so funny to me
when you say it?

487
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,593
Go inside. And get some sleep, okay?

488
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,055
Mm. I will, thanks.

489
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,267
INTERNET CAFE PART-TIMER
THE PART-TIMER AT PERHAPS LOVE IS HOT

490
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,520
Oh, hey Bit-na!

491
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,815
Mr. Trainer! Long time no see.

492
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,734
Yeah, why aren't you coming
to our gym anymore?

493
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,403
Ah, you see,
I've been feeling lazy these days.

494
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,572
But I still have my muscles.
Check them out.

495
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,325
Oh, nice biceps! Okay!

496
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,202
Where are you going?
Meeting someone?

497
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,287
Oh, no, I'm going home.
I live just nearby.

498
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,413
Oh.

499
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,084
Hey, you know what?

500
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,711
Since we haven't met in a while,
how about we go play some games?

501
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,296
Games? I'm in.

502
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,383
You wanna play?
I actually know a place around here.

503
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,395
Welcome.

504
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,567
-Whoa, this place looks nice.
-I know, right?

505
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,365
Please, sit anywhere you like.

506
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,742
What?

507
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,954
I'm Choi Jin-woo.

508
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,331
Oh, I'm Yang Do-hyeok. Nice to meet you.

509
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,999
Yes, nice to meet you.

510
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,920
GKC Entertainment was very impressed
by your social media.

511
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,797
Oh, thank you so much.

512
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,842
We would like you to sign

513
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,010
this exclusive contract.

514
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,595
Please read through it.

515
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,264
All right.

516
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,437
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I have to take this call.

517
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,396
Yeah, sure.

518
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,398
-Please, take your time.
-Ah…

519
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,456
Okay. I'll see you later then.

520
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,752
I'll see you later…

521
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:26,283
So what time is your flight?
I'll drive you there.

522
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,618
No, I want to go alone.

523
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,453
I just came here to say goodbye to you.

524
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,121
Come on, let me take you there.

525
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,084
It's fine. I don't want
that kind of vague kindness from you.

526
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,337
And I don't want to get swayed by you.

527
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,050
I've decided not to pretend anymore.

528
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:47,262
They say if you love someone,
you can't act indifferent around them.

529
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,556
I've realized that it's true.

530
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,018
I'm sorry.

531
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,188
It does pay to be honest.

532
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,190
You're actually apologizing to me.

533
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,487
If I go to the States,
I'll contact you

534
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,030
so that you and I can meet up.

535
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,575
No need.

536
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,578
I'm saying goodbye.

537
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,247
And this time, for good.

538
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,918
Having no relationship
with you at all

539
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,462
is much better
than being by your side like this.

540
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,181
Give me a last goodbye hug, will you?

541
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,151
Bye, Jae-eon.

542
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,645
Ooh.

543
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,355
Thank you.

544
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,067
How's it going?

545
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,907
I should keep working on it,

546
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,951
but I don't know what to do anymore.

547
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,957
You know, some things
just suddenly work out

548
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,835
even when you think
that there's no hope anymore.

549
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,422
Sounds like something good happened.

550
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,132
Huh?

551
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,802
No, uh… nothing happened.

552
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,390
I'm happy for you, Sol.

553
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,853
Jeez, really Ji-wan.

554
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,733
Well, Ji-wan didn't actually
tell me directly.

555
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,735
I just realized it myself.

556
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,155
I'm sure
that she was being really obvious.

557
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,865
You were more obvious, you know.

558
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,412
Um, I didn't think I'd be like this.

559
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,876
Oh, and uh,
Ji-wan said you're an excellent counselor.

560
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,921
It's easy to give advice to others,

561
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,049
but I can't do anything myself.

562
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,595
-Is it really over with you and Jae-eon?
-What?

563
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,724
I just thought that
you two really made a good couple.

564
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,310
Why do you think that?

565
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,647
Well, it's just, uh…

566
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,943
the fact that you're both attracted
to each other already makes it special.

567
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,948
It's a miracle.

568
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,701
You think it's a miracle?

569
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,703
That's what I'd say about you and Ji-wan.

570
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,621
Ah, it's not that different.

571
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,165
It's totally different for me and Jae-eon.

572
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:10,173
Maybe this entire thing
was all wrong to begin with.

573
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,218
It just feels that way.

574
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,478
I can't seem to find a solution.

575
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,276
Maybe the problem
is that you're trying to find one.

576
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,998
Excuse me.
Why the hell isn't my order here yet?

577
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,292
Who's going to eat it?

578
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,251
What's he on about?

579
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,838
It's all for me.

580
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:52,674
My friend's on a strict diet,
so he only eats chicken breasts.

581
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,095
Oh, well, that's a relief.
I haven't placed your order yet.

582
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,013
Hold on, what?

583
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,932
You fucking asshole.

584
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,563
Oh, you're not gonna pick up?

585
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,026
What? Where is he?

586
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,950
OH MY SUNSHINE

587
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:25,957
What is it?

588
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,542
Why wasn't my order placed, huh?

589
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,211
I've been waiting so long for my food.

590
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:32,089
You shouldn't eat stuff
like that. You have gastritis, right?

591
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,423
It'll ruin your stomach.

592
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,092
You and your constant nagging.

593
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,344
You'll surely get fired
if you keep working like this.

594
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,304
And what's it to you
whether I get fired or not?

595
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:42,140
Well, what's it to you whether
my stomach hurts from gastritis or not?

596
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,600
Who are you to nag me?

597
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,105
I'm your friend.

598
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,818
Friends can worry about
each other's health too, can't they?

599
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,618
What's wrong with you?
Why are you smiling like that?

600
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,207
"Oh My Sunshine"? Really?
That's so childish.

601
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,918
Huh? What are you on about?
Where's my phone?

602
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,753
I already saw it.

603
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,214
Hey, you shouldn't snoop.

604
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,635
Don't overthink it.
Uh, your name means "shine",

605
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:22,139
so I just put "Oh My Sunshine."

606
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,142
Never mind that.
When do you get off work today?

607
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,268
What?

608
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,186
Let's go on a date.

609
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,731
Oh, this looks so good.

610
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,567
Why isn't Jae-eon coming?

611
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,988
Hang on. Let's eat these before he comes.

612
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,447
Ta-da!

613
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,034
I'm only giving that to you.

614
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,911
Thanks, Jin-su.

615
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,496
You know how much I like you, right?

616
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:57,007
Why is it that you're always late
to our meetings, but today you're early?

617
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,217
Come on. Don't be so harsh, Na-bi.

618
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:03,013
I'm already anxious because
Jae-eon's been working so hard lately.

619
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,933
Hey, you know what? He's been doing
glass projects because of your piece.

620
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,061
I'm getting suspicious.

621
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,856
There's something going on
between you two, right?

622
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,901
Stop talking nonsense
and just eat up, Jin-su.

623
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:20,155
Mm, if it's not Jae-eon,
then is it that noodle guy?

624
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,741
Ever since
our membership training,

625
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,202
we've been saying there's a higher chance
of you dating the noodle guy.

626
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,244
It's him, right?

627
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,038
What?

628
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,373
Hey, come on. You can tell me.

629
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,501
I won't tell anyone else, Na-bi. Swear!

630
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,130
And why should I tell you
who I'm dating or not?

631
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:43,011
Hey, why are you suddenly
getting so upset?

632
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,888
Hey, Jae-eon.

633
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,516
-What took you so long?
-Sorry.

634
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,728
Well, since you're here now…

635
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,856
Let's drink. Here you go.

636
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,026
You too. Here. All right.

637
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,702
All right, cheers!

638
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,842
So the weather is pretty nice,
huh?

639
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,305
Oh, right!

640
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:38,483
This… this is what's inside the package
that was sent to your house.

641
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,151
They're couple keychains.

642
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,238
A lock and a key.

643
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,865
I got these
because they're limited edition.

644
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,451
I didn't know we'd break up
before I gave it to you.

645
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,746
Aren't they pretty?

646
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,208
Yeah. They're pretty.

647
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,423
So, uh, what's going to happen
between us now?

648
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,425
-To us?
-Yeah.

649
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,512
Well, um…

650
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,560
I mean, do I…
Do I really have to say this out loud?

651
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,645
You need to say it
for me to understand.

652
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,110
Give me your hand.

653
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,283
Gyu-hyun, let's start dating again.

654
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:32,620
Be my boyfriend again.
And this time around, I'll be good.

655
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:36,875
It was all my fault, I'm sorry!
I promise I won't do that again.

656
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,669
I'll do my best. I'll change for you!

657
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,589
Come on, Bit-na.
Can't you be serious for just one second?

658
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,966
Hey. You're the one who's always serious
about everything.

659
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,845
If I become serious too, then there
won't be any chemistry between us, right?

660
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:52,307
-You see?
-Yeah, you're right.

661
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,061
What…

662
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,692
Thank you.

663
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,778
Thank you too, Gyu-hyun.

664
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,617
Oh, I really missed this smell.

665
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,663
Are you a pervert or something?

666
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,249
What do you mean?
How can you say that to your sunshine?

667
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,920
I really missed you too.

668
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:25,006
From now on, let's go on a lot of dates.

669
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,425
Uh, we can go to movie theaters,
amusement parks,

670
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,885
beaches, and mountains too!

671
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:29,969
All right.

672
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:34,599
Listen, I'll try my very best
to be abstinent just for you.

673
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,851
What? You'll be abstinent?

674
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,104
Yes, I'll do my best. I really mean it.

675
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,523
Well, you don't need to go that far.
I mean…

676
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,236
I'm a man, you know, and…

677
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,197
And I like it too.

678
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:52,742
You like what, Gyu-hyun?
Can you be a bit more specific?

679
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,497
Do I really have to say that out loud?

680
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,958
You just said I needed to talk
for you to understand.

681
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,709
You're not sticking to your word. Come on!

682
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,211
-I mean…
-Tell me what you mean.

683
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,879
You already know what I mean.

684
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,215
How would I know?
You have to tell me, so I'll know.

685
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,928
-What?
-You're actually pretty small.

686
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,722
Hey, are you calling me short?
I'm quite tall, you know.

687
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,392
Hey!

688
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,858
-What?
-No, I didn't say anything.

689
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,526
All right. I'm sorry, come on.

690
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,988
Don't worry about me, Mom.

691
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,367
Okay, I will. Tell Dad
I'm gonna call him later, all right?

692
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,869
Yeah, I should really get going now.

693
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,288
I promise I'll call
as soon as I get there.

694
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,738
Oh, hey, Do-hyeok.

695
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,491
Yeah, I'm heading out right now.

696
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,160
Oh, no, you don't need to come.
I can just take a cab.

697
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,538
Okay. I'll be there soon. Mm-hm.

698
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,762
Do-hyeok!

699
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,556
-Hey.
-I brought coffee.

700
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,767
Oh.

701
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,778
-Oh, right.
-Mm?

702
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,949
-Here.
-What's this?

703
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,909
I, um, got them printed.

704
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,078
-The photos?
-Mm-hm.

705
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,080
Whoa!

706
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,500
I can't believe
you got them printed like this.

707
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,629
Hmm…

708
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,381
You're really good at taking photos.

709
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,799
How about cooking?

710
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,467
Your cooking?

711
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,559
Oh, the weather was amazing that day.

712
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,435
And here.

713
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,772
-What's this?
-Well, it's going to rain later.

714
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,233
-Today?
-Mm-hm.

715
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,529
But it doesn't look like
it's going to rain at all today.

716
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,365
Use that if it does.
I have another one here.

717
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,952
All right. Thank you.

718
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,708
So did the meeting go well?

719
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,418
Yeah. It was okay.

720
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:52,338
We're going to meet again
after revising the contract.

721
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,132
Whoa, a contract.

722
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:56,884
Then does that mean
you're going to have an agency?

723
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,720
I, um, I don't know much about it yet.

724
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,308
Oh, and that video you just uploaded
got a lot of views, too.

725
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,101
Well, it's all thanks to you.

726
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,853
Thank you.

727
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,897
I already told you, Do-hyeok.
It's not me. It's all you.

728
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,109
Yeah, but I only thought of doing it
since you gave me all that advice.

729
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,319
That's why.

730
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,951
Thank you for saying that. I'm flattered.

731
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,374
The day we met at your school,

732
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:33,338
I actually went to your house at night
to give you the photos.

733
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:36,924
Oh, really?
Then why didn't you say anything?

734
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:39,010
That's because I saw

735
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,597
you and Jae-eon going
into your house together.

736
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,145
Listen, Na-bi. I know that I said

737
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,564
I could wait for you
for as long as it takes.

738
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,444
But I felt so jealous when I saw you two.

739
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:03,242
Do-hyeok, I…

740
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:09,040
Na-bi, believe me.
All I really want is for you to be happy.

741
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,626
But look, Jae-eon…

742
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,719
Have you ever felt, even once,
that he sincerely likes you?

743
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,388
Just think about it.

744
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,804
Jae-eon?

745
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:48,347
Why are you here?

746
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:51,601
Hey.

747
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,520
Why did you get home so late?

748
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,522
Were you with Do-hyeok this entire time?

749
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,608
Hold on, are you drunk?

750
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,277
And it's none of your business
if I'm with him or not.

751
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,987
Oh, that's cold, Na-bi.

752
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,115
What is it? Am I boring to you?

753
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,242
Since you have someone else now?

754
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,079
Just go home, Jae-eon.
Let's talk again when you're sober.

755
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:19,921
Does he still like you?

756
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,256
Even after he saw us together that night

757
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,424
entering your house?

758
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:25,760
What?

759
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,346
Unbelievable.

760
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:31,891
Is that the reason you chose him over me?

761
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:38,105
You mean you knew all along
Do-hyeok was here that day?

762
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:39,899
Didn't you know he was here, too?

763
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:45,404
Answer me, Jae-eon. Did you really see
Do-hyeok here that day?

764
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,614
Yeah, I did.

765
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,243
You should have seen his face
when he saw us together.

766
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,370
It looked like he'd burst into tears.

767
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,831
Then why didn't you say anything?

768
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:55,998
Why would I do that?

769
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:57,750
What would that do?

770
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,628
Oh, that's right. You said
you didn't want to disappoint him.

771
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,091
Then should I have told you to go ahead
and explain everything to him?

772
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,217
But it's true.

773
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:09,095
We did have a relationship like that.

774
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,643
Have you lost your mind?

775
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,270
You shouldn't be angry with me.

776
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,856
After all,
I'm just telling the truth like you did.

777
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,787
Are you serious?
Is that why you asked me out that night?

778
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:36,831
Isn't that what you always wanted?

779
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:44,171
Oh, I guess that's not
what you really wanted from me.

780
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,632
And you say that you really like me?

781
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,175
That's nonsense.

782
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,261
What about you?
Why did you say that to Seol-a?

783
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:53,097
Was that just to screw me over?
It wasn't, was it?

784
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,390
Yeah, it was.

785
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,559
I just did that to screw you over.

786
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:59,353
You were leading me on,
but you also say we're just friends,

787
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,523
and then I found out you had a girlfriend.
I did it because you were a jerk.

788
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,025
Hey.

789
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,611
Am I the only jerk here?

790
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:08,863
Do you regret it?

791
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:12,158
Do you regret what we did?

792
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:14,660
Then just say so.

793
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,207
Yeah.

794
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,085
I do.

795
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:29,675
You, this messed up relationship,
and everything we ever did together.

796
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,721
But I'm not going to blame you for it.

797
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,640
I brought it on myself.

798
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:40,561
I already knew from the very beginning
there was no happy ending for us.

799
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,813
But I was a total idiot
for getting my hopes up

800
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,523
and thinking you could be sincere.

801
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:51,697
You said I had the right to choose
what happens to our relationship.

802
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,285
Don't you ever show your face to me again.

803
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,207
I lost Na-bi.

804
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:28,544
This time…

805
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,005
for good.

806
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:17,551
Hey, Na-bi!

807
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:21,514
It feels like I'm having
these terrible, recurring nightmares.

808
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,099
Let's get this fixed.

809
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,434
You know, you look happiest
while working on your piece.

810
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,435
And the prettiest.

811
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:27,478
I'm excited.

812
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:29,355
Are you even
gonna be able to come?

813
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,898
Don't strain yourself.

814
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:32,566
I don't think so. I have to make it.

815
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,776
It is your exhibit.

816
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,529
I'm struggling on
how to define the past few days

817
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,948
and the feelings that I have left for him.

818
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,741
-Na-bi.
-If you decided

819
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:43,077
to be a jerk, why couldn't you
have just stayed that way?

820
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,078
What do you even want from me now?

821
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:46,288
I'll stay away from you.
I promise.

822
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:50,543
Lingering care? Regret?
Hate? Or maybe…

823
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,545
Can I have another chance with you?

824
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,338
Please accept this.
