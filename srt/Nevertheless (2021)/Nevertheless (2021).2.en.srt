1
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,052
I'm sure…

2
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,013
I'm sure we feel the same way.

3
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,099
KWON YEO-JU

4
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,234
I don't think I can go today.

5
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,319
How about tomorrow?

6
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,571
Oh, yeah. Okay. That's fine.

7
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,032
Sorry.

8
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,179
PARK JAE-EON

9
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,229
Park Jae-eon isn't exactly
the dating type.

10
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,606
What do you mean by that?

11
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,399
Flirting, yes. Commitment, no.

12
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,901
That's where he draws the line.

13
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,198
He said so himself? That he never commits?

14
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,243
Look, Na-bi, I'm just saying,

15
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,121
flowers don't bloom
just for one butterfly.

16
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,081
What are you saying?

17
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,583
That Park Jae-eon is like that flower.

18
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,085
Gloriously vain,

19
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,421
a symbol of seductive beauty
that withers when plucked.

20
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,965
That's what he is, that's Park Jae-eon.

21
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,883
What is up with you?

22
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,760
I know we're art majors, but still.

23
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,303
You may not be aware of this, Na-bi,

24
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,889
but I'm telling you,
his every move is calculated.

25
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,057
You know…

26
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,893
there were times I felt something was off,

27
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,812
but not anything like that.

28
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,564
You know that's how it begins,

29
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,275
that's how everyone falls
for his stupid, enchanting tricks.

30
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,277
Actually, everyone knows.

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,903
They say they won't fall for it,

32
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,406
yet they do the minute he shows sincerity.

33
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,324
Deep inside, they want to believe it.

34
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,120
So believe me when I tell you.

35
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,455
Park Jae-eon?
That guy's not the type to date.

36
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,709
He just likes to play around with girls
who are drawn to him.

37
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,460
So just forget about him.

38
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,087
With him, you can't keep things casual.

39
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,799
What are you blabbering about?
We're just friends.

40
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,759
Stop lying to yourself.

41
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,845
Trust me, men and women
can't be just friends.

42
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,889
Right. Says the woman
who has a lot of guy friends.

43
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,600
I keep them close
because there's a possibility.

44
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,643
Hanging out with guys
heightens sexual tension.

45
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,561
You catch my drift?

46
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,062
Even Park Jae-eon?

47
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,648
He's not so bad,
I can totally hang out with him.

48
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,234
And also, he's so freaking handsome.

49
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,069
What's up?

50
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,030
Oh, you're actually eating
cafeteria food?

51
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,489
I suggested eating here.

52
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,407
Right.

53
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,326
-I'll just get water.
-Sure.

54
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,997
What is it? You're not feeling well?

55
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,210
Oh… uh… Well…

56
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,545
I'm fine, I just bit my tongue.

57
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,881
You okay?

58
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,008
Uh-huh. I'm all right.

59
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,304
I'll be off now. Enjoy your food.

60
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,305
Where are you going?

61
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,188
You didn't forget, right?

62
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,858
-Hmm?
-I'm using my wish.

63
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,444
But you already used your wish.

64
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,404
I thought you were granting me
another one?

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,407
Okay, but nothing weird.

66
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:20,635
EPISODE 2: IT'S NOT ONLY ME.
NEVERTHELESS,

67
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,217
Let's dance.

68
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,760
I don't want to.

69
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,178
Then let's hang out here.

70
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,472
No, can't we just leave?

71
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,807
Let's hang for a while.

72
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,519
I can't hear anything.
It's too loud in here.

73
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,858
What are you…

74
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,657
I don't want to.

75
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,742
Park Jae-eon…

76
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,369
he really excites me.

77
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,354
All I see is him.

78
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,763
Jae-eon, do you feel the same way?

79
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,663
Sorry.

80
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,917
Let's go.

81
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,677
What the…

82
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,554
I'm so red!

83
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,756
I'm smoking outside.

84
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,264
Park Jae-eon!

85
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,857
Ignoring my messages.
Were you hanging out here?

86
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,859
Are you alone?

87
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,570
Se-mi and Mi-so are inside.
Want to join us?

88
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,790
I'm already with her,

89
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,918
so I can't go with you.

90
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,717
Come on,
we can all hang out together.

91
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,886
We can call my other friends, too.

92
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:32,803
Park Jae-eon…

93
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,973
he makes me feel anxious.

94
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,809
Uh… No, thanks. I'm good.

95
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,647
You can hang out with her.
I'll just go home.

96
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,941
Why are you leaving?

97
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,612
Why don't you just beat it?

98
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,655
All right, then.

99
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,823
See you around.

100
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,046
Why did you try to ditch me?

101
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,382
It was awkward.

102
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,759
You two seemed close.

103
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,512
So I thought you should hang out with her.

104
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,139
We're not close.

105
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,934
We only went to the same academy.

106
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,103
We can all hang out together.

107
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,729
We can call my other friends, too.

108
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,401
Really? Is that all?

109
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,488
She looked pissed
when you told her to leave.

110
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,740
Did she?

111
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,619
That's right.
And maybe for you, it's not a big deal.

112
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,413
She had a butterfly, too.

113
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,082
On her wrist.

114
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,503
I'm not sure
if it was a drawing or a tattoo.

115
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,882
Oh, that. She did that all by herself.

116
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,967
Really?

117
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,595
Why?

118
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,347
Maybe so she would see my reaction.

119
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,101
You know how sometimes you hang out
with friends from school?

120
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,896
But she got so… obsessed with me.

121
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,149
She was delusional.

122
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,780
Why are you suddenly serious?

123
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,866
It has nothing to do with you…

124
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,201
so stop worrying.

125
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,458
I'm taking the bus over there.

126
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,294
-You're going home?
-Mm-hm.

127
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,212
I'm a bit tired.

128
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,469
I'll take you home. It's quite late.

129
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,595
No need.

130
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:38,929
I can manage.

131
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,556
See you.

132
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,795
Is he just leading me on?

133
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,595
What is up with him?

134
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,029
Okay,
this is what I want you to do.

135
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,531
Jeez, this is embarrassing, come on.

136
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,865
Here's what I want you to do.

137
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,243
-Hey, you're… let me see.
-Hey, come on, man. Stay still, would you?

138
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,911
-Put your hands like this.
-It baffles me…

139
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,247
I need to make a sketch
with the light reflecting on it.

140
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,791
-No, I want you to cross them over.
-Like this?

141
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,918
Sure, yeah. That's it. That's it.

142
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,755
-Where should I look?
-Just look at me, it's fine.

143
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,596
You sure don't know
how to compliment others.

144
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,140
You know, Sol…

145
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,352
…you have pretty eyes,
your nose and mouth are pretty too.

146
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,687
Even the shape of your face.

147
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,106
Your eyebrows look amazing.

148
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,774
I am so jealous.

149
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,609
What should we eat for lunch?

150
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,820
How did you hurt yourself again?

151
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,280
Did you tell me earlier?

152
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,533
You're randomly jumping from one topic
to the next again.

153
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,534
No, I'm not.

154
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,537
You see, to me,
there's a certain flow whenever I talk.

155
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,998
Hey, don't lose the posture.

156
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,999
Oh, what was it?

157
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,084
The one earlier. Hurry up!

158
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,670
Oh, yeah, the blind date, how was it?

159
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,756
Mm. It was okay.

160
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,507
I think I'll be seeing him again.

161
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,676
I learned we have
a similar taste in films.

162
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,763
So we agreed to watch one together
next time we meet.

163
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,889
That sounds great.

164
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,223
-Hey, be careful.
-Open it wide.

165
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,892
So what happened
to your forehead?

166
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,018
Oh, this one?

167
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,311
Yeah, that's nice.

168
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,729
Yeah, just go up a little more.

169
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,023
-Like this? More?
-Yeah.

170
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,274
Jeez.

171
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,568
How about this? Is this okay?

172
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,861
Oh yeah, that's great!

173
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,321
Is this okay?

174
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,238
Yeah, yeah.

175
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,573
Is this okay?

176
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,450
Oh, there, there. Don't move.

177
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,245
Hey, Bit-na.
I can't take it anymore. Hurry up.

178
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,956
-Just a few more shots.
-What? No!

179
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,792
What are you trying to do anyway?

180
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,418
-Just a little more. Just a little more.
-I'm falling.

181
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,796
-Almost done.
-I'm falling, I'm falling.

182
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,047
-I'm falling! I'm falling!
-Just a little more.

183
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,256
Na-bi!

184
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,261
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

185
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,224
Right. This ends right now.

186
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,434
Yeah, I'm fine.

187
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,562
What do you want? I'm busy right now.

188
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,358
Nothing. I just came to see you.

189
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,943
I don't want to be a fool again.

190
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,237
You never read my messages.

191
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,321
Oh.

192
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,448
Did you send me messages?

193
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,699
I didn't see them.

194
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,118
Are you busy?

195
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,830
You still have time to eat?

196
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,876
Yeah, I guess I have time to eat.

197
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,262
But then again…

198
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,513
Then we should eat together.

199
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,100
Yeah. Sure, whatever.

200
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,102
Let's go.

201
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,692
WHERE ARE YOU?
DO YOU WANT TO EAT LUNCH?

202
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,735
What are you doing? Are you sleeping?

203
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,074
I'm sure he does this to everyone.

204
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,909
He's so petty.

205
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,870
Where are you?

206
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,631
Home.

207
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,594
PARK JAE-EON

208
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,319
Hello, Jae-eon?

209
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,279
What are you doing?

210
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,280
Nothing much.

211
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,324
Why did you call?

212
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,911
Nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice.

213
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,287
You're ridiculous.

214
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,497
You always say that.

215
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,750
Well, you always say I'm funny.

216
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,920
That's right. But I mean it, though.

217
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,505
Yeah, right.

218
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,259
Don't be ridiculous.

219
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,720
I know everything.

220
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,285
Jae-eon.

221
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,079
Thank you for helping out.

222
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,497
Oh, don't mention it.

223
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,875
Hey, Jae-eon.

224
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,127
How would you like to work with us?

225
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,213
Thank you.

226
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,511
We need new part-timers.
Our department could use an extra hand.

227
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,888
-Just for this semester.
-Actually, I don't--

228
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,349
Come on.
Just think about it. Hmm?

229
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,433
We need two.

230
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,061
Min-yeong's trying to get Na-bi on board,

231
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,689
and… now I'm trying to get you.

232
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,483
Well, I'll think about it.

233
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,904
Okay. Hmm?
You'll be done soon. Thanks a lot.

234
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,823
Oh, yeah. I'll finish up in here.

235
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,908
-Right, right. Let me throw that for you.
-Thank you.

236
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,201
-Work hard.
-Yeah.

237
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,545
-I'm hungry.
-Yeah, me too.

238
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,047
Hey, Jae-eon! Have you had lunch?

239
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,299
Yun-ji and I are about to have lunch.
Wanna join us?

240
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,303
Uh, no, thanks. I have plans.
Enjoy your lunch.

241
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,432
He always says that.

242
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,350
Let's go.

243
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,372
Who is it?

244
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,004
Jae-eon?

245
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,132
What are you doing?

246
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,623
PARK JAE-EON

247
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,681
For the first time in my life,

248
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,933
I had a sex dream.

249
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,937
MISSED CALL
PARK JAE-EON

250
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,480
What?

251
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,650
Damn it. I'm late.

252
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,611
Damn it.

253
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,046
Shit.

254
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,881
Why did it have to be Jae-eon?

255
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,591
And why in my house?

256
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,717
Shit.

257
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,524
-Hello, sir.
-Yes?

258
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,735
I'm Yu Na-bi, sculpture major.

259
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,445
-From the morning class.
-Yes.

260
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,113
-You were supposed to present.
-Yes.

261
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,406
But, I…

262
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,326
kind of overslept today, so…

263
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,204
I was wondering
if I can present now instead?

264
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,123
Okay.

265
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,334
Since it looks
like you rushed to get here.

266
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,628
However, you will get a deduction.

267
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,797
That's fine. Thank you, sir.

268
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,674
Okay.

269
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,608
Oh, shit.

270
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,862
Hey, where are you?

271
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,865
I'm pretty sure
Bit-na is taking this class.

272
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,212
He called me,
but he didn't read my messages?

273
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,347
Na-bi.

274
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,434
You're in this class too?
How come I've never seen you before?

275
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,519
Oh, because…

276
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,396
I'm in the morning class.

277
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,523
I'm only in this session today.

278
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,400
I overslept.

279
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,914
Are you… with someone?

280
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,007
I talked to Jae-eon,
told him to think about working here.

281
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,801
And Na-bi? Is she in?

282
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,470
I don't know yet.

283
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,431
Uh, but she did say she's probably out.

284
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:31,933
Really?

285
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,312
Looks like I told Jae-eon too soon, then.

286
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,105
I'll just shut up for now.

287
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,943
It's Seong-yun, hello.

288
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,070
Hey.

289
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,448
Mr. An.

290
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,951
I'm here to…
I'm only here to get my package.

291
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:50,994
Yes, I know.

292
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,830
Awesome. Thank you.

293
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,918
By the way, I brought this for you.

294
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,544
Oh, you shouldn't have bothered.

295
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,463
Keep it.

296
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,298
Take it. I insist. Come on.

297
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,509
-Thank you. I appreciate it.
-You've got to be kidding.

298
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,803
Are we running a post office now?

299
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,431
Sorry. The pudding was a bit pricey.
I could only afford to buy one.

300
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,308
So, I didn't have a choice.
Hope you understand.

301
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,560
Sorry, I gotta go now.

302
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,355
Gyeong-jun.

303
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:21,691
Isn't receiving packages
on behalf of students going too far?

304
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,777
I'm not doing anything wrong.

305
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,029
You keep your packages from your parents.

306
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,616
You, of all people,
should understand, right? It's not easy.

307
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,869
That pile is too messy.

308
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,621
Should I tell our professor?

309
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,252
Hello there.

310
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,711
Hello, Sol.

311
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,006
Have you chosen a school yet?
The professor always asks me that.

312
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,093
No, I haven't yet.

313
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:55,183
Look, it's very obvious she wants you
to go to an elite university.

314
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:59,312
But if you ask me
you should choose the one you really like.

315
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,233
-Yes, I will. Thanks for the tip.
-No problem.

316
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,485
-You can talk to me anytime.
-Sure.

317
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,655
You're a post-master and a counselor?
Why do you even work here?

318
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,532
Hmm.

319
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,330
Did you order a package?

320
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,790
That could be the delivery guy.

321
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,876
-Take the call.
-Ugh! You're so nosy!

322
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,669
Okay.

323
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,131
Yes, hello?

324
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,758
Hello. It's me Ju-hyeok.

325
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,886
What? Who?

326
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,347
Uh, you gave me your number,
back at the cafe.

327
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,184
Oh!

328
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,103
Oh, I'm so sorry.

329
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,689
No, it's okay. What about you? You okay?

330
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,153
Oh, yes, right. I'm sorry.

331
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,531
Give me your bank details and the amount,
I'll send you the money right away.

332
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,992
Or…

333
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,412
If you have the time someday,
maybe we can just meet up?

334
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,373
What? In person?

335
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,587
Uh, hang on a sec.

336
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,131
-I have to go.
-Okay.

337
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,678
He's obviously hitting on her.

338
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,349
Again, too nosy. You're so annoying.

339
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,270
Romance is in the air right now.

340
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,980
How adorable.

341
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,233
As you can see in this example,

342
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:30,529
there are instances when a character
looks directly at the camera.

343
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,907
The desired effect of this shot…

344
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,160
…is to make the audience feel
that they are locking eyes with the actor.

345
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,828
Rise and shine.

346
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,290
This is called
the "Tension to Camera" method.

347
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,044
What's the matter?

348
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,129
Are you sick?

349
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,425
If you had a bad hunch,
it's almost always right.

350
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,889
-I'll get it.
-No, let me…

351
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,100
No, I'm the one who dropped it.

352
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,226
I'll get it.

353
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,817
The last scene
of this film The 400 Blows,

354
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:13,947
the boy escapes from the juvenile center
and runs towards the ocean,

355
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,200
and looks straight at the camera.
Back then…

356
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,327
Some luck I'm having right now,

357
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,246
a zit pops up on my face.

358
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,958
And it might be that time of the month.

359
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,211
ARE YOU COMING?
CAN YOU GET ME A PAD ON YOUR WAY?

360
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,922
-Come on, go easy on me.
-All right.

361
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,091
Shit.

362
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,476
My tummy still hurts.

363
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,607
-Drink that.
-Oh, thank you.

364
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,781
God, I feel much better.

365
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,908
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

366
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,579
Oh, you're going backward.
You are so toast.

367
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,914
Okay, let's take a short break.

368
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,962
Jae-eon! You smoking?

369
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,589
I'll catch up.

370
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,841
Wanna come with?

371
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,217
Uh…

372
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,719
No, I'm okay.

373
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,054
I need to prepare. I'm presenting.

374
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,597
Oh, really? You are?

375
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,932
I should pay close attention then,

376
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,643
and clap really loud for you.

377
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,520
Look, go ahead.

378
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:28,980
Hmm?

379
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,776
I mean, your friends are waiting for you.

380
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,527
So, go, catch up with them.

381
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,529
Mm.

382
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,742
I don't get you.
You're just cold towards me sometimes.

383
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,092
Let's go.

384
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,099
That helped.

385
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,441
What the hell?

386
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,570
This thing is messing me up.

387
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,492
I don't get you.

388
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,744
You're just cold towards me sometimes.

389
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,830
It looks really bad.

390
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,710
Hello, I'm sculpture major, Yu Na-bi.

391
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,428
So…

392
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,600
My presentation will focus on

393
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,312
what is regarded as
the very first science fiction film in…

394
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,192
Oh, no! Code red.

395
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,528
And this time it's for real.

396
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,572
It's…

397
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,955
…the film A Trip to the Moon.

398
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,208
Director Georges Méliès
was critically acclaimed…

399
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:16,087
"Ladies, having your period
is nothing to be ashamed of."

400
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,338
…in filming this.

401
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,633
-No, not at all.
-Especially, because…

402
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,345
At the time, films were not much different
from theater stages.

403
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,639
But Méliès made a unique mise-en-scène

404
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,975
that was different
from reality or theater stages

405
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,144
by applying perspective,
space, distortion--

406
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,520
Miss Yu, wait.

407
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,648
You're talking too fast.

408
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,859
Slow down and start over.

409
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,738
Okay. Uh…

410
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,406
But periods…

411
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,742
are disasters.

412
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,871
Hi, I'm fashion design major,
Kim Yeong-min.

413
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,211
So a survivor must move
to safer ground.

414
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,004
This film is about Nosferatu.

415
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,549
It's a 1922 silent film,
that's actually an adaptation

416
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,635
of the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker.

417
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:07,305
The director changed the names
and some details from the source material

418
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,016
to avoid copyright issues
when he made the film.

419
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,312
Yu Na-bi!

420
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,819
Did I say something…

421
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,799
Wait, you still have a night class,
don't you?

422
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,259
You'll get cold.

423
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,136
Should I take it back?

424
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,141
It's just, it could get on your--

425
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,351
That's okay.

426
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,314
I wanna cry.
Why did it have to be him?

427
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,691
Are you telling…

428
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,404
everyone about this?

429
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,576
You think I'd do that?

430
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,079
Okay, I'm gonna bounce
a question back to you.

431
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,291
If you saw me having a boner in class,

432
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,668
will you tell everyone?

433
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,045
That's an entirely different thing.

434
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,463
Yes, I know it is.

435
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,008
But would you?

436
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,595
Of course I won't.

437
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,265
Really?

438
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:34,976
I won't, I swear.

439
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,313
I won't, either.

440
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,151
Could this be trivial

441
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,154
to someone like him?

442
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:14,349
THANK YOU FOR TODAY.
I WILL GET YOUR CLOTHES…

443
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,485
What?

444
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,695
Did you get home safe?

445
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,992
Do people act like this
to keep someone on the hook?

446
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,954
You read my message right away.
What are you doing?

447
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,966
LAUNDROMAT

448
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,219
We're playing basketball
and getting some drinks after.

449
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,804
You coming?

450
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,597
I'll pass. I have plans.

451
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,475
Hang on. Didn't you have a jacket on?

452
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,268
Where did it go?

453
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,895
I lent it to a friend of mine. Why?

454
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,980
Friend?

455
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,023
Do you mean that pretty girl from earlier?

456
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,608
Are you close?

457
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,318
Does it look like it?

458
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,244
I'm buying art supplies.

459
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,079
What are you up to?

460
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,875
I thought you said you were just friends.

461
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,294
What?

462
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,505
We really are just that.

463
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,883
Although… we've gotten a bit closer.

464
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,262
I've been messaging all day.
You never bothered to reply.

465
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,638
Don't change the subject.

466
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,349
So you're a thing now?

467
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,185
I don't look at it that way.

468
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,938
More like…

469
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,482
me not pushing away…

470
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,068
someone who's being really nice to me.

471
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,156
Girl, you're getting
your hopes up too much.

472
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,116
Let me get this straight.

473
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,410
So you're implying
that he treats you like you're special?

474
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,870
Well…

475
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,872
Maybe. I don't know.

476
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,959
Look, from what I've seen from him so far,

477
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,962
the things he does
that make you feel that way

478
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,756
might actually mean nothing at all to him.

479
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,967
Like I said, he's nice to everyone

480
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,635
no exceptions whatsoever.

481
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,639
I don't know.

482
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,517
Maybe.

483
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,481
She has to find out for herself.

484
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,609
Hey, Na-bi, don't say
I didn't warn you, okay?

485
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,407
Are you free tomorrow night?

486
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,160
-For your dinner thing?
-So Jae-eon told you?

487
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,871
You are close now.

488
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,540
Do you know who else is coming?

489
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,209
I don't.

490
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,587
Then you should come.
You'll see some persons of interest.

491
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,091
"Persons of interest"?

492
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,219
It's going to be fun.

493
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,846
Don't you want to see it for yourself?

494
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,807
What?

495
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,601
Whether or not
you're really special to Jae-eon.

496
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,648
Thank you!

497
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,577

All of them are girls.

00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,731
I want my heart
to keep fluttering,

504
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,068
but why do I feel anxious?

505
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,165
What do I really want
from Jae-eon?

506
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,739
Right.

507
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,576
Maybe I should see it for myself.
And maybe move on.

508
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,374
Bit-na, I'll go tomorrow.

509
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,839
Hey, isn't Sol coming?

510
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,216
You're close, right?

511
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,051
I wouldn't say that.

512
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,928
She's actually much closer with Ji-wan.

513
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,679
And besides, our department's ace

514
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,765
would never eat
at the same table as us normies.

515
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,892
But you have lunch with her often, right?

516
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,143
So what gives?

517
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,771
It's a metaphor. Keep up.

518
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,523
What are you, a toddler?

519
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,566
Can't you stay still?

520
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,652
I recognize that look.

521
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,655
You're excited thinking
about Sol, aren't you?

522
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,406
So, do you like her?

523
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,243
How do you do it?

524
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,203
So you can help me out.

525
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,497
No way.
Figure out your love life yourself.

526
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,873
Yun Sol?

527
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,417
She's pretty.

528
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:37,171
And feisty and so ridiculously smart.

529
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,257
She's totally my type.

530
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,801
Does she even like guys, though?

531
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:42,927
What do you mean?

532
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,387
I mean… Well…

533
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,847
I've actually never seen her
hang out with any guy.

534
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,683
Have you? Think about it.

535
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,727
Sure, but I've never seen him
hang out with any girl, either.

536
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,895
Does that mean…

537
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,898
Are you…

538
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,026
-What about me? Does that make me a guy?
-Mm-hm.

539
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,820
-Jackass! I'll show you.
-Wait, wait!

540
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,655
-Knock it off.
-Take this.

541
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,990
Ow!

542
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,491
What's up, guys?

543
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,576
I thought you'd quit already?

544
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,662
Couldn't help yourself, huh?

545
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,456
What?
I told you I was going to try, right.

546
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,166
I told you I was going to try, right.

547
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,796
-Ji-wan.
-What's his deal?

548
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,259
Can I ask you for a favor?

549
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,177
A favor? What is it?

550
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,055
We'll go out for drinks later.

551
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,349
You should join us and bring Sol.

552
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,143
Wait, Yun Sol? Why?

553
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,936
Bring her along.

554
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,896
Let him get rejected in person
so he'd shut up.

555
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,982
You have a crush on her?

556
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,319
I think I do.

557
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,654
How about it?

558
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,450
Come on. Help me out here, will you? Hmm?

559
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,244
He's not gonna stop, you know.

560
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,079
All right, fine. I'll talk to her.

561
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:52,997
Nice!

562
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,708
But she might say no.
She doesn't like drinking all that much.

563
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,419
She's right. I'm sure she won't come.

564
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,378
I'm in.

565
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,671
Why not?

566
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,757
You're coming? You're sure?

567
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,301
Why?

568
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,304
Why not?
You asked me to tag along, didn't you?

569
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:12,475
Oh? Oh, yeah, right. I did.

570
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,060
Okay, let's go.

571
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,062
You're being weird.

572
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,985
By the way, what do you think of Se-hun?

573
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:24,862
What about him?

574
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,740
Nothing. Don't you like him, or something?

575
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,745
I think he's… pretty funny.

576
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:34,872
You just think he's funny?

577
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,665
Mm-hm.

578
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,298
-Why?
-I don't want it.

579
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,428
Hey, Se-hun,
that jacket looks pretty cool.

580
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,347
Dude!

581
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,350
It's worth 20 million won, you know.

582
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,976
-Really?
-This guy's loaded!

583
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,728
He should buy each of us
a big bowl of stew!

584
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,438
No, he should just buy
the entire place.

585
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:01,774
Yu Se-hun!

586
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,943
Right! All hail Yu Se-hun!

587
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,861
-Oh, look, Na-bi made it after all.
-Give me that.

588
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,696
-Hi, Na-bi.
-So, where can I sit?

589
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,198
Dude, hurry. Move over.

590
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:12,243
Hey Na-bi, look.
Here, I saved a chair for you. Come here.

591
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:15,579
-All right. You can sit there.
-Come on, Na-bi, don't be shy.

592
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,456
How you been, Na-bi?

593
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,625
So you finally have more time
for your friends now?

594
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,294
'Cause that old dude is out of your life.

595
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,713
She's free! She's finally free!

596
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,757
Hey! What's the matter with you?

597
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,217
Did you really break up with that guy?

598
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,301
Tell us, did you?

599
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,804
You're seriously asking her that question?

600
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,808
We're all here, right?
Jae-eon is the only one who isn't.

601
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,643
He's not replying to me.

602
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,770
Well, that's 'cause
he always replies late.

603
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,274
I know, right? It's weird,
'cause he's always holding his phone.

604
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,777
He just reads the notifications,
but totally ignores the messages.

605
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,238
No, you're wrong.
He's not like that at all.

606
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,073
Where will he sit when he gets here?

607
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,575
We can put another chair here.

608
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,243
"Jae-eon's not the type
to date," huh?

609
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,996
Seems to me
he's dating all the girls in school.

610
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,497
Park Jae-eon's really popular.

611
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:06,505
Hey, guys, we should add more chairs,
'cause Sol and Ji-wan are coming, too.

612
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,798
Seriously?

613
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,342
No way. Are you sure Sol's coming?

614
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,345
Ji-wan's coming too, in case you didn't
hear her name. It's not just Sol.

615
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,181
Great, great, great!
A chair, a chair, a chair.

616
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,724
Oh, wow.

617
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,309
Nice to know you haven't changed a bit.

618
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,810
-Why is it next to you?
-Shut up.

619
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,439
Wanna take it off?

620
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,442
What?

621
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,864
Your jacket. Jeez, look at your face.

622
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,949
What do you think I meant?

623
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,451
Take your jacket off, too.

624
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,537
I wasn't thinking of anything.

625
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,998
It's so hot.
Just take your jackets off.

626
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,083
-You take yours off.
-Oh, that water's mine.

627
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,962
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
Is there another cup I can use?

628
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,422
No, it's fine.

629
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,218
Oh, you're my senior, right?

630
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,638
Nice to meet you, Na-bi.
I'm Kim Eun-han, a freshman.

631
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,726
We've already ordered a few dishes.
Have you tried their seafood stew?

632
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,062
Well, no. I don't think I have.

633
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,647
It's really good. Do you like seafood?

634
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,190
Yes, I do. I like it a lot.

635
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,816
That's so cool.

636
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,110
Can you ask when we're getting our food?

637
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,321
You know what?
We're selling food at the flea market.

638
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,073
Can you come and visit our booth?

639
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,033
We killed time
with pointless conversations,

640
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,576
-while waiting for food.
-Please.

641
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,203
Yeah, sure.

642
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,705
But as soon
as I started to get bored…

643
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,165
-Has he replied?
-No.

644
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,751
-…the star of the show showed up.
-Oh, Jae-eon's here.

645
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,378
-Hey!
-What took you so long?

646
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,171
-Hi!
-Jae-eon!

647
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,674
-Why are you only getting here now?
-You're so late.

648
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,384
Here, Jae-eon!

649
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,804
The room gets filled with
sexual tension whenever Jae-eon is there.

650
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,973
-You better make up for being late!
-Dude, what took you so long?

651
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,599
The traffic was so bad, I'm sorry.

652
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,645
Hey, Na-bi… it's good to see you here.

653
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,272
Oh, thanks.

654
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,108
Jae-eon's finally here,
let's drink!

655
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,484
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-All right!

656
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,027
Cheers!

657
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,280
-Cheers, everyone.
-Cheers.

658
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,782
-There you go. Cheers!
-Drink up, guys.

659
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,953
-Oh, sweet!
-I want some more.

660
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,330
Hey, guys! I'm sorry, I gotta go home.

661
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,165
It's spicier than I thought.

662
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,418
-Oh, here, have some water.
-Hey!

663
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,253
Have some water.

664
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,380
Thank you.

665
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,258
-Oh, everybody likes him.
-It is pretty spicy.

666
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,884
Hey, you know what?

667
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,553
I still can't believe Sol's here.

668
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,054
I asked her to join us.

669
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,931
You didn't need
to twist her arm to do that?

670
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,934
Come on, I don't believe you.

671
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:24,935
So, is it spicy?

672
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,774
I'm looking at you
and your face is all red.

673
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:35,279
But I thought, girls are better
at eating spicy food than guys?

674
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,072
Really? Is that true?

675
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,033
I guess it is.
I read it somewhere.

676
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,077
Women have higher tolerance
when it comes to pain,

677
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,120
because they give birth.

678
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,332
And that the first time they have sex,
it hurts a lot.

679
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,541
What did you say?

680
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:49,710
Oh, damn it.

681
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,587
-I just lost my appetite.
-Yeah, buddy!

682
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,714
-Let's go!
-I'll report what you just said.

683
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,133
-Hey, don't say stuff like that.
-What's wrong with you, Min-sang?

684
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,302
Why do you always say stuff
that offends people?

685
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,970
Why? What's wrong?

686
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,723
Eating something spicy
is about feeling a sense of pain.

687
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,267
Stop treating me like a pervert.

688
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,728
Hey, Min-sang,
use this to wipe your mouth.

689
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,315
Oh, awesome. That was smart. Great, great.

690
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,941
-Stop it, Se-hun.
-Shh.

691
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,285
Hey!

692
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,789
Min-sang, have a drink.

693
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,832
-I'll move here.
-Oh, come on!

694
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,292
-I've done nothing wrong!
-Because you should!

695
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,418
Are you getting a drink?

696
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,004
Just shut up, okay?

697
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,382
Mm…

698
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,509
Try this.

699
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,554
Lime? Is this good?

700
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,391
I don't know.
I just think you're gonna like it.

701
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,685
Really?

702
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,436
Because of what you said at the club.

703
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,480
Here you go.

704
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,733
What's this? Lime?

705
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,026
I like lime a lot.

706
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,120
So you remember that?

707
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,215
You know, you're strange.

708
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,218
Most people try smoking out of curiosity.

709
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,636
She tried it with me before.

710
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,388
Seriously? When?

711
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:28,308
Wow, I'm offended.
You always refuse when I offer.

712
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,977
I was curious that time.

713
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,396
Save it.
I'm so hurt I think I'm gonna cry.

714
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,481
Hey, Na-bi.

715
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,109
I'm glad to see
you're in a good mood again.

716
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,282
What do you mean?

717
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,160
You looked upset back there, so I thought
maybe you weren't feeling well.

718
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,121
I'm not uncomfortable
being around a lot of people.

719
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:52,166
Hmm. That's right.
You're not comfortable around strangers.

720
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,584
Really? Even with me?

721
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,421
You weren't like that before.
You used to smile all the time.

722
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,631
I thought you were so angry.

723
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,175
Gosh, Min-sang.
What's wrong with you?

724
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,302
Why do you keep bugging Na-bi today?

725
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:05,888
Hey.

726
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,599
Are you guys seeing each other?

727
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,018
You act strange when you're together.

728
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,687
I knew there was something going on.

729
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,772
Well, it's really--

730
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,231
No, you got it all wrong.

731
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,151
Oh, come on, don't lie to me.

732
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,028
It's so obvious,
the way you two look at each other.

733
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,321
What's up with you?

734
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,906
I said, there's nothing going on.

735
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,241
Right, Na-bi?

736
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,331
Yeah.

737
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,332
That's right.

738
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,334
Nothing, you say?

739
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,794
But, that's weird.

740
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,338
'Cause you couldn't
take your eyes off of him the whole night.

741
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,799
Dude, you kept staring at him.

742
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,509
I'll be in the ladies' room.

743
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,470
I'll come with you. Oh, damn it.

744
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,014
Shit.

745
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,642
He doesn't know how you really feel,

746
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:54,269
so he said that because
he doesn't want things to get awkward.

747
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,104
Just forget it.

748
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,775
Because if that were really the case,
then he would've just changed the subject

749
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,194
or would've given
a vague answer or something.

750
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,365
Right, Na-bi?

751
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:09,993
Jae-eon didn't just say that
for the sake of giving an answer.

752
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,079
He just drew the line.

753
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,248
Hey, don't be like that.

754
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,375
Na-bi, you're overreacting.

755
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,835
You know something like this could happen.

756
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,044
Why are you encouraging me?

757
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:22,089
Well… I just thought maybe
I was too harsh before.

758
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,591
It's not like
I have the power to read minds.

759
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,135
And also, I noticed
he couldn't stop looking at you.

760
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,390
So not true.
He was busy talking to Yun-ji.

761
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:35,185
I swear! He kept staring at you
whenever you had something to say.

762
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,354
And most importantly,

763
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,568
Jae-eon never does stuff like this.

764
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,408
Bit-na, it's just a canned drink.

765
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,202
Oh, this is so much better.

766
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,081
To be honest, I wasn't sure
when I only heard your side of the story,

767
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,876
but when I saw you in one room,
I felt something.

768
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,924
What do you wanna do now?

769
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,634
Well, what I want is to go home.

770
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,387
Let's invite Jae-eon to your place.
What do you think?

771
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,848
What's wrong with you?
I don't wanna do that, Bit-na.

772
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,349
Come on, I'll go with you!

773
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,351
You can't waste
such a beautiful opportunity.

774
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:18,604
But still…

775
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,400
Never mind, I'll just go home.

776
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,651
I'm not in the mood for anything.

777
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,195
Well, let's at least give it a shot.

778
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,363
Bit-na.

779
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,241
You swear there's really nothing going on?

780
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,911
Oh, right.
Because you said you're not into dating.

781
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,331
But it seems like she's hitting on you
and she doesn't even know it.

782
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,126
She's always acted like she's all that
because she knows she's pretty.

783
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,711
I guess it serves her right.

784
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:46,590
Min-sang, don't say things about people
you can't tell them yourself.

785
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,133
-Huh?
-You're badmouthing her,

786
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,718
'cause you know you'll never have her.

787
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,428
It's pathetic.

788
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,888
What did you say?

789
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,389
Better watch your mouth.

790
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:57,935
What a prick.

791
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,437
You just said there's nothing going on.

792
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,939
Huh?

793
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,608
-Hey, where've you been?
-Pajeons must be ready by now.

794
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,526
Let's go,
or I'll finish all of it.

795
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,028
All right, I'm coming.

796
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,655
Prick.

797
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,032
Wait, don't start without me.

798
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,497
He seems totally unaffected
with what happened.

799
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,627
Don't worry about Min-sang.

800
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,089
-What?
-That guy… says stuff about me, too.

801
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,676
Stuff like what?

802
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,970
That you're not into dating?

803
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,056
Okay, answer this.

804
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,350
Does everyone have to date?

805
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,687
It's not a requirement.

806
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,522
Is that so?

807
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,276
I have a friend who doesn't date too.
Doesn't believe in dating.

808
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,321
But he's totally incapable of caring.

809
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:52,906
Even for the one he's with.

810
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,951
Can't just two people have…

811
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,953
a special kind of closeness.

812
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,581
Can't they just look at each other

813
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,126
or simply be near each other?

814
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,927
Do they have to care

815
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,513
that there's something in their hair?

816
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,145
That's not what I'm saying.

817
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,312
Really?

818
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,815
It's nice that we're on the same page.

819
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,695
Is that really all we have?

820
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,364
Of course I didn't
have the guts to ask him.

821
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,199
Who wants another round?

822
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,702
-Me!
-Me! Me, me, me!

823
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,245
-We should go home.
-You go home!

824
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,538
-Let's go. I lose.
-You lose!

825
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,623
Na-bi, aren't you going home yet?

826
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,959
-Well…
-Jae-eon, are you going home yet?

827
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,211
Well, if everyone's leaving already…

828
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,005
I'm not, I have other plans tonight.

829
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,174
Really? You do? Is that plan important?

830
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,467
I'm meeting up with a friend.

831
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,803
Now is the perfect time
to get rid of my feelings.

832
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,305
And make sure it's all gone.

833
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,933
I can handle it.

834
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,313
What's wrong?

835
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,357
Should I meet up with my friend?
Or be with my other friends?

836
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:10,817
What about you?

837
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,614
But I'm…

838
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,034
Well… you see…

839
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,746
Bit-na and I are planning
that we drink some more at my house.

840
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,081
Wanna join us?

841
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:31,588
I decided I'd be fun
and not get rid of my feelings.

842
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,924
National!

843
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,092
Song!

844
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,973
All right. "Love."

845
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,350
-"Love."
-"Love."

846
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:51,942
What? You don't know the song?

847
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,322
-Still don't know?
-All right. Let's keep going. Don't stop.

848
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,866
That's unacceptable, you have to drink.
Give it to her.

849
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,785
-You can't sing that.
-But why do I have to?

850
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,954
Let me. I'll drink it for you. Give it.

851
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,374
Hey.

852
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,042
Keep it going.

853
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,752
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it!

854
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,462
Let's now do the Alphabet Game.

855
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,673
-Letter "L"!
-Letter "L"?

856
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,008
-Lion.
-Mmm.

857
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,552
Leaf.

858
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,636
Okay. Lie!

859
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,054
Love.

860
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,808
Oh, I know. Left!

861
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:25,892
Life.

862
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,310
Long.

863
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,146
-Oh, gosh, what do I do?
-Ooh!

864
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,064
-Only the two of you are left.
-It's okay. Let me figure something out.

865
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,026
Right! Mine is "Lust. Lust!"

866
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,280
Why? What's wrong?
It starts with the letter "L"!

867
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,574
-All right, fine. You're right.
-Yay!

868
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,952
Okay. Then I must declare
that the loser is Yu Na-bi!

869
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,330
As the loser, you must drink.

870
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,665
-Bottom's up.
-Okay.

871
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,500
One, two…

872
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,841
And now, the bottle will decide
who will end up kissing.

873
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:00,427
One, two, three!

874
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:04,014
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin!

875
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,850
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin!

876
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,978
Spin, spin, spin, spin…

877
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,817
Kissy, kiss! Kissy, kiss!

878
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,028
All right, all right. Shut up.

879
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,029
You're doing it?

880
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,114
Yeah, yeah, I will.
Shut your mouth, let me do this.

881
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,076
-Really?
-He will?

882
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,120
-Oh!
-Come here!

883
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,082
Now, let me do it right.

884
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,880
-Whoa!
-Ouch! I think my lip is bleeding.

885
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,131
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-But it's okay, it's okay.

886
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,133
-What about your braces?
-Huh?

887
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,593
This is so crazy!

888
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:42,886
Awesome!

889
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,388
So cool!

890
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,976
-Hey, hey, hey! Be quiet.
-Shh!

891
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,561
My neighbors will complain.

892
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,981
Hey, keep it down.

893
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,233
Shh!

894
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,277
Oh, no. I told you to be quiet.

895
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,446
-Sorry.
-Coming!

896
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:05,784
Excuse me.

897
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,331
Do you have any idea
how late it already is?

898
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,333
You were too loud. Can't you be quiet?

899
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,210
I'm so sorry, sir.

900
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,212
There are other people
in this building, you know.

901
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,841
My friends came over.
We were having fun, so…

902
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,303
We're gonna keep it down.

903
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,182
We're studying for an exam, so be quiet.

904
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,642
Oh, is that so?

905
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:34,020
Then we would pray silently for you
so you guys would do great in your exams.

906
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,605
Thank you.

907
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,775
Okay, then we trust
that you won't be noisy anymore.

908
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,653
-Good night. See ya.
-Good night. I'm sorry for the noise.

909
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,673
You looked like a couple.

910
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:02,799
Shut up.

911
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,427
We can't play drinking games
anymore, okay?

912
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,554
-Let's keep going! Come on!
-They're so fun! Come on!

913
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:11,182
Let's keep going!
Let's spin, spin, spin the bottle!

914
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,144
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin!

915
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,730
-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spinning, spinning!

916
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,773
It's me!

917
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,026
-It's me!
-What are you saying?

918
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,319
It's me.

919
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,695
-Come here, Sol.
-What the?

920
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,155
You're going for it?

921
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,114
She's so drunk.

922
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:27,991
You're gonna kiss her?

923
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,745
-Killjoy.
-Sit down. Come back here.

924
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,663
-Sit. Sit down.
-Shut up!

925
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,708
Hey, Sol, where are you going?

926
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:37,834
I'm gonna smoke.

927
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,502
But what about me?

928
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,714
-Now look what you've done.
-Shut up. It's okay.

929
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,300
JUNG JU-HYEOK

930
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,801
Someone's calling Sol.

931
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,345
Hey, Sol!

932
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,596
Wait.

933
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,640
Jung Ju-hyeok?
Who's this Jung Ju-hyeok guy?

934
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:53,641
Jung Ju-hyeok?

935
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,437
Jung Ju-hyeok doesn't matter right now.
What matters is we spin!

936
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,897
-Spin!
-Yeah!

937
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,566
-Spinning, spinning, spinning!
-Spinning, spinning, spinning!

938
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,360
-Spinning, spinning!
-Spinning, spinning…

939
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,002
Hey! Did you guys plan this?

940
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,045
Huh?

941
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,505
Can you imagine
what you made us look like?

942
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,591
-Now we look like idiots.
-You kissed because you chose to.

943
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,051
-There's nothing wrong with it.
-All right, fine.

944
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,887
-Let's go out for a smoke.
-Come on, let's go.

945
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,263
Okay.

946
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,848
My legs hurt.

947
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,058
Oh, my gosh.

948
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,893
-I'm exhausted.
-I need air.

949
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,312
Hey, I'm wearing your shoes, okay?

950
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,773
-Be back later!
-Hmm…

951
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:43,900
Hey! Sol!

952
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,528
-Going for a smoke?
-Mm-hm.

953
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,488
Who's Jung Ju-hyeok, by the way?

954
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,448
He called you when you were outside.

955
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,742
What? Oh.

956
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,119
Just someone I know.

957
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,495
Just someone you know?

958
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,622
And I thought I already know
everyone you know.

959
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:58,873
No, you don't.

960
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,004
It's cold outside.

961
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,757
Uh… Thank you.

962
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,638
Where have you been, Sol?

963
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,682
I had to take a walk.

964
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,475
Your place is really nice, Na-bi.

965
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,893
It used to be my aunt's.

966
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,357
Why do you make things hard for you?

967
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,778
I know, right?

968
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,828
Hey, you guys…

969
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:41,749
Sol is so pretty up close. Oh, my god!

970
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,294
She is such a wonderful goddess.

971
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,920
We get it, so tell her already!

972
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,047
We can't stand your fawning anymore!

973
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,425
Hey, Ji-wan.

974
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,094
What does Sol look for in a guy?

975
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,513
Oh, my god! He's driving me nuts, man.

976
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,224
I'm not going to tell you.

977
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,476
Sure you won't.

978
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,144
Wait…

979
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,355
Why? I thought you were gonna help me.

980
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,191
Looks like she doesn't know, either.

981
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,276
No, you gotta be kidding me.

982
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,111
If she doesn't know, then who does?

983
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,698
Fine, Sol…

984
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,159
Go on.

985
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,412
…totally hates boring guys just like you.

986
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,830
Sheesh!

987
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,832
Come on. I'm a fun guy.

988
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,626
In fact, if you make fun of me…

989
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,504
I'll be a zombie. Hey, back me up.

990
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,796
Don't smoke so much.

991
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,548
Wait a minute, where's Jae-eon?

992
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,133
Beats me. Is he inside?

993
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,344
Oh, you're just ignoring me now.

994
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,013
He must be on his phone again.
He's always talking to someone.

995
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:40,642
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Yun-ji in a while, either.

996
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,562
Did you notice if they left together?

997
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:46,606
Call them.

998
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,483
Hurry up.

999
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,902
Get up, you guys. Let's go find them.

1000
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,701
Where did he go?

1001
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,080
What was that?

1002
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,499
What? Nothing.

1003
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,752
-Can I borrow some sweatpants?
-Sure.

1004
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,296
-I'll get a pair.
-Thank you. I'll use the bathroom.

1005
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,226
It tickles!

1006
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,572
Hey!

1007
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,201
Stop it! It tickles!

1008
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,838
That was intense.

1009
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,051
This is so embarrassing.

1010
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,472
Listen.

1011
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:05,393
This might be too much to ask,
but can you please keep this a secret?

1012
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,729
-Just this once.
-Please don't tell the others.

1013
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,693
Sure. I won't say a word, don't worry.

1014
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,486
Thank you so much, Na-bi.

1015
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,738
Thank you.

1016
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,448
Sure, not a problem. We're good.

1017
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,075
-Go on, get outta here.
-I promise…

1018
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,162
-I'm not gonna let her go.
-Okay, don't. Now, go.

1019
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,872
-Okay, thank you.
-Okay.

1020
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:26,998
Bye, sorry again.

1021
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,499
-When did you…
-I'll tell you later.

1022
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,126
Let's go.

1023
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:41,179
I'm losing it.
I really thought it was Jae-eon.

1024
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,614
What? Is that it?

1025
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,457
If you're not into it, just tell me.

1026
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:11,834
It's not like that.

1027
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,045
Go back inside, I need a moment.

1028
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,287
That meant nothing.

1029
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,083
She only wanted to try it out.

1030
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,797
No need to explain yourself.

1031
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,882
What about you?

1032
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,137
Didn't you want to try it?

1033
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:07,849
Why would I?

1034
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:10,810
And no.

1035
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,277
I wanted to do it with you.

1036
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,701
What?

1037
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,009
I just thought…

1038
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:45,928
you felt the same way too.

1039
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,421
I'll let you decide.

1040
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,786
Sorry.

1041
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,400
Just like that…

1042
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,238
the gates of hell swung open.

1043
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:19,332
Big surprise,
still no word from Jae-eon.

1044
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:21,792
Your butterflies,
they still doing good?

1045
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,210
But I'm gonna set them free soon.

1046
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:26,923
I mean, they're supposed to be free,
and they're not, because of me.

1047
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,216
Could I actually be
in love with him?

1048
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,260
Or did I do that 'cause I was jealous?

1049
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,846
You should know,
all he does is hurt people.

1050
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,514
You barely know each other, right?

1051
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,642
No, not true.

1052
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,018
He knows me better than you do.

1053
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,896
That kind of presence
only comes naturally.

1054
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:43,522
Some people are just gifted.

1055
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,651
So the question is,
what do I really mean to him?

1056
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:47,693
You wanna hang out?

1057
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,820
Why are you doing this to me?

1058
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:51,948
I've been attracted to you

1059
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,074
from the beginning.

1060
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:55,159
What is this I'm feeling right now?

1061
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:56,827
But I'm…
