[Episode 36]

4
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,030
That was

5
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,030
a great strategy.

6
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,190
The Sea Spirit Clan is really useless.

7
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,550
It was just a trick,

8
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,890
and the Sea Spirit King turned against us.

9
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,430
Indeed, we should make those slaves

10
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,830
who have the guts to challenge the Immortal Clan

11
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,389
to pay the price.

12
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,390
But not on the Lost Sea,

13
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,230
but at the Ruins on the Sea.

14
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,750
Grand Elder, why?

15
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,070
If we want to completely destroy

16
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,610
the anti-immortal alliance,

17
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,329
we should not only kill them,

18
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,290
but also destroy their hope.

19
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,710
Only in this way

20
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,030
can we make an example of them in the three realms,

21
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,800
so that they

22
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,070
will never dare to start a rebellion again.

23
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,200
We need to make them realize

24
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,350
only the Immortal Clan

25
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,540
is the ruler of this world.

26
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,210
Great Sages,

27
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,510
prepare for a battle

at the Ruins on the Sea.

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,800
Let us go

30
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,810
to the Ruins on the Sea now

31
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,670
to get ready to fight the enemies.

32
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,590
I'll make him

suffer.

34

Very good.

As all of you guys

42
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,690
stand united,

43
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,720
we definitely can protect the Immortal Realm.

44
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,150
Go now.

45
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,150
We must kill those rebels

46
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,360
on the Ruins on the Sea.

47
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,140
Yes.

48
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,200
Yes.

49
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,860
Yes.

50

Yes.

High Priest,

52
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,950
the three Great Sages of the Sage Hall

53
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,350
are leading the Immortal Group

54
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,750
to the Ruins on the Sea.

55
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,190
Why?

56

High Priest,

57
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,110
I heard that Wu Geng

58
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,840
is leading a group of rebels

59
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,909
and heading to the Immortal Realm.

60
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,110
They have conquered the Sea Spirit Clan

61
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,440
and passed the Lost Sea.

62
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,880
The Sea Spirit Clan is useless after all.

63
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,170
This is the Immortal Clan.

64
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,280
It's the Ruins on the Sea.

65

66

The era of the Immortal Clan ruling the world

70

is about to end soon.

71
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,790
We're finally here.

72
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,250
This is the Immortal Realm.

73
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,070
Everyone,

74
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,500
after this war,

75
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,450
your names

will go down

00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,370
in the history of the Immortal Clan forever.

78
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,070
The power of the Immortal Group of the Sage Hall

79
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,800
shouldn't be underestimated.

80

Soldiers of the Immortal Clan

Be careful, everyone.

83
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,160
Get ready to fight the enemies.

84
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,550
This is our first battle

in the Immortal Realm.

86
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,070
Let's defeat the Immortal Clan

87
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,190
in one go.

88
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,990

-Okay.

Yes.

Attack!

You think your weapons can hurt immortals?

96
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,310
Release!

97
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,550
Your Highness,

98
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,180
our refined qi arrows are working.

99
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,790
Let's take this opportunity

100
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,110
to attack them together.

101
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,290
Charge!

102
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,040
[Luanwu Kuangdao] [Hanfeng Linlin]

103

The blue dragon overturns the river!

104
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,700
The Demon Clan's generals are all brave and battlewise,

105
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,570
but there are too many immortals.

106
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,910
Most ordinary warriors

107
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,640
can't resist them on their own.

108
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,630
These immortals

109
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,880
have different levels of divine power.

110
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,140
Two or three ordinary warriors

111
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,380
are enough

112
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,530
to deal with weak immortals.

113
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,110
But we have to send powerful men

114
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,990
to deal with strong immortals.

115
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,720
Be careful.

116
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,630
Let's stall the strong first

117
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,360
and focus on getting rid of the weak.

118
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,100
Then we attack the strong.

119
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,530
We can destroy them in layers.

120
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,010
I didn't expect

121
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,710
the lowly species

122
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,150
to fight back like this.

123
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,230
Looks like

124
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,750
they're being driven

125
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,670
by an extraordinary force.

126
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,830
It's just

127
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,960
the power of hatred.

128
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,470
Maybe.

129
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,550
They love their hometowns

130
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,830
and their clansmen.

131
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,750
So they will try their best

132
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,950
to defeat us.

133
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,190
They're not qualified.

134
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,230
But it doesn't matter.

135
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,260
Soon,

136
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,230
they will be defeated

137
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,350
and gradually

138
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,030
kneel and beg for mercy.

139
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,910
What's the situation with the three Great Sages?

140
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,710
I think White Lotus Great Sage, Xuanfeng Great Sage,

141
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,590
and Zhen Chan Great Sage

142
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,430
have already joined the battle.

143
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,230
You two,

144
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,500
go to the Ruins on the Sea now.

145
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,470
High Priest,

146
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,830
since the three Great Sages

147
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,040
have led the Immortal Group there,

148
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,900
I think those mortals will die for sure.

149
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,110
Even if Tai Ji and I go,

150
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,030
I'm afraid we won't be of any use.

151
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,490
You know nothing.

152
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,080
The Sage Hall took action

153
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,270
when Wu Geng and the others

154
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,250
were about to arrive in the Immortal Realm.

155
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,810
It's not that simple.

156
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,310
Go investigate now and report to me.

157
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,510
We can't let Wu Geng

158
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,170
arrive in the Immortal Realm.

159
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,200
It would be great if the Sage Hall

160
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
can kill Wu Geng on the Ruins on the Sea.

161
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,240
To ensure nothing goes wrong,

162
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,440
you two go hide secretly.

163
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,780
Whether Wu Geng is alive or dead,

164
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,650
since he's here,

165
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,110
I can't let him

166
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,550
escape.

167
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,650
The wolf has a winning game when the shepherds quarrel.

168
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,190
High Priest, you are wise.

169
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,500
The anti-immortal army

170
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,670
has passed the Lost Sea.

171
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,710
They're about to arrive in the Immortal Realm soon.

172
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,070
Looks like Grand Elder

173
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,300
has the situation well in hand

174
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,210
and is very confident.

175
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,110
I've ordered

176
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,750
the Sage Hall's three Great Sages

177
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,680
and generals to take precautions.

178
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,750
Once the anti-immortal alliance breaks in,

179
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,270
they will surround and kill them immediately

180
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,110
at the Ruins on the Sea.

181
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,480
By that time,

182
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,430
the Great Sages will bring back

183
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,470
the Crystal Glory to you.

184
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,230
You spied on me?

185
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,780
The Oracle Hall's incompetence

186
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,710
has made Immortal King dissatisfied.

187
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,550
So

188
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,470
he asked me to pay more attention.

189
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,370
The Oracle Hall is incompetent?

190
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,830
Isn't it

191
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,230
because of you?

192
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,470
The human race started a rebellion.

193
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,000
Shi Xing turned against us.

194
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,740
The three realms secretly formed an alliance.

195
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,630
I'm sure

196
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,170
you know everything.

197
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,990
In my opinion,

198
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,470
the reason why you didn't ask the Great Sages

199
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,150
to stop them on the Lost Sea

200
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,750
is that you want the anti-immortal army

201
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,470
to arrive in the Immortal Realm

202
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,800
without any obstacles.

203
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,150
Shen Yan,

204
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,800
you're up to no good.

205
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,690
You want to endanger Immortal King's throne.

206
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,480
It's typical of you

207
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,910
to eliminate dissidents

208
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,830
with groundless accusations.

209
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,890
Over the past years,

210
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,960
many clansmen

211
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,890
have been called rebels

212
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,830
and locked in the World's End by you,

213
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,470
including

214
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,380
your father, Fu Xi.

215
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,270
But

216
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,390
I'm not someone

217
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,270
you can afford to mess with.

218
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,120
You'd better think carefully

219
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,490
before slandering me.

220
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,840
I will report everything you did

221
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,850
to Immortal King.

222
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,800
Immortal King

223
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,190
will see your true colors.

224
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,230
Do you think Immortal King

225
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,750
will punish me

226
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,190
because of your words?

227
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,830
You're too naive.

228
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,550
In front of Immortal King,

229
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,470
I'd like to see

230
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,710
whether he'll believe you or me.

231
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,960
High Priest,

232
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,630
how could you

233
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,530
be disrespectful to Grand Elder?

234
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,870
Why are you here?

235
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,470
Us?

236
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,300
Grand Elder ordered us

237
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,070
to guard the Immortal Realm here.

238
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,900
How dare you betray me!

239
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,240
Good.

240
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,830
Very good.

241
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,540
I'd like to see

242
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,700
how the Sage Hall is going to clear up the mess.

243
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,910
Tai Ji, Liu Yue.

244
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,790
Yes.

245
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,830
Keep an eye on her.

246
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,230
Don't let her cause any more trouble.

247
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,110
Yes.

248
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,290
How could this happen?

249
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,980
Looks like they can't be hurt.

250
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,210
It seems they're being protected

251
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,810
by some kind of divine power.

252
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,750
Zhen Chan Great Sage.

253
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,390
It's

254
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,500
his divine power of the Immortality Realm

255
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,290
that makes them invincible.

256
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,330
The crystal armor.

257
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,010
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

258
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,390
Kong Que.

259
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,460
Take a rest.

260
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,550
I'm going to treat the soldiers.

261
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,850
Your Highness.

262
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,030
No matter how hard we try,

263
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,270
we can't hurt them.

264
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,670
If this continues,

265
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,270
we'll be worn out sooner or later.

266
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,110
That's right.

267
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,270
With the help

268
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,990
of Zhen Chan Great Sage's divine power,

269
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,540
they've turned the situation around.

270
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,140
We're at a disadvantage now.

271
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,550
We need to find Zhen Chan Great Sage first

272
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,510
and remove

273
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,300
the Immortal Clan's protection

274
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,290
to solve the problem.

275
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,100
Geng,

276
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,970
let's split up.

277
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,300
You go save your grandpa.

278
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,620
Leave Zhen Chan Great Sage to me.

279
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,980
Leave this to me.

280
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,350
You fight your way out first.

281
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,030
We'll meet at the bottom of the Crystal Mountain.

282
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,180
Don't worry, Wu Geng.

283
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,170
Leave this to us.

284
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,150
Okay.

285
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,510
If we can't discontinue

286
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,670
Zhen Chan Great Sage's divine power very quickly,

287
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,870
Clan Leader Kong Que,

288
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,870
I hope you can

289
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,070
take the injured soldiers

290
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,600
back to Shenyin Village first

291
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,150
to preserve our strength.

292
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,690
Your Highness,

293
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,590
we're going to open a way for you.

294
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,510
Soldiers,

295
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,890
change the tactics and make refined qi into a lock.

296
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,820
Trap them!

297
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,510
Protect Great Swordsman and His Highness.

298
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,810
Break into the Immortal Realm first

299
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,630
to cut off the Immortal Clan's help.

300
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,270
Yes.

301
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,100
Go!

302
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:09,870
Go!

303
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,230
Let me help you.

304
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,590
Let's go.

305
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,610
Lock!

306
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,390
We can't let them pass.

307
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,330
Yes.

308
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,570
De!

309
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,200
De!

310
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,820
Liang!

311
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,390
You want to pass?

312
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,470
Impossible.

313
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,630
No matter how rugged the road is,

314
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,730
no matter how strong the enemy is,

315
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,850
we must fight for victory.

316
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,500
Even if we'll die,

317
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,790
our belief of resistance

318
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,790
will be passed down.

319
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,650
Your Highness,

320
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,070
I can't see you

321
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,040
defeat the Immortal Clan with my own eyes.

322
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,070
I have completed

323
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,270
my mission.

324
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,080
I believe

325
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,360
you can do it!

326
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,730
You dodged my attack.

327
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,570
Not bad.

328
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,230
But

329
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,910
your expedition ends here.

330
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,590
I was thinking

331
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,560
who would be so despicable in the Immortal Realm

332
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,310
to launch a sneak attack.

333
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,350
It's really you.

334
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,500
Brat,

335
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,310
aren't you guys afraid of death?

336
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,590
Since we have the guts to come,

337
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,650
we don't care if we can survive or not.

338
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,350
If our death

339
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,150
can save more people,

340
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,830
it'll be worth it.

341
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,400
Then die!

342
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,990
Are you still struggling?

343
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,790
I'll make you

344
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,910
become the nourishment of the Blood Lotus

345
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,550
and die in wailing.

346
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,100
Gou.

347
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,110
Are you okay, Bai Cai?

348
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,190
I think Gou is in danger.

349
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,470
Then go find him.

350
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,210
Don't worry. Leave this to us.

351
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,200
But if I leave,

352
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm afraid everyone...

353
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,070
Don't worry.

354
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,950
We won't die

355
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,830
before we arrive in the Immortal Realm.

356
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,710
I will do my best

357
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,910
to save more people

358
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,200
of both the Shenyin Clan and the Demon Clan.

359
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,270
Okay, be careful.

360
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,680
Rot completely.

361
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,060
The anti-immortal army

362
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,270
includes the top masters of the three realms.

363
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,130
But I didn't expect

364
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,080
that my first opponent

365
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,170
belongs to the human race.

366
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,890
Human, tell me your name.

367
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,570
Ziyu,

368
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,790
a wanderer in the mortal realm.

369
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,830
Both you and your sword are extraordinary.

370
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,940
This sword is called "Immortal Executioner".

371
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,150
I'm Zhen Chan, the Immortal Clan's preacher.

372
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,200
I have a question.

373
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,430
I want to hear

374
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,510
your answer.

375
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,750
Go ahead.

376
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,110
There are old grudges between the Demon Clan and the Immortal Clan.

377
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,440
I understand

378
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,330
why they came to invade us.

379
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,560
But what is the human race

380
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,720
fighting for?

381
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,960
Freedom.

382
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,630
Your biggest mistake

383
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,390
is you underestimated your opponent

384
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,110
in the battle.

385
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,990
Gou.

386
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,630
Bai Cai.

387
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,230
You just used

388
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,190
a lot of divine power.

389
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,350
You haven't recovered yet.

390
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,680
What are you doing here?

391
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,350
No matter what happens,

392
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,790
I want to be with you.

393
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,550
How are you?

394
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,430
Are you hurt?

395
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,230
I'm fine.

396
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,480
White Lotus Great Sage is vicious.

397
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,800
Don't get involved.

398
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,950
Leave him to me.

399
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,590
After I kill him,

400
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,730
let's save grandpa together.

401
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,070
You poisoned the people in Bai capital.

402
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,600
Lan and Zi Dian were killed.

403
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,070
Today,

404
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,230
I'm going

405
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,070
to make you

406
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,270
pay the price!

407
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,160
Ignorant humans.

408
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,070
Since

409
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,870
you entered the Immortal Realm,

410
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,270
you've been destined to die.

411
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,470
You're wrong.

412
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,120
Destiny is nothing to be afraid of.

413
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,350
My fate

414
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,710
can only be decided by myself.

415
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,830
Zhazha?

416
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,990
Master! Master!

417
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,560
Save me, Master!

418
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,590
Things are going more smoothly

419
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,300
than I expected.

420
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,910
What is freedom?

421
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,750
Looking back,

422
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,040
humans were not very intelligent.

423
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,310
They lived in caves

424
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,470
and feared darkness, hunger,

425
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,790
and beasts.

426
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,910
It's the Immortal Clan

427
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,590
that gave you wisdom

428
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,590
and taught you fire making, ploughing,

429
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,960
and medical skills.

430
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,670
Why

431
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,390
are you still not satisfied?

432
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,590
The Immortal Clan did give the human race

433
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,670
a lot of things.

434
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,550
But

435
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,760
you didn't give us dignity.

436
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,590
What is

437
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,940
your so-called dignity?

438
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,810
To the Immortal Clan,

439
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,990
humans are just

440
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,790
your slaves.

441
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,630
In your eyes,

442
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,390
people's lives

443
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,600
are less important than a bloodstone.

444
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,230
Have you forgotten?

445
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,870
Humans and immortals are the same.

446
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,310
We are all flesh-and-blood living beings

447
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,950
with emotions.

448
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,590
However,

449
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,550
you've been oppressing the human race.

450
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,870
You even want the human race

451
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,710
to be grateful to you.

452
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,890
Do you think the human race can be free

453
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,390
and no longer be slaves

454
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,910
after defeating the Immortal Clan?

455
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,950
You're too naive.

456
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,350
The human race in my eyes

457
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,990
is full of greed,

458
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,430
plunder, and wars.

459
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,590
The oppression

460
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,470
and killing among humans

461
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,150
will only get worse.

462
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,310
Men are born evil.

463
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,390
The human race must be restricted.

464
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,290
Men are born evil?

465
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,110
Isn't it because

466
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,110
you consider yourselves the standard of kindness?

467
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,170
You judge human nature arbitrarily.

468
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,710
Who has ever said

469
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,110
immortals are born kind?

470
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,270
Human,

471
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,420
your heart has been corrupted by the evil.

472
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,910
Reasoning with you is useless.

473
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,310
If you live,

474
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,750
you will be a disaster.

475
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,710
You think you've grasped the truth.

476
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,400
This

477
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,220
is to destroy

478
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,390
your proud dream.

479
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,750
Zhazha, why are you there?

480
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,940
Where's Chen Jing?

481
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,890
White Lotus Great Sage

482
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,570
caught me.

483
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:49,000
He threatened my father to kill you.

484
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,750
If you are capable,

485
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,080
let's have a fair fight.

486
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,830
You took a kid as a hostage.

487
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,030
Aren't you ashamed?

488
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,630
Wu Geng,

489
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,969
don't be rude.

490
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,429
Father.

491
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,230
Zhazha.

492
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,550
Zha... Zhazha, don't be afraid.

493
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,350
I'm here.

494
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,790
Save me!

495
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,429
Zhazha.

496
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,440
White Lotus Great Sage,

497
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,310
I promised you

498
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,670
I'll help you capture Wu Geng.

499
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,350
Why did you arrest Zhazha?

500
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,310
You are just a mortal.

501
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,020
How dare you judge the Immortal Clan?

502
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,710
You...

503
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,110
Fine.

504
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,750
As long as you let Zhazha go,

505
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:52,310
I'll do whatever you say.

506
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,909
Chen Jing, I order you

507
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,550
to kill him.

508
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,950
Chen Jing.

509
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,870
Wu Geng.

510
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,670
The Immortal Clan is the ruler of the world.

511
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,070
We are civilians.

512
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,910
We should be obedient and respectful.

513
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,710
But you

514
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,390
are arrogant.

515
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,590
It will harm you

516
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,020
and everyone else.

517
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,540
Let's be honest.

518
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,030
You'll harm the people around you like this.

519
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,700
Die!

520
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,790
Master.

521
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,070
Father.

522
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,750
Stop fighting.

523
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,530
I die. Zhazha lives.

524
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,790
Leave.

525
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,950
Master.

526
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,640
Father.

527
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,390
Stop fighting!

528
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,950
Chen Jing,

529
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,770
how dare you betray the Immortal Clan!

530
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,590
Save Zhazha.

531
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,470
I want

532
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,230
to see you discomfited.

533
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,870
I'll make you know

534
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,950
immortals are immortals.

535
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,630
You slaves

536
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,360
can't afford to provoke us.

537
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,800
White Lotus Great Sage, stop talking.

538
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,270
Among the three Great Sages,

539
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,030
your divine power

540
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,790
is the weakest, right?

541
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,290
How arrogant!

542
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,870
I'm going to kill you now!

543
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,430
The Dead Spiritual Energy Sword

544
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,700
pierces your heart like thousands of blades.

545
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,410
Father!

546
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,230
Father!

547
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,090
Father.

548
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,510
Zhazha.

549
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,560
Father.

550
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,370
Zhazha.

551
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,070
Father.

552
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,500
Get up, Father.

553
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,750
Father.

554
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,030
Zhazha,

555
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,930
don't... don't be afraid.

556
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,030
Listen to me.

557
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,850
I'm useless.

558
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,840
I... I can't protect you anymore.

559
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,200
But remember,

560
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,770
you must become

561
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,450
a decent and righteous person.

562
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,470
You should...

563
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,980
You should fight bravely

564
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:59,600
like Wu Geng.

565
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,250
Mr. Chen Jing.

566
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,180
Don't worry.

567
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,740
I will take good care of him.

568
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,780
Father.

569
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,050
Stand up, Father!

570
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,030
Father.

571
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,350
Zhazha, don't cry.

572
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,030
I...

573
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,430
have lived for so many years.

574
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,270
I shouldn't have helped the Immortal Clan.

575
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,550
I

576
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,120
deserve this.

577
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,020
Wu Geng,

578
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,620
the great cause of defeating the Immortal Clan

579
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,080
relies... relies on you guys.

580
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,330
Zhazha.

581
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,750
Father.

582
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,680
I don't... don't want to leave you.

583
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,770
Father!

584
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:22,170
Father! Father!

585
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,540
You can't die, Father!

586
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,150
Father!

587
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,390
This is the consequence

588
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,750
of fighting against the Immortal Clan.

589
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,410
Bai Cai,

590
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,680
get Zhazha and Chen Jing

591
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,240
out of here first.

592
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,550
Okay.
